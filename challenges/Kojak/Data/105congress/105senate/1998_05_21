Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to S. 1415, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1415) to reform and restructure the processes by \n     which tobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and \n     distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco products by \n     minors, to redress the adverse health effects of tobacco use, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Gregg/Leahy amendment No. 2433 (to amendment No. 2420), to \n     modify the provisions relating to civil liability for tobacco \n     manufacturers.\n       Gregg/Leahy amendment No. 2434 (to amendment No. 2420), in \n     the nature of a substitute.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from \nMassachusetts who wishes to speak. I will yield the floor in just a \nminute, because I don't want to have him delayed, because I know he has \na schedule. Of course, I note the presence on the floor of the sponsor \nof the pending amendment, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire.\n  Mr. President, I thought yesterday we made good progress. We have \naddressed the issue of attorneys' fees, although I don't believe that \nwill be the final consideration of that issue since there are some very \nstrongly held views on it. But we did have good and vigorous debate on \nthat issue.\n  Yesterday, also, I think the parameters of this legislation were \ndetermined to a significant degree when the Ashcroft amendment was \ntabled. Then the majority of the Senate decided that we would not \nremove these fees that will be imposed on the tobacco industry as part \nof this legislation and settlement.\n  On the other side, when the Kennedy amendment was rejected, also the \nmajority of the Senate declared its position at $1.10, which was \napproximately where the price of a pack of cigarettes would be.\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\n  Today, we will address the Gregg amendment, which will have to do \nwith another important part of the bill. And that is the cap on the \namount of payments that the tobacco companies would make on an annual \nbasis, which I intend to discuss at more length, because I am not sure \nthat this Senate understands, one, the exact meaning of that and the \nimplications of removing it, because, very frankly, the implications of \nremoving it will mean much higher costs to the taxpayers and to the \nconsumers at the end of the day.\n  Finally, after that issue is resolved, we intend to take up one of \nthe other major portions of this proposed legislation. And that is the \nagriculture portions of the bill, and, of course, there are extremely \nstrongly held views on that particular issue.\n  Mr. President, I believe at the end of today we would have \naddressed--the Senate--admittedly from time to time in somewhat \nprolonged fashion, the major issues pertaining to this legislation.\n  I am pleased with the progress we have made so far. Apparently, we \nmay not be able to complete action on this legislation before going \ninto recess. But hopefully the realization will set in that we have \naddressed by the end of the day the major portions of this bill. And we \ncould then conclude consideration of this legislation upon return.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, did my friend and colleague want to make \na statement? I know the floor manager is on his feet.\n  Mr. KERRY. No. I thank our colleague. I will reserve my comments.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2433\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Gregg-Leahy amendment raises very \nfundamental questions:\n  Why would we consider giving a group of the worst corporate villains \nin America special protection?\n  Why would we want to make it more difficult for those who have been \ninjured by the tobacco industry's wrongdoing to collect damages?\n  Why should Congress impose a liability cap which will have the effect \nof redirecting dollars away from smoking victims and into industry \ncoffers?\n  I have heard no convincing answers to these questions from the bill's \nproponents.\n  More than one year ago, when news of the settlement negotiations \nbetween the state attorneys general and the tobacco industry first \nbecame public, I expressed my opposition to restricting the liability \nof tobacco companies. On April 25, 1997, I came to this floor and spoke \nout against giving the tobacco industry any special protection:\n\n       It would be unconscionable to deny people poisoned by \n     tobacco their day in court. Each year, millions of Americans \n     learn that they have a disease caused by smoking. In too many \n     cases, it is beyond our power to restore their health. We \n     must never permit the tobacco industry to extinguish their \n     right to justice as well.\n\n  We have come a long way in the last year. The deal with the industry \nthat was announced on June 20th would have given tobacco companies de \nfacto immunity from suit. In fact, its provisions were designed by the \nindustry to erect enormous barriers in the path of smoking victims \nseeking compensation. It would have banned all class action suits, \nwhich are often the only effective way individuals can litigate against \ncorporate giants. In fact, it prohibited any aggregation of claims. It \nwould have also banned all punitive damages. If ever we have seen an \nindustry against which punitive damages are warranted, it is the \ntobacco industry. It would have prohibited all litigation by health \ninsurers, such as Blue Cross and Employee Health and Welfare Funds, \nwhich incur enormous costs treating tobacco induced illnesses. It would \nhave prevented the introduction of crucial evidence by tobacco victims \nsuing the industry. It would have given absolute immunity to the parent \ncompanies of cigarette manufacturers even though those companies are \nwhere most of the profits go and the real decisions are made. It would \nhave extinguished all future governmental suits against the industry. \nAnd, it would have imposed an annual ceiling on the liability of the \ntobacco industry. It was truly a draconian litany.\n  Fortunately, these liability restrictions were so extreme that they \nproduced a great public outcry. Public health experts and victims' \nrights advocates expressed their outrage at this enormous injustice.\n  During the past year, there has truly been a national awakening on \nthis issue. The American people focused on what the tobacco industry \nhas done as never before. The dramatic revelations of corporate \nmisconduct which have emerged from the industry's own files have truly \nshocked the national conscience. The harshest indictments of the \ntobacco companies are written in their won words, long kept secret, but \nnow revealed for all to hear. From a 1981 Phillip Morris strategic \nplanning document:\n\n       Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, \n     and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke \n     while still in their teens . . . Because of our high share of \n     the market among the youngest smokers, Phillip Morris will \n     suffer more than the other companies from the decline in the \n     number of teenage smokers\n\n  From an R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company document entitled ``Planning \nAssumptions for the Period 1978 to 1987''.\n\n       Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14 to 18 \n     year old group is an increasing segment of the smoking \n     population. RJR-T must soon establish a successful new brand \n     in this market if our position in the industry is to be \n     maintained over the long term.\n\n  Company records also detail elaborate efforts to chemically treat the \nnicotine in cigarettes to make it even more addictive than it naturally \nwould be. All the while, these same companies were telling the American \npeople that smoking is just a matter of free choice.\n  All of the special industry protections contained in the settlement \nwere included in the Commerce Committee bill when it was first \nintroduced. To the Committee's credit, in the final days before the \nmarkup, the prohibitions on class actions and punitive damages were \nremoved. In the negotiations which produced the Manager's Amendment, \nthe provisions granting immunity to corporate parents and affiliates \nwas finally deleted and many of the evidentiary restrictions were \nremoved. It is now time for the Senate to strip this legislation of the \nremaining vestiges of these special protections for Big Tobacco. While \nthe remaining special protections may be less extreme, the principle is \nthe same. This industry should not in any way be shielded from the long \noverdue rendezvous with accountability which awaits it in courthouses \nacross America.\n  Title XIV of the Manager's Amendment provides the industry with an $8 \nbillion per year liability cap limiting the companies financial \nexposure for both past and future misconduct. I object to any special \nprotection for the industry. I believe the tobacco industry is not \nentitled to any liability cap. But, I especially object to this \nparticular cap which applies to liability for future as well as past \nwrongdoing. One of the most important purposes of the civil law is to \ndeter misconduct.\n  Capping liability for future wrongdoing reduces that deterrent and \nencourages tobacco companies to continue their misconduct. This \nindustry of all industries, based upon its unparalleled record of \ncorporate irresponsibility, should be subject to tougher standards, \ncertainly not more lenient standards, than other companies. Yet, a more \nlenient standard is exactly what Title XIV will provide for the tobacco \nindustry.\n  Consider the significance of the protection which a liability cap \nwill give the tobacco companies. It provides them with an absolute \nceiling on the amount of money they will have to spend each year to \ncompensate their victims. This industry which conspired for decades to \nconceal the enormous health damages inherent in smoking. This industry \nwhich manipulated the nicotine in its products to make them even more \naddictive. This industry which targeted generations of our children for \na lifetime of addiction and early death. There can be no justification \nfor sheltering this industry from the legitimate claims of those who \nhave been injured by its deadly product.\n  To the extent that the proposed liability ceiling is ever reached, it \nwill have the effect of transferring dollars which rightfully belong to \nvictims into the industry's corporate coffers. We are giving preference \nto CEOs and shareholders above the victims of tobacco\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\ninduced illness. That cannot be justified. It is ironic to hear some \nproponents argue that the ceiling is so high it will never be reached. \nIf that is true, it is unnecessary. If it is reached, it will inflict a \nsecond injury on those already injured by this industry's gross \nmisconduct.\n  There is another serious problem created by the current Title XIV. \nThe language it uses to settle the state cases is far too broad. It \ndoes for more than resolve current claims arising from state \nexpenditures for the treatment of citizens suffering from tobacco \ninduced illness. As written, it could prohibit state and local \ngovernment from bringing future actions to enforce public health \nstandards and consumer protection laws. It could prevent state and \nlocal government from effectively policing future tobacco industry \nconduct. If this provision is not revised, it will tie the hands of \nstate and local government, and allow the tobacco industry to escape \neffective regulation.\n  The Gregg-Leahy amendment will remove all of these special limits on \nindustry liability from pending legislation. Congress does not need the \nconsent of the tobacco industry to legislate meaningful protection for \nAmerica's children. Our sole concern must be what the public health \nrequires, not what the industry desires. The deal with the industry \nwhich Title XIV contemplates would set an appalling precedent. It will \nundermine the moral authority of the federal government as protector of \nthe public health. Today the Senate should declare that it will not \nallow the tobacco industry to escape its long overdue rendezvous with \naccountability.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak at greater length at a later \ntime, but let me just say with respect to two of the concerns that were \nexpressed by my colleague from Massachusetts, the Senator expressed the \nnotion that the managers' amendment has left an ambiguity with respect \nto preserving addiction claims and also preserving the ability of \nStates to bring future enforcement actions against the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  I would assure the Senator that it is neither the intention of the \nSenator from Arizona nor myself that that be the case. It is our \nunderstanding that the language in the managers' amendment is clear \nwith respect to the fact that we do preserve addiction claims, and we \nalso preserve the right of the States to bring future enforcement \nactions. If there is any ambiguity about that, I know the Senator from \nArizona and I would be only too happy to accept an amendment of \nclarification to make it clear that neither of those are in fact the \nintent. So I think that that is an issue that can be dealt with \nexceedingly easily. The larger issue, sort of the question of whether \nthere is a shield or not, is something that I will address a little bit \nlater.\n  At this moment I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say, for the benefit of colleagues \nwho were anxious to speak on this issue, that this is a good time. \nThere is nobody here at this time seeking recognition, so we invite \nSenators who were particularly anxious to try to address this question \nto come to the floor and do so.\n  I want to try to clarify, if I can, what this amendment does and what \nit doesn't do, because I think there is a misunderstanding here. I \nthink it is absolutely vital that when the Senate votes on this, we \nvote with clarity as to what the impact will be.\n  Some people have come to the floor suggesting that this is a shield \nfor tobacco companies and that it is an unwarranted shield for tobacco \ncompanies. I think the Senator from Arizona and I would stress, as \nstrongly as either of us knows how, that there is no shield here for \ntobacco companies. Tobacco companies will be liable. They will be \nliable under any circumstances under this bill. There is only one \ncircumstance in this bill by which they might be limited in the amount \nof a 1-year payment. That is not a limit on liability. That is a limit \non how much of their liability they would pay in any 1 year. But if the \nliability were more than that payment for 1 year, the payment carries \nover into the next year. So, in effect, there is no limit on liability. \nThere is simply a rollover process by which a fixed amount, on an \nannual basis, is arrived at.\n  Why does that component of the bill exist?\n  Let me emphasize, there are two parts of this bill. If the opponents \nof the so-called cap, of an annual cap, if they were to prevail here \ntoday, what they would succeed in doing is stripping this bill of the \none invitation that it offers to tobacco companies to come into the \ntent, if you will, and be part of the solution of how we are going to \nreduce smoking among teenagers. If you strip out that cap, what will \nhappen is we will return to the status quo. We stay in the position \nwhere tobacco companies are merely being sued. We get no cooperation \nwith respect to any of the advertising restrictions, any of the \ndocument depository, any of the health programs that will help our kids \nreduce smoking. We get none of that cooperation, and we guarantee that \nthere will be a challenge on the look-back provisions. We guarantee it.\n  If people think stripping that out creates a stronger bill, to leave \nus in a situation that we have been in for all the last years--which is \nsimply endless lawsuits that produce no cooperative effort and \nultimately result, at least to this date, in no winnings in court--I \nwould have a hard time understanding how that is a better situation. \nThe fact is that all of the concerns that people expressed about \nimmunity have been addressed between the time of the tobacco company \nsettlements and the time the Commerce Committee brought a bill out of \ncommittee.\n  Let me clear up that understanding as strongly as I can. When the \nsettlement was agreed to, back in June of 1997, it contained sweeping \nimmunities for the tobacco companies. Those are gone. There is no \nlonger any elimination of class actions. Tobacco companies will \ncontinue to be subject to class actions. There is no longer an \nelimination of punitive damages. Tobacco companies will be subject to \npunitive damages. There are no longer any restrictions on the \naggregation of claims, which means different individuals could come \ntogether, one lawyer representing them--you can aggregate the claims \nand come in with a larger claim. That is now permitted. And there are \nno restrictions on third party claims. They are now permitted.\n\n  So, as reported by the Commerce Committee, the bill contained certain \nother immunities. Those are gone, too. Parent companies and affiliates \nare no longer shielded from liability. Advertisers, attorneys, and PR \nfirms are no longer shielded from liability. Addiction and dependency \nclaims against the tobacco industry are preserved, including claims \nwhere addiction is the only injury alleged and claims where addiction \nis the basis of a broader claim relating to the manifestation of a \ntobacco-related disease.\n  There are no longer any restrictions on the type of evidence that is \ndiscoverable or admissible, and all limits on the industry's \nobligations to produce documents have been removed. The ability of \nplaintiffs to maintain actions in State courts and grounded in State \nlaw is preserved. And, finally, there is no longer any exemption for \ntobacco companies from the Nation's antitrust laws.\n  All of that is gone, Mr. President--gone. They have been totally \nexposed. And that is one of the reasons, I might add--you know, when \nyou look at the price of $1.10, and you look at the settlement in \nMinnesota, if you extrapolate the settlement in Minnesota and the \nsettlement in Mississippi, if you add up the potential of all the \nsettlements in the country, you come out with an amount of money that \nis exactly or almost exactly where we are with respect to the $1.10. \nThe fact is the tobacco companies are settling cases now at a rate that \nbasically accepts the $1.10. They are not fighting about price because \nthey know ultimately that is a price they can bear. What they are \nfighting about is the liability. That is the reason these millions of \ndollars are really being spent.\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\n That is the real bone of contention here.\n  The fact is, they are offered two choices in this bill. They don't \nhave to participate, in which case the situation the Senator from New \nHampshire wants is exactly what will exist. They will be subject to \nsuits, endless suits. That can happen. But, if they choose to try to \ncome into the tent, as we have said --and we have no way to force them \ninto the tent. There is no way we can do that. So my fellow Senators \nhave a choice. You can either leave them out there subject to lawsuits, \nsubject to all of this litigation without any cooperation. Or you can \ndecide maybe there is something sufficiently good that we, the \nGovernment, can get in exchange for their participation, for which we \nare willing to tell them only one thing: You are not going to pay more \nthan $8 billion in any 1 year. It doesn't let them off the hook. It \ndoesn't say they don't have to pay. It doesn't say they are not liable. \nIt doesn't give them immunity. It simply restricts the amount of money \nin any 1 year.\n  What is it worth getting for that restriction for not having any more \nmoney in 1 year? We settle the State actions and we give them that $8 \nbillion cap. That cap is importantly indexed to inflation, so there is \nnot some sort of reduction in the purchasing power or in the value of \nthat. It will rise with inflation and it will increase according to--at \nleast 3 percent we have had each year and perhaps more, if the CPI is \nhigher than 3 percent.\n  I think it is important to make it clear--there is no concession in \nthis bill unless the tobacco companies decide to be involved. And that \nis a critical component. The tobacco companies would have to come in \nand sign a protocol, sign a consent decree, and they would agree to \nabide by the provision of the payments. Most important, they would \nagree to abide by the look-back assessments.\n  I would like to just run through the look-back assessments, because I \nheard the Senator from Utah yesterday on the floor--the Senator from \nUtah was pointing out to everybody how unconstitutional are the look-\nback assessments. The look-back assessments are a dramatic way of \nengaging the tobacco industry into compliance with the things we want \nthem to do.\n  The tobacco industry accepted, they are the ones who helped come up \nwith the look-back agreement. The look-back agreement was in the \noriginal settlement with the attorneys general. So they have accepted \nit once already. They have shown their willingness to come in and live \nby the standard of the look-back agreement.\n  What the look-back agreement says is that they must meet a target for \nthe reduction of underage tobacco use. These targets are the same as \nthose they agreed to in the June 20 agreement.\n  The targets are as follows: In 3 years, there must be a 15-percent \nreduction. In 5 years, there must be a 30-percent reduction. That is \nfor cigarettes. For smokeless tobacco, it is 25 percent. There is a 50 \npercent reduction over 7 years and 35 percent for smokeless.\n  Over 10 years, the tobacco companies are agreeing that they must \nreduce teenage smoking by 60 percent. That is what this bill is about. \nThis bill is an effort to reduce teenage smoking, and here we are \ntrying to get the tobacco industry to specifically accept \nresponsibility to be part of the process of doing that. You can't order \nthem to do it. They are certainly not going to do it if all we do is \nleave them out there subject to endless lawsuits.\n  There ought to be some incentive that says to those companies, ``Come \non in and be part of the solution,'' and the look-back provisions are \nthat. But the look-back provisions also say that if the industry \ndoesn't meet the target, they will pay $80 million for each percentage \npoint missed between 1 and 5. They will pay $160 million for each \npercentage point missed between 6 and 10 percent, and $240 million for \neach percentage point missed above 10 percent. That is not a bad \npenalty. That is not a bad assessment. That is an assessment based on a \ntarget that they agree to meet, and if they don't meet the target, they \npay a regulatory fee accordingly.\n  Mr. President, you can't get them to do that unless they agree. If \nyou don't want them to challenge it and to tie us up for years in a \ncourt challenge that would not do what we want to do to reduce smoking, \nthen, Mr. President, you have to find some way to bring them in.\n  I say to all of my colleagues, yesterday on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, there was a lot of hue and cry about how kids are going to lose \nout per 10 cents that we didn't raise the price, and if we had raised \nthe price by 40 cents, we were going to save another 240,000 lives and \npeople were deeply concerned about that and are deeply concerned about \nthat.\n  Those people who were concerned about that should not come in and \nvote to leave the tobacco companies in a position where all they are \ngoing to do is litigate lawsuits over the next 10 or 15 years, because \nduring those intervening years, those numbers of kids are the kids who \nare going to be the victims. It is much more intelligent, it seems to \nme, to get the tobacco companies to be part of the solution in a way \nthat reduces the level of smoking so those kids are, in fact, saved. I \nthink that is a critical choice here.\n  What we do in this bill is ask the tobacco companies to come in and \ndo things that we have absolutely no right to get them to do without \ntheir cooperation. Let me be specific.\n  A participating company, if they consented, would come in and make a \nsignificant up-front payment. They would abide by far broader \nadvertising restrictions than those that were contained in the 1997 \nsettlement. They would be required to create a document depository, \nwhere all those people who are going to sue in the future would have \naccess to the documents that have come out of all of the tobacco \nlitigation or out of their existing files. And they would agree--and \nthis is the most important thing, Mr. President--they would agree not \nto challenge the provisions in the bill. They would agree to abide by \nthese provisions, notwithstanding any future court decision on their \nconstitutionality.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to, again, measure that. If the tobacco companies \nsign an agreement not to sue in the future, not to challenge any of the \nadvertising restrictions that we can't achieve unless they agree, that \nis an enormous step forward.\n  Those advertising restrictions are as follows: There would be a \ncomplete ban on human images, on animal images and cartoon characters. \nThere would be a ban on outdoor advertising, including stadia and mass \ntransit. There would be a ban on advertising over the Internet. And \nthere would be a ban on payments to glamorize tobacco use in media when \nsuch use would be appealing to minors.\n  There would be a ban on payments for tobacco products placement in \nmovies, TV programs and video games, and there would be severe \nrestrictions on point of sale advertising of tobacco products.\n  All of those things--all of those things--none of which could be \nachieved without the consent of the tobacco companies, we would gain as \na result of just one thing: allowing them to know the level of their \nexposure and liability on an annual basis. It seems to me that is an \nenormous gain for the children, it is a gain for us putting together a \nresponsible approach to reduction of smoking, and it is certainly a \ngain for the Congress, which would then have constructed a piece of \nlegislation that had a chance of passing.\n  It seems to me what we have here is a fundamental choice: If we want \nto put together a piece of legislation that can pass or whether we are \ngoing to come out here and put ourselves in the position of simply \nbashing tobacco because that is the feel-good position.\n  I might add that in addition to the advertising restrictions, they \nwould also abide by the look-back provisions. The look-back provisions \nwill almost certainly be challenged. They won't be challenged, and even \nif they were challenged by someone else yet found unconstitutional, if \nthe tobacco companies come in and sign a consent decree and a protocol, \nthey must abide by that. If the tobacco companies at any time in the \nfuture were to violate that protocol, violate any component of this \nact, they would lose the cap on the annual liability payment. They \nwould suffer the full exposure, just as they would if they don't \nparticipate.\n  The final comment I make to my colleagues is very simple. This is a \nclear, clear choice. Under the managers'\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\namendment, no tobacco company gets any liability restriction, any cap, \nany restraint whatsoever unless they decide to give up their rights on \nthe first amendment, unless they give up their rights to challenge, \nunless they agree to abide by every component of the act.\n  We have a fundamental choice here, whether we are going to be \nreasonable in the approach to try to bring them into the tent, or \nwhether we are going to try to abide by something I think most people \nwould feel would be destructive to this legislation as a whole.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I know others want to speak at \nthis time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from \nWashington, as well as the Senator from Oklahoma, who have very strong \nand important views--especially the Senator from Oklahoma has very \nstrong views on this issue. I will not, then, make my remarks in order \nthat they may be heard. I, again, encourage other Senators who would \nlike to speak on this amendment and the bill to come over. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, perhaps a brief review of history as to \nhow and why we find ourselves in the position we are in in this debate \nis an appropriate point at which to begin.\n  Over the years, the Congress has delicately paced around the outer \nedges of the controversy over tobacco, encouraging certain voluntary \nlimitations on advertising, particularly by television, requiring \ncertain warnings to be included on packages of cigarettes and on \nadvertising, but never getting to the heart of the issue of the \ndesirability or the lack of a desirability of tobacco.\n  Those limitations can be looked at as either a glass partly full or \none largely empty. It is clear the major tobacco companies have \nattempted to remain profitable by creating, through advertising and \npeer pressure and in any other method that they could, a constantly \nincreasing supply of new smokers, almost all of whom have begun smoking \nwith the conscious knowledge of its adverse impact on their life \nexpectancy and on their health, although when they began young this was \nnot something that was at the forefront of the thoughts of youth.\n\n  Nevertheless, in the United States of America, over the course of the \nlast 20 or 30 years, we have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of \nmen and women who smoke. We, as Americans, probably smoke less than \nalmost any other country in the world.\n  Various individuals and groups have sued tobacco companies as a \nresult of the adverse impacts of smoking on health. Almost without \nexception, those individuals have lost those in connection with that \nlitigation.\n  All of this had us in a situation that was almost stable until a \ngroup of State attorneys general and private lawyers came along with a \nnew theory, that damage was caused not just to individual smokers but \nto the treasuries of our States and, by extension, to our own Treasury, \nthrough Medicaid primarily, through Medicare, and through the expenses \nof taking care of tobacco-related health problems, that these damages \ntotaled in the billions of dollars. And, as a consequence, most of the \nStates of the United States brought actions against tobacco companies \nto recover those losses to their States.\n  Some, as you know, Mr. President, acting independently, have already \nwon that litigation by settlement or otherwise. The bulk of them, \nalmost a year ago, reached an agreement with the tobacco companies for \nwhat is almost certainly the most massive judgment or change in \npractices that has ever taken place in this country--close to $400 \nbillion in payments, dramatic and voluntary restrictions not only on \nadvertising but on various other forms of promotion, a set of goals for \nlessened teen smoking, and a myriad of other ideas.\n  A part of that settlement is involved in the amendment before us \nright now, because that settlement purported to protect the tobacco \ncompanies against some forms of litigation, although not all forms of \nlitigation. Those protections have been abandoned or rejected by this \nbill in return for certain other, less significant limitations on the \nannual liability of tobacco companies to individual litigation.\n  But, Mr. President, the centerpiece of the agreement with the State \nattorneys general, without whose work we clearly would not be debating \nthis issue here today any more than we have for the last 10 or 20 \nyears, the centerpiece of that agreement was its voluntary nature. As \nthe eloquent Senator from Massachusetts, who is managing this bill on \nthe other side of the aisle, pointed out, advertising restrictions, \nupfront payments, document collections, and probably the look-back \nprovisions, are all provisions of that agreement that cannot \nconstitutionally be imposed on the tobacco companies by law.\n  As a consequence, we are faced with a delicious challenge. We can \nmake all the heroic antitobacco statements and speeches that we wish, \nwe can pile on to a greater extent than even the most radical bills \nthat have been introduced into this body, but we cannot force tobacco \ncompanies, as long as they are engaged in a legal business--so far, we \ndo not have a bill that would absolutely prohibit the use of tobacco--\nwe can pass whatever legislation we wish, but we cannot force them to \nabandon their first amendment rights; we cannot violate the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  So in the ultimate analysis, we are either going to pass a bill that, \nhowever reluctantly, with however much grumbling, the basic tobacco-\nproduct manufacturers will accept and follow, or we are simply going to \ncreate another bonanza for lawyers in challenging some of the basic \nprovisions of this legislation, in challenges that, by and large, are \nalmost certain to be successful. We may have voted ``antitobacco,'' but \nwe will not have succeeded in a truly antitobacco result.\n\n  At this point, the tobacco companies have rejected the acceptance of \nthe so-called McCain bill. Perhaps more narrowly, they have rejected \nthe McCain bill as it was reported from the Commerce Committee. Many of \nthe changes that have been made in the bill that is before us are \ndesigned, it might well be, as a result of gaining their acquiescence. \nThis amendment, if it is passed, will clearly and necessarily result in \ntheir rejection of the entire package.\n  Personally, Mr. President, I believe what we ought to do is in effect \nto ratify, with some toughening, the agreement that the attorneys \ngeneral of the various States made after long and careful negotiation \nand litigation. And we will have the opportunity to do that, or come as \nclose as we can to doing that, when we deal with the amendment that \nwill be proposed by my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch.\n  But this bill, the McCain bill in its present form, is, in my \nopinion, a responsible approach toward this problem. I believe that we \nmust deal with the agricultural elements of it, the payments to tobacco \nfarmers, payments that I think are infinitely too high, with the total \npreservation of the present tobacco program that is included in the \nFord provisions, but we will be dealing with that next.\n  I believe a significant portion of the money that the Federal \nTreasury is going to get from this ought to go to tax relief for the \nAmerican people rather than into other Government-run programs.\n  But these are elements of this bill that we will debate at some point \nin the future. They are not elements that will result in the rejection \nof the bill by those at whom it is aimed on the grounds of the \nConstitution. This amendment is. Personally, as I say, I would prefer \nthe provisions on litigation that are contained in the attorneys \ngeneral bill. It may be that at some point or other we will move back \nin that direction.\n  I am convinced, however, that the amendment that is before us now \nwill destroy any chance of our passing successful antitobacco \nlegislation. Legislation that balances the constitutional rights of \nthose organizations with which we disagree must significantly increase \nthe cost of a pack of cigarettes but not beyond the point where we \ncreate a huge black market of contraband cigarettes, a point that I \nbelieve would have been passed, exceeded, by the Kennedy amendment \nyesterday, and a package that can result in something ultimately \nacceptable to the\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\nAmerican people, to the courts, to those who manufacture cigarettes, \nwith the net result that we will reduce, though we will never \neliminate, cigarette smoking.\n\n  I believe that the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, who did not \nseek but was given this assignment, has carried it on in a highly \ncredible fashion with a far greater degree of success than I would have \npredicted when he started. I think he deserves the thanks, the \ngratitude of all Members of this body, and to a large extent, at least, \nour support. I am convinced that he deserves our support on this \namendment because this amendment will destroy any chance of being truly \nsuccessful in getting antitobacco legislation through the Congress, and \nthrough the President's signature, in a way that will meet the goals \nthat all of us share.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to make fairly lengthy remarks \ndealing with the contents of the bill. First, let me just state my \nrespect and admiration for Chairman McCain. He is a very good friend of \nmine in the Senate. One of the things we have a pleasure of doing in \nthe Senate--we are not a very big body--so we get a chance to know each \nother sometimes pretty well. I have had the pleasure of working and \nknowing Senator McCain since he came to the Senate. He is a very good \nfriend of mine. He will still be a good friend of mine.\n  I don't like his bill. I don't like the procedure by which the bill \nis being considered, and I was involved in the procedure. Senator Lott \nasked me to head up the task force to try to put this bill together. \nSenator McCain, and the Commerce Committee, had a lot of jurisdiction \nover the bill, probably more than any other committee. Also, he had to \ndeal with the issue of whether or not we are going to have a limitation \non liability for tobacco companies.\n  Probably the most important issue is whether the attorneys general \npackage will either pass or not pass, it is very pertinent to the \namendment that the Senator from New Hampshire has pending before the \nSenate today. Are we going to give a limitation on liability to tobacco \ncompanies? We don't do it for other companies, with very, very few \nexceptions. I think we did it for the airline industry for a small, \ntargeted area, but, by and large, we don't do this for any industry in \nAmerica. We don't do it for pharmaceuticals. We don't do it for people \nwho make heart valves, and so on. A liability limitation was in the \nattorneys general's package that they dumped on Congress, that they \nsigned off with the administration. The administration agreed with that \npackage, the so-called $368 billion 25-year package. That was handed to \nCongress and they said, ``Here, go pass it.''\n  I told some of my colleagues from the outset I don't think we will \npass legislation--nor do I think we should--that will put a total \nlimitation on class action lawsuits. If you are using in tobacco, you \ncan't have a class action lawsuit against tobacco companies? That is \nwhat the attorneys general's package was going to do. In exchange for \nthat, tobacco companies were going to pay about $15 billion a year. \nThat was the so-called deal.\n  They didn't consult very many people in Congress, and I thought at \nthe time they are going to have a hard time passing that restriction on \nliability. If they don't have that, they don't have a deal. Frankly, as \nthis process evolved and the Commerce Committee marked up the bill, \nthey struck some of the liability protections on exemption from class \naction suits, and instead came up with a cap--which is kind of a back \nend way of trying to do somewhat the same thing. The tobacco companies \nsaid, wait a minute, you have increased the price, you have increased \nthe penalties, you have increased everything, and you gave us very \nlittle legal protection--this cap. Anyway, the tobacco companies said \nthat is not good enough, there is no deal, we are not going to abide by \nit.\n  The only way this could conceivably be in the Commerce Committee \ninstead of the Finance Committee is we say there will be payments of \nfees in lieu of protection for liability. But it didn't work out that \nway. So then we had a referral to the Finance Committee. The Finance \nCommittee struck out this fee structure, which I think is a disaster. I \nsee my friend and colleague from Nebraska here is also on the Finance \nCommittee. I will go through, and it will take some time, but I will go \nthrough how the tax is computed or the fees are computed in this bill, \nand just say that it won't work very well.\n  I also want to say I concur with the objectives of trying to reduce \nteen smoking. I don't want teenagers to smoke. I have four kids. One \nout of my four smokes, and he happens to be 28 years old. He started \nwhen he was in high school. I really wish that he didn't smoke. I grew \nup in a family--both my parents and all my brothers and sisters--all of \nthem smoked. My mother has had lung cancer and emphysema, very \ncritical. She still is a survivor, but it is a very serious problem. A \ncouple of my brothers and sisters had a hard time quitting. They did \nquit. They were able to do it. One in my family didn't have that hard \nof a time of quitting. I am trying to get my son to quit and I have not \nbeen successful. I wish that he would. I really wish that he would.\n  When you look at the use of tobacco products, you can see that it is \npretty significant. This chart shows anybody who has ever used \ncigarettes in their lifetime, kind of an unusual statistic. I guess I \nwould fall into it because I know I smoked one or two cigarettes when I \nwas in junior high--probably never a full pack. But I guess, if \nsomebody said, did you ever smoke a cigarette, I would have to say, \nyes, sometime in the 8th grade. So I would be in the 70 percent \ncategory--you might notice from this chart that usage went down a \nlittle bit in the last few years. Frankly, under the Clinton \nadministration it started going up.\n  Marijuana use has also gone up--and I am more concerned about drugs \nthan I am smoking. I will make that evident in a moment. But marijuana \nuse, which was up to 60 percent and has fallen down to about 33 \npercent, fell almost every year through the 1980s until, frankly, \nPresident Clinton was elected. Then it has gone up and it has gone up \nin a skyrocketing fashion. As a matter of fact, I will insert in the \nRecord this chart. I tell my friend and colleague from Nebraska that \nmarijuana use in 1992 among 12th graders was 11.9 percent. Last year, \nit was 23.78 percent --100 percent increase of marijuana use among high \nschool seniors. That is a staggering statistic.\n  This is marijuana use by people categorized as ``frequent users'' who \nhave used it in the last 30 days. You can see on the chart that this \nhas jumped up. You also see tobacco use has gone up. Cigarette use has \ngone up. In 1992, cigarette consumption among seniors in high schools \nwas 27.8 percent. In 1997, it was 36.5 percent, an increase of about a \nthird. That is a big increase. You could go all the way back to the \n1960s as to who uses cigarettes on a frequent basis or in the last 30 \ndays, and it was very constant for decades, until frankly, the Clinton \nadministration. And during these 5 or 6 years, it has gone up a third, \nthe biggest increase that we have seen.\n  You might also note, and this is more troubling to me, that marijuana \nuse had gone down for frequent users, down to only about 11 or 12 \npercent in the early 1990s. And now it is more than double and is up to \nabout 24 percent. Now, that bothers me. And I cannot help but think a \nlot of people, when they are just going after tobacco and how terrible \nit is, are fairly silent about drug use, drug use that is habitual, \ndrug use that is illegal, drug use that is deadly, drug use that leads \nto lots of other crimes, lots of other problems.\n  Why only the attention on cigarettes? Why only the attention on \ncigarettes? We are going to have some amendments which will have \nsignificant attention on drugs. I had a town meeting during the Easter \nbreak in Oklahoma--I had several--but I had one in Shawnee, OK, a \nmiddle-class town. This town meeting happened to have a lot of high \nschool students, a lot. I told them we were debating the cigarette tax \nissue and I just asked how many smoked, and hardly any hands went up.\n  I said, ``Well, let me ask you a question. Congress is contemplating \nraising tobacco prices by $1.10, maybe $1.50. Would that make any \ndifference for those of you that raised your hands?'' The answer was, \n``No, we don't smoke that much.'' Maybe they would smoke\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\non a weekend or at a party. They said it would make no difference. That \nis an informal survey; it is not scientific. But some claim that \nscientists say if we raise this tax, we are going to reduce teen \nsmoking. I am not sure that is the case. I think when you ask the \nquestion if somebody smoked in the last 30 days, that means one \ncigarette or two cigarettes. I am not sure you are going to have an \nappreciable reduction because you raise prices a dollar. Maybe there \nwould be some. Maybe it would be a component in reducing teen smoking, \nbut some people are acting like it is the whole battle. I disagree with \nthat. I don't think it would work.\n  As a matter of fact, I am kind of amused because now we hear \neverybody say our objective is that if we raise these prices, these \ntaxes, spend all this money and run this massive campaign, we will be \nsuccessful and we can reduce teen smoking by 60 percent. If you are \nagainst this, you are for tobacco companies and you are against kids. I \nreject that outright. I don't like smoking. I don't like teen smoking, \nespecially. I don't like to see kids smoke. But that doesn't mean you \nhave to sign onto a program that spends hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  I looked at a statement of Secretary Shalala when she announced new \nFDA regulations with David Kessler in August of 1995. They came up with \na lot of new regulations. I don't agree with a lot of them. I think \nthey are overly intrusive. But whether I agree with them or not, they \nstated in those regulations they thought they could reduce children and \nadolescent smoking by 50 percent within 7 years. Wait a minute. We are \ntalking about spending hundreds of billions of dollars in addition to \nthese FDA regulations to it to 60 percent? So these massive price and \ntax increases might decrease smoking another 10 percent in addition to \nwhat they are already doing in FDA? I am not so sure.\n  That tells me that people are sometimes pretty loose with statistics. \nMaybe these surveys don't mean as much as some people think. Maybe this \nquestion of, ``Did you smoke in the last 30 days?''--maybe that is one \ncigarette. I am not sure. That is one of the questions.\n  My point is that I don't want kids to get addicted to smoking. We \nwant to do some things to discourage that. I am concerned when I see \nthat drug use has doubled; marijuana use has doubled under this \nadministration amongst high school seniors. That bothers me a whole lot \nmore than the 33 percent increase in teen consumption tobacco. I happen \nto be a parent; I have four kids. If you tell me that maybe they smoked \na cigarette once, or if they were using marijuana on a regular basis, I \nwould be a lot more concerned about the marijuana. I don't want them to \ndo either, and we should discourage both. But to have a campaign and \nhave this massive effort to attack tobacco and be silent on drugs, I \nthink, is absurd and it should not happen.\n  We should have a campaign against teen smoking, but we should not \nraid taxpayers in the process. We should not spend hundreds of billions \nof dollars. If you ask people, ``Do you want to reduce teen smoking?'' \nyou are going to get a favorable poll that says 90 percent say yes. If \nyou say, ``We are going to reduce teen smoking, and we are going to \nspend hundreds of billions of dollars and pass the largest tax increase \nin years. Do you still think we should do it?'' They are going to say, \n``What?''\n  I think there was a poll that said 70 percent of the people thought \nCongress is doing this more to spend money than to help kids. They know \nthis is more about a money grab, a big ``cookie jar,'' than about \nreducing teen smoking. Look at the costs. I happen to be kind of a \nnumbers cruncher. I am on the Budget Committee and the Finance \nCommittee and I think numbers are important.\n  I am going to talk about this bill quite a lot this morning. I looked \nthrough this bill, and in this bill there is no mention anywhere of a \n$1.10 tax increase. I am going to tell the press there is no mention of \na $1.10 per pack tax increase in this bill. They mention it in the \ncommittee report, but the committee report is not the law. So how much \ndoes this bill cost? I stated repeatedly that it costs more than a \n$1.10; and it does cost a lot more than $1.10. People will say, wait a \nminute, where did you get the figures? I got the figures from the bill, \nnot from Senators' statements or from reading The Washington Post or \nThe New York Times, where the headline was ``Senate to Stay With $1.10 \nTax Increase.'' There is not a $1.10 tax increase in this bill; there \nis a lot more. It is going to cost consumers a lot more. Is it going to \ncost tobacco companies a lot more? I don't think so.\n  As a matter of fact, I put on this chart the gross tax increase on \nconsumers in billions of nominal dollars. These new taxes cost \nconsumers, but do they cost tobacco companies? Not a dime. Let me go \nthrough a couple of the provisions, Mr. President. Before I do, I will \nsubmit the chart I have already discussed about the increase in use of \nmarijuana and also cigarettes into the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the chart printed in the Record at \nthis point, along with another chart regarding the national tobacco \nsettlement trust fund.\n  There being no objection, the charts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      12TH GRADERS USE OVER 30 DAYS                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Class of

Mr. President, I am also going to insert a table that \nshows new tax assessments and penalties that are in this bill. The \nnational tobacco settlement trust fund is what I am going to talk about \nnow. This is the trust fund, the big kahuna. There are a lot of other \ntaxes, penalties, but this is the bulk of the money. If a person was \ninterested, they could look at this provision in the bill. If you go to \npage 179, it talks about the trust fund. You can see on page 181 that \nit says tobacco companies, in the first year, pay $10 billion. Then on \npage 182, it says--in the first year, you also pay $14.4 billion. That \nis the reason why the first year payments are $24.4 billion on my \nchart. It doesn't say anything about a $1.10 tax, or any other tax. It \nsays, industry, you pay $24.4 billion. I have heard some people say, \nwell, we are going to raise the tax gradually to $1.10. It starts out \nat 65 cents. The only mention of a per pack tax is in the committee \nreport. It starts at 65 cents and ends with $1.10.\n  I am just telling you that those numbers don't add up. I have told \nthis to my colleague from North Dakota, and maybe he will believe me by \nthe time I finish this presentation. The bill\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\ndoesn't mention $1.10. We are passing a bill, not a committee report. \nWe are passing a bill. The bill says in the second year the companies \nwill pay $15.4 billion. The third year is $17.7 billion, then $21.4 \nbillion, and then $23.6 the fifth year. Thereafter, it is adjusted for \ninflation. That is where these numbers come from. These numbers are \nadjusted for inflation. At a minimum of 3 percent, regardless of \nwhether there is any inflation or CPI, whichever is greater. The bill \nsays a minimum, so I put in the 3 percent.\n  Now, some of my colleagues and the administration said this bill \nraised $516 billion. That number is in the committee report. The \ncommittee report embarrasses me. I am embarrassed by the work that the \nCommerce Committee put together, but frankly I shouldn't really blame \nthem. I want to blame the administration because, frankly, they wrote \nthe bill. It wasn't the Commerce Committee; it was the administration. \nThe administration-drafted report even has a section that says payments \nwill be no greater than $516 billion. That is hogwash. As a matter of \nfact, I have a letter from OMB that says you only compute $516 billion \nif you deflate the industry payments to constant 1999 dollars. That is \nwhere they get $516 billion. Those are constant 1999 dollars. They make \nit look a lot smaller than it is.\n  Frankly, that is not the way we do accounting in the Senate. The bill \nsays, here are the payments and they are adjusted for inflation, and, \nfrankly, these are conservative because I will tell you that sometime \nin the next 25 years, you are going to have more than a 3 percent \ninflation rate. We know that. So I am going to tell you that the $755 \nbillion in industry payments over the next 25 years is conservative. It \nis much more conservative than what will actually happen. I will also \nmention that I didn't add look-back assessments. The administration, \nwhen they said $516 billion also didn't add the look-back. Then, they \nincreased the look-back to $4.4 billion when they rewrote the bill over \nthe weekend. The administration rewrote the bill over the weekend, not \nthe Commerce Committee or the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee \nreported out a bill and some amendments and said, let's scrap this \nindustry payment nonsense and come up with a tax increase. I didn't \nsupport it--a $1.50 tax increase--but at least it was honest.\n  This bill is very misleading. These industry payments are very \ndeceiving. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves. I will talk about the \nlook-back provisions in a minute. I didn't even add the look-back, yet, \nbut if you add the look-back at another $130 billion the total tax \nincrease is $885 billion. These are just the facts. These are the facts \nthat you get if you read the bill--if you read the bill on page 182, \npage 183 and page 184.\n  Then you find out that they did a lot of other silly things in this \nbill. I guess silly things maybe to protect certain constituents or \ncertain parts of the industry. But, if you think you are passing a \n$1.10 tax on all tobacco, you will find out that they exempted some \ncompanies. They exempted some companies. I thought excise taxes were \nexcise taxes, like excise taxes on gasoline--the Federal excise tax is \non all gasoline, made in North Dakota and Oklahoma. Except perhaps for \ngasohol. I don't think we should exempt gasohol. But we do. But this \nbill exempts certain companies from the tax. If their sales are less \nthan 1 percent, they pay no tax. What does that mean? You already have \na 24-cent Federal excise tax on cigarettes. Everybody pays it. There is \nno exemption on that. Congress has already increased that in the future \nto go up to another 15 cents. That is going to be 39 cents. Everybody \npays that. But this committee said for this additional tax or fee some \ncompanies need not pay. Think about that.\n  Everybody else is going to have to pay this. Let's say the tax is \n$1.10. I think it is much more than that. But most companies will have \n$1.10 additional cost put on their products, and some companies won't. \nThat makes sense, doesn't it?\n  I also looked at the tax increases on other products. I would love to \nhave a sponsor of the bill explain to me how they did this. Take a \nproduct like snuff. I calculated the tax increase on snuff, that little \nround package, you know, you put a pinch between your check and your \ngum. The tax increase on snuff is over 3,000 percent. That is a \nsignificant tax increase. Right now it is 2.7 cents per little can, and \nit goes up to 85 cents. That is a pretty good increase. Maybe 85 cents \nis the right amount. But I will venture to say nobody in here knows \nthat. That little can costs about $3 and something. That is a pretty \ngood hit.\n  We at least ought to know what we are doing. I don't think anybody \nhere knows what they are doing.\n  Then we find in the bill that some smokeless tobacco companies, small \nmanufacturers, are getting a smaller tax increase, 60 cents. For most \nof the snuff people, the people who make these little round things, we \nare going to increase their tax by 82.5 cents. But for some people we \nare only going to increase it 60 cents, because they are small, or \nmaybe because their Senator said, ``Hey, they are not part of the \nproblem, they are not very big. They sell less than 150 million \nunits.'' I thought we were interested in children's addiction. So we \nare going to give this company a 20-some-cent advantage over other \ncompanies? That is in the bill. That is on page 185, if anybody cares \nto look at it. I wonder how many of us really looked at this bill.\n  Excise taxes, if they are going to be on snuff, should apply to \neverybody. But we didn't do that in this bill. I say ``we,'' the \nCommerce Committee. The Finance Committee did tax everyone, and in \nproportion to the tax on cigarettes. Finance said, ``Let's scrap all \nthis industry payment nonsense and have an excise tax.''\n  I am going to show you that this tax is a lot more than one dollar \nand a dime. And I don't think there is any question it is more than a \ndollar and a dime. Yet, people are still under the facade that this is \n$1.10. Why? Because OMB said it is, and Treasury said it is. I don't \nthink that is the truth. The bill says, here is the amount of the \nindustry payment, pay it. Not everybody has to pay. One company made a \ndeal, and said, ``Hey, we have already settled. So we are not part of \nthe problem. So we don't have to pay the excise tax.'' They have a much \nbetter deal. It is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We are \ngetting ready to pass it. I don't think that makes sense. I think we \nought to be ashamed of ourselves the way we are legislating.\n  There is a reason why we have committees of jurisdiction. And we \nviolated it grossly. I thought maybe we fixed it when the Finance \nCommittee took this bill. But, obviously, the Commerce Committee and \nthe administration said, ``No, we don't want to do that. We like what \nwe have.'' I will tell you why. Because they are going to get more \nmoney, in my opinion, than they would get at $1.50.\n\n  I was halfway tempted to vote for the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts amendment to raise the tax to $1.50. If you had a real \ntax at $1.50, I think it raises less money than the figures we are \ntalking about. Maybe I am wrong. The press is going to report $1.10 and \n$1.50. That is what the press reports. I think this payment scheme \nequates to more than $1.50. This chart shows $40 billion or $50 billion \nper year in the future. Guess how many packs are sold a year? About 24 \nbillion packs a year. If you have a $1 tax, assuming you had no \nreduction in consumption, you are talking about $24 billion. This bill \nis in that neighborhood already in the first year--not just the fifth \nyear. We are talking about the first year. That is going to be about a \n$1 tax paid for 1999. You have the $10 billion initial payment. That \nequates to about $1 a pack. The tax on snuff and smokeless, and so on, \ndoesn't raise a lot of money cumulatively, but it is a huge tax \nincrease.\n  On chewing tobacco, the tax goes from a very small two-and -a-quarter \ncents per 3 ounce pack of chewing tobacco to over 40 cents--almost 41 \ncents. That is a 1,711-percent increase in one fell swoop. That is a \nbig hit. I think it is a nasty habit. If you want to tax it and \neliminate it, maybe that is what some people are trying to do. But we \nat least ought to know what we are doing. I would venture to say that \nmaybe a lot of people in the Senate don't.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the look-back provisions. I think I \nheard Senator Hatch, and others, say that the look-back is \nunconstitutional. I think he is right. I will tell you, I am not a \nconstitutional scholar. I will not\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nenter that debate. I will tell you, it is unworkable. I heard somebody \nsay the industry has signed off on the look-back provisions. I have not \nbeen talking to the industry, but I am pretty sure they are planning on \ncontesting them on constitutional grounds. And they are pretty \nconfident--at least that is what my staff tells me--that they would \nwin.\n  What does the look-back do? It could raise a lot of money. And \nevidently the administration thinks this is real money and it is going \nto happen because they increased the amount to $4.4 billion over the \nweekend. The look-back grew by over 10 percent over the weekend. It is \nmuch higher now than when it passed out of the Commerce Committee.\n  That is interesting. How does it work? If a person was interested, \nthey could look on page 106 of the bill and find the look-back section. \nThis is kind of interesting. How does this work? Is this going to be a \nreal incentive for companies to curtail smoking? I found out these \nprovisions are very interesting. They start on page 103 of the bill and \ngo through to page 109. I will just talk about this for a second.\n  The look-back says the Secretary--talking about the Secretary of \nTreasury--shall conduct a survey to determine methodology and the \npercentage of all young people who use a type of tobacco product within \nthe last 30 days. It says ``a type of tobacco product within 30 days.'' \nHe is going to take a survey, a poll.\n  A lot of us are in the political business. All of us in the Senate \ntake polls. The Secretary of the Treasury is going to take a poll. Keep \nin mind that of all tobacco consumption, only 3 percent of it is done \nby teenagers. Keep in mind that it is against the law for teenagers to \nsmoke in every State. It is against the law to smoke if you are less \nthan 18 years old. He is going to take a poll and find out how many are \ntrying tobacco. These numbers are going up. Maybe they did it once, or \nmore. They are going to take a poll. The poll is going to also specify: \n``Did you use tobacco?'' and ``What brand did you use?''\n  Then there is a complicated formula. But if a tobacco company's \nnumbers don't come down, then we are going to be subject to special \nassessments.\n  I should mention more about the poll--this is interesting. Every poll \nthat I have ever seen has pluses and minuses. There is a range of plus \nor minus 4 percent. This cannot be entirely accurate, because they are \nnot going to ask every teenager age 11 through 17, ``Did you smoke?'' \nThat wouldn't be too cost effective. They might do it maybe for that \nreason.\n  On page 106, it says, the survey is deemed conclusively to be proper, \ncorrect, and accurate for purposes of this act. They deem their poll \nwhenever they happen to take it to be accurate.\n  That is interesting. I just think of the games that could be played \nwith that.\n  Let's see, if they took their poll around the Fourth of July, there \nmay be a greater instance of tobacco use on the 4th of July, or maybe \nthe Memorial Day weekend, or maybe the Labor Day weekend when people \nare going to the beach. If they want to jack the penalties up, ``Let's \ntake the poll then.''\n  I just fail to see that this is a good way to do business. If the \ncompany doesn't meet the underage tobacco use goals as outlined by this \nbill, then there would be significant penalties--very significant \npenalties, up to about $4.4 billion, and indexed for inflation. So on \nmy chart the totals increase rather significantly to $130 billion. \nThose aren't tax deductible.\n  Is that really workable?\n  Then there is another section.\n  There is an additional look-back assessment on brand-specific \nunderage tobacco problems. If you look on page 112, which talks about \nif they miss their percentage share, tobacco companies could have an \nadditional surcharge of $1,000 per teenager.\n  The amount of the manufacturer-specific surcharge for a type of \ntobacco product for a year under this paragraph is $1,000 multiplied by \nthe number of individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with \nrespect to its target level reduction.\n  So we have target-level reductions. It starts out at 15 percent. It \ngradually increases to 60 percent. They are going to take a survey and \nfind out what brand of cigarettes this youngster is smoking. So in this \nrandom survey, if a bunch of kids say, ``Yes, I had a Marlboro,'' mark \nthem down, and for every child they determine smoked that brand of \ncigarette, they are going to assess the company another $1,000.\n  Now, I find that to be ludicrous. There are hundreds of brands of \ncigarettes--hundreds, and so we are going to have the Department of \nTreasury conducting this poll asking teenagers did you smoke. And if \nyou did, what brand? And it may be they can remember the brand, maybe \nthey can't. Maybe they smoked one cigarette; maybe they bummed a \ncigarette; maybe they don't tell the truth; maybe they don't respond; \nor maybe whatever. We are going to be assessing penalties to the tune \nof $1,000 for every teenager deemed by this poll to have used this \nparticular product.\n  That is ludicrous. I want to warn my colleagues. I may not have the \nvotes, but I am going to probably try and strike that. If we don't \nstrike that, it is going to come back to haunt you. You are going to be \nembarrassed because we put language in here that says this poll was \ndeemed to be accurate and therefore whatever the Secretary says is law \nand as a result here is your penalty. We have determined that there are \n10,000 youngsters in the age category who are using your brand and they \nare age 17 or less, and therefore we are going to sock it to you.\n  This doesn't make sense. If you want to figure out ways to punish \ntobacco, to fine tobacco, do it. But this is not the right way. This is \nnot workable. You should trash this whole thing and say, if you want to \nincrease tobacco tax $1.10, do it. Do it tomorrow. This thing phases it \nin over five years.\n  My point being, if you are going to try to reduce consumption, you \nwant to have a sticker price shock. You don't phase it in over 5 years. \nThey will never see it. They won't know it. It won't make the reduction \nin use. It won't get consumption down. It won't be effective.\n  Wow, what did we do. We raised hundreds of billions of dollars, but \ndid we achieve our objective? I don't think so. What did we do? Maybe \nthe objective was to raise billions of dollars so we would have a lot \nof money to spend. Maybe that's the case. I don't know. I hope not.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have a lot to say.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I understand. I don't want to interrupt the Senator. I \njust want, if I could for the purposes of the Record, if nothing else, \nand maybe for the education of both of us, to ask just one question.\n  Has the Senator, in the numbers that he has displayed on the chart, \nmade any volume adjustment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me go to that, and I appreciate the Senator's \ncomments because I knew the bill's proponents would say my numbers \ndon't assume a volume adjustment.\n  The administration, when they did their projection to come up with a \n$516 billion price tag for this bill, they did no volume adjustment. \nWhen the AGs came up with their price tag for the settlement, they \ndidn't do a volume adjustment. And finally, we discovered that the \nWhite House changed the volume adjustment threshold in this legislation \nover the weekend. That bothers me a lot. That was changed Sunday or \nMonday night. And that bothers me a lot.\n  Let me conclude. I know what my colleague is going to say. Let me \ntake you through this a little bit further.\n\n  The volume adjustments, the formula that passed out of the Commerce \nCommittee says the industry payments will be reduced by the volume. If \nthere is a reduction in sales, we will reduce the tax. Again, in \ncalculating the costs of their own bills, both the $516 billion current \ndollar estimate and the $755 billion nominal dollar estimate, they \ndidn't calculate the volume adjustment.\n  Now, what happened Sunday and Monday night was a humongous tax \nincrease that nobody knows about because the volume adjustment was \ntriggered not when sales dropped below 100 percent of 1997; it is \ntriggered when sales drop below 80 percent of 1997. So you get no \nvolume reduction unless you reduce total consumption to below 80 \npercent where we are today. So I am not sure there will be a volume \nadjustment ever.\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\n  Now, I do not know if my colleague caught that. In the original \nCommerce bill, it says we will take these figures on my chart and we \nwill reduce them, if there is a reduction in volume of sales. We will \nhave a CPI increase, and we will have a volume decrease, and so maybe \nthe figure will stay close to $23 billion. If volume went down 3 \npercent and CPI went up 3 percent, maybe you could take this figure, \n$23 billion, for all future years.\n  Well, what they did in the stealth of the night of Sunday or Monday, \nthey said, oh, we are going to change that. We are not going to give a \nvolume adjustment unless they reduce total consumption to below 80 \npercent of where it was in 1997. Wow.\n  Now, this is getting too complicated. Most of our colleagues aren't \ngoing to follow it, and I don't want to get too bogged down in the \nminutia, but that is a big tax increase. That means you are not going \nto have reductions. You may never have a reduction.\n  My point being, that the way you do volume adjustment, the real way \nis to have a direct excise tax on the product--very clean, very simple. \nYou don't have to argue about whether or not you are talking about \nconstant dollars, inflated dollars, whether you are talking about \nvolume adjusted. If you have an excise tax per pack, if you sell less \npacks, so what. You have accomplished your objective. You have done it.\n  This is the worst method to tax we have ever imposed in the Federal \nGovernment that I can find. This is so convoluted, so distorted, so \ndeceptive, so contrived say we are raising taxes $1.10 and not do it. \nIf our colleagues want to be honest, they would say let's scrap all \nthis and let's make the tax $1.10, and then you have an automatic \nvolume adjustment. You have an automatic volume adjustment. Because if \nyou purchase less, then that will happen.\n  Let me just mention, too, the volume adjustment section, just for my \ncolleagues'----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator--\n  Mr. NICKLES. I really don't want to. I have a lot to go through and I \nwant to finish this. I am this far and I have a lot more to go. So I \nwill be happy to talk to you in just a minute. But I want to run \nthrough several things, and I don't want to get too bogged down on that \none particular thing.\n  Mr. President, let me just touch on a few other things. And I mention \nthat, Mr. President, and I will guarantee you that not one Member, \nmaybe not any Member, certainly not more than two members of the \nCommerce Committee or the Finance Committee knew anything about that \nchange in the volume adjustment, and it is a big change. It is \ndifferent than the committee reported bill. And, again, I am troubled \nby these games. I am troubled by people saying, oh, here is what the \nbill says and then to play games maybe late at night, Sunday night, \nMonday night, and have this bill written by the administration. This is \nnot a Commerce Committee bill. This is an administration bill.\n  I think it cries out for change, and the change should be this, I \ntell my colleagues. The change should be to call a tax a tax. Senator \nLautenberg introduced a bill that said let's have a $1.50 tax. That is \nwhat the Finance Committee passed. Whatever the tax is, whether it is a \n$1.10 or $1.50, whatever, we should pass the tax increase per pack \nplain, simple, clean, and not play this game of, industry, you pay in \nall these hundreds of billions of dollars, and maybe we will give you \nsome reductions if consumption comes down, but we are going to have \npenalties if X, Y, Z brand doesn't go down as much as we think it \nshould go down among certain people. That is absurd, and that is what \nwe have, all based on polling that they deem to be accurate. That makes \nno sense, no sense whatsoever.\n\n  Let me go on through a few other points. I am going to try to speed \nthe pace up. There are tobacco distributor licensing fees, brand new; \nthere are nonpayment penalties, there are document good-faith payment \npenalties; there are antismuggling penalties; and then we get into new \nspending. So all this is on the revenue side. This is on the tax side. \nThis humongous tax bill, I don't care what period you are looking at, \nthis is a bigger tax bill--gross, net, any figure you want to use--a \nbigger tax increase than the tax cut we passed last year. Maybe that \nwill help put it in perspective.\n  Last year, in a bipartisan manner, we passed $500 tax credit per \nchild. This year, for 1997 it is $400. We passed that. We reduced \ncapital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent. That is one of the reasons \nyou have seen Federal revenues grow by over 10 percent this year. It is \nbecause we cut capital gains. People like that. People have more \nfinancial transactions, and you are not taxing those transactions so \nmuch. It raised a lot of money for the Government. We reduced estate \ntaxes by increasing the exemption. We provided IRAs. We did a lot of \ngood things in the tax bill, a lot of good things.\n  Guess what, this tax increase overshadows it. This tax increase \novershadows it, and it is paid for, the strong majority of this is paid \nfor, by individuals making less than $30,000, $40,000 a year. This is a \ntax increase on low-income people. It is a humongous tax increase. It \nis bigger than all the tax cuts we gave last year, than all the tax \ncuts. So that should concern people.\n  My colleague, Senator Gorton of Washington, said we should have some \ntax relief. We are going to have a humongous tax increase; we should \nhave some relief.\n  We are getting to the spending side now. This is one of the problems \nthat bothered me. I told my colleagues from the outset, I will work to \npass a good bill to reduce teenage consumption of drugs and tobacco. I \nwill. I will not support passing a bill that spends hundreds of \nbillions of dollars so government can grow. We grow government in this \nbill like there is no tomorrow. This bill has government growing from \nthe State level, government growing from the Federal level, government \ngrowing at almost any excuse. And the administration wrote every bit of \nit.\n  Did they consult the Appropriations Committee? Did they consult the \nBudget Committee? No way. We made a little improvement. In the bill \nthat passed the Commerce Committee, this was all off budget and it \nwasn't subject to an appropriation. All of that was an entitlement. We \nchanged it. Now, only half of it is entitlement. The States are \nentitled to 40 percent. That is an entitlement. We can't touch that. \nAnd then the farmers are entitled--under the bill from the \nadministration and Commerce Committee, farmers are entitled to $28 \nbillion.\n  I know Senator Lugar is going to have an amendment to reduce that, \nbut in both cases those are entitlements. In both cases we are spending \nbillions of dollars. I have a problem with that. I don't know how I can \ngo to my farmers and say those tobacco farmers are going to be entitled \nto get maybe $18,000 an acre on this buy-out, and of course they can \ncontinue producing tobacco after we buy them out. We will buy their \nquota, but, yes, they can continue producing tobacco forever. I have \ntrouble with that.\n  I have trouble with, Who is going to get most of this money? Let's \nsee; let's figure out who is going to get the money. I mentioned my \nmother had emphysema and lung cancer. Does she get any money? No. Do \nvictims get any money? No. Government gets money. Who gets money? Do \nvictims of cancer and smoking-related disease and problems get money of \nout of this? No. Who gets the money? States get the money. The \nGovernment gets the money.\n  Where are they going to use the money? The bill says the States get \n40 percent of the money, and they are going to get at least $196 \nbillion so they don't sue the tobacco companies. Four have done it and \nsettled. More power to them. Congratulations.\n\n  Who is going to benefit from that? I guess the States do. They get \nsome money. In the State of Florida, out of an $11.3 billion, the trial \nattorneys get $2.8 billion. That is 24.7 percent. In Texas, they had a \n$15.3 billion deal; the trial attorneys get $2.2 billion.\n  We had an amendment the other day to limit it. Maybe it was too low. \nI am going to tell my colleagues, you are going to have another chance. \nBut we are going to give a few individuals, maybe 50 individuals or \nsomething, we are going to make them multimillionaires, maybe \nbillionaires? We have had some of these people working the halls of \nCongress. These guys, some of them have chances to become billionaires, \nwith a ``b.''\n  And I am all for people making money, I think that is great, but we \nshould not do it raising taxes on consumers making under $25,000. We \nare\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\ngetting ready to do it, and I will tell my colleagues, if we pass this \nand if somehow you are successful--and I don't think you will be--but \nif some forsaken way you are successful getting this through conference \nthe way you have it set up right now, you will be more than \nembarrassed. You will be reading about individuals making hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, trial attorneys making hundreds of millions of \ndollars off this deal. And you had your hands on it? I would be \nembarrassed, and I think that you would. I think we are going to fix \nit.\n  I noticed the Senator from North Carolina was here, and he tried to \nfix it with one amendment. It didn't pass, but my guess is we have some \nother ideas. I think we will fix it before it leaves the Senate. If we \ndon't fix it before it leaves the Senate, we will fix it in conference. \nIf we don't fix it in conference, I hope we don't have a bill. I hope \nwe don't have a bill anything like this. And, again, I reiterate my \nposition, I think we can come up with a bill that will be good to curb \nteenage smoking and consumption of drugs and tobacco. But I do not \nthink we have to come up with a scheme that spends either $500 billion \nor $755 billion or $885 billion. I don't think we have to do it. I know \nwe don't have to do it.\n  Some people are saying, ``I am reading a poll and''--I don't care \nwhat the poll says. Let's do what is right. Let us try to curb teen \nsmoking. You don't have to do all of this.\n  The FDA came up with their regulations 2 years ago, and they said \ntheir regs alone were going to reduce consumption by 50 percent. There \nis not a lot of difference between 50 percent and 60 percent, except I \nsee hundreds of billions of dollars being spent in the process. So, let \nme talk about that. I talked a little bit about the money going in. I \nam telling you, there is a lot more money going in than people have \nmentioned. If they say there is only a dollar and a dime, let's pass an \namendment and say here's a dollar and a dime, and I guarantee these \nfigures will shrink. They will shrink.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator just yield on that point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I won't yield. I am going to continue or I will \nnever get done, and then I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  The spending side of this equation, I mentioned it has a couple of \nentitlements. The States get 40 percent of revenues. We tell the \nStates: You have to spend half of it as the Clinton administration \ndecreed. You have to spend half as they said. It must be on children's \nhealth, child care, child welfare, substance abuse, education, \nchildren's health insurance--any of their little social programs that \nthey like. Granted, the Clinton administration wants to expand the \nwelfare state. So they say, here, States, we know that you initiated \nthese lawsuits and you were winning some of them, but, since now we are \ngoing to take this over and federalize it, you have to spend the money \nthe way we want.\n  So the bill restricts half of the state money and says: States, you \nspend it in a welfare-acceptable or child-acceptable manner as the \nClinton administration dictates that it be spent. And then they say: \nStates, you can spend the other half any way you want to. So that is \nthe way we are going to increase government in the States. States, \ncongratulations, here's your money. In exchange for that, we are going \nto limit your ability to sue the tobacco companies.\n  I can see why the companies walked away from this deal. They made a \ndeal with the Clinton administration and the administration broke it, \nand they can still be sued in lots of areas. Oh, well, there is an $8 \nbillion cap. I can see a race to the courthouse.\n  I am going to support the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire \nto strike protections for the tobacco companies. Some people say, if \nyou are opposed to this bill, Senator Nickles, you must be in favor of \nthe tobacco companies. This bill does the tobacco companies a big favor \nby limiting their liability to $8 billion a year. The tobacco companies \nare saying they are not even part of it. Why should we give them an $8 \nbillion limit of liability? Why?\n  I don't see any reason to do that. I agree with the Senator from New \nHampshire. So I am not going to give the tobacco companies the \nprotection they really want. Why give it to them? It is the proponents \nof the bill who are trying to do the tobacco companies a big favor, not \nsome of the opponents.\n  (Mr. FAIRCLOTH assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, what about the money? Now we are talking \nabout money. The States are going to get 40 percent of this amount, and \nthey can spend half as they want, and the other half is spent as the \nClinton administration wants.\n  They can spend it on public health--and we are all for public health. \nThat is going to get 22 percent. So we are going to grow a lot of \ngovernment in that area. Health-related research, we are all for that. \nFarmers' assistance, we are going to make farmers millionaires. Maybe \nthese farmers were thinking about selling their property last week. \nNow, they hear Congress is getting ready to pass a bill and they say, \n``I might get 4, 5, 10 times what the property is worth if I hang \naround.'' It would be interesting to see what is happening on tobacco \nfarm prices right now in North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia and other \nplaces, because Congress is going to pay them billions of dollars.\n  We are going to pay them so much--not per acre--per pound of quota, \nand we are going to make a lot of them a lot wealthier than they have \never been.\n  Guess what? When we are done paying them they can still grow tobacco. \nWe can buy their farms cheaper than what will be paid under these two \nproposals right now. We can buy the land, have the Government take over \nthe land and turn it into a park. I shouldn't say that out loud, \nbecause somebody is going to propose it.\n  We are going to make people very, very wealthy because they hold a \ndocument called an allotment. It goes back to the New Deal. If you \nbelieve in free markets, it is just totally wrong. Yet, we are going to \ncompensate them; we are going to buy them out.\n  Let me go through some other new spending provisions.\n  There is a Medicare preservation account. Frankly, that is important, \nbut I tell my colleagues, it wasn't in the Commerce Committee bill. It \nwasn't in the Finance Committee bill. It appeared Sunday or Monday \nnight, and I object to that. I object to the administration coming in \nand saying, ``Oh, we have some new ideas here,'' as they did with their \nvolume adjustment.\n  We have child care development block grants. This is very \ninteresting. This was put in the Commerce Committee bill, and I \nobjected to it. One, they don't have jurisdiction over child care \ndevelopment block grants, but they were putting it in anyway. They are \nnot the committee of jurisdiction on that. I don't know if they know \nanything about it. They put the money in. The Finance Committee took it \nout. Guess what? The Clinton administration put it back in. I am \ntroubled by that.\n  Then, I find they did some other things. They changed formulas for \nchild care programs. I wonder if my colleague from North Dakota knows \nthat. They changed the formula. We have a State match formula for \nMedicaid. The match in most States is 50-50. In some States, it is 70-\n30. This bill now reduces that State match for child care to 20 \npercent, because they want more child care money spent and more \nindividuals to qualify for it. The States actually have more money now \nin this program than they know what to do with. People were not taking \nadvantage of it, so they reduced the State participation down to 20 \npercent.\n  The Federal Government for child care, with this increase, is going \nto pay four times as much as the State pays for it. That is an \nentitlement. That is a change, and the Commerce Committee has no \njurisdiction over that. They did it. They also have report language \nthat says, ``Hey, let's spend about $4 billion per year on this \nprogram.'' This is a 25-year bill. That is $100 billion. It was just \nadded. Does anybody know it? Like I said, it was in, it was out, now it \nis back in.\n  They changed the Medicaid provision, which is wrong. They put in a \nbrand new children's health care provision, which basically reopened \nthe welfare bill. The bill would add $25 billion for States to do \nMedicaid outreach on children's care. We debated welfare. We passed the \nwelfare reform bill. Now, the administration is coming through\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\nthe backdoor on the tobacco bill saying, ``Let's expand the welfare \nbill.''\n\n  They did it in the middle of the night. It did not pass the Commerce \nCommittee. They didn't ask anybody in the Finance Committee who worked \non welfare reform--not one person, not staff, not anybody. They just \nput it in.\n  They also put in a provision that allows for presumptive eligibility \noutside the cap funding for children's health care. Last year, we \npassed children's health care, a $24 billion. We increased cigarette \ntaxes to do it. I thought it was too much. I didn't support it, but we \npassed it. It is now the law of the land.\n  Guess what they did in this bill? They just put in this new language. \nIt was not in the Commerce Committee bill. It was not in the Finance \nCommittee bill. The administration put it in. It sickens me to know \nthat the administration thinks they have the ability to rewrite this \nbill. It may have Senator McCain's name on it, but it is the \nadministration's bill. Now, they are opening up the welfare bill, and \nthey are opening up the kid care bill we passed last year for a massive \nexpansion. These new provisions are estimated to cost $400 million per \nyear. They open up the balanced budget agreement. That was part of our \nbalanced budget agreement package that we negotiated and fought so hard \nfor. Again, they cannot find enough people to qualify for the money \nunder the language that we already have, so they are trying to figure \nout new ways to spend more money.\n  We have new programs for cessation and other treatments, Indian \nHealth Service, education prevention, counterads, which incidentally, I \nwill support. This paltry bill is spending hundreds of billions of \ndollars. Do you know what it spends for countereducational ads to \ndiscourage the consumption of tobacco? Mr. President, $500 million a \nyear. Big deal.\n  Everybody says, ``Hey, we need to pass this bill so we can reduce \nteen consumption of tobacco.'' So $500 million out of a total of about \n$20 billion dollars almost every year. All the rest is for other \nGovernment spending; in some cases, any Government spending.\n  The national educational effort to convince people that smoking can \nbring about cancer is pretty small out of this total package.\n  It has an Institute of Medicine study, National Institutes of \nHealth--all of these are getting pro rata shares of money that would be \nauthorized--Centers for Disease Control, National Science Foundation, \nNational Cancer Clinical Trials. That program wasn't in anybody's bill. \nThe administration put that in either Sunday or Monday. They have money \nin here for a State retail licensing program, State grants, of $200 \nmillion a year. It is on page 118 of the bill.\n  I will just tell my colleagues what this does. I am embarrassed that \nwe would put language in that allows this to happen. But I want my \ncolleagues at least to know it so that maybe they will agree with me. I \nwill have an amendment at some point to strike some of this language.\n  The State retail licensing program codifies that portion of the FDA \nregulations. It provides for $200 million a year and, basically, it \ncodifies the FDA regulations dealing with selling tobacco. That is on \npage 119. It says:\n\n       Shall prohibit retailers from selling or otherwise \n     distributing tobacco products to individuals under 18 years \n     of age, in accordance with the Youth Access Restrictions \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary.\n\n  Let me mention what that one little paragraph does. That paragraph \nsays we are going to set up a whole mechanism to find out whether or \nnot retail establishments are selling tobacco to teenagers. Maybe you \nsay, ``Hey, I don't want retail establishments selling to teenagers.'' \nSo how are they going to do it? There is $200 million which they give \nto the States in block grants. The States have to contract to set up \ninspection teams to do random inspections across the country to find \nout whether or not they are complying.\n  What if they don't comply? The fines and penalties are very, very \nsignificant. I looked it up. The fifth noncompliance the penalty is \n$10,000. For the sixth there is an even greater penalty; it is not just \nmonetary.\n\n  So the Federal Government is going to train these inspectors. They \nare going to go out and do random audits. And I just have to think, \nwhat are we doing? How far are we going in this Government police \nbusiness? In the committee reported bill there would have been so many \ninspections per State. Each individual State had a list of how many \ninspections. I will talk about this later, because I plan on having an \namendment on it. But I say on the floor today, I believe, there have to \nbe 4,000 inspections--smaller States less, bigger States more.\n  The bill was mandating thousands of inspections where these people \nwould be going by and seeing if somebody is purchasing cigarettes. \nGuess what? It is not just purchasing under age 18; they are checking \nto see if the establishment is checking IDs for people up to age 27. So \nyou are in noncompliance if you are a gas station and you sell \ncigarettes to somebody who is 26 years old. That is a violation if you \ndo not check their ID. You are in violation of these Federal \nregulations if you do not check their ID.\n  Now, I am going to have a different speech talking about FDA \nregulations. But my point is, this bill sets up a $200 million new \nprogram to give money to the States. The States monitor this as we deem \nappropriate on the Federal level. I find that to be absurd. And the \nFederal Government, with its wisdom, says, ``We believe you should \ncheck everybody aged 27 or less. If you don't check them, you are \nsubject to fines of up to $10,000.''\n  Wow. Now, think of that. You have some burly Marine who is 25 years \nold from the Marine camp in North Carolina who comes in, and he says he \nwants a pack of cigarettes, and you can tell he is more than 18 years \nold. And you are going to ask this guy, ``Oh, I can tell you're a \nsergeant major, but we want to check your ID\"? I don't want to ask him \nto do that. But you could be fined up to $10,000. That is in the FDA \nreg.\n  We are getting ready to codify the FDA regs. We are getting ready to \ndeem the FDA regs as law, which is a very bad idea. The FDA can come up \nwith regs. They cannot write law. They cannot write law. Their regs, in \nmy opinion, are unconstitutional. We just cannot deem something \nunconstitutional as law, as this bill would propose to do, whether it \nbe in advertising or otherwise. Just to give you an example, the FDA \nregs said it was unlawful for tobacco companies to develop advertising \ngimmicks such as a hat. I have a staff member who has a hat that says \n``Marlboro'' on it. Heaven forbid, what outlandish behavior. We have \nthe Federal Government saying, ``You can't have a hat that has \n`Marlboro' on it or `Winston' ''? Give me a break. And there are \npenalties for noncompliance with that.\n  The FDA came up with some outlandish regulations. We are just going \nto deem those regulations as law? We are the legislative body. I think \nwe should clarify what FDA can do. I don't mind regulating nicotine. I \ndo not mind giving FDA some additional authority if we clearly define \nit, but Congress should define it. We should not just take their regs \nand say, ``Here. Whatever you've said is fine. It's law, no matter what \ncourt cases are already decided.'' Wait a minute. If they went too far, \nthey breached the Constitution, we are just going to deem it as law? \nThat is not good legislation. That is just doing whatever FDA wants.\n  Again, this administration wrote the bill. But we should not adopt \nthose provisions. We are the legislative branch. We are the equal \nbranch of the administration. Why let them write this bill? Why help \nthem pass a bill which has no tax relief, spends hundreds of billions \nof dollars, and its impact on smoking is very questionable?\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of new spending. I am going to submit \nfor the Record several specific references. I have heard people say \nthis bill has 17 new agencies. It has a lot more than that.\n  Mr. President, I think I have mentioned all these. I will run through \nthis other list in a minute. It has Indian tribe enforcement grants, \nIndian tribe public health grants, tobacco farmer quota payments, \ntobacco community grants, farmer opportunity grants, tobacco worker \ntransition program, USDA operation of tobacco program, international \ntobacco control awareness effort--brand new; it was not in either bill, \nwas not in the Commerce Committee, and was put in by the administration \nSunday or Monday.\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\n  Compensation to tobacco vending owners: That was in the Commerce \nCommittee bill. Let me just touch on that for a second. Everybody knows \nthe FDA regs say we are going to ban vending machines. Well, if \nCongress wants to ban vending machines, Congress should do it. And then \nyou say, ``Well, wait a minute. Shouldn't we compensate the vending \nmachine owner?'' It is logical. As a matter of fact, the Constitution \nsays you should not confiscate somebody's property without just \ncompensation.\n  What do we do in this bill? We set up a corporation. And the \ncorporation is to deem what is just compensation. I have had people \ncome in and lobby me--some of them are very good friends --and say, \n``Boy, we need this in there.'' I say, ``What kind of compensation are \nyou talking about? How much do those machines cost?'' ``Well, they \nmight cost $1,500, $2,000, $2,500, something like that.'' ``How much do \nyou envision taxpayers paying you for that machine?'' ``Well, we're \nkind of thinking maybe $8,000 or $10,000, something along those \nlines.''\n  That troubles me. ``Well, we were going to make money off that \nmachine for the next several years, and we would like to have the \npresent value of the future earnings of that machine since you're \ntaking it away from us.'' Maybe they have a legitimate argument, but \nthat bothers me. It is the same argument that we are going to be making \non tobacco farmers. Are we going to be giving them the future value of \nthe earnings potential of that farm for a long number of years? I do \nnot want to do it. And I love my friends from the tobacco States, but I \ndo not want to do that. I do not want to do it on vending machines \neither. I just think that is a mistake.\n  We are getting ready to pay--if we allow this legislation to go \nforward,''such sums as necessary.'' We are going to be spending lots \nand lots of money.\n  This bill has a section in it, Mr. President, called ``asbestos trust \nfund.'' Now, I raised this with my colleague, the Senator from Arizona. \nThe bill that was reported out of the Commerce Committee contained a \n$21.5 billion asbestos trust fund, originally funded separately by the \ntobacco companies. I objected to that, and so they agreed to fund it \nout of the larger trust fund. Then the Finance Committee struck it \naltogether and said if we are going to set up a new compensation \nprogram, we should look at it more closely. And if we do it for \nasbestos, shouldn't we also do it for black lung? Shouldn't we do it \nfor brown lung? And shouldn't we do it for textile mills? Shouldn't we \ndo it for any other number of lung diseases related to occupation?\n  I do not think you can stop just with asbestos. I think you have to \nlook at black lung, you have to look at brown lung, you have to look at \nall of them. So the cost of this, the $21 billion, could grow like \ncancer, and would. I made these points in the Finance Committee. We \nstruck it in the Finance Committee. This was never a request by the \nadministration, and never a request by the Commerce Committee. Then it \nwas put back in by the Commerce Committee anyway; it is back in.\n  They delete the authorization language and so on, but they authorize \nCongress to spend tobacco money whenever Congress passes an asbestos \nbill. You can tap into the fund an unlimited amount of money. It does \nnot say $21.5 billion, it just opens the door. I think that is grossly \nirresponsible.\n  Does that mean I am not sympathetic to somebody who had asbestos \nproblems and also is a smoker and had lung cancer and has a problem? \nNo. I am very sympathetic. But I am also looking at what we are doing \nhere. And we are in the process of expanding a program greatly out of \ncontrol.\n  It has money in it for the Veterans Affairs' tobacco recovery fund--\nnot specified; wide open; no limit to how much it could cost.\n  Is has an attorney fee arbitration panel. I touched on this before. \nThis arbitration panel is a three-member panel, with no limit as to how \nmuch this would cost. I heard some people say, ``We can't do that.'' \nNow, wait a minute. Everything else has limits. I am going to submit \nthis list of programs for the Record, but we have about 30-some-odd \nguidelines on how this money should be spent.\n  But we are going to leave a blank check in here for attorney fees? \nNow, give me a break. Congress is in the process of raising these \ntaxes, putting this money in the fund. Congress is also responsible for \nspending the money: ``Here, States, here is how you spend it. Here is \nhow you must spend it. Here is how we're going to spend it. And we can \nplace restrictions on what attorney fees should be.\n  Right now if we pass this bill, the clear winners are trial \nattorneys. The clear losers are consumers, low-income smokers. They are \nthe losers. The trial attorneys are the victors. They are the winners. \nThey win big time. They become millionaires--billionaires, maybe in \nsome instances. And the losers are the people who see their total \nFederal tax liability increase by 44 percent if they make less than \n$10,000. They are the losers. They are big-time losers. Are we going to \nfix it?

Since we also added the Lugar \namendment, there are several provisions, some of which are similar but \nnot near as extensive or as expensive as that provided in the Commerce \nCommittee bill. It adds a tobacco community's revitalization trust \nfund, it adds a tobacco quota buyout, block grants, tobacco farmer \nassessment, and so on.\n  I want to be fair on both sides of the tobacco argument. You add all \nthat together, you have 30-some new programs funded in this bill. You \nhave hundreds of billions of dollars funded in this bill. You have \ntrial attorneys who, in all likelihood, will make over $100 billion out \nof this bill--$100 billion out of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record new taxes, \nassessments, penalties, and new spending authorizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   What's New in the White House tobacco bill                                   \n                                       NEW TAXES, ASSESSMENTS, & PENALTIES                                      \n                                                                                                                \nNational Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund............................

Now, are we going to pass that? I know I saw an ad by \nDr. Koop saying we need to. I love Dr. Koop. I know he is very sincere. \nBut I don't think you have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to \ngo after teenage consumption of tobacco or of drugs. And I think we \nshould go after both. I think we would be grossly irresponsible if we \ndon't go after both.\n  I am concerned about the cost of this bill. I told my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona that I have the greatest respect for him but I \ndon't have great respect for this bill. I think this bill is one of the \nworst pieces of legislation that Congress has considered since the \nhealth care dictates of the President and Mrs. Clinton several years \nago. That bothers me. I don't think we should pass it in the Senate. I \ntold my colleagues I am not going to just stand back and throw rocks at \nit. I will try to make some improvements.\n  I read a list of the sections, and I don't think there should be an \nasbestos section. I may have an amendment to delete it. I don't think \nwe should have the massive industry payment system. I am going to try \nto talk my colleagues into replacing it with a simple excise tax. Raise \nit $1.10, so you know exactly the amount. I am not comfortable with the \nfact that some people are saying it is $1.10, but it raises more money \nthan that, so maybe they will have more money to spend. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that these payments, and you divide that out by the \nnumber of cigarettes sold, if you are selling 24 billion cigarettes, \nyou realize this will raise a lot more money than $1.10. We are talking \nabout big money. We are talking about it every year.\n  The tobacco settlement was originally, when fully implemented, about \n$15 billion a year. This bill starts at $24 billion, and by the year \n2002, assuming the kickback comes in, $30 billion. That is a lot of \nmoney--3,000 percent\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\nincrease in the tax on smokeless tobacco and so on.\n  Maybe people don't care. I care. I care about the procedure. I think \nsome of my colleagues from the tobacco areas were upset about the \nprocedure. I think when you are dealing with the agriculture section, \nthat should have come out of the Agriculture Committee. Commerce \nCommittee is not supposed to write the agriculture section. And \nCommerce Committee is not supposed to write the tax section. And they \ndid both and they did a crummy job on the tax section. This is the \nworst tax law I've seen. If we pass it, it would be the worst tax bill \nCongress has passed. With all due respect, it wasn't even done by the \nCommerce Committee. It was done by the administration. President \nClinton didn't want to use the word ``tax'' so he thinks they hide it \nby using the word ``fee,'' but it is not a voluntary fee.\n  If tobacco companies were in agreement with this, this would be \nvoluntary, it would be a fee, and in return they get some liability \nprotection, and that is what they negotiated with the attorneys \ngeneral. Maybe that would work. This is not voluntary. There is no \nprovision that says if the tobacco companies don't like the fee, they \ndon't have to pay it. There is no provision like that. So it is a tax. \nCongress has the power to tax, but if we are going to tax, let's tax \nright.\n  The cigarette excise tax right now is 24 cents per pack. It is going \nto 39 cents by 2002. This bill purports to raise it another $1.10, so \nthat goes to $1.49.\n  So for my colleagues who are trying to push the tax to $1.50, it will \nbe $1.10 by the year 2002 under this bill, plus indexed for inflation. \nSo maybe you have a lot more than you really realized.\n  Let me take you through the numbers again. The tax on cigarettes \ntoday is 24 cents per pack. Congress, last year, I believe, increased \nthat tax 15 cents--24 and 15 is 39 cents. That is already law. This \nbill adds to that, purportedly, another $1.10. A $1.10 on top of the 39 \ncents is $1.49. So the Federal excise tax on tobacco, at a minimum, \nwill be $1.49 in the year 2002, plus it is indexed for inflation \nforever. This is indexed at inflation, or 3 percent--whichever is \ngreater. Never had an index that I know like that. I don't know that \nthat makes sense, but we have it in there. Why do we have it in there? \nSo we put more money in the pot so we have more money to spend. I don't \nthink we should do that.\n\n  What should we do? We should work together to come up with a \nresponsible package. I am willing to do that. I think this bill goes \nway too far.\n  I haven't touched the regulatory side of the bill. I will save that \nfor another speech, and hopefully maybe the FDA section will have some \ncommon sense come into it. We don't want to give this unbridled \nauthority to the administration. Don't we want to preserve for \nourselves, the legislative branch, the authority to write law? Or are \nwe going to take a massive menu of FDA regs and say they are deemed to \nbe law, although a court said part of them is unconstitutional. I don't \nthink we should do that. I will save the FDA section for another \ncomment and another time.\n  Now I am talking primarily about the financial impact of this bill. \nLet's work on a bill that will do a couple of things. Let s work on a \nbill that will try to educate youngsters that using drugs or using \ntobacco is a very serious problem. Let's try to reverse this trend that \nhappened, frankly, in the last 6 years, during the Clinton \nadministration, where marijuana use doubled among high school seniors, \nwhere tobacco use is up 35 percent among high school seniors. Let's try \nto reverse that through some public education. Let's try to get some \nworkable restrictions that are constitutional. Let's try to put some \nresponsibility back on young people. Let's try to maybe give the States \nthe encouragement to enforce the law.\n  It is against the law in every State in the Nation for people under \nthe age of 18 to smoke. So if they enforce the law, we don't have this \nproblem. Now, maybe they are not enforcing the law. But certainly this \nlittle operation we have here where we are going to have the Federal \nGovernment spend $200 million a year to go around and have all these \npeople inspecting to see if the convenience stores are checking IDs up \nto people age 27 is absurd. That is not going to work. It will build \nresentment. We need to say, States, what can you do to enforce the law? \nMaybe all the enforcement should go not to just the person selling the \ntobacco product. I am all for the States, if they find somebody selling \ntobacco or alcohol, frankly, to that minor, there should be significant \npenalties. That is the reason the laws are on the book. They should \nenforce the law. The penalties should not be just on the person selling \nbut on the person buying or the person consuming. There are laws if you \nare driving under the influence, you get a DUI, they can take your \nlicense away. Maybe we should have restrictions and penalties on the \nconsumer if they are breaking the tobacco consumption laws. Maybe it \nwould be a financial penalty, maybe it would be that they have to do \ncommunity service. Maybe they have to clean up a park. Give the States \nsome flexibility to put some penalties on the consumer.\n  One of the reasons I didn't smoke is because I had a football coach \nwho said, you smoke, you are out of here. Everybody else in our group \nunderstood that there was a penalty, there would be a price to be paid. \nSo let's put it back on the individual. Let's turn it around. We can do \nsome things like that.\n  What I see here is a massive effort to conceal, disguise, slide in \nunder the radar screen, a very big tax price increase. And the way it \nis done is going to have minimal impact on reducing consumption among \nteenagers because we slide it in stealthily. It starts at 65 cents and \nover 5 years it is $1.10, according to this nonsense. Are we going to \ndo it so gradually there is no sticker shock, so there won't be any \nimpact anyway? The Finance Committee said, if you are going to increase \nthe tax, put it up front, that, to me, is at least more honest. Do a \ntax, do away with the nonsense of hundreds of billions of dollars in \nindustry payments. The tax is 24 cents now, so it's going to 39 cents. \nIf Congress has the votes to do it, make it another dollar, add it on, \nvote on it. I probably won't vote for it. But do it honestly. The way \nwe have here is so misleading and deceptive.\n\n  Instead we are going to talk about volume reductions, and we are \ngoing to talk about inflation adjustment and about these payments, and \nI am going to bring up the point that some companies don't have to pay. \nIf smokeless companies produce less than 1 percent, they are exempt. So \nwhat are we going to do? We are going to put penalties, big assessments \non some companies; but a new startup company doesn't have to pay this \n$1.10 assessment. That is a big advantage. I have a feeling that this \nbill is going to cause new companies to crop up all over the place.\n  I think the arguments made by the Senator from Utah and others about \nhaving a black market are very real. These commodities aren't that hard \nto smuggle or hide. I think if you put in this kind of incentive, you \nwill have the same thing happen as it did in Canada and in other \ncountries in Europe. You are going to find a lot of contraband, a lot \nof hidden stuff, and people smuggling tobacco like they used to be \nsmuggling liquor. There is a lot of money to be made in the process. If \nthey are smuggling tobacco tax free, there is money to be made. And \nthere is money to be made in drugs. Smuggling under this bill is \nillegal. But the financial rewards will be very lucrative. If a person \nfigures out the value of a truckload of cigarettes, you will realize \nthat there is a real incentive if a person can get around the law and \npaying these taxes. The taxes are going to be greater, certainly, than \nthe product.\n  I stopped in a gas station last weekend just to see what tobacco \nprices were. I didn't know; I don't buy tobacco. There were some \ncigarettes selling for $1.24 a pack, and another for $1.84, and another \nfor $2.02. People say most of them are about $2. The more popular \nbrands were the higher-priced ones, closer to $2. That is with the \ntobacco tax of 24 cents. If it goes up another 15 cents--this bill \npurports to take it up to $1.10, and that is without the look-back \npenalties. If you add that back in, you are looking at probably close \nto a $2-per-pack tax that is in this bill. So taking a product right \nnow that sells from $1.24 to $2, you are going to add $1.50 to $2 in \ntaxes very shortly on consumers. Is that going to be an incentive for \npeople to smuggle cigarettes and get around the law? I believe it is. \nCertainly, there is incentive.\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\n I hope they won't be successful. I don't want to set up a black market \nor encourage that type of activity, but I am afraid we will be doing \nit.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just say that I am disgusted about the \nprocedure. I don't say that very often. I am part of the leadership, \nbut I am disgusted by the fact that you have one committee, the \nCommerce Committee, writing the finance portion, writing the \nagriculture portion, and they didn't do a very good job. I am disgusted \nby the fact that the bill changed and the administration rewrote the \nbill over the weekend. They didn't consult the Commerce Committee, or \nthe Finance Committee, or the committees of jurisdiction dealing with \nwelfare, child care, the committees that wrote those laws, people that \nhad the staff and the experts who knew what they were talking about. \nThe administration put in a lot of their wish lists. I am disgusted by \nthe fact that we would set up a whole new trust fund and say it is \nlimited to $1.10 tax, when it is not.\n  Let's be honest with people. This is not the way to pass legislation. \nThe Commerce Committee is not a tax-writing committee. They did a \ncrummy job. I am disgusted. The tax on one can of Skoal will be one \nlevel, and on a competitor it would be 30 percent less. I am disgusted \nby the fact that one cigarette company is not going to have the excise \ntax that another cigarette company is going to have. Wait a minute, \nthis is a national excise tax, but some companies don't have to pay it \nand some companies do. That is not the way you do business. I don't \ncare if you are small or large. Excise taxes are supposed to be across \nthe board. They didn't do that.\n\n  I am also disgusted by the fact that we would end up passing a bill \nto allow trial attorneys to make $100 billion over the life of this \nbill--probably $4 billion a year over the course of this bill. That \nbothers me a lot. That reminds me of what motivates this bill and it \nreminds me of the movie ``Jerry McGuire,'' where someone is screaming, \n``Show me the money.'' That is what is driving this thing. It is not \njust about curbing teenage smoking. That is a great public relations \ncampaign, and I will stand with anybody to try to curb teenage smoking \nand drug use. I emphasize ``drug use,'' because there is silence in \nthis bill about that. We are not going to pass a bill, if I have \nanything to do with it, unless we have a significant effort to combat \nnot just cigarettes but also marijuana and other illegal drugs that are \nmuch more hazardous, dangerous, and deadly.\n  I think this bill needs a lot of work. My guess is that it is \nprobably not fixable with just a few amendments. I don't think we \nshould be in a real rush to pass it. I have spent the last three nights \nstaying up past 1 o'clock reading this bill, trying to understand how \nit works. I still have a lot to learn about this bill. Before we pass \nthe biggest tax increase, the biggest spending program considered by \nCongress in years, I think we ought to know a little bit more about it. \nSo I urge colleagues to do their homework, consider serious amendments, \nnot frivolous amendments to string this bill out for a long time, but \nto make it better.\n  We are legislators. We are trying to pass law. My opinion is that \nthis is a bad bill that needs to be improved significantly before we \nlet it become law. I will reiterate my statement that I will work with \nany colleague, Democrat or Republican, to try to fashion a bill that \nwill reduce teenage consumption of drugs and tobacco. But I don't think \nwe have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to do it. I don't \nthink we have to turn over massive amounts of power to bureaucrats to \ndo it. So I look forward to working with my colleagues to try to make \nthat happen in the next few weeks as we consider this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was seeking to ask the Senator from \nOklahoma some questions about the numbers he was displaying about the \nrevenue generated by this bill, because the numbers he was displaying \nare not the official forecasts by the Joint Tax Committee of what this \nbill will raise. His numbers that he was displaying here are much \nhigher than the numbers that are in the official forecast. Generally, \nwhen we debate a bill on the floor of the Senate, we debate based on \ncommon numbers. We debate based on the official forecasts. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has chosen not to do that. He has chosen to take other \nnumbers that are much higher and different. The major difference \nbetween those numbers is that the bill calls for a volume adjustment \nthat is not contained in the Senator's figures.\n  The volume adjustment appears very clearly in the bill at page 189, \nNo. 2, ``Volume Adjustment.'' I will not go through the technical \ndetails. But the volume adjustment provides for, if volumes of \ncigarettes consumed declined because of an increase in price, the price \nincrease will be adjusted downward. The numbers of the Senator from \nOklahoma do not contain that volume adjustment. The fact is both Joint \nTax and the Congressional Budget Office assume there will be a \nreduction in volume of about one-third, and any volume reduction beyond \na 40-percent volume reduction will result in a lowering of the price \nincrease.\n  Again, the Senator's numbers did not include those figures. The \nnumbers he was using are not the official forecasts for this bill. They \nare at great variance from what has been provided by the Senator and \nare the official forecasts of what this bill will raise made by the \nJoint Tax Committee.\n  I want to point that out because I think it is important to set the \nRecord straight.\n  At this point in the record, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the Joint Tax Committee's estimates of what this bill \nwill raise.\n  I also would like to enter into the Record at this point page 189 \nfrom the bill that points out the volume adjustment provisions which \nthe Senator from Oklahoma neglected to advise the Senate are not \ncontained in the numbers which he displayed for our colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: This letter is in response to your \n     request for a revenue estimate of the manager's amendment to \n     S. 1415 offered May 18, 1998.\n       In order to complete the estimate of the manager's \n     amendment to S. 1415, we assumed that the base payment for \n     years beginning in 2003 and thereafter is $23.6 billion \n     before the volume and inflation adjustments.\n       Our estimate presents the net revenue effects of the \n     manager's amendment to S. 1415. These net amounts differ from \n     the gross payments required under the manager's amendment for \n     several reasons. First, the general tobacco industry payments \n     are converted to fiscal year payments. Second, the general \n     tobacco industry payments are reduced by an income and \n     payroll tax offset in the same way that net receipts from an \n     excise tax are calculated. Third, the higher price for \n     tobacco products resulting from the proposal reduces net \n     receipts generated from present-law tobacco excise taxes \n     because of reduced tobacco consumption. Finally, because the \n     proposal is expected to supercede most of the State-by-State \n     settlements that are implicit in the Congressional Budget \n     Office baseline receipts forecast, much of the negative \n     indirect effect of the anticipated State-by-State settlements \n     on receipts is reversed.\n       We estimate that the manager's amendment to S. 1415 will \n     have the following effects on Federal fiscal year budget \n     receipts:\n\n                                                                [In billions of dollars]                                                                \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                      Fiscal year--                                                     \n                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    1999       2000       2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007     1999-02    2003-07 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``base \n     volume'' means 80 percent of the number of units of taxable \n     domestic removals and taxed imports of cigarettes in calendar \n     year 1997, as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``actual volume'' means \n     the number of adjusted units as defined in section \n     402(d)(3)(A).\n\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague is making my argument for \nme.\n  In the first place, I am consistent. The administration, and Senator \nMcCain, said this bill would only cost $516 billion. Guess what? They \ndon't make a volume adjustment on that estimate. Instead, they used \nconstant 1999 dollars.\n  I have a letter from OMB that was trying to refute my argument, but \nbasically they made it for me. OMB says inflated nominal dollar \nindustry payments would equal $755 billion over 25 years. That is \nwithout the look-back penalty. By way of comparison, the equivalent \nestimate which the State attorneys general are proposing is $539 \nbillion in nominal dollars. Like the private analysis, these estimates \ndo not included volume adjustments. There is a reason they do not \ninclude volume adjustments. It is because it is hard to figure.\n  My point is that everybody here has heard the attorneys general group \ndiscussing the $368 billion figure that the administration signed off \non. When they use the $368 billion, they do not take into account any \nvolume adjustment. No one knows what the volume adjustment is going to \nbe.\n  I will show my colleague a table from the Joint Tax Committee. I have \nbeen trying to figure out what these industry payments really are. How \nmuch of a tax increase is it? I have hounded Joint Tax for an estimate, \nand we have a letter and report from them dated yesterday. If this is \nnot the one the Senator printed in the Record, I will insert it in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my statement.\n  In the first place, they show the total revenues on the top line \nwhich, frankly, are consistent with the revenues that I showed on my \nchart. It is shown in calendar years, according to the bill on certain \npages which provided for a payment of $24.4 billion, $15.4 billion, \n$17.7 billion, and so on.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for an \nadministrative question, not a substantive one?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is throwing me off track.\n  Mr. McCAIN. About the schedule.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be finished shortly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to make sure people understand. I am not sure my \ncolleague from Arizona knows what was done.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I was not trying to interfere.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand; no problem. I bragged on the Senator \nbefore.\n  But I want to talk a little bit about the volume adjustment. I am \nvery familiar with the volume adjustment because I have been trying to \nfigure out what they are doing with it.\n  Also the Senator from North Dakota tried to repudiate my number of \n$755 billion. I am telling you that is the same number OMB came up \nwith, and they didn't volume adjust it, and they didn't volume adjust \nthe $368 billion.\n  I want people to know that I am consistent with what was done before.\n  In addition to inflation, the bill that was reported out of the \nCommerce Committee was to have a volume adjustment. If you sell less, \nthere would be less tax. So you have some reduction. But they do not \nknow exactly what that would be.\n  What was rewritten by the administration on Sunday or Monday is that \nthere will be a volume adjustment if and when volume gets less than 80 \npercent of last year's level. That is a big change.\n  Under the bill as originally written, the volume adjustments don't \nkick in until the sixth year. Then you would have some reduction. They \nsay you will get a reduction if and when you reduce consumption below \n80 percent down here.\n  My point is there is no volume reduction for the first several years, \nand after that you are guessing. But the volume reduction must be lower \nthan 80 percent. To get any volume reduction whatsoever, you must \nreduce consumption total by more than 20 percent. It used to be that \nyou only had to reduce it 1 percent to get a 1-percent reduction. Now, \nyou have to reduce 21 percent to get a 1-percent reduction. It may be \nthat they will never get a volume reduction as a result of that change. \nI don't know.\n  But my point being is that, one, we are being consistent in our \nanalysis of the cost of the bill, as it pertains to OMB, as it pertains \nto the Attorney General.\n  I want people to know what the facts are. The fact is the bill says \nit has a CPI adjustment. The facts are that OMB said they used constant \n1999 dollars to get $516 billion. I read it in the committee report. \nThis is absurd. It said total payments shall not exceed $516 billion. \nThat is not in the bill. It doesn't fit. It doesn't work.\n  If you use nominal dollars, as we use in every other budget \nprojection, and you put a 3-percent kicker in, that is how you get up \nto $755 billion.\n  Then you can add the look-back assessment. One could say there will \nnot be a look-back. Why was all this effort to add a look-back. I heard \ncolleagues say on the floor that look-back is almost maybe 50 cents. I \nwill tell you the look-back is a disaster. If anybody wants to raise \ntobacco prices another 50 cents, do it honestly. The look-back rests on \nthe Secretary of Treasury taking a poll and saying, ``Did we meet our \nobjectives? We want to reduce consumption by teenagers by a certain \npercentage. Did we make it? If we didn't make it, what happens then?'' \nIf they miss it by a certain percent, there is a fine. If they miss it \nby a bigger percent, there is a bigger fine. That raises about $4 \nbillion.\n  Then, they go to brand specific look-back assessments. This is \nabsurd. They say they are going to, in the same poll, find out whether \nthese youngsters buy X, Y, or Z brand. And if they smoke that brand, \nand that brand does not meet that target, there is a $1,000 penalty. \nFor every teenager they identify that smoked more cigarettes in that \nparticular percentage, then there is a $1,000 fine.\n  That is not really workable, and it needs to be fixed. It needs to be \ncleaned up. It needs to be deleted and then raise the tax whatever you \nwant to raise it. Be honest. Tell people we want to raise taxes. The \nfirst year it is going to a dollar a pack. Just raise it a dollar a \npack. Say next year, instead of 24 cents, it is going to be $1.24. Just \ndo it. That would be the honest way. This thing is more than deceptive \nand, in my opinion, probably won't work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am just going to repeat the point. I am\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\nsorry to have set off my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The simple fact is the numbers he has displayed here are not the \nofficial forecast for what this bill will raise. They just are not. \nThey are dramatically higher than the official forecast before this \nbody by the Joint Tax Committee, which is the forecasting service we \nall use. And so the numbers that he has presented to our colleagues, to \nanybody else who is listening, are numbers that are not the official \nforecast of what this bill is going to raise.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. I asked repeatedly for the Senator to yield to me. He \nrepeatedly refused, so I refuse.\n  The point is very simple. The reason his numbers are at dramatic \nvariance with the official estimate of what this bill that is before \nthis body will raise is because he takes no account of the volume \nadjustment that is contained clearly in the bill. And that volume \nadjustment calls for lower payments from the companies as the use of \nthe product falls. Now, any economist and anybody with common sense \nunderstands that as you increase the price of something, you sell less \nof it. That is just basic. And so the legislation acknowledges that \neconomic fact of life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nJoint Tax report.\n  Now, first I want to reply to my colleague. This joint tax report, \nwhich I have been asking for every day, is dated May 20, yesterday. \nThey didn't have this information before. No one has had a chart on \nwhat they thought the industry adjustment would be, but let me just \ngive the facts according to Joint Tax if you worship at that altar.\n  In the first place, they say the figures I have on the gross industry \npayments, are accurate. They have the exact same figures that I have. \nThey happen to be accurate. They estimate these for the first time. We \ndon't have a CBO study. We don't have a GAO study. We don't have \nanything from the administration showing what they think the volume \nadjustment would be. No one has had volume adjustments in any of their \ncharts, because it is a guess. But let me just repeat what the Joint \nTax Committee has said. They say the gross figures that I have are \nidentical. They say the total tax on consumers over the first 5 years \nis $102 billion. They say volume adjustment is $8.7 billion. So the net \nover the 5 years is $93.4 billion.\n  So this massive change in numbers that you are talking about is not \nthat massive. The total amount of tax on tobacco consumers, according \nto joint tax, over five years is $93.4 billion. That is pretty \nsignificant.\n  So, Mr. President, I just got this yesterday, or maybe we got it \ntoday. We got it today. And I am happy to have it submitted for the \nRecord. I am happy to debate facts all day long, and I want to debate \nfacts.\n  I see my colleague from Vermont who supports, I believe, a straight \nexcise tax. I just think you ought to do a tax. I think this scheme of \nhaving industry payments and having look-backs and surveys and polls, \nand those polls are deemed to be accurate--that is absurd, but that is \nwhat is in this bill.\n  You have an automatic volume reduction if you have an honest excise \ntax. Isn't that the truth? If you have an honest excise tax of $1.10 \nand there is less cigarettes sold, there will be less money going in to \nthe trust fund. It is self-fulfilling if you do it right.\n  This bill does it wrong. This bill says we are going to have this \nformula for this money to go in, and it is indexed and there is \nadditional formulas if we determine a certain number of people are \nusing the wrong product. And so we will put that in. And then, oh, yes, \nwe will reduce it by volume if we determine that.\n  Why not just have a tax per pack, and if there is less volume, there \nwill be less money going into the pot. And no one will have to argue \nabout volume adjustment that will be determined by the Secretary to \nsend to these various companies, and, oh, he is going to forget to send \nthat assessment to some companies.\n  That doesn't make sense. If somebody makes a different size of Skoal \nor a different size of snuff, he has a little different tax. You should \nput the same tax on every pack of cigarettes, the same tax on every \nbrand of moist tobacco or every brand of smokeless tobacco and just do \nit. And then you have an automatic volume adjustment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Sure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I won't take but a couple minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I did ask unanimous consent to print this chart in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  RECONCILIATION OF GENERAL TOBACCO INDUSTRY PAYMENTS UNDER S. 1415, AS AMENDED, AND NET FEDERAL REVENUE EFFECT OF SUCH PAYMENTS ESTIMATED BY THE JOINT \n                                         COMMITTEE ON TAXATION ON MAY 19, 1998, BEFORE THE LOOK-BACK PROVISIONS                                         \n                                                                [In billions of dollars]                                                                \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                           Fiscal year--                                                \n                Provision                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007   1998-2003  1998-2007\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI.

Mr. President, I am sure my friend from Oklahoma will \nallow me to describe what my position will be on it, and I appreciate \nhim stating it. And I do not want to get into the debate he and the \nSenator from North Dakota have been having. I was here to support, as I \nhave, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Gregg. And what I have before me is an amendment that I think makes \na great deal of sense.\n  I said yesterday that nobody is running up to me in the streets of \nVermont and saying, ``Oh, please, whatever you do, be sure and give a \nlot of immunity to the poor tobacco companies.'' Nobody in Vermont is \nsaying, ``Whatever you do, make sure first and foremost you protect the \ntobacco companies.''\n  They have made it very clear that they are concerned with protecting \nteenagers, concerned with protecting their children, concerned with \ngetting back some of the costs that we in Vermont have spent on health \ncare for those who have suffered from addiction to cigarettes.\n  But I ask, Mr. President, at the conclusion of my statement that I be \nallowed to put in the Record a letter from C. Everett Koop and David \nKessler to Senator Gregg and myself dated May 20, 1998.\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I just mention this about it. The letter very forcefully, \nvery eloquently makes the case why the interests of public health are \nnot served by giving big tobacco further special legal protection. They \nwrite:\n\n       Special legal protections for tobacco are unfair \n     to patients and their families.\n\n  They write further:\n\n       Special legal protections for tobacco are bad for public \n     health, especially children's health.\n\n  They write:\n\n       Special legal protections for tobacco are undeserved.\n\n  And they write:\n\n       If passed, the special legal protections in the Commerce \n     Committee bill would be the biggest corporate giveaway in \n     history.\n\n  And then they say:\n\n       For the sake of public health and children's health, for \n     the sake of the people who are already sick and for those who \n     will become sick, and for the sake of holding the industry \n     accountable for its actions, we urge you to strip the special \n     legal protections from the bill.\n\n  I agree with Dr. Koop. I agree with Dr. Kessler. I agree that first \nand foremost we should protect the people of this country. We should \nprotect the health of the people of this country. We should protect the \nchildren of this country. And we should not be giving special limits on \nlegal liability to big tobacco.\n  I disagree with the position of the White House in trying to allow \nspecial legal protection and special immunity for the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  Yesterday, the President wrote to the Senate leaders that:\n\n       If a cap that doesn't prevent anybody from suing the \n     companies and getting whatever damages a jury awards will get \n     tobacco companies to stop marketing cigarettes to kids, then \n     it is well worth it for the American people.\n\n  Everybody agrees with that. What doesn't come out in the President's \nletter is this bill does have provisions that will prevent some parties \nfrom suing the tobacco industry. It does cap the total annual payments \nfor the tobacco industry. The liability cap may very well affect the \npayment of future jury awards to tobacco victims.\n  So, I disagree with the White House and I disagree with those on both \nsides of the aisle who would limit some of the liability of the tobacco \ncompanies. If the tobacco companies hadn't faced unlimited liability \nfor their actions, we would not even be here today. If the tobacco \ncompanies hadn't known that they could be sued, and sued successfully, \nthey never would have admitted some of the things that have now come \nout. If the tobacco companies had not faced this, we never would have \nfound out the years that they had lied. We never would have found out \nthe internal memos where they were targeting 14-year-olds. We never \nwould have found out even such things as their efforts to make \ncigarette placements in all kinds of movies, including, of all things, \nthe ``Muppet Movie.'' These are things that we have found out only \nbecause they face that liability.\n  I concur with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I am \nopposed to limiting liability. With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                     Advisory Committee on Tobacco\n\n\n                                     Policy and Public Health,\n\n                                                     May 20, 1998.\n       Dear Senator Gregg and Senator Leahy: We are writing to \n     endorse and support the Gregg-Leahy amendment to S. 1415 to \n     eliminate all special liability protections for tobacco \n     companies. We wish you success and would urge your colleagues \n     to join with you in this effort.\n       Special legal protections for tobacco are unfair to \n     patients and their families.\n       Millions of Americans are now sick with tobacco-related \n     illnesses. Millions more will become sick in the future. \n     These are people who started to smoke at a time when the \n     tobacco industry lied about its products, hid scientific \n     studies, and shredded documents. Most of these people started \n     to smoke when they were children whom the industry targeted \n     for special marketing. To protect the industry now would \n     leave many of these patients, their families, and their \n     survivors without remedy.\n       Special legal protections for tobacco are bad for public \n     health, especially children's health.\n       Court oversight in the historic Minnesota suit led to the \n     disclosure of thousands of documents about the addictiveness \n     of nicotine and about the industry's plans to market to \n     children. Other legal actions have resulted in consent \n     decrees that will cut back on Big Tobacco's seduction of new \n     young smokers. Under the Commerce Committee bill, these state \n     and local suits would be impossible.\n       Special legal protections for tobacco are undeserved.\n       The tobacco industry has proven itself to be an \n     irresponsible corporate citizen. Extending protection to this \n     industry would be to subsidize and condone these activities. \n     No other industry, no matter how valuable to the Nation, has \n     such protections. We should not extend them to an industry \n     whose product that serves only to kill Americans prematurely.\n       The Senate should not provide special legal protections for \n     tobacco.\n       If an American jury finds tobacco companies owe damages, \n     the Senate should not overturn that verdict.\n       If the most skilled lawyers that money can buy cannot get \n     the tobacco industry out of court, the Senate should not \n     become its defenders.\n       If passed, the special protections contained in the \n     Commerce Committee bill would be the biggest corporate \n     giveaway in history.\n       For the sake of public health and children's health, for \n     the sake of the people who are already sick and those who \n     will become sick, and for the sake of holding the industry \n     accountable for its actions, we urge you to strip the special \n     legal protections from the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     C. Everett Koop, M.D.\n     David A. Kessler, M.D.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I had printed in the Record this Joint \nTax table. I also want to clarify a statement. I said, all of this \nmoney would be going into the trust fund. That was the way it was \ndesigned as it passed the Commerce Committee initially. The Commerce \nCommittee now says the net revenues from this large payment goes into \nthe trust fund. This chart says ``Industry Payments.'' That is not \ncorrect. It is consumers' payments. Consumers are going to be paying \nevery dime of this tax.\n  Granted, they have a section in here that says industry, companies, \nyou pay this amount. But they also have a section in here, on page 189, \nthat says the tobacco companies must pass the cost on to consumers.\n\n       . . . an amount sufficient to pass through to each \n     purchaser on a per-unit basis an equal share of the annual \n     payments to be made by such tobacco product manufacturer. . . \n     .\n\n  In other words, consumers, you have to pay every dime of this, every \nsingle dime. This is not paid for by tobacco companies. This is not a \ntax on tobacco companies. This is a tax on consumers. The way to solve \nthis ambiguity on volume adjustments is just say: ``Here is the tax per \npack, or per can or whatever it is. And then, if volume goes down, \nthere is less money.'' We do not do that in this bill.\n  I just mention, too, there is something really phony going on here. \nJoint Tax--and maybe I am not being as respectful to Joint Tax as I \nshould be. But the way they scored this thing, as I know my colleague \nknows, they take 25 percent of the revenue from excise taxes and assume \nthat is lost in transmission. So, if you raise $1 in tax, they assume \nonly 75 cents gets to where you are trying to send it. That would \nusually be correct. If you were going to increase excise taxes on a \nfarmer, he is going to have less money to spend on other products, it \nis going to slow the economy, so there would be some decline.\n  This assumption, I don't think, is applicable to these tobacco \npayments. Maybe the government would lose some percentage, but I don't \nthink it would be as much as 25 percent. And the reason is the \ncompanies, by this language, are forced, mandated, to pass on every \ndime of this payment. I cannot think of any other business--if Nickles \nMachine Corporation I used to run, if we had an increase in excise tax, \ngranted that might be in our cost of manufacturer. I might try to pass \nit on in higher prices to consumers and so on. Maybe I would be \nsuccessful and maybe I wouldn't. Maybe I'd have to eat part of it.\n  We have language in here saying we don't want tobacco companies to \npay a dime of this. We want consumers to pay every single dime of this \npart. Not the look-back. The look-back, they say, is not deductible, so \nmaybe they are supposed to chew on part of that. But the big part of it \nis passed on to consumers.\n  So I want to make sure I was accurate. I think I said this money goes \ninto the trust fund. That was not the\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\ncase. The language now says the net revenues go into the trust fund. \nAnd the net amount is really determined by the Secretary of the \nTreasury. He has a great deal of flexibility, I am afraid, to say, \n``Oh, well, we think, since this is all passed through, the gross \namount could be the net amount.'' He could say that this since it is \nall passed through.\n  Maybe I am getting too technical. I just want people to know, when \nyou see estimates from Joint Tax that they agree that this is a $102 \nbillion tax increase over the first 5 years. The look-backs are a \nquestion mark. Who knows? But evidently somebody thinks it is real \nmoney or they wouldn't be trying to jack up the look-back penalties.\n  And then the other variable is the volume adjustment, and no one has \nhad scoring on volume adjustments until today. These are purely \nassumptions. I put those into the Record. So, if they were accurate, \nconsumers will pay $102 billion, adjusted by 8.7, so $93.4 billion over \nthe 5 years. So it reduces it somewhat.\n\n  For that to happen, you have to assume you are going to have volume \nless than 80 percent of 1997 over that period of time. Who knows? I \ndon't know. But I always want to be factually correct. I may disagree \nwith the colleagues on substance or philosophy or motives or whatever, \nbut I want to be factually correct. And these numbers, I believe, are \nfactually correct. The volume adjustment is speculative and now Joint \nTax says it is minus $8 billion. Great. I do not agree with them that \nthere would be such a large loss of revenue from gross to net, because \nof the language that says 100 percent of it shall be passed on to \nconsumers. This figure, this payment by consumers, is accurate. \nConsumers, not tobacco companies, will pay the cost of this bill. I \nthink it is too high.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for a \nthorough exposition of the bill. He obviously has spent a great deal of \ntime studying it. I, obviously, am not in agreement with a number of \nhis conclusions, but this kind of exposition has been very educational \nand helpful to the entire Senate. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, \nnot only for his in-depth knowledge of the legislation but also the \ncomity which has accompanied his and my relationship and difference of \nopinion on this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was not able to be here at the exact \nmoment that the Senator from Vermont was speaking. But I do understand \nthat the Senator suggested that a rationale for his cosponsorship of \nthe Gregg amendment is that he opposes ``a lot of immunity for the \ntobacco companies,'' and opposes the ``protections'' that are contained \nin the Commerce Committee.\n  I will try to emphasize again, because I think we are really either \ntalking past each other here or there is just not an awareness of what \nis in the bill--there are no protections for the tobacco companies. \nThere is no protection. None. Zero protection. There is no such thing \nas a lot of immunity in this bill. There is no immunity in this bill. \nNone. Zero immunity.\n  The tobacco companies will be liable to lawsuits under any \ncircumstances. Whether they play in the tent or they are out of the \ntent, they are liable for lawsuits. The only distinction here is, if \nthose lawsuits are successful, how much will they be required to pay \nout in 1 year? That is the only thing that is contained here that is \nsome kind of a limitation.\n  Instead of being required conceivably to pay out $20 billion in 1 \nyear and go bankrupt so you have no payments to kids, there is a \nlimitation of $8 billion. So you can choose between the system that \nallows you to conceivably make them go bankrupt in the court system as, \nI might add, 70-plus percent of the asbestos companies did. We have \nlines of people who are suing today on asbestos who will never collect \nbecause the companies went bankrupt. In fact, there are people who want \nthem to be able to collect under the tobacco settlement because there \nis a lot of confusion between those diseases that are asbestos-induced \nversus tobacco-related.\n  Let's get the terms of this debate correct. We are not talking about \nimmunity; we are talking about whether or not, in exchange for \ncompanies giving up their constitutional rights to advertise, in \nexchange for companies abiding by the look-back provisions, in exchange \nfor companies agreeing not to sue in court, in exchange for companies \nagreeing to be part of the document depository, in exchange for \ncompanies being part of the effort to get our kids not to smoke, we are \ngoing to tell them in any one year, ``You're liability is only going to \nbe $8 billion.''\n  If the court finds that you are liable for $20 billion and there is \nno finding of liability next year in the court, they are going to have \nto pay the difference. The $8 billion from the $20 billion means they \nare still going to have to come in and pay an additional $12 billion, \nand they will pay up to $8 billion in the next year.\n  This is rational, in my judgment, Mr. President, because if you don't \ndo this, then you are voting for the status quo, which is a system that \nis not a system. You would be voting to say, ``OK, we've got this one \nlittle option here that invites the companies to come in and be part of \nthe process, but we're going to strip that option away because we want \nto show how tough we are on the tobacco companies and we're just going \nto let the lawyers go sue for the next''--whatever, recognizing that, \nfor the last 20 years, not one lawsuit has yet produced a dime for a \nplaintiff.\n  Obviously, circumstances have changed. We now have evidence that no \nplaintiff had in those past years. I understand that. As a lawyer, I \nwould love to go to court with the current level of documentation, and \nclearly, with the document depository, it will be a lot easier for a \nplaintiff to go into court and get a judgment. But you are not going to \nget that judgment in any sense of order. You are going to have what we \ncall a rush to the bar: First lawyers come, first served. The first \npeople to get the biggest judgments will be the first people paid off.\n  All these people coming in here and talking about the kids and \ntalking about how they want to have some kind of system to get the kids \nto stop smoking will have abandoned those kids, because those kids are \nnot going to benefit during those years of litigation. That is what we \nare talking about here. We are talking about whether or not we are \ngoing to have a rational approach to this or whether we are all going \nto feel good and say no liability.\n  I respect Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler enormously. We wouldn't be where \nwe are without them. There is no question about that. But I regret \nenormously that it is somehow their judgment that it is better off for \nthe children to be in that position where we are just going to have \nthese open-ended lawsuits without any incentive whatsoever to try to \nget the companies to become part of the process.\n  There is no guarantee they will. There is no guarantee that they \nwill. We may well pass this legislation in its current form, and a lot \nof those companies will say, ``We still think it is too punitive. We \ndon't want the look-back provisions. We're still going to challenge.'' \nThis bill does not disadvantage us one iota with respect to that \nchoice, because we have a two-part structure where, if they don't agree \nto participate in giving up their constitutional rights, in setting up \nthe document depository, in being part of the look-back provision, then \nthey can be sued under this bill in the very form that the Senator from \nNew Hampshire is seeking. No loss, no setback, nothing.\n\n  The choice here is between whether you are going to go with the \nstatus quo\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\nor you are going to hold out some hope that you are going to invite the \ntobacco companies to be part of a process of giving up what nobody will \nsuggest under the law they could give up otherwise.\n  The Senator from Utah is one of our strongest experts on the law in \nthe Senate, and he knows full well how the look-back provisions may be \nchallenged. He knows full well how these constitutional rights cannot \nbe given up except by consent. You can't restrict some of the \nadvertising we seek to restrict unless the tobacco companies sign the \nprotocol. Unless you are willing to say to them something that invites \nthem in, they are not going to sign a protocol, and there is no \nguarantee they will sign it even if you say that.\n  So I think the choice for the U.S. Senate is very, very clear, and I \nhope colleagues will vote for common sense and not for the sense that \nthe status quo is somehow going to serve the interests of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank you. I rise to oppose this \namendment. This amendment strikes the so-called ``immunity\" provisions \nof the floor vehicle.\n  First, let me say that there are no immunity provisions in the \nunderlying bill. The traditional definition of the word ``immunity'' \nis: Being in a state ``free or exempt'' from disease or taxes or civil \nliability or the like. Under this definition, there is no immunity in \nthe Commerce Committee bill or in the amendment that Senator Feinstein \nand I have developed.\n  The tobacco companies are not exempt from anything. They will be and \nare accountable for their actions.\n  There are, however, in these bills limitations on liability \nprocedures, but these should not be confused with immunity. Under the \nunderlying bill, suits may still be brought. The tobacco companies \ncould still face a multiplicity of suits for civil liability and \npossible criminal proceedings. This is not immunity by any stretch of \nthe imagination. Indeed, when you are required to fork over a \nstaggering $516 billion as the floor vehicle requires--which is really \nover $860 billion according to some estimates--you are not getting a \nfree ride.\n  If this is really immunity, do you think a bipartisan group of 40 \nStates' attorneys general and some of the leading plaintiffs' attorneys \nin this country who have been suing the tobacco industry for several \nyears would have backed the June 20 settlement? Of course they \nwouldn't. It contained, justifiably, in my mind, limited liability \nprovisions broader than the Commerce Committee bill, including a \nlimitation on punitive damages for past bad behavior by the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  I am talking about some of the leading plaintiffs' lawyers in the \ncountry-- men like Wendell Gauthier, Stan Chesley, John Climaco, Jim \nParkinson, Ken Carter, John Coale, Bob Redfearn, and Don Hildry --I \nhate to leave any names out because there are literally dozens of them. \nI am talking about people who have pursued to the full limits of the \nlaw the asbestos industry, the Dow Chemical Bhopal disaster, the Dalkon \nShield, and the breast implant manufacturers, and virtually every other \nplaintiffs' litigation that has taken place over the last 25 years.\n\n  And where would we be had these plaintiffs' lawyers not brought these \nsuits? The States themselves are represented by very capable attorneys, \nattorneys general like Gail Norton of Colorado, Christine Gregoire of \nWashington, Jan Graham from my own home State of Utah, and Mike Moore \nof Mississippi, all of whom have worked very closely with me on this \nmatter.\n  We are talking about top people here, tough-minded public servants. \nAnd the States also met the armies of litigators employed by the \ntobacco industry by contracting with their own legal experts on the \npart of the States.\n  Dick Scruggs from Mississippi has been in this from the start on \nbehalf of Mississippi and other States. Professor Lawrence Tribe of \nHarvard has been hired by Massachusetts and other States.\n  So we are not talking about a bunch of pushovers here who will lay \ndown in front of the big tobacco bulldozer. These top lawyers all knew \nthey were fighting an uphill battle. And to date, there has never been \na penny paid to a litigant in this country due to a jury award. In \nfact, there has only been one jury award to plaintiffs in the history \nof the country, I believe for $750,000, and it will be 10 years before \nthat is paid, if it is paid at all.\n  I have been following tobacco litigation since my early days as a \ntrial lawyer in Pittsburgh, PA, when I watched one of the greatest \ntrial lawyers in the country, Jimmy McCardle of the law firm of \nMcArdle, Harrington, Feeney, and McLaughlin on Prichard v. Liggett & \nMyers. It was a terrific battle publicized all over the world, as a \nmatter of fact. And they lost because it is so difficult to win in \nthese battles.\n  But nevertheless, once we establish this document repository, it \nshould be easier to prove cases that can go to jury and, I think, \nincrease the chances of jury awards. These top lawyers all knew that \nthis is uphill. I have to say, from the time that Jimmy McArdle, that \ngreat attorney, lost, everybody else has lost since him, except for the \none Florida case that is on appeal.\n  Why are these cases lost? Many legal observers have noted that \nAmerican juries are very reluctant to award damages in situations where \nthe complaining parties can be viewed as assuming a known risk. So we \nall have to recognize that the prevailing legal landscape has favored \nthe companies for a long time.\n  The 40 State attorneys general and dozens of expert lawyers, like the \nCastano group, did what rational people do every day in litigation in \nthis country. They proposed to resolve their claims through a \nsettlement. And they did achieve a resolution. But they have to have a \nbill passed through this Congress that is similar to what they \nnegotiated and brings the tobacco companies back on board, albeit \nscreaming, kicking, and shouting all the way.\n  They brought us a proposal that settled the suits and involved \nmassive payments and a brand new regulatory regime in return for some \nlimited liability restrictions. These restrictions will provide an \norderly mechanism for compensation payoffs and will provide the \ncompanies with financial certainty.\n  That is exactly what this legislation should do. The bill we adopt \nshould help resolve these claims and do so in a manner that is in the \nbest interests of the health of the American people.\n  So not only do I oppose amendments like these, but I think the most \neffective way to go about this legislation is to devise liability \nprovisions that address the concerns of plaintiffs in a reasonable \nfashion.\n  When we consider this legislation, let us keep in mind that some 40 \nState attorneys general and some of the leading plaintiffs' lawyers in \nthis country have already reached judgment that a fair and rational way \nto proceed, the best way to proceed, is to effectuate a national \nsettlement of these claims.\n\n  Every day in our country lawsuits are settled by negotiating mutually \nagreeable resolutions that usually involve payments of money and with \nagreements to change certain behaviors. And that is exactly the theory \nbehind the June 20 proposal and, I might add, the Hatch-Feinstein \nsubstitute amendment that we probably will bring up before this is \nover. So in one sense the June 20 proposal and our substitute amendment \nare typical.\n  Of course, what makes this June 20 proposal and our bill atypical is \nthis approach represents the largest settlement proposal in the history \nof the world; requires the largest payment of punitive damages in the \nhistory of the world; contains unprecedented regulatory authority over \ntobacco products; and, provides for a broad array of public health \nprograms, including public education, tobacco cessation, and counter \nadvertising, that is, if the tobacco companies come back on board.\n  If they do not come back on board, many important restrictions are \nnot going to happen and we will be immersed and mired in litigation for \na long time, maybe 10 years. And then the bill on the floor, if that is \nthe way it comes out, will likely fail dramatically as an \nunconstitutional piece of legislation.\n  But if we adopt this settlement approach and can drag the companies \nback on board, we can achieve advertising and look-back penalties far \nbeyond what the Constitution would allow because we would have a \nconsent decrees\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\nand protocol contracts where the companies would voluntarily agree to \nwaive certain rights. But to get them to do that, there has to be some \nincentive for them to do that, and that is some reasonable limited \nliability provisions.\n  Immunity has nothing to do with it. It is limited liability we are \ntalking about here.\n  To just give one example, we currently have an FDA rule that is tied \nup in the courts. This rule bans tobacco billboard advertising within \n1,000 feet from public schools.\n  The Judiciary Committee heard first amendment experts like Floyd \nAbrams tell us this rule cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. But \nif we adopt a bill that contains liability provisions based on the June \n20th settlement model that can bring back the companies, kicking and \nscreaming all the way, we can achieve a total ban on all outdoor \nbillboards.\n  This bill on the floor will not do that. But I believe before this \nbattle is finished the final bill will accomplish that, or we just will \nnot achieve as much public health protections as we can here.\n  So while the FDA rule wends its way through courts--and I think there \nis good reason to believe it will fail--today in Florida and \nMississippi, through the settlement limited liability approach, there \nare no tobacco billboards in those States; and soon there will be no \nbillboards in Minnesota because the companies have agreed to stop this \nadvertising. Without reasonable liability limitations, there is no \nreason for them to just cave in and agree on these matters.\n  So there are good public policy reasons to oppose this so-called \nimmunity amendment and favor legislation that, like mine, contains the \nliability limits modeled on the June 20 agreement.\n  Now, while I respect Drs. Koop and Kessler--I had a lot to do with \nboth of them obtaining their Federal appointments that vaulted them to \nsuch prominence--I respect them to a large degree when they are \ncommenting on public health matters within their expertise, when it \ncomes to matters touching on the civil litigation system, I have to \nrely on the judgment of experts in the field, including 40 State \nattorneys general and the leading plaintiffs' lawyers in this country. \nAs you would not go to a doctor to fix your car, so you would not go to \na doctor for a legal opinion.\n  I might also add that I have tried some of these cases, too, in the \npast, not tobacco cases but difficult, contentious litigation. And I \nthink I do know what I am talking about. And I do believe that I would \nlike to see Drs. Koop and Kessler limit themselves to their expertise \nand not try to intrude into matters that literally they do not fully \nunderstand. As a matter of fact, in many respects they are gumming up \nany possibility of getting all these public health moneys that will \nhelp us solve some of these problems.\n\n  To be fair, although I do not favor the underlying bill, I have to \noppose this amendment. I appreciate our distinguished friend, the \nSenator from New Hampshire. There is no question he is thoughtful, very \ndecent and a good Senator. I have a tremendous amount of respect for \nhim. I just happen to disagree with him on this matter.\n  And to be fair, although I do not favor the underlying bill, I have \nto oppose this amendment as well. There is simply nothing in the bill \nthat would prohibit an individual from bringing suit against tobacco \ncompanies. There is nothing in this bill that would even reduce the \namount litigants can be awarded.\n  All that is in the bill is an $8 billion yearly cap on the amount of \ndamages that have been awarded. If the awards amount to over $8 \nbillion, the amount will be paid in succeeding years. So there is \nreally no limitation on liability other than that $8 billion cap. And I \nhave to tell you, that is not enough to get the companies back to the \ntable or to get the companies back to voluntarily agreeing to have \nadvertising restrictions and look-back provisions that work.\n  In testimony before the Judiciary Committee, while defending the \nliability provisions of the June 20 settlement--which were even \njustifiably broader than the cap in the floor vehicle--Laurence H. \nTribe, Tyler Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, demonstrated that \nliability limitations provisions are legal, constitutional, and not \nunique. As to his constitutional argument, he correctly asserts that \nthe 1978 Duke Power Supreme Court case, allows Congress to alter common \nlaw rights such as the granting of punitive damages, and the capping of \ndamages.\n  He also pointed out that there are a slew of federal statutes that \ngrant limited liability to different industries and entities. The \nproponents of this amendment who say that no industry has ever received \nsome liability limitations are just wrong. One example of a federal \nliability limitation is contained in the Price Anderson Act, which \nplaces a $560 million cap on compensatory damages in suits against the \nnuclear industry. The purpose of this cap is to create an incentive for \nthe development of nuclear energy.\n  Another example is the Federal Credit Union Act, which limits damages \nfor lost profits and pain and suffering for losses resulting in the \nliquidation of federal credit unions. Other examples include the Black \nLung benefits program, the National Swine Flu Immunization program, the \nNational Vaccine program, and certain provisions of both the Federal \nEmployers Liability Act and the Jones Act. That is just mentioning a \nfew.\n  I wish that the liability provisions in the underlying bill mirrored \nthe liability provisions in my bill--which is modeled on those in the \nfreely-bargained for June 20 settlement. Without those liability \nprovisions which were gained through tough negotiations between 40 \nstate attorney generals and the leading trial lawyers and agreed to by \nthe industry, the industry will not participate to the fullest extent \npossible in any tobacco bill program.\n  So I must oppose both this amendment and the underlying bill because \nI think that the bi-partisan group of 40 state attorneys general and \nthe leading trial lawyers in this country got it right the first time.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and reject the Commerce \nCommittee bill.\n  What we should do is pass legislation that closely models the \nsettlement proposal brought to us last year by the 40 state attorney \ngenerals and the leading plaintiffs' lawyers in this country.\n  Having said all that, let me just conclude with these thoughts: There \nis no doubt in my mind the only way this is ever going to work without \n10 years of litigation--and 10 million more kids unnecessarily put at \ngreater risk--and a decision by the courts that the bill that is \ncurrently being argued on the floor is unconstitutional, is to get back \nto as close to the attorneys general agreement as we can. Yes, we can \nadd some money to that agreement. It can be higher than the $368.5 \nbillion, but it should be a reasonable amount that gets the companies \nback on board.\n  There is no guarantee by anybody that the companies are going to come \nback on board, but I think there is a pretty good guarantee they won't \ncome back on board under the financial and other requirements of this \nparticular bill, or without the incentive of having some reasonable \nform of limited liability.\n  If we can't do these things in a fair and reasonable manner, then why \nin the world should the tobacco companies come back and voluntarily \nagree to pay what really involves hundreds of billions of dollars, and \nwithout some protections for them with regard to future class action \nsuits?\n  The industry has agreed that individual suits can be brought and \nbrought with the aid of a document repository. With all the documents, \nit seems to me it would be easier to bring those individual suits. It \nwould be easier to recover, and in my opinion, you don't need the \npunitive damages, because you will have a right to compensatory damages \nwhich is everything that you can possibly argue before a jury except \npunitive damages.\n  I have to say, as a former trial lawyer, I never needed punitive \ndamages to get high verdicts in the cases I tried, and I don't think \nthese plaintiffs' lawyers that we know today who will handle the bulk \nof the cases in the future will have any difficulties handling \ncompensatory damages and getting very adequate awards for their clients \nfrom here on in. Unlike Jimmy McArdle, who had the world to fight as \nthe first litigant attorney in Prichard\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\nv. Liggett & Myers in the early 1960s, attorneys today will have \neverything going for them because of the tobacco settlement.\n  This law will work if we do this right. That will be a tremendous \nchange from what poor Jimmy McArdle had to go through in the early days \nof Prichard v. Liggett & Myers. I remember that case. I was watching it \nclosely. I was hoping he would win. I felt there was little likelihood \nhe would win in Pennsylvania at that particular time because we didn't \nknow then what we know today about the tobacco companies, about this \nindustry and about what this industry has done to entice children to \nuse their products.\n  I just have to tell you, if we keep doing what we are doing here on \nthe floor, we will have millions more children exposed to a greater \nrisk than they should and be exposed to during the course of the new \nlitigation which could last for 10 years or so. Some of these children \nwill ultimately die prematurely because of this increased risk as this \nlitigation proceeds.\n  What is really unfortunate is that at the end of that litigation you \nwill find that if this bill passes--the managers' amendment in its \ncurrent form--the tobacco companies will likely prevail on a number of \nimportant matters. Then, where are we?\n  That means we would have let the American people down by passing \nlegislation that will not work. And in the end, we would have done a \nlot of unnecessary harm to millions of children, and we will only have \nto start all over again, and we may not have a group of tobacco \ncompanies willing to deal at that time as they have with the attorneys \ngeneral and plaintiffs' lawyers as we had under the June 20th proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. It would be my intention to respond to a number of points \nmade by the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Massachusetts. I see \nthe Senators from Nebraska and Minnesota are here. I know they have \nbeen waiting, so I will wait for my response.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5247-7", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF DAVID R.

I shall be very, very brief--\nuncharacteristically brief. I see the Presiding Officer smiling.\n  Minnesota is a State that has played a very central role in this \ndebate about tobacco. I think if there is one thing that has come out \nof the litigation, the whole case against tobacco with Minnesota \nleading the way, Attorney General Humphrey and others, it is this: \nMinnesota unearthed a lot of documents, around 36,000 documents, and \nmany of the documents have been referred to in the debates on the floor \nof the Senate. The one thing that you see over and over again is a \npattern of lying. It is just a pattern of outright lying on the part of \nthis industry. Mr. President, I don't believe that an industry that has \nwalked away from an agreement, which has really willfully targeted our \nchildren, has really caused a tremendous amount of pain among children \nand their families, has really brought about the addiction of children \nand too many citizens dying an early death, deserves any immunity at \nall.\n\n  We should not give this industry any special deal. We don't in other \ncases. I don't think this industry should get immunity. I fully support \nthis amendment. It is as simple as that. I see nothing in what this \nindustry has done over many, many years--the way in which this industry \nhas conducted itself, the way in which this industry has blatantly lied \nto people in this country, or, for that matter, the way this industry \nhas related to what is going on here in the Senate--that would lead me \nto the conclusion that they deserve a special deal. I don't think \npeople in the country think they deserve any special deal.\n  Therefore, this amendment is extremely important. I hope colleagues \nwill support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5269-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JAMES C.

Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to \nLuxembourg. I have talked about Mr. Hormel's qualifications before, so \nI need not repeat that.\n  We are talking about someone who is a loving and devoted father and \ngrandfather, an accomplished businessman, dean of students at the \nUniversity of Chicago Law School, on the board of directors of all \nsorts of organizations, from the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce to \nSwarthmore College--you name it.\n  One of my colleagues--and I think it is extremely unfortunate--has \ncompared Mr. Hormel, a highly qualified public servant and nominee, to \nMr. David Duke who, among other credentials, is a former grand wizard \nof the Ku Klux Klan, founded the National Association for the \nAdvancement of White People, and claimed that the ``Holocaust is \nprimarily a historical hoax and not against Jews but perpetuated on \nChristians by Jews.''\n  Mr. James Hormel has been compared with this man, David Duke. I want \nto say to my colleagues that, given this kind of statement made \npublicly by a U.S. Senator, this kind of character assassination, it is \nmore important now than ever that this man, Mr. Hormel, be allowed to \nhave his day in the court of the U.S. Senate. There is overwhelming \nsupport for his nomination. He should be brought to the floor of the \nSenate, and we should have an up-or-down vote.\n  I want to just announce my intention to colleagues that when we come \nback, I will have sense-of-the-Senate amendments that the majority \nleader should bring this nomination to the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nWhen colleagues start making comparisons to David Duke to someone who \nhas been such a sensitive, good public servant, that man or that \nwoman--in this particular case, Mr. James Hormel--deserves, out of a \nsense of decency and fairness, to have his case brought before the U.S. \nSenate.

The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2434\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, there are an awful lot of us who are now, \nas we head through the deliberation of this bill and the various \namendments being offered--and, to be clear, I voted, on the budget \nresolution, in favor of the amendment being offered now by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. I will disclose, though, that I do not know how I \nam going to vote on the same amendment because I want to get a bill. I \nwant the fine work that Senator McCain and the Commerce Committee have \ndone to yield a piece of legislation that the President can sign. I \nthink it is terribly important. There are parts of this bill, on the \nother hand, that give me a considerable amount of concern.\n  First of all, I hope that at some point I can have this discussion in \nthe presence of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who \nunderstands these issues very, very well.\n  First of all, I would like to talk about how we got to where we are \ntoday. The whole thing began back in 1996. There were a lot of \ndiscussions between the attorneys general, led by Michael Moore from \nthe State of Mississippi. A settlement ensued as a result of one \ncompany, Liggett, disclosing information. This accelerated rapidly, and \non the June 20, 1997, an agreement was reached. An agreement was \nreached between the tobacco companies and 40 States' attorneys general, \nand the settlement reached is very important for this debate because a \nnumber of things were in that settlement.\n  First of all, there was a stipulation. The tobacco industry has said \nthat nicotine is addictive. I know a bit about addiction. I was a \nUniversity of Nebraska graduate of the College of Pharmacy. I practiced \npharmacy for a while. I remember in 1965 waiting in a Lincoln pharmacy \nfor the opportunity to have my character molded by the U.S. Navy, \nhaving passed a physical examination provided by my Government. I was \npracticing pharmacy.\n  Remember, there was a great debate going on at that time in this \ncountry not just about Medicare but the regulation of drugs. At that \ntime, in 1965, the most rapidly moving pharmaceutical in our store was \na drug called Dexadrine, among other amphetamines. It is a very highly \npotent stimulant. At the time, the industry was saying it was habit \nforming, not addictive.\n  In 1965, prior to the enactment of changes in the law that increased \nthe power of the FDA--and I point out to colleagues that I believe \nperhaps the most important section of this bill is title I, which gives \nthe FDA increased authority to regulate tobacco and tobacco products. \nThe tobacco industry stipulated and agreed that nicotine is addictive \non June 27, 1997. That should not be in dispute today.\n  In 1965, Dexadrine was moving very rapidly with a powerful capacity \nto addict, and it was addicting a lot of people. We had to fill \nprescriptions for Seconal and phenobarbital just so people could get to \nsleep at night after taking this stuff. After this regulation went into \neffect, we saw a dramatic change in the accessibility to this \nparticular drug. It went from being a very highly used medication to \nwhere, today, you would be lucky to see, even in a high-volume store, \n100 Dexadrine a year. Today, it is only allowed to be used for \nnarcolepsy.\n  Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with some high \nschool students at Burke High. I talked as well to other young people \nwho are smoking. About 7 to 12 of these young people were smoking. What \nis quite apparent to me, Mr. President--and my suspicions are, though I \nhave not polled it and I don't have accurate information--my guess is \nthat most people in Nebraska, or a large percentage of people, don't \nunderstand that the landscape changed last June 20 with the tobacco \nindustry saying yes, nicotine is addictive. They don't understand what \nbeing addicted means. They don't understand that there is a physical \nneed and withdrawal symptoms associated with individuals who try to \nstop. Certainly, these young people did not understand what it means to \nbe addicted. Indeed, when I asked them if they expected to be smoking \nwhen they reached adulthood, the majority of them said no, they did not \nexpect to be--even though we now know that 90 percent of the people who \nsmoke today started smoking when they were young.\n  The fact that we now know that nicotine is addictive and the tobacco \nindustry is stipulating in their settlement that it is, it is an \nimportant and relevant fact, because what happens now is that we are \ntransformed from dealing with an issue that has to do with personal \nfreedom; we are now dealing with an issue that has to do with this \nquestion: Are we going to make an effort to save lives? In addition to \nbeing addicted, they are addicted to a substance that contains toxins, \nincluding carbon monoxide and other chemicals, which, if taken as \ndirected, will result in the premature death of 1 out 36 people who \nstart smoking, as well as all kinds of other health problems associated \nwith tobacco.\n  So I want to begin, as I evaluate--and all colleagues should--whether \nto vote for the McCain bill, to understand that the industry agreed to \nthe FDA regulation on June 27, 1997, as a consequence of the effort of \nMichael Moore and 39 other State attorneys general, and a settlement \nwas reached. What the Commerce Committee has done is report out almost \neverything that was in that settlement. The tobacco industry agreed to \npay $15 billion a year. Indeed, they agreed to pay $50 billion in \npunitive damages.\n  At the time, I remember in the aftermath of the settlement--and it \nseems like a hundred years ago, but it was less than a year ago--the \nbig debate was: Would that $50 billion be tax deductible? Would the \ncompanies be able to deduct it from their income? Or would it have to \nbe a post-tax payment? But it is $50 billion in punitive damages. They \nagreed to pay $15 billion more. What Senator McCain and the Commerce \nCommittee have done is say, since that time, a number of things have \nhappened. We had a settlement in Texas, a settlement in Florida, and, \nmost important, a settlement in Minnesota, which has the tobacco \nindustry not only stipulating everything they did before, but releasing \nsome 36,000 documents, most of which are still unread, my guess is, by \nmost Members of Congress--certainly me. But just reinforcing for our \ncitizens the idea, yes, I knew it was addictive; and, yes, I've been \ntargeting your kids; and, yes, I've been doing some other things to try \nto increase sales, even though I understand that it is a terribly big \npublic health problem.\n\n  The Commerce Committee has said we now have them agreeing to a 10-\npercent increase in Minnesota, and, instead of $15 billion, we are \ngoing to ramp it up to $23 billion a year. When we talk to citizens at \nhome, please don't leave a citizen in your State with the illusion that \nsomehow Congress or the Commerce Committee on their own came up with \nthis number. This was agreed to by the tobacco industry on June 20, \n1997. And, after the settlement in Minnesota, it seems to me the \nCommerce Committee is well within reason to say that instead of $15 \nbillion it ought to be $23 billion. That is where we are.\n  Mr. President, the next thing I have to ask is, What are we going to \ndo with it? What is the purpose? Where are we going? What is the idea \nthat is most important with this legislation? For me, the most \nimportant idea--it may be different for others--is I want to save \nlives. I think that is what we are talking about. One out of three who \nstart smoking dies prematurely. In Nebraska, $250 million is spent just \non cigarettes; 100 million packs of cigarettes are sold every single \nyear in Nebraska. I want to decrease the number of people who are \nbuying cigarettes. If I can get 50,000 of the 350,000 Nebraskans who \nsmoke, if I can help them stop smoking, not only do I save the lives, I \nsave the money.\n  All of this conversation about a tax increase and being concerned \nabout low-income Americans and the taxes they are going to be paying, \nif they would do this bill right, we would help people stop smoking and \nreduce their out-of-pocket spending for tobacco, not to mention the \nout-of-pocket spending for health care, the out-of-pocket spending that \noccurs as a result of not\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n\nbeing able to go to work, and the out-of-pocket spending for some other \nthings.\n  I ask Members: Have you ever talked to anybody who has been able, \nafter a long period of time, to quit smoking how they feel? Are they \nhappy? Are they glad? The answer is always yes. They can do more. They \nand their kids are enjoying life better. They feel healthier. They have \nmore money in their pocket as a consequence of not having the addiction \nas a part of their life. They do not say, ``Gee, I am mad at you \nbecause you helped me stop smoking.'' They are glad.\n  This piece of legislation, as far as I see it, that we are debating \nright now is an opportunity for me to go home and say, ``We are going \nto try to save lives, not just to try to prevent young people from \nsmoking''--we have about 30,000 people in Nebraska who are underage who \nare smoking cigarettes--but also to go to the adults, the 350,000 \nadults who are buying 100 million packs of cigarettes a year, and help \nthem stop smoking, to save their lives, to decrease their out-of-pocket \nspending for tobacco, and to give them a shot at the American dream--at \nleast connected with tobacco--and able to say, ``I am healthier and, as \na consequence of being healthier, happier as well.''\n  There are two provisions of this bill--I don't know if the Senator \nfrom Arizona wants to respond to any of them or not--that concern me. \nThe first is the provision for the tobacco farmers. I will wait until \nmy friend from Kentucky comes down to the floor. I will have a chance. \nThe Senator from Indiana has an amendment down there.\n  First of all, I want to say that without the Senator from Kentucky \nand the Senator from South Carolina, there would be no provisions in \nhere for tobacco farmers. I agree with them; there need to be some \nprovisions for tobacco farmers to help them as we move from the old \nera, when we were neutral as to the health impact of this naturally \ngrown product, to a point where we now say we want to help people stop \nsmoking because it is killing them, it is ruining their lives and \nruining their health. As we go from that point, it seems to me \nreasonable that we ought to have some transition payments for Americans \nwho earn their living by growing tobacco.\n  There are about 740,000 acres of tobacco acreage nationwide. To put \nthat in perspective, one of the reasons I am concerned about it is, in \nNebraska we have about 22.5 million acres for other crops, and 1.5 \nbillion nationwide; 740,000 acres of tobacco quota against about 1.5 \nbillion acres for all other agricultural products. Freedom to Farm, \nwhich I think we ought to pattern the tobacco language after, Freedom \nto Farm was about $36 billion total for 1.5 billion acres.\n  It seems to me we ought to be looking for some way to pattern the \ntobacco farmer portion on what we have done for other farmers in this \ncountry as we transition into an era where we say, ``You are going to \nhave the freedom to make your own decisions, plus the market will allow \nyou to decide how you are going to plant and what you are going to \nplant.'' I have a very difficult time voting for something that has $28 \nbillion for tobacco farmers when I did $36 billion for all farmers, \nincluding mine in Nebraska. We paid out at that time about 10 percent \nof the value of the crop. Ten percent of the value of the crop was one \nof the bases to come up to use for the payment.\n  I hope again I am able to work with the Senator from Kentucky, \nbecause I applaud his work, the work of the Senator from South \nCarolina, and the work of the Senators from Virginia and North \nCarolina. Lots of people have had input into this to make certain we do \nsomething to help the tobacco farmer. The question is, How much are we \ngoing to help?\n  I am troubled by that provision, I say to my friend, the chairman of \nthe committee, who is trying to figure out how to manage this across \nthe line. I hope to be constructive in getting that done. I voted \nagainst putting another 40 cents on. I will probably vote against the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire, even though I voted for it \nbefore when it was on the budget resolution, because it seems to me \nthat you have increased the cap on liability. I think it was 6.5 in the \nfirst bill. It is now $8 billion a year. That is a lot of money. We are \nnot giving the tobacco companies--I think people said we don't want to \ngive tobacco companies special treatment. They will be required under \nthis legislation to pay $23 billion a year into a tobacco trust fund. \nThat is not my idea of giving somebody in the private sector special \ntreatment. It seems to me that it is a reasonable tradeoff in order to \nbe able to fight this battle.\n  To me, the most exciting thing about this legislation, now that we \nhave the full truth about what tobacco can do, is I will be able to go \nhome and say this legislation will enable us to organize community-\nbased efforts to help not just our children keep from starting to smoke \nbut also help in my State 350,000 adults who currently smoke whose \nlives, in all likelihood, are going to be shorter and they will be less \nhealthy as a consequence.\n  That leads me to the second concern I have. Again, I have an \namendment on the tobacco farmer portion, depending on the disposition \nof the Lugar amendment, that will place a greater emphasis on \nprevention and smoking cessation. I really have come to a point now \nwhere I say what makes it work for me is to be able to go home to \nNebraska and say this bill helps save lives. That is what we are doing. \nIf I can get that done, if it enables me to save lives, it seems to me \nI have something that I can make work at home.\n  To that end, the amendment that I have prepared--and I am not going \nto lay it down right now because we have one that we are debating--\nwould take the money and, instead of ramping up from I think $15 \nbillion initially up to $23 billion a year, the breakdown is, 40 \npercent of that money goes to the States, 22 percent of that money goes \nto NIH, 22 percent of that money goes for smoking cessation, education, \nand international trafficking--to stop international trafficking--and, \nas I understand it, 16 percent I think is left that goes for tobacco \nfarmers. As I said, I think that 16 percent is too high. We have \nprepared an amendment, depending upon the disposition of the Lugar \namendment and depending upon my ability to be able to negotiate about \nthe Senators who worked hard on this provision.\n  But I believe what would also increase the likelihood of being able \nto save lives at home, being able to make this thing not just a \nsituation where, as a result of increased Federal regulation through \nFDA, as a result of the tobacco industry raising the price because of \nthe fees they will be paying into this national trust fund, another way \nto do it would be to take that 40 percent that is allocated to the \nStates and add the 6 percent that ends up being estimated for \nprevention in the third area, and consolidating all that into a block \ngrant that would go for smoking prevention and cessation, insist in the \nlanguage of the law that the Governors put together a community-based \norganization to come up with a plan to help people stop smoking and \nhave HHS approve that plan. I think it would allow us to have a steady \nstream of money that would come into each one of our States.\n  I am uncomfortable about having anybody but Members of Congress \ndeciding how money is going to be spent. I love my Governor. I love all \nGovernors. They are all great Americans. But as far as I am concerned, \nthe Constitution gives me the authority to vote to raise taxes and vote \nto spend money, and I think that is what we ought to be doing.\n  As concerned as I am about getting more money into Medicaid, the \nthing that I have to do in order to make this successful is I have to \nhave those people out there who are smoking stop smoking.\n  So I would at some point come to the floor and offer an amendment. I \nhope to have some conversations with the chairman and the ranking \nmember on this, because I think we could improve the bill substantially \nif our goal is to save lives and reduce the number of people who are \nsmoking, not just stopping young people from becoming smokers but \nhelping those who are already smoking stop in order to be able to save \ntheir lives. It seems to me we ought to consider that the funding \nlanguage in here needs to be altered and a much greater emphasis \nplaced--indeed, it ought to be the most important emphasis--on smoking \ncessation programs.\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\n  Let the Governors write a community-based plan. Make them engage the \ncommunity. It is much more likely at the local level that real answers \nare going to be found for this problem. It is not as easy as it sounds \nnot just because of addiction but because of other reasons to stop \nsmoking. I think it is much more likely they will come up with plans \nthat work.\n  Let us, as a consequence of our concern for public health, work with \nthose community groups to make certain that the money is going in that \ndirection.\n  I discussed as well with the managers creating a tobacco scholar \nthrough NIH funding for every State. I don't know about other Senators, \nbut I need a lot of help with numbers, with what the research is \nsaying. Not only do we put more money into research, but it is likely \nthat all of us are going to see State-based efforts to reduce smoking, \nand if we have to scramble around and try to figure out what the data \nis, to try to figure out what the facts are, it gets difficult to do \nit.\n  So I am here. I say to my friend from Arizona, I like what you have \ndone. You have a good bill, it seems to me, in the Chamber, one that if \nwe can get it passed, get beyond all the problems of price increases \nand concern for the poor, and so forth, I say to my friend from \nArizona, will enable you to say you have saved millions of lives as a \nconsequence of this law.\n  That will be my hope. And, indeed, I believe it is reasonable to \nassume, as I look at the language of this law, that we will as a result \nof helping people not smoke to begin with and stop smoking if they have \nmade that decision and became addicted to nicotine, their lives will be \nhappier and longer and healthier as a consequence of this legislation. \nThus, there is an urgency to do it, an urgency to make sure we don't \nmake the perfect the enemy of the good. There are lots of good \namendments coming up. I have some ideas. All of them are not going to \nbe incorporated. We still have the House to get through and the \nconference to get through. So I praise very highly the fine work the \nchairman has done on this thing, and I hope the wishes of the majority \nleader will be heard and that we are able to get this thing done before \nwe get out of here for the Memorial Day recess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his \nthoughtful and measured remarks, and I appreciate his willingness to \ncompromise, which has been a trademark of the Senator from Nebraska for \na long time.\n  I would not ask him if he felt the same way about our relations, \ncongressional relations with Governors when he was Governor of the \nState of Nebraska. I will leave that question unanswered at this time. \nBut I do again thank him for his thoughtful approach. Obviously, he has \nstudied this very complex issue and a number of his recommendations, I \nbelieve, are important and may be adopted either by agreement or in \namendment form. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, because of the schedules of Senators, it is now my \nintention to move to table the amendment sometime around 2 o'clock. A \nnumber of Senators are off the Hill and will not be back until that \ntime. Also, I understand the distinguished Democratic leader would like \nto make some remarks before the vote.\n  Mr. President, I know that the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Illinois and my friend from Texas all want to make \nremarks. But I will just take about 2 or 3 minutes to say I paid \nattention to the remarks of the Senator from Oklahoma. I appreciate \nthem. Many of them were constructive. Many of them I profoundly \ndisagree with and cannot and will not at this time respond to over an \nhour of comments and an in-depth discussion of the bill.\n  But the criticisms of the Senator from Oklahoma basically boil down \nto four fundamentals: One is a tax increase; second is big spending; \nthe third is big government; and the fourth is the argument that it \nwill not stop kids from smoking.\n  I will briefly address that in general terms and at a later time I \nwill give more specific responses to the Senator's very strong and, by \nthe way, well-meaning criticisms of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The argument that this is nothing but a tax increase would have some \nvalidity if it were not for the fact that there will be an increase in \nthe price of cigarettes even if this body and the Congress of the \nUnited States do nothing.\n  Two weeks ago, there was another settlement, the fourth made between \nthe industry and a State. It was between the industry and the State of \nMinnesota. What was the agreement? It was a $6.5 billion agreement, the \nlargest yet on a per capita basis. And guess what is the result of that \nagreement? An increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes in \nMinnesota in order to pay for the settlement.\n  I might point out that settlement was double the settlement that was \nachieved by the attorneys general with the tobacco industry last June \n20. As we see settlement after settlement after settlement, we will see \nan increase and an increase and an increase in the price of a pack of \ncigarettes. So we will either enact an increase in the price of the \npack of cigarettes, earmark it to the worthy causes, the four that we \nhave laid out, the States, public health, research, and the farmers, or \nwe will watch as State after State goes to court, achieves a settlement \nor a jury verdict, and we see the same result.\n  What is the problem with that? The only problem with that is 3,000 \nteens start smoking every day and 1,000 will die early as a result of \nhealth-related illness. So, Mr. President, if you want to call this a \nprice increase, that is fine. But if anybody in America believes there \nis not going to be a dramatic increase in the price of a pack of \ncigarettes as a result of negotiations or litigation, they simply have \nnot observed what has happened in the case of the four previous States \nin the past several months. And 36 more States, at least, are lined up \nto go to court.\n  Now, this also does touch to some degree the argument my friends have \nabout attorney's fees. The last I saw--and I don't keep close track of \nwhat happens in Florida--the plaintiff lawyers were going to get $2 \nbillion out of the settlement. I think we need to address the issue of \nlawyer's fees, but if you are worried about it, I would think you would \nthen support a comprehensive settlement as opposed to watching this go \non. It isn't just the lawyer's fees that will cost the taxpayers. It is \nthe cost of litigation, which we know is serious.\n  So if you want to call it a tax increase and quote the biggest in \nhistory, blah, blah, blah, then that is your right. But I think in all \nfairness, in all fairness, you ought to understand the consequences of \nfailure to act, which will be larger increases in the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes, larger litigation and more delay and, finally, of course, \nthe problem that we need to address and that is the issue of kids \nsmoking.\n  The second argument is that it is big spending. Let me point out that \n40 percent, the biggest chunk of this settlement, goes to States that \nhave incurred costs associated with Medicaid. That is where 40 percent \nof the money goes. And we also know that we don't know--that we don't \nknow--exactly what it is that causes kids to smoke. We have some pretty \ngood ideas. And, by the way, every single expert, including--including \nthe chief executive of Philip Morris, who, while they were negotiating \nwith the attorneys general, said, ``We all know that price rates are \nmore sensitive to kids smoking than adults.'' That makes sense, \nobviously, since kids generally don't have as much money as adults do.\n\n  But if you want to call it a big spending bill, let's look at where \nthe money is going to, and that is for research, and it is to go to \nhealth care, and it is also to go to farmers who are going to be \ndislocated by this. Remember also that much of the smoking prevention \nand cessation is in block grants so that the States will be able to do \nwhat they think is best with it.\n  Big government? This may be a big government solution. This may not \nbe the solution that I would have had envisioned nor that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts would have envisioned. This is as a direct result of \nthe agreement which was reached between the attorneys general, 40 of \nthem, and the tobacco industry, which set the stage for the fact that \nthe U.S. Congress needs to act--or at least address the\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\nissue. We may not act. We may not act. We may decide, as my friend, the \nSenator from Texas, will so eloquently argue, that we can't do this. \nBut when the stage was set with that agreement last June 20, and we \nwere going to have to act it out, what we did in the Commerce Committee \nby a 19-to-1 vote was put our imprint on it, and the benefit of our \nwisdom, our knowledge, and, frankly, that of every public health group \nin America, as well as many other organizations.\n  Finally, and I apologize to the Senator from California for taking \nthis much time, but the other is that it will not stop kids from \nsmoking. You know, I challenge anyone who says this bill will not \nreduce teenage smoking to find a single public health organization in \nAmerica, that is legitimate, that is not on the payroll of the tobacco \ncompanies, that will say that an increase in the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes, plus youth cessation programs, will not have a beneficial \neffect on this terrible problem.\n  There was a chart, the Senator from Massachusetts saw it the other \nday, of the deaths in America. The bar graph was dramatically higher, \ntobacco-related illnesses death, as opposed to drunk driving, as \nopposed to many other causes of death in America.\n  If it will not work, then are we satisfied with the status quo? Are \nwe satisfied that in America today this problem is not only real but \ngrowing? We had a Centers for Disease Control study just recently, \nteenage smoking is on the rise. Minorities in America, those teenagers \nare starting to resort more and more and more to the use of cigarettes.\n  So maybe it will not--maybe it will not stop kids from smoking. Maybe \nthis will not work. But to accept the status quo, in my view, and think \nthat just by passing a tax increase on cigarettes we will address that \nissue, will not do it. I challenge my friend from Texas, who is waiting \nto speak, I think, very soon. If the Senator from Texas can find a \nsingle public health organization in America--the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Lung Association, the Coalition for Tobacco-Free \nKids, any living--any living Surgeon General of the United States of \nAmerica, who will say to you and this body: OK, just pass a tax \nincrease, fund some tobacco cessation programs and that will do the \njob--then I think that should be an important part of this debate.\n  But the reality is, not a single one of those organizations will say \nthat anything less than a comprehensive approach to this problem will \ndo the job.\n  So I just wanted to take a few minutes to respond to the very well \nthought out and very studied and scholarly, in many cases, objections \nthat were raised by the Senator from Oklahoma. That is what this \nprocess is supposed to be all about. I appreciate his input, as I do \nthat of my dearest friend, the Senator from Texas, who has promised me, \nand I have promised him, we will remain smiling throughout this debate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nexcellent comments. I would not say anything more substantively except \nto say I think both the Senator from Arizona and I, and others involved \nin this, believe that there are a number of good suggestions that have \nbeen made. I think we laid this down with the statement this is not \nperfect in the way that no piece of legislation that comes here is \nperfect. I am confident that in the process, if we are not seeking to \nkill it, we can find a way to meld some of the good suggestions that \nare being made into both acceptable amendments and amendments which can \npass by their own weight. I hope we will do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from California be \nrecognized for 10 minutes. Following the Senator from California, the \nSenator from Texas, Senator Gramm, will be recognized--not for a \nspecific period of time--and following the Senator, the Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, would be recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I amend that by asking if Senator Hagel, the Senator from \nNebraska, could be recognized after Senator Carol Moseley-Braun?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kerry very much for his \nleadership on this issue. Senator Kerry, Senator McCain and many other \ncolleagues, including Senator Conrad and Senator Daschle, our \nDemocratic leader, have put in so much time and effort on this \nimportant issue. I extend my thanks to them.\n  Mr. President, I have not spoken yet on the floor on the subject of \ntobacco legislation. I am going to be concise. Let me tell you why. I \nam going to be concise because this not is a difficult call for me. I \nam going to support the strongest possible tobacco legislation we can \nput together. I am going to support not the weakest, but the strongest \ntobacco legislation we can put together. There are two reasons for \nthis. First, Smoking kills our people. Second, kids are the targets of \nthe tobacco companies, which is a crime against them and against all of \nus. For these two critical reasons we must act now to pass the \nstrongest tobacco legislation possible.\n  I have a couple of charts that I am going to share which I think tell \nthe story. This one says, ``Tobacco Kills and Smokers Get Hooked as \nTeenagers.'' Approximately 90 percent of adult smokers started smoking \nat or before the age of 18. When they are older, 66 percent of them \nsay, ``Oh, my God, I wish I could quit.'' We need to do something to \nhelp young people so that they are not faced with this painful, \nhorrible addiction later in life.\n  How do you do that? You don't do that by siding with the tobacco \ncompanies. You do that by siding with the public health experts in this \ncountry.\n  This chart very clearly shows how people die from tobacco. We will \nstart off with stroke deaths, 23,281. I am not going to round off these \nfigures, because each one represents a real person, your father, your \nmother, my grandmother, my grandfather, et cetera. It is all of us \nrepresented in these numbers.\n  Lung cancer, 116,920 deaths from lung cancer. 134,253 deaths from \nheart disease. Bronchitis/emphysema deaths, 14,865.\n  This many deaths occur every single year. Every single year Americans \nhave these painful, awful deaths.\n  Pneumonia, 19,173 deaths. Hypertension, 5,450 deaths. All of these \ndeaths are related to smoking. Secondhand smoke cancer deaths--how is \nthis one? These individuals don't even smoke, but they breathe it \nbecause someone they work or live with smokes and 3,000 people die \nevery year. Absolutely proven fact, secondhand smoke kills 3,000 \ninnocent people every year.\n  Other cancer deaths related, 31,402. Other cardiovascular diseases, \n16,854. Other respiratory diseases, 1,455. And how about infant \ndiseases; 1,711 infants are dying. Burn deaths, 1,362. Chronic airway \nobstructions, 48,982.\n  It adds up to 400,000 dead Americans every single year. In spite of \nthis terrible fact, some of my colleagues are standing with the tobacco \ncompanies. I am sorry--count me out of that crowd.\n  Who am I going to stand with? RJR Tobacco? Philip Morris? No. I am \ngoing to stand with Dr. Everett Koop. I am going to stand with Dr. \nDavid Kessler. I am going to stand with the medical community. I am not \ngoing to stand with the tobacco companies. I am going to stand with the \nAmerican Association of Public Health Physicians, the American Lung \nAssociation, the American Medical Student Association, the American \nMedical Women's Association, the American Patient Association, the \nAmericans For Nonsmokers' Rights, the Association of Military Surgeons \nof the United States, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the \nCenter for Women Policy Studies, the Child Welfare League of America, \nChinese American Antismoking Alliance, Citizens for a Tobacco-Free \nSociety, Interreligious Coalition on Smoking and Health, National Asian \nWomen's Coalition--the list goes on and on and on.\n\n  I am going to stand with the public health community. If my \ncolleagues want to stand with the tobacco companies, that is their free \nchoice; they are free to do it, and they are also free to explain it to \ntheir constituents.\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\n  One of the things I heard yesterday from one of our colleagues, \nSenator Ashcroft, is how horrible it is to increase the cost of a pack \nof cigarettes; isn't that terrible for poor people. The very people on \nthis floor who are complaining that we are hurting poor people were \nnever there when we passed the earned income tax credit that helped \nlift Americans out of poverty. They were never there when we raised the \nminimum wage. Now, suddenly, they are concerned. It is my opinion what \nthey are really concerned about is the tobacco companies.\n  I don't hear these same people saying, ``Well, America, if you really \nwant to put money in your pocket, you can give up smoking and pocket \nthe money from the two packs or three packs you smoke a day.'' That is \nwhat they could be saying. When they talk about the tax on cigarettes, \nI don't think they are really concerned about poor people. I think they \nare concerned about the tobacco industry.\n  What I am concerned about is not just the cost of cigarettes, not \nonly in dollars but in lives. 400,000 lives every year and 80 percent \nof them are hooked as teenagers. I am going to show you another chart.\n  This chart must look very dizzying on TV. Let me tell you what it is. \nIt is 3,000 stick figures of children. That is how many kids become new \nsmokers every single day.\n  Today, 3,000 children will start to smoke. Every third one will die \nfrom a smoking-related illness. These children are shown in the darker \nshade. Every third one will die.\n  I have seen colleagues come to the floor with charts about how with \ntobacco legislation there is going to be bureaucracy, and it is going \nto be terrible. You want to take a look at this --3,000 teenagers \nstarting to smoke every day and every third one of them will die. That \nis what is truly terrible. What is terrible is that children are \nsmoking and these children will die.\n  That is why I am standing here today. I urge my colleagues to listen \nto the arguments on the floor and remember that it all comes back to \ntwo issues: One is that every day 1,000 kids put themselves at \ncertainty of death from smoking, and in every year, 400,000 Americans \ndie and almost 90 percent of them started just like this when they were \nkids.\n  I have to tell you, passing strong tobacco legislation isn't even a \nclose call for me.\n  Under oath the tobacco companies said, ``We do not market to \nchildren.'' They said, ``Our advertising is not designed to attract \nyoung smokers.''\n  But when the lawsuits were filed against the tobacco industry, they \ncame up with all these smoking guns, if you will.\n  We have to compliment the efforts of dedicated government attorneys \nwho worked on this. I would like to extend a special thanks to Louise \nRenne, the City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco. It \nwas due to her tireless efforts of that we have many of the documents \nthat show how the tobacco industry targeted our children.\n  From a Philip Morris memo in 1981:\n\n       It is important to know as much as possible about teenage \n     smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is \n     tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming \n     majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their \n     teens . . . it is during the teenage years that initial brand \n     choice is made.\n\n  This is from a private, internal memo. And how about this:\n\n       . . . Because of our high share of market among the \n     youngest smokers, Philip Morris will suffer more than the \n     other companies from the decline in the number of teenage \n     smokers.\n\n  Philip Morris is going to suffer? Philip Morris is going to suffer if \nkids stop smoking? It is in black and white. I ask them about the \nsuffering of people who die from these diseases. Have you ever seen \nsomeone die of lung cancer? Have you ever seen someone sit near you on \na plane with oxygen going up their nose because they can't breathe? \nPhilip Morris is going to suffer? Smoking is what causes real \nsuffering.\n  I am going to stand with the public health officials. I am going to \nstand with them, and I am going to stand with them proudly. People can \ncome on this floor, and I welcome their debate, but when you cut to the \nchase, the arguments against strong tobacco legislation are same \narguments Philip Morris is making, they are the same arguments RJR is \nmaking, they are the same arguments that tobacco companies and their \nsophisticated lawyers are making. Their arguments have nothing to do \nwith the hard, cold facts that they are trying to hook our kids.\n  As Senator McCain said today, we know, we can do something about it \nand at least we know we cannot tolerate the status quo. That is what \nthis tobacco legislation is all about.\n  A draft report from RJR said:\n\n       . . . The brands which these beginning smokers accept and \n     use will become the dominant brands in [the] future. Evidence \n     is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old \n     group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR \n     [tobacco] must soon establish a successful new brand in this \n     market if our position in the industry is to be maintained \n     over the long term.\n\n  It is time that we expose this danger these companies pose to our \nchildren. It is time to end the horrific costs to our society of losing \na wife, a mother, a grandma too soon because when they were young, they \ngot hooked on tobacco; they got hooked by companies who swore to God in \nfront of this Congress that they never went after kids.\n  Why should we stand with the tobacco companies? Why should we? We \nshouldn't. We should stand with C. Everett Koop. We should stand with \nthe American Lung Association. We should stand with the people who care \nabout our children.\n  Brown and Williamson in 1973, another tobacco company said:\n\n       Kool has shown little or no growth in share of users in the \n     26 [plus] age group. Growth is from 16 to 25-year-olds . . . \n     at the present rate, a smoker in the 16 to 25-year-old age \n     group will soon be three times as important to Kool as a \n     prospect in any other broad age category.\n\n  There it is. For anyone to think that we should stand with those \ncompanies who went after our children--for anyone who thinks that is \nthe right thing to do--I guess I just don't understand their position.\n  It comes down to two things: Smoking kills and they grab our kids, \nand they grab 3,000 kids every single day, and every third one will die \nof smoking-related illness.\n  These cigarette companies even discussed adding honey to cigarettes \nso they could grab the youngsters. Here is that quote. A 1972 Brown and \nWilliamson document states:\n\n       It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. \n     Honey might be considered.\n\n  We have to do something. We should pass the strongest possible \ntobacco bill.\n  One successful way to reach the children is through education, and \none proven success is to make sure that in after-school programs, our \nkids are taught about the dangers of drugs, alcohol and smoking. It \nworks.\n  I am working on an amendment to make sure that when we support \ntobacco cessation programs, we do not disqualify after school programs. \nI am excited to say that it looks like that amendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague is ready to attack on his \npoint of view, and I am going to yield. If I might have 20 seconds?\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the distinguished Senator from California needs a \ncouple more minutes, I have no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. If I could finish in about 60 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from California have 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I will not be using that much time, \nI say to my friend. So I urge him to just stay on the floor.\n  I do not have complicated reasons for supporting the strongest \npossible legislation. It is simply about life and death. And it is very \nobvious to me that by passing comprehensive, tough legislation, we have \na chance to stop kids from smoking and to stop the deaths and turn \nthese awful statistics around. We have what may be a once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to do it. I hope we are going to do it.\n  Not every amendment that I vote for is going to be in the final \npackage. I understand that. But I am going to support the toughest bill \npossible. I am going to offer an amendment to make sure that we support \nafter school programs to educate our children against the problems of \nsmoking. There are many effective after school programs\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\nthat teach kids about tobacco in a very straightforward, good way so \nthat they resist the temptation and peer pressure to smoke.\n  So I am glad to stand with my friends in the Senate who look at this \nas an opportunity to stop deaths, to stop the targeting of our \nchildren. And I am very hopeful, Mr. President, that we will, in fact, \nend up with a strong piece of anti-tobacco legislation.\n  Thank you very much, I say to my colleague from Texas, for his \ngenerous spirit. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say if we pass this bill I \nhope that we will be successful in inducing not only teenagers but \nother Americans to come to their senses and to stop smoking.\n  Once in my life I was an economist. And any economist will tell you, \nother things being the same, at a higher price people will consume less \nof a given product. The problem, of course, in the real world is \ngenerally other things are not the same.\n  A concern I have raised that has not been dealt with is that no \ncountry in the history of the world, so far as I am aware, has ever \nimposed a tax at the level we are debating here and not had a black \nmarket for cigarettes develop.\n  In Britain, 50 percent of cigarettes are sold on the black market. In \nItaly it is 20 percent. Canada raised cigarette taxes to try to induce \nteenagers to stop smoking, but then their country was inundated with \nillegal cigarettes. The effect was to actually lower the price of \ncigarettes bought on the black market. Canada, in an extraordinary \naction, actually repealed the tax increase. And the minister of health \nsaid that by repealing the tax increase, and thereby forcing teenagers \nto attempt to buy cigarettes through legal channels they would reduce \nteen smoking. By limiting the economic foundation of the black market, \nthey might be more successful in reducing teen smoking.\n  I am hopeful that, if in fact we raise taxes to the degree we are \ntalking about, something good will come from it. Obviously, inducing \nteenagers to smoke less would certainly be a good thing.\n  The issue I want to address today, and the issue that I hope we will \nvote on before we go home for the recess, is the issue of what we are \ngoing to do with this money. We can debate endlessly what the tax \nincrease is going to do and what it is not going to do. I am still very \nmuch troubled by the impact of this tax increase on real people.\n\n  In listening to many of the strongest proponents of this bill, you \nget the idea they are taxing tobacco companies. That somehow we are \ngetting revenues from companies that have conspired to deceive the \npublic, that have conspired to induce teenagers to smoke. Therefore, \nnot only are we getting the good of higher prices and the impact that \nmight have on consumption, but in fact there is almost a retribution \nquality to it.\n  I guess I have to temper that with a cold recognition that in this \nbill we are not taxing tobacco companies. In fact, we have an \nextraordinary provision in this bill that makes it illegal for tobacco \ncompanies not to pass the cost increase through to consumers.\n  So except for a look-back provision, where we are actually going to \npoll teenagers, and if we find that teenage smoking has not declined, \nwe will have a look-back tax on tobacco companies and target those who \nwe find, through the poll, are the preferred brand names.\n  It is interesting, because article I of the Constitution gives \nCongress the power to impose taxes. Nowhere has it ever been \ncontemplated we would allocate that power to a pollster. And it is \nclear to anyone that provision is unconstitutional. But beyond that \nprovision every penny of taxes we impose in this bill will be paid for \nby people who consume cigarettes.\n  Now, we might wish that were not the case. I wish it were not the \ncase. But, unfortunately, that is the way the bill is written. In fact, \nas I said a moment ago, the bill is actually structured so that tobacco \ncompanies could not pay the tax if they wanted to. They are forced, by \nlaw, to pass it through to the consumer.\n  One of the things that troubles me is who this consumer is. I \nmentioned these numbers the other day, but they are relevant to the \namendment I want to talk about today. Thirty-four percent of the new \ntobacco taxes in this bill will be paid for by Americans who make less \nthan $15,000 a year. They do not own Philip Morris or any other tobacco \ncompany.\n  These people are, by the logic of this bill, victims. They have been \ninduced to smoke. They have, in the logic of this bill, become addicted \nto nicotine. And if you had to classify them into a category, it would \nbe the category of ``victim.'' And yet for people who make less than \n$15,000 a year, they are going to pay 34 percent of these taxes.\n  This is not a trivial amount of money. When you add up all the tax \nprovisions in the bill, most of the estimates tend to indicate that a \npack of cigarettes, which in my State sells for about $2, will rise in \nprice to about $4.50 to $4.75 a pack. These prices are for a $1.50 per \npack increase, which is substantially less than this bill will produce \nwhen you add up all its provisions.\n  An individual who smokes an average amount would pay $356 a year in \nnew tobacco taxes. And for a couple making less than $15,000 a year, \nthey will pay a whopping $712 in tobacco taxes from an effective \nincrease in price of $1.50 per pack. To someone making less than \n$15,000 a year, $712 a year is a lot of money.\n\n  So what concerns me, and obviously does not concern many of my \ncolleagues, is the impact of this tax on blue-collar workers. When I \nlisten to the proponents of the bill, they make two things very clear. \nThey care about driving up the price of cigarettes, and they don't care \nabout the money. In trying to respond to the fact that 70 percent of \nAmericans believe this bill is about taxes and not about smoking, over \nand over again they say, ``We want the higher tax because we want to \ndiscourage smoking, not because we want the $700 billion.''\n  Senator Gregg has an amendment pending which I do not believe will be \ntabled. I intend to vote against tabling the Gregg amendment. The Gregg \namendment says that we shouldn't be granting immunity to tobacco \ncompanies for future suits. Basically the Gregg amendment strikes the \nprovision that caps liability. I intend to vote with Senator Gregg. I \ndon't believe his amendment will be tabled.\n  When his amendment is acted on, I intend to offer an amendment that \naddresses what to do with the money. I hope my amendment will have very \nbroad-based support. I thought I would take the time now to explain it \nso that if the Gregg amendment is not tabled, and I can offer the \namendment at that point, people will know what is in dispute, and those \nwho want to come and speak on it can do so. I will offer the amendment \nfor myself and for Senator Domenici. I know he will want to come over \nat that point and speak, and I am sure many others will want to speak \nfor and against it.\n  The issue here is the following: If we pass this bill, blue-collar \nAmericans making $15,000 a year or less will pay 34 percent of the \ntaxes the bill will impose. Individuals making less than $22,000 a year \nwill pay 47 percent of the taxes that will be imposed by raising the \nprice of cigarettes. Those making less than $30,000 a year will pay a \nwhopping 59.1 cents out of every dollar of taxes collected under this \nbill. In other words, this is not a tax that is randomly distributed \namong the general population of the country. The plain truth is, with a \nfew exceptions, smoking in America today is a blue-collar phenomenon. \nThe vast majority of people in America who smoke, and therefore who \nwill pay this tax, are blue-collar workers. Almost 60 percent of this \ntax will be paid for by Americans who make less than $30,000 a year.\n  Now, this produces some extraordinary results. Were the following \nnumbers not from our own Joint Tax Committee, they would be difficult \nto believe. Let me give you just two numbers. For Americans who make \nless than $10,000 a year, the taxes embodied in this bill will raise \ntheir Federal taxes by 41.2 percent in 1999. In the year 2003, when \nthis bill is fully implemented and the tax is fully phased in, \nAmericans who make less than $10,000 a year will see their burden of \nFederal taxes rise by 44.6 percent.\n  If our objective is not the money but to get people not to smoke by \nraising the price of cigarettes, shouldn't we\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\ntake some of the money we are taking from very moderate-income \nAmericans and give it back to them by cutting other taxes? Couldn't we \nfind a tax cut that would apply to moderate-income Americans so that we \nwouldn't be lowering the real standard of living for people who are the \nvictims of cigarettes by having become addicted to smoking and to \nnicotine?\n  If a motion to table the Gregg amendment fails, I will offer an \namendment with Senator Domenici. This amendment aims to take roughly $1 \nout of every $3 collected in these cigarette taxes and give it back to \nAmericans with family incomes of less than $50,000 a year. We do it by \nrepealing a provision of the Tax Code that is generally known as the \nmarriage penalty. Let me basically explain how the marriage penalty \nworks, what our amendment will do, and then wrap up. I see other \ncolleagues are here to speak.\n  Under the existing Tax Code, we have an incredibly destructive \nprovision that actually says when two young people meet, fall in love \nand get married, if they both work outside the home, they actually have \nto pay more taxes as a married couple than they would have to pay if \nthey were single. Under our Tax Code, that average marriage penalty is \nabout $1,400 a year. Now, I think I speak for many people who are \nmarried in saying that my wife is easily worth $1,400 a year. I would \ngladly pay that price and more for the privilege of being married, but \nI don't think the Federal Government should get that money. Maybe my \nwife should get that money. Also, I don't understand discouraging the \ncreation of families when families are the most powerful instruments \nfor human happiness and progress that have ever been created.\n\n  Let me remind my colleagues, if anyone has followed this debate, they \nknow that everyone who has spoken in favor of this bill has said the \nmoney is incidental; that this is not about the money, they just want \nto raise the price of cigarettes. I will offer this amendment with \nSenator Domenici to help them fulfill that commitment and prove that is \nwhat they want. So our amendment is a very targeted tax cut that takes \nroughly $1 out of every $3 raised by this tax and gives it back to \nAmericans with family incomes of less than $50,000 a year.\n  Here is how our bill will work. It will target families that make \nless than $50,000 a year. Right now, a married couple filing a joint \nreturn can earn $6,900 before they have to start paying Federal income \ntaxes. If they filed separately and they weren't married, they could \njointly earn $10,200 a year. If you wanted to state it dramatically, \nyou could say that if they live in sin they can earn $10,200 without \nhaving to pay any income taxes, but if they get married they have to \nstart paying income taxes after they earn $6,900. Now, almost everyone \nrealizes this is a destructive tax policy, but we haven't been able to \nfix it.\n  What the amendment that I will offer for myself and for Senator \nDomenici will do is: for those who make less than $50,000 a year as a \nfamily income, we will give them an additional deduction of $3,300 a \nyear. They will pay the same taxes whether they get married or whether \nthey don't. The net result is a substantial tax cut for moderate-income \nworking families. We will adjust this for inflation to assure that we \npreserve the real value of this deduction.\n  Finally, we apply it to the earned-income tax credit. As almost \neverybody here knows, if you work and you make modest incomes, you can \nget an earned-income tax credit. What we will do in our amendment is \nallow the marriage penalty in tax terms to apply above the line so that \na working couple, a very-modest-income working couple, can deduct this \ncorrection for the marriage penalty before they calculate their \neligibility for the earned-income tax credit.\n  Among the largest beneficiaries of the amendment that Senator \nDomenici and I will offer will be very modest income, blue-collar \nworkers earning very low wages. What we will do is allow this deduction \nto apply to the earned-income tax credit.\n  If our amendment is adopted, roughly one-third of the tax that is \ncollected on cigarettes would be given back to the very blue-collar \nfamilies that will bear the largest burden of taxation as a result of \ntaxing cigarettes. Some couples will pay $712 a year in new cigarette \ntaxes under this bill.\n  Under our amendment, the price of cigarettes would still go up as \nmandated by the underlying bill. To the degree that people respond to \nthe higher price, we will have the impact of that rise in the price of \ncigarettes, but we will not be making modest-income workers poorer by \nthe amount of the tax because we will take $1 out of every $3 of the \ntax and give it back to the very same families by repealing the \nmarriage penalty for middle and moderate income couples.\n  Now, why is that important? It is important because the very people \nwho are going to be hurt the most by this tax are moderate income \npeople who have been victimized by tobacco companies. I am sure my \ncolleagues are having their offices flooded with letters and postcards, \nas I am, from people who are basically saying, ``I have a very modest \nincome and I smoke, don't raise my taxes; tax the cigarette \ncompanies.''\n  Well, what we are doing here in our amendment is allowing the \nincrease in the price of cigarettes therefore discouraging smoking, but \nwe are giving at least part of the money back to middle-income and \nmoderate-income families.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I think it is \nvery important that we vote on a tax cut as part of this bill before we \nadjourn. If we don't do this, we are going to have done something \nextraordinary in this bill, and I can't help but be struck by the \nparadox of it. In this bill, we are saying that people who smoke have \nbeen victimized by the tobacco companies; yet, we are turning around \nand taxing the people who smoke because the bill prohibits tobacco \ncompanies from not passing the tax through to the people who smoke.\n  So while many people view this bill as firing a shot with a tax at \nthe tobacco companies, in reality, the tax is hitting very moderate-\nincome, working Americans. It is hitting the very people who have been \nvictimized by the tobacco companies. The amendment that Senator \nDomenici and I will offer after the motion to table the Gregg amendment \nfails says, since the proponents of the tax pledge that this is not \nabout the money, that it is not the money they want, it's the higher \nprice of cigarettes, go ahead and take the tax, but, as a modest down \npayment, let's take $1 out of every $3 we collect in cigarette taxes \nand give it back to moderate- and modest-income families. Let's make it \nsubject to the earned-income tax credit so that very low-income, \nworking Americans will not be hurt as badly. If both members of the \nmarried couple smoke, they will be paying $712 a year in Federal taxes \nunder this bill. Let's eliminate the marriage penalty under the Tax \nCode for middle- and moderate-income families so that while the price \nof cigarettes goes up, they don't find themselves economically crushed \nby it. They will have an incentive to quit smoking, but at least a \nthird of the money would come back to them by eliminating a \ndiscriminatory provision in the Tax Code.\n  I would like to go further than this amendment, and we will have an \nopportunity to do that. But this is a first installment. I think it is \nvery important that we vote on this amendment before we recess, since \nit is clear that we will not finish the bill this week. I hope that my \ncolleagues will support this amendment when Senator Domenici and I \noffer it to the Gregg amendment, hopefully, immediately following the \nmotion to table the Gregg amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized for 15 minutes, to be followed by the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, may I make a unanimous consent request? I \nask unanimous consent that I might follow Senator Hagel?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nprivileged to follow the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to\n\n[[Page S5277]]\n\nshare some general thoughts with regard to S. 1415, the National \nTobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act.\n  It has been said on the floor before that the fundamental goal of the \nlegislation is to significantly reduce smoking among the Nation's \nyouth. That, of course, is a goal that I think everyone can support. I \ncertainly support it.\n  I am going to take a slightly different tack, Mr. President, because \nI am a reformed cigarette smoker. I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I \nrecently stopped smoking--successfully. And this time, for real. I \ndeveloped the habit when I was a teenager, at a time when the tobacco \ncompanies were still marketing their products as being ``safe.'' In \nfact, I am old enough to remember television commercials portraying a \n``doctor'' with the white coat on, with a stethoscope around his neck, \ntalking about how one cigarette brand was ``healthier'' for you than \nanother brand. Well, of course, we all know now that they were lying to \nus, frankly. The tobacco industry knew at the time that cigarettes are \nnot healthy, they are not safe, and that they are all addictive. \nCigarettes lead directly to a variety of cancers, emphysema, heart \ndisease, premature death and, I point out to the ladies, wrinkles on \nyour face. That is something tobacco companies have known for a long \ntime; they just did not tell us, and they were not very candid about \nit.\n  I very much wish that the measures we are discussing today had been \nin place when I was a teenager, because those measures might well have \nprevented me from starting to smoke in the first place. Since they were \nnot, I started smoking many years ago and I have struggled since to \nquit smoking. I am now winning the battle. I haven't smoked in months. \nBut I can tell you firsthand just how difficult it is to quit and stay \noff of cigarettes. It is a fact that cigarettes are addictive.\n  We all know, again, that the tobacco industry knew full well that \nonce young people started smoking, it would be very difficult for them \nto ever break the habit. Eighty-nine percent of all smokers begin \nsmoking by the time they are age 18. People tend to start young. And \neager to maintain its market, based on its own research--because they \nhad a lot of money to put into research, population studies, and the \nlike--the industry came along and specifically targeted children and \nyoung people in the hopes of creating lifelong addicts.\n  Its efforts have paid off handsomely. Today, more than 4 million \nAmerican children and teenagers, including over 180,000 Illinois \nchildren and teens, smoke cigarettes. Seventy percent of Illinois high \nschool students have tried cigarette smoking and about 35 per cent are \ncurrent smokers. Teen smoking has risen for five years in a row. And if \nnothing is done, 5 million Americans who are now children, including \nover 260,000 Illinois children, will die prematurely from tobacco-\nrelated diseases. Illinois children and teenagers currently illegally \npurchase over 12.9 million packs of cigarettes each year, resulting in \nalmost $25 million in cigarette sales.\n  This is a lot of money. That is one of the reasons this bill is so \ncontentious, because there is an awful lot of money involved in this \ndebate.\n  But tobacco products are responsible for enormous damage to all of \nour citizens, not just children. Twenty-three percent of Illinois \nadults are smokers. Smoking accounts for nearly one in five deaths in \nthe United States. It is related to over 419,000 U.S. deaths each year \nand over 19,000 deaths in Illinois--more than alcohol, car accidents, \nfires, suicides, drugs, and AIDS combined. Approximately half of all \ncontinuing smokers die prematurely from smoking. Of these, 50 percent \ndie in middle age, losing, on average, 20 to 25 years of life.\n  That is probably one of the reasons my teenage son, who is not a \nsmoker, badgered me about smoking. I mean he was just relentless. He \nwould take cigarettes and put them in the toilet so they would get wet. \nHe would hide them. He would send me pictures of diseased lungs. He \neven started sending me pictures from National Geographic of \nspectrographic outlines of nicotine, the chemical component of \nnicotine. When it is put on the spectrograph, it looks like cigarette \nsmoke. He thought this was hilarious. He was continuing to put pressure \non me, and he succeeded. In addition to the fact that he would come up \nwith all of the evidence, probably the most profound thing that he did \nwas to say to me, ``Mom, I want you to live, because I love you.'' Of \ncourse, no dollar amount can you put on that kind of motivation. In \npart, I tried to stop. I have at this point stopped because of those \nmotivations.\n  But, in addition to the terrible human costs, the American affair \nwith tobacco--as some have said on this floor, our country was built \nwith tobacco from our earliest years--has exacted an immense economic \ntoll.\n  Tobacco-related illnesses cost the United States more than $144 \nbillion a year in health care costs and lost productivity. Even though \nsmokers die younger than the average American, over the course of their \nlives, current and former smokers generate an estimated $501 billion in \nexcess health care costs.\n  So the smokers account for a large part of the tremendous cost of \nhealth care in this country as well.\n  On average, each cigarette pack sold costs Americans more than $3.90 \nin smoking-related expenses. Whatever the cost is of the cigarette that \nyou buy, the taxpayers of this great country all have to chip in to try \nto take care of people like me who got addicted by these cigarette when \nthey were teenagers.\n  We now have proof that the tobacco companies knew precisely what the \nimpact of their products would be. According to their own internal \ndocuments, these companies hid the truth regarding both the dangers \nassociated with smoking and the addictiveness of their products. They \neven went so far as to testify falsely to the Congress when questioned \non these issues for years, failing to disclose and hiding at all levels \nof industrial espionage associated with keeping the truth from the \nAmerican people. But it is out now. Everybody knows the facts \npertaining to the impact of smoking and the addictive nicotine and \ncigarettes. It is not even a debate anymore. These are true facts. They \nare indisputable facts. So the question becomes, What is it that we \npolicymakers are going to do about it?\n\n  It is time for the tobacco industry not only to be held accountable \nfor marketing a product it knew to be unsafe but to assist in the \neffort to drastically cut the number of children who become addicted to \ncigarettes. While the bill now before us is far from perfect, on \nbalance, I believe it offers us the only real chance we have to \naccomplish that goal.\n  The original Commerce-reported bill, in my view, offered too much \nliability protection for tobacco companies, and too little penalties \nfor failing to meet the legislation's targets for reducing smoking \namong our children and teenagers. I am pleased, therefore, that the \nyearly cap on surcharges for the tobacco industry for not meeting \nunderage user reduction targets has been raised to $4 billion. I also \nstrongly support the new uncapped, company-specific surcharge of $1,000 \nper underage user in excess of the yearly reduction target.\n  I particularly want to commend the negotiators for removing the grant \nof total immunity to the parent companies and affiliates of cigarette \nmanufacturers. Parent companies are where some of the most \nsignificant--and reprehensive--decisions have been made, and they are \nwhere the profits from the sales of cigarettes ultimately go. Those \ncompanies must be held accountable and under this new version of S. \n1415, they are.\n  I also think the bill's treatment of the liability cap issued has \nimproved. I remain very uncomfortable, frankly, with the provision \ncurrently in the legislation which may get amended, that caps the \namount that the industry must pay out in any given year for past, \npresent, and future damages resulting from the use of its products at \n$8 billion annually. I recognize that this cap was raised over the \nweekend from $6.5 billion, but I do not believe that the tobacco \nindustry is entitled to any cap at all. That is why I will vote in \nfavor of an amendment that will remove the that cap. because I just \nthink that people who have been harmed ought to be able to sue and to \nbe compensated. It is just that kind of basic. I don't think putting a \ncap on liability and a shield like this is good policy in this \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\n  I am very much in favor of the decision to establish a Public Health \nAccount within the unified trust fund. I believe that it is critical to \ntarget the money that the government will receive from this settlement, \nand strongly support the negotiators' decision to allocate 22 percent \nof the government's annual receipts to smoking education, prevention, \nand cessation programs as well as to counter-advertising \ninitiatives. Nothing can beat education. I think the fact that we have \ntrue facts and we have educated so many people is one of the reasons \nthere has been a change in the climate of opinion around the propriety \nand the acceptability, not to mention the dangers, of smoking.\n\n  I am also concerned, however, about the fact that this new $1.10 fee \nthat consumers will have to pay every time they buy a pack of \ncigarettes will fall mostly on moderate- and low-income Americans. That \nargument has been raised here on the floor, and it is true. Almost half \nof the tax increase--whether you call it a fee or a tax it is still \nmoney on top of the price of cigarettes. Almost half of that increased \nburden will fall on Americans who smoke and who make less than $30,000 \nannually, and 70 percent of it will fall on American smokers who make \nless than $50,000 annually. That means that smokers making $10,000 or \nless --which is really poverty in this country--annually will see their \nFederal tax burden rise by an astonishing 44 percent.\n  The sad truth is that smoking behavior, the actual cigarette smoking, \nis disproportionately concentrated among moderate- and low-income \nAmericans, and they are the ones being asked, frankly, to make the \ngreatest financial sacrifice on behalf of our children and the public \nhealth. This fact gives me real pause. Frankly, I didn't think I would \never want to support--as a matter of fact, I tend to take a position \nagainst regressive taxes of this kind. Everything that I know about \nhard-working Americans who are of marginal incomes tells me that this \ntax will be tough for them to swallow. But at the same time, the truth \nis that smoking is voluntary behavior. So it is a tax you can choose \nnot to pay--a fee you can choose not to pay--and it is precisely that \ndecision that we are trying to inspire.\n  It is also true that we do not have hard evidence that the reductions \nthat are called for in the bill, the reductions in smoking behavior by \nour children, will be guaranteed. We do not have guarantees about that. \nWe do not know for certain that price increases, advertising \nlimitations, and the other provisions of this bill will ensure without \nany doubt that children and teenagers will not smoke. Smoking rates \namong the young dropped during the 1980s, and they have climbed up \nagain during the 1990s. Frankly, there is no real explanation for these \ntrends except that it is a matter of popular behavior and kids doing as \nthey see their friends and their pals doing and role models in their \nown lives. I am hopeful that this new fee will help make smoking less \nglamorous, less appealing, and will encourage young people not to waste \nthat money on something that is ultimately hurtful to them as well as \nthe community as a whole.\n  I have used the word ``hope.'' It is used a lot in this debate. Those \nof us who support the legislation are hoping that this bill will \nmitigate and reduce teen smoking. We are hoping that it will improve \nthe public health. We are hoping it will help reduce the amount spent \non health care. And these hopes, I think, are well founded and well \nrepresented in this legislation.\n  This bill represents a huge gamble that we should and must take. \nGiven what we know about the risks and consequences of smoking, we \ncannot just sit by and do nothing; we have to act. We have to do \neverything we possibly can to discourage our young people from taking \nup this habit. We have a duty to our children, to all of our Nation's \nchildren, to do everything we can to help them stay away from the \naddictive effects of nicotine.\n  Mr. President, a strong coalition of health, public interest, and \ngovernmental organizations agrees and shares those hopes. A coalition \nof at least 48 major organizations including the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical \nAssociation, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges, and the National Association of County and \nCity Health Officials, all of these organizations support \ncomprehensive, effective tobacco control legislation.\n  Moreover, while it is impossible to be certain that maybe price \nincreases will achieve the kind of reductions in smoking by children \nthis bill sets out, the best experts in this area in terms of the \nrelationship between price and behavior, including economists from the \nUniversity of Chicago in my hometown and others in the administration, \ntell us that a quick, dramatic increase in the price of cigarettes will \nlikely result in major reductions in teen smoking. So I am hopeful that \ndespite my real concerns about the inadequacies of this bill in the \nliability area, my real concerns about the regressive nature of the tax \ninvolved, and my real concern that this bill does not ask the tobacco \ncompanies to endure the same kind of sacrifice that it imposes on their \nadult customers, I do intend to support the legislation.\n  It seems to me there is no other choice. As someone said to me--and I \ndon't know whether it has been mentioned in the debate--if it is a \ntossup between death and taxes, I will take taxes. This is a situation \nwhere the choice is pretty clear, that we have an obligation to the \npublic health and we have an obligation to our children to at least try \nto do what we can to erect barriers to the kind of destructive behavior \ncigarette smoking represents.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to reflect on some of the \ndynamics of the debate on the tobacco bill. I think it is important we \nas a body step back and focus on some of the various dynamics and the \nconsequences of what we may or may not do as this debate goes forward. \nAnd it should go forward. Nobody disagrees with trying to reduce teen \nsmoking. That is not an issue. We are all here to try to do the right \nthing. The focus on teen smoking, after all, was the core issue that \nreally began this debate more than just a year ago.\n  I do not question the motives of my colleagues on either side of this \ndebate. My colleagues on both sides of this debate are trying to do the \nright thing, trying to focus on making this a better world. I should \nalso say, in the interest of full disclosure, I do not smoke, never \nhave smoked, don't care about smoking. I think it is an unhealthy, bad \nhabit, but at the same time I think we owe this country a good, honest \ndebate about the issue from many of the dynamics, and certainly the \nconstitutional dynamic of what we are about to do or may do is \nimportant.\n  I also think it is important for us to look at some of the societal \nand cultural consequences of this debate and of what action we may \nbring in the Senate over the tobacco bill, because if we do do \nsomething, it will have an impact on society, and it will have an \nimpact far beyond just raising taxes and making government bigger, with \nmore unaccountable regulations. This will have a very significant \nimpact on our society.\n  I do fear, as I believe many of my colleagues fear, the great law of \nunintended consequences when we do not think things through very \nclearly. As we frame the debate, as we frame this issue, I fear that we \nare not including all that needs to be framed and debated here. As I \nhave listened to and observed a number of presentations, all using \nstatistics, information, and numbers, we pull them from everywhere. But \nthe fact is, we do not have good, accurate information on this issue. I \nlook at the number that is being used by almost everyone here, that \nthis bill would reduce teen smoking by 60 percent. But where do we get \nthe number? Where are we pulling our assumptions from?\n  I have here a copy of the New York Times story yesterday headlined \n``Politics of Youth Smoking Fueled by Unproven Data.'' It has some \ninteresting points. This New York Times article says, for example:\n\n       But with the Senate having begun debate on Monday on \n     tobacco legislation, many experts warn that such predictions \n     are little more than wild estimates that are raising what may \n     be unreasonable expectations for change in rates of youth \n     smoking.\n\n  Another point in this article I think is pretty important.\n\n\n[[Page S5279]]\n\n\n       Politicians and policy makers have tossed out dozens of \n     estimates about the impact of various strategies on youth \n     smoking, figures that turn out to be based on projections \n     rather than fact.\n       ``I think this whole business of trying to prevent kids \n     from smoking being the impetus behind legislation is great \n     politics,'' said Richard Kluger, the author of ``Ashes to \n     Ashes,'' a history of the United States' battle over smoking \n     and health.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       It is nonsense in terms of anything you can put numbers \n     next to.\n\n  This certainly does not minimize the seriousness of what we are \nabout. It does not minimize the seriousness of teenage smoking, again, \nif that is the focus, if that is the reason in fact we are debating \nthis.\n  Other assumptions that get thrown into this as well are somewhat \nfaulty. We know that we are today debating a massive tax and regulatory \nbill, and we tend to glide over that. I will give you some statistics \nthat actually are accurate from my State, from Illinois, Hawaii, and \nMassachusetts, four States that have raised--raised--cigarette taxes in \nrecent years, and they have all seen teen smoking increase. In 1993, \nNebraska raised the cigarette tax to 34 cents. The number of Nebraska \nteenagers who smoke increased by about 20 percent over a 3-year period.\n\n  Now, some might say, well, 34 cents is not enough; you have to raise \nit to where it really hurts. But I think we can understand and get some \nsense of focus that increasing taxes at least predominantly as the \ngreat dissuader of teenage smoking is far, far from being proven. USA \nToday had a very interesting front-page survey a couple of weeks ago in \nits newspaper, and it reported such things as, ``Only 14 percent of \nteenage smokers said higher cigarette prices would make them quit.'' \nThe same survey in the USA Today said only 12 percent believed \nrequiring a photo ID to prove they are adults when buying cigarettes \nwould make them quit.\n  Another dynamic of this debate, which again seems to get very little \nattention, is, How would this change the power of the Federal \nGovernment? Would it increase unaccountable, essential unaccountable \nFederal regulation through the Food and Drug administration? Yes. \nConsiderably. It would give the Food and Drug Administration \nunprecedented authority to regulate as yet still a legal product. Now, \nif this body really is as concerned about tobacco as we are \nrepresenting, why don't we have the guts to just step up and ban \ntobacco as an illegal drug? Why don't we do that? Why don't we be \nhonest enough about this issue to bring it down here and debate it and \nsay we are going to ban tobacco and say it is an illegal drug? Or let's \nnationalize the tobacco companies?\n\n  The point is that we are not being totally honest with what we are \ndoing. Where will the money go? The numbers float around. Is it a $565 \nbillion bill? Is it a $750 billion tax bill? Where is this? We do know \nit is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. We do know that. Where is \nthis money going to go? Where is the money going to go? Because we also \nknow that all that money, whether it is $500 billion, $600 billion, \n$800 billion, can't possibly be used for teen smoking programs. So, \ndoes that give us some impetus to tax more and to do more and, \ntherefore, find, at the end of the rainbow, a pot of gold? More \nGovernment programs, more Government, more bureaucracy, more \nregulation. I think that is an important dynamic of this debate. Higher \ntaxes, obviously. Nobody has yet denied that. Nobody has denied, yet, \nthat we are, in fact, increasing taxes. Not just increasing taxes but \nwe are really increasing taxes by a new dimension here.\n  Where does that money go? For example, we do know somewhere, in all \nthese bills out there, there is a figure we can get pretty close to \nfocusing on, that, over the next 8 years, at a minimum, we would be \nraising about $130 billion in new taxes.\n  There are some constitutional issues, believe it or not. Again, let's \nface the facts here. What we are doing here, we are expropriating a \nlegal industry. We are expropriating a legal industry for the first \ntime in the history of America. I said at the beginning of my remarks \nthat I don't smoke. No one can come to the floor of the Senate and \ndefend the tobacco companies' conduct, their behavior. It has been \noutrageous. That is not what this debate is about. Let's not get \nensnared in the underbrush of that debate. Let's be careful here how we \nframe the debate.\n  Nobody that I know of is on the floor of the Senate defending the \ntobacco companies. That is not the issue. We are defending some \nconstitutional rights here. We are defending the honesty of how we are \ngetting at this issue. Again, if we wish to take tobacco and \ncriminalize it, that is certainly an option. If we go forward and do \nwhat some in this body intend to do, and want to do, essentially \nexpropriating a legal industry, then what kind of precedent does that \nset? I think, first of all, constitutionally it would be out, but what \nkind of precedent does that set? Who is next? Caffeine? Diesel fuel? \nWho is next? That is another consequence, another dynamic of this \ndebate on which we should reflect.\n  Just one example of a constitutional question is--I think we all \nunderstand it does raise some very serious constitutional questions. \nFor example, the Federal district court in North Carolina ruled that \nthe FDA cannot restrict advertising and promotion of tobacco products. \nWe have a legal system for this. We have a legal system that works \npretty well in this country. It has worked over 200 years.\n  Again, this is not a matter of defending the tobacco companies. That \nis not what this is about. This debate, parts of it, remind me of other \ndebates we have been engaged in about the environment or religious \npersecution. I do not know one Senator who wants dirty air and dirty \nwater and a dirty environment. Nor do I know one Senator who supports \nreligious persecution. It is always a matter of how you improve it, not \neither/or. This is a good example of that kind of debate.\n  Black market--my friend from Texas talked a little bit about that an \nhour ago. It is a very, very real concern, a very real issue. For \nexample, after increasing its cigarette taxes in the late 1980s, Canada \nsaw a huge increase in the black market for cigarettes. By 1994, one-\nthird of the Canadian cigarette market was contraband. Is that where we \nare headed here? We need to talk about that. It isn't just Canada. How \nabout Sweden? Recently, Sweden lowered its cigarette tax by 27 percent \nto reduce smuggling from Denmark. England estimates it loses over $1 \nbillion in tax revenue every year because of smuggled cigarettes.\n\n  My friend from Montana, Senator Burns, tells me the biggest export in \nMontana is--wheat? No, it is contraband going to Canada, illegal \ncigarettes--another dimension of this that we need to be very seriously \nlooking at, the consequences of a well-intentioned action.\n  The State of Washington estimates that 27 percent of its cigarette \nmarket is now contraband--that is now. The State legislature moved the \nenforcement power of the cigarette tax from the State revenue \ndepartment to its liquor control board, ``whose agents carry guns and \nhave complete police powers.'' Is that a consequence we want from this?\n  Personal responsibility--my goodness, my goodness. The very \nfoundation of this Nation is rooted in personal responsibility. Where \nhas been the debate on this issue about personal responsibility? There \nwas a lot of debate about blaming everybody for one's actions. It is \nthe Army's fault. It is the Army's fault that I started smoking. It is \nthe Government's fault. It is the tobacco company's fault. It is \neverybody's fault, except mine.\n  What does that say to our young people? Why have I not heard any \nconnecting issue or debate in all the debate that has raged on so far \nabout personal responsibility--consequences for one's actions? Our \nyoung people need to understand that actions have consequences. They \nneed to understand that. Yes, we need to help them. Yes, we need to \nprotect them. But that should be part of the debate, talking about \npersonal responsibility--not that it is everybody else's fault. That is \na dynamic of this.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I will be very happy to yield when I finish. I thank the \nSenator.\n  The Federal Government, no government, can tax or regulate young \npeople's behavior. That is silly. That is complete folly. Come on. How \nmany\n\n[[Page S5280]]\n\nparents do we have in this body? How many people in this body have \ndealt with young people? I suppose everybody in this body remembers \nwhen they were 16, 17, 18--and you believe that the Government is going \nto regulate behavior and change behavior? We are going to make \neverybody's life-style healthier? That is another dynamic that has not \nbeen debated in this.\n  Ignoring other problems--isn't it interesting that the real problems \nin this country for young people, far more severe and far more \nimmediate, are with illegal drugs and underage alcohol use, but, yet, \nwe are not talking too much about those issues today. Why aren't we? \nBecause we are losing the illegal drug debate and war. More young \npeople today are on illegal drugs than before. It is a tougher issue. \nIt is everybody's concern. But we beat our breasts down here and say, \naren't we doing something great because we are going to take care of \nunderage cigarette smoking.\n  By the way, you can look at numbers and polls on this. I know they \nall have them, and I have one done by Citizens for a Sound Economy, May \n13 to 15 of this year, asking 1,200 Americans, as parents, what their \nbiggest concern for teenagers is. No. 1, illegal drug use, 39 percent; \ngangs, 16 percent; alcohol, 9 percent; tobacco use, 3 percent. Again, \ndoes this diminish the importance of this issue? No, of course not, but \nlet's have some perspective in this debate. And there are other \nproblems that young people face. We have numbers from polls and from \nvery conclusive studies that show what I am talking about.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, with a couple of final observations.\n  There is an interesting thread of arrogance that has run through this \ndebate: Government is smarter; we can tell you what to do; you really \ndon't understand the seriousness of tobacco use; you are not smart \nenough to sort it out yourself; but you see, we are in the Congress, we \nwill tell you when something is dangerous and when it isn't; you can't \nread; you don't understand, I am sorry.\n  We can have that kind of society. We can have that kind of a world. \nSome countries do. But if that is what you opt for, you will opt for \nalso giving up some personal freedom, some personal responsibility, and \nit might be a better world that way. But that is another part of this \ndebate we haven't heard enough about, and it should be part of it.\n  As I said in my earlier remarks, all my colleagues mean well. They \nare well motivated, they want to make the world better, they want to do \nthe right thing. There is no question about that. But I hope they will \nthink for a few moments about some of the issues I have raised as we \nstep back for a moment and try to put in perspective what we are doing. \nAre we really making the world better and accomplishing what we want to \naccomplish, focusing on teenage smoking, underage smoking, which, by \nthe way, there are now laws on the books to deal with? Are we making it \nbetter by putting hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes on our \npeople, building a bigger Government and more programs and more \nregulations, and then on top of that, having to deal with the \nunintended consequences of our action that will affect culture and it \nwill affect society? Those are all part of the total debate, Mr. \nPresident, that should be brought into focus.\n  I will vote against this bill, because I think it is not the right \nway to deal with some very serious problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island has the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2433\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, let me offer a few thoughts on why I \nbelieve the amendment authored by my good friend from New Hampshire, \nSenator Gregg, should be rejected.\n  Senators Tom Harkin, Bob Graham and I struggled with the liability \nissue when we were developing our own antitobacco bill, the so-called \nKIDS Act. We began our deliberations with a review of the global \nsettlement that was reached by the 40 attorneys general from the \nvarious States. In summary, we concluded that we could not support some \nof the provisions of that legislation; namely, the prohibition on class \naction suits.\n  The attorneys general agreed that no class action suits would be \npermitted and there would be a ban on punitive damages against the \nindustry. That is what the industry got out of the negotiation with the \nattorneys general, amongst other things.\n  Given the tobacco industry's behavior, how could we, the three of us \nworking on that legislation, possibly accede to tort protections that \nwould nullify entire categories of lawsuits, leaving injured parties \nhigh and dry?\n  But there were balancing factors which also had to be weighed, Mr. \nPresident. The industry's consent is terribly important to the \nimplementation of a comprehensive national tobacco policy. It is far \nbetter to have the industry at the table and agreeing.\n  Certainly, endless litigation serves no one's interests but the \nlawyers. Thus, something had to be done to create a more certain \nenvironment, both for the plaintiffs and for the tobacco companies. \nHence, we decided to include an annual liability cap in our bill of $8 \nbillion; $8 billion would be paid out each year and that was it. If \nthere were subsequent suits and judgments had been brought and earned \nprevious thereto or subsequent, they would fall in line and collect in \nthe ensuing years.\n\n[[Page S5281]]\n\n  While the structure of the cap in Senator McCain's bill is somewhat \ndifferent than the cap we had in our bill, nonetheless the intent is \nthe same. The cap in the McCain bill does not stop a single lawsuit. It \ndoesn't prevent a single lawsuit from being brought. It doesn't stop \none injured party from being able to collect. Moreover, only those \ntobacco companies that accept and abide by the terms of this bill will \nbe able to obtain the financial predictability that is provided by this \nliability cap. In other words, the company doesn't get the cap unless \nit agrees to a series of requirements upon the companies or company \nthat we believe are very important to reach a fine settlement.\n  What are some of these? What do the tobacco companies have to do to \nbe eligible for a so-called cap? It must sign a national protocol, a \nbinding consent decree to assure it will abide by all terms of the \nMcCain bill. It must agree not to delay its implementation through \nendless court challenges. These terms they must agree to, amongst other \nthings, are: They must make very steep annual payments to the Federal \nGovernment. They must meet tough annual youth smoking reduction \ntargets. In other words, there are percentages that youth smoking must \ngo down each year. The companies have to meet those requirements. It \nobviously encourages them to come forward with ingenious stop-smoking \nefforts or cease from smoking or decline from taking up smoking. They \nmust pay large fines if they fail to meet these goals.\n  What they also agree to is to fundamentally alter the way the tobacco \nproducts are manufactured and distributed, and they accept the \nregulation of tobacco products by the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration, so-called FDA.\n  If tobacco companies fail to abide by the terms of this bill, they \nare not going to be eligible for the liability cap. The liability cap \nis something that helps the companies reach some certitude of what \ntheir payments are going to have to be. But if they don't meet these \nterms, they lose the rights under the cap. If they fail to meet the \nannual youth smoking reduction targets by more than 20 percent in any \ngiven year, they lose the protection of the cap. If they are caught \nevading the antismoking provisions, they lose the protection of the \ncap. So this isn't some giveaway to the tobacco industry. It is a \nnecessary trade-off to obtain a strong national tobacco control policy.\n  At the end of the day, when all is said and done, we hope the tobacco \nindustry will return to the table and sign the consent decrees which \nwill accompany this bill. If the Gregg amendment is adopted, it \nreduces, obviously, the chances for that occurring.\n  What is the incentive for a tobacco company to come to the table if \nthey lose even this cap protection? If we all are for obtaining the \nstrongest possible antitobacco policy, then we ought to vote to table \nthis amendment; that is, the amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  President Clinton supports the cap, as do many others who want a \ntough national policy to discourage youth smoking. Giving some \npredictability to tobacco companies who are willing to change the way \nthey do business, it seems to me, is a small price to pay to get them \nat the table and participating in implementing these tough policies--\nindeed, the advertising policies to cease certain types of \nadvertisements and to enter into other kinds of advertisement directed \ntoward encouraging young people to give up smoking or to deter them \nfrom taking it up in the beginning.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe that the cap is a very worthwhile part \nof this McCain bill. And I urge my colleagues to reject the proposed \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there are few industries I consider more \nvile than the cigarette manufacturers. I believe they lied to the \nAmerican people and knowingly addicted millions to their harmful \nproduct. It is with this disgust and anger in mind that I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote against the Gregg Amendment.\n  Although at first blush it may seem the ``right'' thing to strike the \nliability cap if we want to punish the tobacco manufacturers, in effect \nwe will have done exactly what they want us to do: Kill the bill. We \nshould first ask ourselves what we are trying to accomplish with this \nlegislation: Reduce teen smoking, fund worthy tobacco-related programs \nwhile holding harmless innocent parties such as farmers. Would the \nGregg Amendment further any of those goals? No.\n  The provision stricken by this amendment does not grant immunity to \nanyone, rather it sets a yearly cap on what they will pay and allows us \nto charge fees, put in place advertising restrictions and conduct \nstrict oversight. In essence, it keeps the companies out of bankruptcy \nthereby allowing us to keep a close eye on them and force them to undo \nsome of the damage they have done. The liability cap of $8 billion per \nyear cuts off no one's rights or payments, other than for those who \nwant to settle their claims. Taking it away would likely result in many \naggrieved parties going unpaid because the companies would file for \nbankruptcy protection, effectively shutting out meritorious plaintiffs \nfrom recovery.\n  For those of my colleagues worried about the tax burden imposed by \ntobacco legislation, I would think they would all vote against this \namendment as well. If the Gregg Amendment is passed and the liability \ncap stricken, the fee would then become a pure tax and the overall tax \nburden on the American public would likely double. Here's why: The \ncurrent bill would then not settle any state lawsuits, but rather \nsimply impose a tax of at least $1.10. Because those state suites would \ncontinue, and likely be successful or settled, we should expect that \nthe states will begin to impose their own taxes on tobacco. That means \nwe see a $2-3.00 per pack increase in taxes--which is outrageous. In \nshort, if you want to do nothing but tax and spend, vote for the Gregg \nAmendment. If you actually want to try and solve some of the problem of \nreducing teen smoking you should vote against it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are engaged in a historic debate and \naction on a plant that brought death and disease to millions of people \nin this country for 300 years. The outcome of our work will determine \nwhether this nation moves to a sensible tobacco policy that will \nprevent the premature death of millions of our children or continues on \nthe path of death and disease.\n  This is truly a historic, once in a lifetime opportunity to save \nlives and protect children. When else have we had legislation before us \nthat truly could save millions of American lives? It is an opportunity \nI've been working towards since 1977 when I first introduced \nlegislation to end taxpayer subsidies to tobacco advertising.\n  The need for bold action couldn't be clearer. Today, as in any other \nday, 3,000 children in America will take up a deadly habit that will \ncut 1,000 of their lives unnecessarily short. That's more than 3 jumbo \njets full of children crashing every day. And the problem is getting \nworse. Smoking among high school seniors is at a 17-year high.\n  It is not reflected in this chart, but the CDC just reported that the \npercentage of high school students who smoke has increased from 27.5 \npercent in 1991 to 36.4 percent in 1997. They further found that a \nshocking 42.7 percent of students--and these are kids generally between \n14 and 17--used cigarettes, smokeless tobacco or cigars in the past 30 \ndays. We also know that the vast majority--fully 90 percent--of adult \nand lifelong smokers begin at or before their 18th birthday.\n  We can change all that. We know the key ingredients to reducing teen \nsmoking. We know that a comprehensive set of reforms is needed. We need \nsolid authority and resources for the FDA to oversee tobacco products. \nWe need an aggressive education and counter advertising effort. We need \ncommunity-based prevention. We need to expand our research. We need to \nhave strong financial incentives for tobacco companies to take every \naction to cut teen smoking. And, most importantly, we need to price \ncigarettes out of the range of children.\n  Every major public health expert agrees that the single most \nimportant component of a comprehensive strategy to cut child smoking is \na sudden and significant price increase. This is the centerpiece of S. \n1889, the KIDS Act, I introduced with Senator John Chafee and Senator \nBob Graham. Our bipartisan legislation provides for a\n\n[[Page S5282]]\n\n$1.50 increase in the per pack price of cigarettes--$1.00 the first \nyear and another 50 cents the next.\n  As Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr. David Kessler said, this proposal is \n``tough medicine for a tough problem.''\n  Our approach, according to the CDC and other experts, would cut \nsmoking by children in half, over the next three years. That's the \nsharpest and fastest reduction achieved by any bill proposed to date.\n  The bill before us, as reported out of the Commerce Committee, has a \nnumber of commendable features. In many ways it is very similar to the \nHarkin-Chafee-Graham KIDS Act. It has strong FDA provisions, strong \npublic health provisions and its look-back and liability provisions \nhave been substantially improved. We are very pleased that much of our \nwork is reflected in the bill and we commend Senator McCain for his \ngood efforts.\n  However, on the crucial question of price, the bill is inadequate. \nThe bill would increase the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over \n5 years. To have the greatest impact on teen smoking the price should \nbe increased by at least $1.50 a pack over a very short period of time.\n  I will be doing everything, working with my colleagues, on a \nbipartisan basis, to correct this fundamental shortcoming of the \npending measure.\n  While I'll have a lot more to say about many aspects of this \nlegislation, I want to focus the remainder of my remarks today on this \ncritical issue of price. I do this not only because it is the most \nimportant feature of the legislation, but because it has been the focus \nof an onslaught of misleading television, radio and print ads as well \nas statements and mailings by the tobacco industry in my state of Iowa \nand around the nation.\n  The tobacco companies have been making a number of false arguments \nabout the impact of increasing the price to cut down on teen smoking. \nMost disturbing have been their statements that teens don't respond to \nprice increases--that increasing the price won't have an effect on the \nrates of underage smoking.\n  These accusations are not only run counter to the finding of every \nmajor public health organization and countless economists and studies, \nthey contradict the industry's own internal documents and analyses that \nthey tried to hide from the American people for so long.\n  Many studies published in respected journals have clearly documented \nthe impact of price increases on teen smoking. The most recent \nestimates from the CDC is that for every 10 percent increase in the \nreal price of cigarettes, the prevalence of teen smoking is cut by 7%.\n  In its report this year, Taking Action to Reduce Tobacco Use, the \nInstitute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences concluded \nthat ``the single most direct and reliable method for reducing \nconsumption is to increase the price of tobacco products. . . .''\n  In 1994, the Surgeon General's report Preventing Tobacco Use Among \nYoung People concluded that increases in the real price of cigarettes \nsignificantly reduces cigarette smoking and that young people are at \nleast as price sensitive as adults.\n  And we have to look no further than our neighbors to the north--\nCanada--to find a real world example of the impact of price increases \non teen smoking. As this table shows (attached) when real prices in \nCanada increased from $2.09 to $5.42, the number of 15-19 year olds \nsmoking fell from 42 percent to 16 percent--a drop of 62 percent. \nHowever, when tobacco taxes were reduced, youth smoking began \nincreasing after 15 years of decline.\n  As I said earlier, in addition to the abundant evidence on youth \nsmoking and price, the tobacco industry themselves have admitted this \nin a number of their internal documents. For example, a 1981 Philip \nMorris document said, ``In any event, and for whatever reason, it is \nclear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of \nteenagers. . . .''\n  A 1987 Philip Morris document further details their knowledge and \nconcern about the relationship to price and hooking kids as the next \ngeneration of smokers. The document says:\n\n       You may recall from the article I sent you that Jeffrey \n     Harris at MIT calculated, on the basis of Lewit and Coate \n     data, that the 1982-83 round of price increases caused two \n     million adults to quit smoking and prevented 600,000 \n     teenagers from starting to smoke. Those teenagers are now 18-\n     21 year olds . . ., 420,000 of the non-starters would have \n     been PM smokers. Thus, if Harris is right, we were hit \n     disproportionately hard. We don't need to have that happen \n     again.\n\n  A 1982 RJR Reynolds document--that I ask unanimous consent to have \nincluded in the Record at this point--states clearly that an increase \nin the price of cigarettes will result in ``thousands of new smokers \nlost.'' This document says that a 15.1 percent increase in the real \nprice will result in the loss of 93,000 ``new smokers'' aged 13 to 17 \nyears old.\n  So when the tobacco companies now argue that increasing the price of \ntobacco products won't impact youth smoking--they are once again \nblowing smoke. They are once again trying to deceive the American \npeople.\n  So, Mr. President, we have important work to do this week. We have \nthe opportunity to do a lot of good and strike a blow for our children \nand for public health. I look forward to working with my colleagues, on \na bipartisan basis, to seize this opportunity.\n  Tobacco reform is the issue of 1998. It is the crown jewel of this \nCongress. And passing a strong comprehensive tobacco bill is an \nopportunity we simply can't let pass by.\n  Unfortunately, victories in the tobacco wars have come few and far \nbetween. In 1988, we finally changed Federal law on smoking in \nairplanes. It was a full ten years later, and after failing one time, \nthe Senate took its next step last September by passing the Harkin-\nChafee plan to fully fund enforcement of the FDA youth ID check.\n  But I am more hopeful now than ever that we can pass a comprehensive \nplan that would once and for all change how this nation deals with \ntobacco and dramatically cut the number of our kids addicted to this \ndeadly product. Mr. President, our goal is to be on the Senate Floor \nthree years from now announcing that indeed, child smoking has been cut \nin half. We should all put our energies into making that happen.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the pending tobacco \nlegislation. I am concerned that we have gotten off track in our \nconsideration of comprehensive tobacco legislation and the importance \nof preventing children smoking.\n  Our focus must be youth smoking.\n  In an earlier speech on this floor, I reminded my colleagues of some \nof the alarming statistics about youth smoking. I will not dwell on all \nof those statistics; however, it is important to remember that 3,000 \nkids will start smoking today, and 1,000 of those children who start \nsmoking over these 24 hours will die prematurely. Our purpose is to \nprevent these deaths.\n  I urge my colleagues to focus on the health of our children, and \ntheir children--to keep in mind youngsters traveling that tricky path \nfrom childhood to adulthood, surrounded by temptations and convinced of \ntheir own invincibility. What can we do to make it more likely that \nthese children will arrive at adulthood without crippling addictions?\n  Mr. President, before answering that question and discussing the \npending legislation, I want to pause and recall some recent history \nthat helps explain how we have reached this point in the legislative \nprocess.\n  For many years, individuals were not successful in suing the tobacco \nindustry because of the ``assumption of risk'' doctrine. No jury would \nside with the plaintiff because the smoker assumed the risks associated \nwith smoking. However, a group of State attorneys general got together \nand started suing the industry to recover Medicaid cost for smoking \nrelated illness, thus avoiding the ``assumption of risk'' doctrine.\n  In the course of these lawsuits, internal industry documents were \nmade public. From these documents, we learned that the Industry knew a \nlot more about the addictive nature of nicotine and the destructive \neffects of smoking tobacco than was previously thought.\n  Some states began to settle for huge sums from the tobacco industry. \nMississippi settled in 1996 for $3 billion. Florida and Texas were the \nnext to settle, for $11.5 billion and $15.3 billion respectively. And, \nas we have all read in the last week, Minnesota is the most recent to \nsettle--at $6.6 billion.\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\n  In the spring of 1997, everyone came to the bargaining table --40 \nattorneys general, the industry, members of the plaintiffs' bar, and \npublic health groups. They all sat down and worked out an historic \ntobacco settlement on June 20, 1997. The basic elements of the June \n20th settlement included:\n  Industry payments of $368.5 billion over 25 years--to be funded by \nraising the price of cigarettes by $.70 per pack over 10 years;\n  Advertising restrictions--the industry voluntarily limited its First \nAmendment rights;\n  Youth access provisions and tough licensing for retailers who sell \ntobacco;\n  $2.5 billion per year for smoking cessation programs, public \neducation campaigns and state enforcement;\n  FDA authority to regulate tobacco and smoking;\n  No class action suits or suits by any government entity;\n  Immunity for the industry from all punitive damages for past actions; \nand\n  Individuals were allowed to bring suits to recover compensatory \ndamages for past conduct and compensatory and punitive damages for \nfuture conduct.\n  Because the settlement required the enactment of federal law, it came \nbefore Congress. We are here because the June 20th settlement requires \nus to be here. Implementing the provisions of that settlement, or \nprovisions similar to it, requires federal legislation.\n  As we all know, several committees had jurisdiction over different \nprovisions in the June 20th Agreement. Judiciary obviously had its \nrole; the Labor Committee had its expertise in the public health \nprograms and the FDA authority; Finance had jurisdiction over \ninternational trade aspects; Commerce, the liability and interstate \ncommerce expertise; and the Agriculture Committee had a keen interest \nin the effects this type of unprecedented legislation will have on \nfarmers--the one group not invited to the bargaining table during \nsettlement negotiations.\n  After months of work, it became clear that it was impossible for all \nof these committees to put together their respective pieces of a \ncomprehensive package in a vacuum. The Majority Leader asked Chairman \nMcCain to take on the herculean task of crafting comprehensive \nlegislation to address underage smoking through the Commerce Committee.\n  The bipartisan bill produced by Senator McCain and the Commerce \nCommittee is by no means perfect. Even Senator McCain admits that. But \nit is important that we not lose sight of the Commerce bill's virtue: \nit is a comprehensive approach. It is vital that the United States \nSenate address children smoking in a timely, thoughtful manner--the \nCommerce bill gives us the structure for doing this.\n  I return, then, to our central legislative focus: preventing youth \nsmoking. After 6 hearings in the Labor Committee, 11 hearings in the \nCommerce Committee, and chairing a hearing on October 27, 1997 in my \nsubcommittee on Public Health and Safety, I am convinced that the goal \nof cutting underage smoking in half over the next 10 years can be \nachieved only by a three-component comprehensive strategy. All three \nparts are necessary. No single part will accomplish this goal.\n  1. First, we must address advertising targeted to children. An \narticle in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported on \nFebruary 17 that advertising is more influential than peer pressure in \nenticing our children to try smoking, and it estimated approximately \n700,000 kids a year are affected by advertising. The industry cannot \ncontinue to target kids, our society must stop glamorizing smoking on \ntelevision and in the movies, and we must restrict advertising at \nsporting events and near our schools.\n  We tell our kids not to smoke, but then we look the other way when \nretailers sell to kids. We tell our kids that tobacco will shorten \ntheir lives, but clever advertising drowns out our message. So, we must \nrestrict tobacco marketing that appeals to kids, but I know that the \nindustry, like all industries marketing legal products, has substantial \nFirst Amendments rights that must be respected.\n  2. The second element of a comprehensive program is that there must \nbe strong, effective public health initiatives, including tobacco-\nrelated research, treatment and surveillance. A bold effort is \nnecessary to keep people from starting to smoke and to help people stop \nsmoking. A strong commitment to basic science and behavioral research \nis critical. We need the very best scientific research on the \nphysiology of nicotine addiction.\n  Such focused research made possible by this bill might even uncover a \npill that eliminates the addictive nature of nicotine. Such a discovery \nalone would solve the destructive aspects of youth (and adult) smoking. \nThis type of research might have benefits beyond tobacco; it also could \nbe vital in our fight against substance abuse more generally.\n  3. Access is the third element. We must attack how easy it is for \nkids to get their hands on tobacco products. States must enforce the \nlaws against youth smoking. Retail outlets must be a partner in our \nefforts to stop youth smoking. We must make vending machines far less \naccessible to kids. The price of cigarettes must go up--enough to \ndiscourage a teenager from purchasing, but not enough to create a black \nmarket--and there must be consequences for the underage teenagers who \nare caught with tobacco products.\n  As Chairman of the Public Health and Safety subcommittee, I heard \nchilling testimony from teens about how easily they purchased tobacco \nproducts. Nickita from Baltimore, now 18 years old, started smoking \nwhen she was 14. She testified that she would normally get her \ncigarettes from the store. She testified that she never had a problem \nbuying cigarettes in the store, in fact, ``people in my community as \nyoung as 9 years old go to the store and get cigarettes. They do not \nask for I.D.s.''\n  The lesson I learned from this testimony: We must enforce youth \naccess laws. We must make it impossible for children to buy cigarettes \nin any neighborhood in this country. It is shameful that in America in \n1998, a teenager can purchase tobacco in any of our neighborhoods.\n  Price is also a factor in access. While it is obviously only one of \nmany factors, price does affect the level of a product's consumption. \nConsumption had been decreasing in the 1970s; however, between 1980-\n1993 the downward trend accelerated, with consumption falling by 3% a \nyear at the same time that the inflation adjusted price of cigarettes \nincreased by 80%. In addition, the early 1990s saw price cuts, and \nconsumption leveled off with only modest decreases in price until 1996. \nThen, in 1997, prices rose by 2.3%, and consumption fell again by 3%.\n  Expert testimony, based on data from this country and others, clearly \ndemonstrates that the price of cigarettes affects consumption. But a \nhigher price alone won't solve this problem; a comprehensive solution \nis necessary.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Commerce Committee's bill is a good \nstart toward addressing all three aspects of a comprehensive package: \nadvertising, public health, and access. It also addresses an issue \nignored by the June 20th settlement: tobacco farmers. These farmers \nwere not at the table during the negotiation of the June 20th \nagreement. The industry ignored them. The attorneys general ignored \nthem. Yet these hardworking men and women bear absolutely no \nresponsibility for ads targeting kids or for underage sales. These men \nand women work hard for modest incomes, and we cannot ignore the impact \nthat this legislation will have on their circumstances. The Commerce \nbill tries to rectify this oversight.\n  So, the Commerce bill addresses the three areas a comprehensive \napproach must include, and it protects tobacco farmers. That does not \nmake the bill ideal. It is by no means perfect; however, it is not \nnecessarily guilty of all the charges lodged against it.\n  Some urge that the bill is merely an attempt to destroy an industry \nthat is producing a legal product, by raising the price too much. This \nis a legitimate concern. Are the numbers in the Commerce bill too high? \nWe have had countless numbers of financial experts come before several \nof the committees of jurisdiction, and no one agrees on the answer to \nthis question. Wall Street, the Treasury Department, and public health \ngroups all have different levels.\n  We do know one thing: the industry agreed to $368.5 billion in \nexchange for some assurances that they were immune from future cost of \nunpredictable\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\nlawsuits. Maybe the Commerce bill's figure of $516 billion is too high \nwithout similar assurances of protection. The industry obviously feels \nit is. But we know we cannot always trust the industry. I hope that, \nthrough our debate here, we can find common ground on the issue of the \ntobacco industry's payments.\n\n  I do not believe that those who support a comprehensive solution to \nteen smoking are trying to destroy the industry. Tobacco products are \nlegal to manufacture and consume. We are engaged, however, in the \ntricky exercise of finding a price level that will help diminish teen \nconsumption without bankrupting the industry or creating a black \nmarket. I am confident that we can work together in good faith to find \nthat price.\n  I am gratified that the Senate rejected Senator Kennedy's amendment, \nwhich would have treated industry payments as an excise tax of $1.50 \nper pack. This $1.50 tax was too much. The proponents were no longer as \nconcerned with a comprehensive program targeted at preventing children \nfrom smoking as they were with enacting an excessively punitive excise \ntax, which would have punished smokers--who we need to be helping--and \nhit the working poor the hardest.\n  There is a temptation, especially among those who are always \nsearching for revenue streams, to seize upon the opportunity of an \nexcise tax to raise vast amounts of funds for other initiatives. We \nshould be guided by health objectives and not by the search for revenue \nstreams. The funds generated by the agreement should be used for \ntobacco related and health related activities--not the creation of new \nentitlements.\n  Mr. President, let me also address a related issue the tobacco \nindustry is raising: Is the Commerce bill just a big tax bill? I find \nthe industry's complaint that it is somewhat ironic. As I already \nnoted, the industry volunteered to make over $368 billion in payments--\nall passed on to the consumer--as part of the July 20th payment. The \nindustry called that payment a ``voluntary payment.'' That level was \nsimply not enough; for one thing, it did nothing for the tobacco \nfarmer, who was abandoned by the industry. Something more than $368 \nbillion was necessary.\n  Yet now the industry complains that the entire amount of the payments \nincluded in the Commerce bill is a ``tax.'' Maybe, as I said, the \nCommerce bill's payments are too much. But it is disingenuous for the \ntobacco industry to now contend that the payments are all a tax; they \ncame to us and sought our legislation, and they volunteered over $368 \nbillion. We upped the ante a bit--in large part to protect farmers--and \nnow it's suddenly a giant tax. We cannot treat this argument too \nseriously.\n  I want to emphasize how much more effective we can be with a \nsettlement. We must have an industry that doesn't market to kids--a \nsettlement gets us that--a price increase alone does not. Without the \ncooperation of the industry, there is no doubt that this bill will be \nheld up in the courts--putting us years behind in our effort to reduce \nsmoking. The industry does have First Amendment rights, and it can \nexercise them.\n  I invite the industry to come back to us and provide us with credible \ninformation about the level of payments they can afford. The industry \ncan work with us to prevent youth smoking--or it can distort the record \nand continue to be vilified in the public eye. For the sake of stopping \nchildren smoking, I prefer that the industry rise above causing the \nproblem of youth smoking and be part of the solution.\n  Some have charged that the Commerce bill is too bureaucratic. I \nbelieve that our families, communities and states should be empowered \nto fight teen smoking in the manner most suitable for the concerns of \nthat state or community. We don't need big federal government \nstructures to achieve our goal. The Manager's Amendment to the Commerce \nbill has done a good job of streamlining the bureaucracy it originally \ncreated. I am especially supportive of the increased empowerment and \nflexibility given to the States for the use of funds and for control \nover the public health initiatives.\n  Having said that, a comprehensive approach to prevent youth smoking \nisn't a simple undertaking. If we are after results, there must be a \nstructure in place. I believe that we can effectively and efficiently \nuse existing structures, in conjunction with the States, to have a \ncomprehensive approach. Indeed, I played a crucial role in helping \ndraft those portions of the Commerce bill dealing with the Food & Drug \nAdministration. These provisions have earned widespread support, and I \nspoke on the floor Monday to explain them. They prove that we can use \nan existing agency to implement common-sense regulations to reduce \nyouth smoking.\n  Another criticism of the Commerce bill concerns the possibility that \nit may create a black market. We should be realistic about the \npossibility of a black market. If we create a black market by raising \nthe price too high--as was done in Canada--then we will lose all \ncontrol over youth access. Again, this is one reason I voted against \nSenator Kennedy's $1.50 per pack tax. Instinctively, and based on \ntestimony to the Commerce Committee, I believe that price level is too \nhigh.\n  In short, Mr. President, I do have concerns with some parts of the \nCommerce bill. For this reason, I will be open-minded in considering \namendments to it. The Commerce bill is a good starting point, but it is \nonly a starting point. We can and should improve on it--as long as we \ndo not lose sight of our ultimate objective: a comprehensive approach \nto prevent teen smoking.\n  The single criterion I will employ in assessing the amendments that \ncome before the Senate is this: Is the amendment likely to complement a \ncomprehensive strategy to prevent teen smoking? In other words, does it \nhelp restrict advertising targeted at children, promote public health, \nand address access to tobacco? If so, I will consider it; if not, I \nwill reject it.\n  I respectfully suggest, Mr. President, that my colleagues keep the \nsame focus. Rather than attempting to treat the tobacco bill as a new \nrevenue stream--like my colleagues who want a $1.50 per pack excise \ntax--and rather than treating the bill as a chance to create many new \nfederal programs, I urge my colleagues to focus on the children who \nwill start to smoke during this debate. One-third of those children \nwill die prematurely because they started to smoke. We must focus on \nstopping them from smoking.\n  Four years ago, I was saving lives as a heart and lung surgeon. I saw \nthe ravages of tobacco in the operating room. The people of Tennessee \nelected me to use common sense to advance the public good. I submit \nthat crafting a comprehensive approach to keep children from smoking is \na chance for the Senate to save lives through the exercise of common \nsense. I urge my colleagues not to stray from that goal.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are engaging in one of the most \nimportant public health debates of this generation. We have a historic \nopportunity to enact a comprehensive, national antitobacco strategy to \nend the plague of death caused by smoking. As I listen to the debate \nhere in the Senate I am discouraged by much of what I hear. This is not \nabout taxes, or tax cuts. This is not about what the tobacco companies \nget or don't get in the deal. This is not about First Amendment rights \nor increased litigation. This is about one thing and one thing only. \nWill we stand up to the tobacco companies for our children?\n  Will the U.S. Senate say enough is enough. Will we fight to prevent \nthe deaths of five million children under age 18 who will eventually \ndie from smoking-related disease? Or will we allow the tobacco \ncompanies to shape the debate and beat back our efforts to protect \nchildren. Today, 4.1 million children age 12 to 17 are current smokers. \nIsn't this enough for the tobacco industry? Are we going to sacrifice \nmore of our children?\n  I have listened very carefully to all sides on these issues. I have \nbeen told that a tax that is too high will bankrupt the industry. I \nhave been lobbied by many claiming that without special deals, the \ntobacco companies will not agree to restrict advertising or will \nlitigate this legislation to death. But, I have also heard from \npediatricians; public health officials; former Surgeon General C. \nEverett Koop; and many Washington State members of the American Cancer \nSociety, who have expressed their concerns by illustrating\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\nthe human costs of the lies and deceit utilized by the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  Tobacco kills more than 400,000 Americans every year. More people die \nin this country from smoking related illness than from AIDS, alcohol, \ncar accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and fires. Twenty seven percent \nof Americans who die between the ages of 35 and 64 die from tobacco-\nrelated diseases. Isn't this enough? Why has it taken us so long to get \nto this point of the debate? 400,000 Americans die each year while we \ndo nothing.\n  We owe our children more. I owe the children of Washington State \nmore. I have an obligation to push for the toughest tobacco bill \npossible. I can promise you that on my watch the tobacco companies get \nno special deal and that protecting our children is what controls the \ndebate. It is not what can the tobacco companies live with, but is \nright for our children.\n  The tobacco bill that I support will have economic sanctions that \nwill force corporate culture changes by the industry. I will support \nefforts that penalize the companies if they continue to prey on our \nchildren. And I will not support anything that forgives an industry \nthat sold a product that could potentially kill five million children \nalive today.\n  I have made some difficult decisions and votes throughout this \nprocess. But, I am proud of my votes to increase economic barriers to \nprevent children from purchasing cigarettes. I know the tobacco \ncompanies hate these kind of barriers. As we discovered in an internal \nPhilip Morris document from 1981, ``In any event, and for whatever \nreason, it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking \nprevalence of teenagers.'' There is no dispute on the sensitiveness of \nchildren to price increases. Both public health advocates and the \ntobacco companies agree. The public health community supports these \nbarriers and the tobacco industry fears them. But some in the U.S. \nSenate disagree that price matters. I stood up and said no you will not \naddict 3,000 children a day with cheap cigarettes.\n\n  Some of us argue on the floor that without special immunity \nprotection or predictability, the tobacco companies will never accept \ntough advertising restrictions or consent to FDA regulation. To this I \nwould respond simply by saying if we make the look-back surcharges so \ntough that without major cultural changes companies will see profits \nevaporate, we will get our advertising restrictions. If we show that \nthese advertising strategies are aimed at our children we will get \nthese restrictions. We do not need to give special deals that allow \ntobacco companies to walk away from their responsibilities.\n  The tobacco companies have lied to Congress and the American people \nnow they want to negotiate in good faith. In the 1980's, there was \nlegislation in the House of Representatives regarding safe cigarettes. \nThere is technology that would allow tobacco companies to manufacture a \ncigarette that was almost fire safe. The Safe Cigarette Act, introduced \nby Representative Moakley was fought at every level by the industry. \nThey claimed that it was not cost effective to make a cigarette that \nwould prevent the tragic death of children in fires caused by a \ncarelessly discarded cigarette. Saving children from a horrific death \nfrom fire was not enough of an incentive for the manufacturers to \nsacrifice some of their billions of dollars in profits. Instead they \nsacrificed children.\n  Now the industry wants immunity. We are supposed to give them caps on \ntheir liability and responsibility in exchange they will become \nresponsible corporate citizens. This claim simply has no merit. They do \nnot deserve any special deals.\n  Will the tobacco companies challenge these provisions in court? It is \nhard to imagine an industry that has patented their own brand of \nlitigation and used legal maneuvers to hide their deceit and lies, \nwalking away from another opportunity to challenge restrictions in \ncourt. If this industry wants to tie this up in court for years to \ncome, I would say we need to make the look-back surcharges so tough \nthat their own stock holders will not allow this kind of irresponsible \nbehavior. I caution the tobacco industry--if you want to spend the next \nfew years litigating instead of cleaning up your practices you may very \nwell become extinct in the next Century. What would the world be like \nwithout the plague of tobacco? Maybe this is what the industry should \nask the American people?\n  I urge my Colleagues to think long and hard about this debate. We \nwill never get another chance like this one to really make the world a \nsafer and healthier place for our children. Let's side with our \nchildren today instead of the tobacco companies.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the international provisions of the tobacco \nlegislation have been the subject of many hours of discussion and \nnegotiation. The current provisions serve as a strong platform that I \nhope this body will continue to build upon in the years to come as we \nseek to protect all children from the diseases and the economic costs \nbrought about by tobacco use. I received letters which demonstrate the \nbreadth of support and the importance the public health community \nplaces on maintaining the international tobacco control provisions in \nthe tobacco legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Effective National Action\n\n\n                                            to Control tobacco\n\n                                                     May 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Wyden: Last summer's agreement between the tobacco \n     industry and the Attorneys General was flawed because of its \n     failure to consider international tobacco and health issues. \n     We commend you for your strong leadership on this issue and \n     support your efforts to ensure the greatest level of \n     protection possible from tobacco for all children.\n       The international provisions in S. 1415 represent a good \n     start. It is vital, however, that they not be weakened at all \n     and that serious consideration be given to strengthening \n     them.\n       Thank you for your tremendous leadership in protecting \n     people from tobacco.

Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: The Latino Council on Alcohol and \n     Tobacco (LCAT), members of the Hispanic Health and Education \n     Working Group and other Latino professionals want to thank \n     you and your staff for your hard work in supporting \n     international provisions for tobacco control. You and your \n     colleagues are putting forth a signal, a good beginning, a \n     starting point for assuring that the children of the world \n     will be protected from the unacceptable practices of the \n     tobacco giants.\n       Latino parents, educators and public health experts believe \n     that US standards should be upheld worldwide. Federal workers \n     should not support tobacco companies or their subsidiaries \n     abroad. International agencies such as the World Health \n     Organization and the Pan American Health Organizations and \n     non-profit organization should receive funding for their \n     efforts to prevent, treat and stop the spread of smoking \n     related diseases. Anti-smuggling provisions should be \n     strengthened. The US should be a leader in the fight against \n     the spread of tobacco related diseases. You have made it \n     clear through your efforts that public health has no \n     boundaries.\n       We trust that you will continue to work on international \n     tobacco control. We thank you for your leadership and \n     commitment to these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeannette Noltenius.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                                     May 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your commitment to \n     protect the world's children from tobacco. The American Lung \n     Association shares your concern that children around the \n     world are prime targets for the tobacco industry. The \n     international provisions of S. 1415, as amended, represent a \n     strong first step toward curbing the worldwide tobacco \n     problem that the World Health Organization calls a global \n     epidemic.\n       The result of tobacco legislation should not be to redirect \n     the tobacco industry's focus from America's children to \n     children elsewhere around the world. Because of your efforts, \n     the bill's international measures will\n\n[[Page S5286]]\n\n     fund a public health effort around the world, require \n     cigarette labeling and permanently stop the U.S. government \n     from marketing and promoting the export of cigarettes. We \n     cannot allow this progress to be rolled back by weakening \n     amendments on the Senate floor.\n       Strong international tobacco control measures are part of \n     the sound tobacco control policy outlined by the public \n     health community and leaders like Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler. \n     This approach also includes a significant increase in the \n     cigarette excise tax, full authority for the Food and Drug \n     Administration, complete document disclosure, strict \n     penalties on the industry for marketing to children, \n     protection from environmental tobacco smoke, potent public \n     health programs and, of course, no special protections, like \n     immunity or caps, for the tobacco industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John R. Garrison,\n                                        CEO and Managing Director.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah is recognized at this time.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I could just ask a parliamentary, procedural question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with the agreement of the Senator from \nArizona, we want to try to structure the order for the next three \nspeakers, if we could. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator \nfrom Utah speaks----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. KERRY. The minority leader be recognized; and after the minority \nleader, the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then do a tabling motion.\n  Mr. KERRY. At which point, Senator McCain will move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. And I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. You are welcome.\n  A critical component of our debate must be the issue of this bill's \nconstitutionality. This is a matter of extreme seriousness.\n  We are considering a bill that is fundamentally flawed with respect \nto its constitutionality. And that is despite the fact that each one of \nus swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America \nwhen we were elected and sworn into this office.\n  Many skeptics, particularly in the media, contend that Congress will \npass for political reasons any measure that gains any sort of \nconsensus, even if it violates the Constitution.\n  I reject that. I certainly hope they are wrong. I believe that the \nmost important job that members of Congress have is to protect, \npreserve, and defend the Constitution of the United States. And, as \nJudiciary Committee chairman, I take this job very seriously.\n  Why? The answer is, for over 2 centuries the Constitution has been \nthe genesis of our liberty and a source of America's amazing growth and \nprosperity.\n  The Constitution fosters liberty and prosperity by circumscribing \nGovernment's ability to interfere in the lives of the people. Thus, our \nGovernment is termed one of limited powers.\n  In fact, I believe that the structure of the Constitution--the \nseparation of powers, checks and balances, and federalism--and not the \nsystem of courts, is the best protection of our liberties.\n  The salient fact is that the Constitution itself was designed to be, \nin the words of Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist No. 84, ``in every \nrational sense, and to every useful purpose, a bill of rights.''\n  One such constitutional mechanism to protect liberty is limiting \nCongress' legislative authority to only those laws that are reasonably \nderived from its enumerated powers contained in Article I of the \nConstitution, which in practice means that such laws must be consistent \nwith the meaning of the Constitution's provisions and the Bill of \nRights. As such, Congress has a special role in defending the \nConstitution and safeguarding our liberty by policing itself and by \ncontrolling its own appetites.\n  I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment of Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes, who in 1904 gave the opinion that, ``It must be remembered that \nlegislatures are the ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of \nthe people in quite as great degree as the court[s].''\n  So this is why we are having this debate--to exercise our authority \nto ensure that any legislation that is passed is, in fact, \nconstitutional. Let us confound the cynics by doing the right thing.\n  I pray that the Senate will consider the constitutionality of the \nfloor vehicle and any other bill offered as a substitute. To skirt this \nissue would be to violate our very oaths of office.\n  I believe that the bill now being considered in this chamber suffers \nfrom a number of serious constitutional problems.\n  These problems permeate the bill.\n  Besides jurisprudential concerns, there are significant practical \nconsiderations, because passage of the bill could result in \nconstitutional challenges that, if successful, will nullify the key \nsections of the bill. This is true for the bill as reported, the bill \nas rewritten over the weekend, and the bill as modified on the floor on \nMonday. Removal of many ``consensual'' items to a new title XIV has not \naddressed these concerns.\n\n  Mr. President, if key provisions in the bill are nullified, the \nefforts of Congress to enact an effective and truly comprehensive \nantismoking, antisnuff, plan will be severely impaired and virtually \nnothing will have been done to effectively reduce youth smoking.\n  I want to stress that the constitutional problems primarily arise \nbecause the Commerce version and several other major bills have moved \nfrom being a codification of the June 20, 1997, proposed agreement--\nwhich contemplated voluntary participation of the tobacco companies--to \ntax-and-spend and command-and-control legislation.\n  Without the voluntary participation of the tobacco companies--and the \nState attorneys general--both the so-called ``look-back'' provisions \nand advertising restrictions contained in this Commerce bill become \nconstitutionally problematic. These and other constitutional problems \nraise first amendment, bill of attainder, takings clause, and due \nprocess clause issues.\n  More specifically, without the voluntary cooperation of the parties, \nthe advertising ban contained in S. 1415 as amended will probably fall. \nThis is a shame, because almost all health experts believe that \nrestricting advertising is necessary in order to reduce teen smoking. \nThe advertising restrictions in the Commerce bill are contained in both \nthe protocol and in a section that codifies an FDA rule that also \nrestricts otherwise lawful tobacco advertising.\n  The Supreme Court, in the 1996 decision 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode \nIsland, emphasized that any restrictions on truthful advertising must \nreceive the highest scrutiny, and be narrowly tailored to meet the \nstatutory goal. They required that other less restrictive alternatives \nbe employed to resolve problems before speech is censored.\n  The majority of scholars and lawyers who have looked at the issue \nagree that unless the tobacco companies voluntarily waive their \nconstitutional rights, which is what they did in the June 20, 1997, \nagreement, most restrictions on the advertising of a lawful product, \nsuch as tobacco, would run afoul of the first amendment.\n  Indeed, most conclude that the restrictions contained in the protocol \nand FDA rule are not narrowly tailored and that other alternatives \nexist to reduce teen smoking.\n  Experts from the left to the right agree. Professor Laurence Tribe of \nHarvard Law School; Judge Robert Bork; Floyd Abrams, one of the most \nnotable first amendment lawyers; the liberal ACLU and the conservative \nWashington Legal Foundation, all oppose these advertising restrictions \nas unconstitutional. It does not matter whether the restrictions arise \nfrom the codified FDA rule or in the settlement itself, both are \nunconstitutional. Let me just read to you some of their views.\n  Let us take the testimony of Floyd Abrams before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on February 10, 1998:\n\n       Any legislation of Congress which would purport to do by \n     law what the proposed settlement would do by agreement in \n     terms of restricting constitutionally protected commercial \n     speech, is, in my estimation, destined to be held \n     unconstitutional. . . . It is unlikely that, at the end of \n     the day, the FDA's proposed regulations could survive First \n     Amendment scrutiny.\n\n  That was given before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 10, \n1998.\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\n  Let me go to the next chart here. These are quotes by the American \nCivil Liberties Union to the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 20, \n1998.\n\n       Both the legislation and proposed regulation by the Food \n     and Drug Administration. . .are wholly unprecedented and, if \n     enacted, will most likely fail to withstand constitutional \n     challenges.\n\n  There are solid arguments.\n  Let us go to the next one.\n  The next chart is of Judge Robert Bork, dated January 16, 1996, when \nhe said:\n\n       The recent proposal of the FDA to restrict severely the \n     First Amendment rights of American companies and individuals \n     who, in one way or another, have any connection with tobacco \n     products [is]. . .patently unconstitutional under the Supreme \n     Court's current doctrine concerning commercial speech as well \n     as under the original understanding of the First Amendment.\n\n  Those are very strong arguments from well-established constitutional \nauthorities.\n  I also have a letter, dated March 17, 1998, from Floyd Abrams, to \nSenator McCain, concluding that the FDA restrictions are as violative \nof the first amendment as the somewhat broader advertising restrictions \ncontained in the protocol of the Commerce bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      Cahill Gordon & Reindel,\n\n                                 New York, NY, March 17, 1998.\n\n     Re proposed restrictions on cigarette advertising.\n\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I take the liberty of writing to you \n     with respect to the questions you posed to the Clinton \n     Administration concerning its views about and general support \n     of S. 1415. In my view, your questions were particularly well \n     taken given that any ban on truthful advertising of products \n     that may lawfully be sold to adults--whether of cigarettes or \n     any other product--raises very serious First Amendment \n     issues. Regrettably, the same cannot be said of the \n     Administration's response to you by letter dated February 27, \n     1998. In that letter and its attachment, the Administration \n     claims that the ``significant constitutional concerns'' and \n     ``difficulties'' it believes are raised by S. 1415 are not \n     presented by the proposed FDA regulations on tobacco product \n     advertisements. That is not the case, not in my view nor that \n     of many others who have studied the FDA rule and opined on \n     its constitutionality.\n       The expansive sweep of the proposed FDA rule makes it no \n     less constitutionally infirm than the advertising \n     restrictions in S. 1415. The scope of the rule tells the \n     story. All cigarette advertising would be banned in any media \n     other than ``permissible outlets'' such as newspapers, \n     magazines, periodicals and billboards. Those outlets would, \n     in turn, be liable to criminal prosecution and the entry of \n     civil injunctions if they published any cigarette \n     advertisements other than ones in black and white text \n     containing a second warning statement in addition to the \n     current Surgeon General's warning. The only exception to the \n     text-only requirement would be for certain ``adult'' \n     publications, a category that apparently would exclude such \n     mass-circulation magazines as Better Homes and Gardens, Life, \n     National Enquirer, Newsweek, People, Popular Science, Sports \n     Illustrated, and TV Guide. Adults, of course, comprise the \n     vast majority of the readers of these publications.\n       That the proposed FDA rule's extreme breadth and rigidity \n     would serve to all but ban cigarette advertising to adults \n     should be indisputable. What else can be said of a proposed \n     regulation which would ban all outdoor advertising within \n     1,000 feet--over three football fields in every direction--\n     from any playground or school anywhere in the nation? The \n     1,000-foot rule seems particularly gratuitous in view of the \n     fact that it would ban advertising that FDA, by virtue of its \n     proposed text-only requirement, already has sought to strip \n     of the features FDA claims make it appealing to young people. \n     The unbridled sweep of these restrictions is in no manner \n     tailored to their supposed aim. This is particularly true \n     given the availability of far less speech-restrictive \n     alternatives to an ad ban, including stricter enforcement of \n     existing underage sales restrictions and enactment of tougher \n     new laws against sales of cigarettes to minors.\n       The Administration cannot seriously quarrel with the \n     reality that by so severely limiting the placement and the \n     nature of ``informational messages'' that advertise tobacco \n     products to adults, those messages will no longer reach them. \n     That result, the Supreme Court repeatedly has held, is \n     unconstitutional--the government may not ``reduce the \n     population . . . to reading only what is fit for children.'' \n     Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957), see also Reno \n     v. American Civil Liberties Union, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 2346 \n     (1997); Sable Communications Inc. v. FCC, 492, U.S. 115 \n     (1989); Bolgar v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60, \n     71-72 (1983). In short, the FDA rule is no constitutional \n     panacea. It, too, suffers the same fatal flaws evident in any \n     scheme seeking broadly to ban truthful, nondeceptive \n     advertising for a legal product.\n       In sum, I respectfully submit that the proposed FDA \n     regulation could not withstand judicial scrutiny under the \n     First Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Floyd Abrams.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. There are other provisions of the bill that are \nconstitutionally infirm.\n  The look-back penalties in the Commerce bill, which are imposed on \nthe tobacco companies if teen smoking does not meet certain goals for \nreduction, are subject to constitutional challenge unless they are \nvoluntarily agreed to by the tobacco companies.\n  I must add that the Commerce bill now terms the penalties \n``surcharges,'' but this simply is an attempt to elevate form over \nsubstance. No matter how it is termed, these payments are the \nfunctional equivalent of fines.\n  Chief among the grounds for challenging this provision is due \nprocess.\n  The Supreme Court has held that imposed penalties must be related to \nthe objective of the legislation. Penalties should not be imposed \nwithout a showing of fault. I refer you to the Vlandis v. Kline case \n(412 U.S. 441) in 1973 which held that penalties without fault create \nan ``irrebuttable presumption.''\n  Given what we know--or do not know--about how teens react to \nadvertising, it is possible that even if the tobacco industry does all \nthat it can to prevent teen smoking, the target will not be met.\n  Moreover, besides the look-back penalties, the Commerce bill contains \nan additional provision that companies lose their liability cap \nprotection if underage smoking exceeds the targets by a set amount. \nThis is also done without a showing of fault.\n  Thus, it is clear that a court would interpret the Commerce bill's \npenalties as punitive. It is possible, then, that the look-back \nprovisions could fall under the provision in the Constitution that \nprohibits Congress from passing a bill of attainder.\n  I refer my colleagues to the Cummings v. Missouri case (71 U.S. 277) \nin 1867. George III and the Parliament had used bills of attainder to \npunish their political enemies, and the framers of the Constitution \nwisely forbade Congress from doing the same.\n  Certain payments made by the industry raise fifth amendment takings \nclause issues. For instance, it could be argued that some of the \npayments made by the industry constitute a forced seizure of money. The \ninitial $10 billion up-front payment and the first six annual payments \nare owed regardless of whether there are any tobacco-related incomes \nand regardless of whether there are any tobacco sales.\n  I might also direct my colleagues attention to a new provision which \nextends liability to the parent companies of tobacco subsidiaries, such \nas R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, just to mention two. The effect of \nthat provision would be to extend the penalties to the conglomerates' \nfood business, for example, even though they have independent \noperations and no fault on their part has been shown.\n  These payments can neither be characterized as a tax or a licensing \nfee and would constitute uncompensated takings under the fifth \namendment. I refer, for example, to Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. \nBeckwith (499 U.S. 155, 162-163), a 1980 case where cash and bank \naccount seizures were held to be uncompensated takings under the fifth \namendment.\n  The current version of the Commerce bill requires all tobacco \nmanufacturers to release attorney-client and work product documents to \nthe FDA and establish, finance, and run a document depository. Now, \nwhile this is a worthwhile goal,\n  I believe that the wrongdoings of the tobacco companies have been \nhidden for far too long and this information should be brought to the \nlight of day to help the FDA in regulating tobacco and assuring the \npublic health.\n  What some of my colleagues fail to appreciate is that it must be done \nin a constitutional manner, or it is all for naught.\n  We must remember that the June 20 settlement agreement presupposed \nvoluntarily participation by the tobacco companies in releasing \nproprietary documents and in establishing and financing the document \ndepository.\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\n While litigation documents already made public can be forwarded to the \nFDA, it is problematic that the industry could be required to release \nadditional documents, especially work product, confidential, or \nprivileged documents. Such documents are properly defined by the fifth \namendment. I refer you, for example, to the Nika Corp. v. City of \nKansas City (582 F.Supp. 343 (W.D.Mo.)), a 1983 case, where the \ncorporation's documents were held to constitute property under the \nfifth amendment.\n\n  Moreover, pursuant to the same theory, the forced funding by the \nindustry of the depository--the leasing of the building, the salaries \nof the personnel--indeed as for any confiscation of cash or other \nvaluable assets, would constitute a taking under the fifth amendment \nrequiring compensation. I refer you to Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by saying unless we have the voluntarily \nparticipation of the tobacco industry, I doubt that a comprehensive \nbill like the present Commerce bill could be implemented. Such a bill \nwill undoubtedly be successfully challenged in the courts, and I \nbelieve the litigation and the inevitable appeals could take years to \nresolve.\n  In other words, I make the case that if this bill passes in its \ncurrent form, without the cooperation of the tobacco companies, which \nwill be the case, then it will be litigated for at least 10 years.\n  And in the end, I believe, it is likely to be overturned because it \nwill be found unconstitutional. If that is so, then we are risking the \nlives of 10 million more kids who will become addicted to tobacco and \ndie prematurely as a result of our failure to do the right thing, right \nnow, on the floor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives.\n  It is important that these constitutional issues be addressed. It is \nimportant we not ignore the Constitution. It is important that we \nuphold the Constitution.\n  I know that the health of our children is of paramount concern to all \nof my colleagues. So let us at least do the right thing and pass a bill \nthat is constitutional. The protection of the Constitution and the \npromotion of public health are not inconsistent goals. The American \npeople demand both and we should give it to them.\n  I hope all who are here today will pause a moment to consider this.\n  This total cost of this bill has been estimated by some to be $516 \nbillion, although I believe it is far higher.\n  It is estimated that the bill will result in a price per pack cost \nincrease of $1.10 per pack, although this is at the manufacturers' \nlevel and I believe it will go higher.\n  There are a whole raft of other add-on costs not included in the \n$1.10 figure: the wholesaler and retailer markups; the impact of \ngrowing contraband sales which divert revenues; possible triggering of \nthe look-back provisions; and new state excise taxes. That is why \nseveral analysts who have done detailed economic models have concluded \nthat the cost will be over $5 per pack, or over $50 per carton, of \ncigarettes.\n  These are important considerations.\n  If we do not rectify the situation and approve a constitutional \nmeasure, then I think everybody who votes for this bill would deserve a \ngreat deal of criticism for what has happened. What really bothers me, \nto be honest with you, is how some who represent the public health \ncommunity choose to ignore these issues. Their motives seem to be \ndirected more at punishing the tobacco companies than at securing a \ntough, workable bill.\n  Nobody dislikes the tobacco companies more than I do, and nobody has \nfought harder to try to get the tobacco companies put in line.\n  But frankly, unless they come on board, unless we can bring them to \nthe table, this whole thing could amount to an exercise in futility. \nThe constitutionality issue is key here, and I just don't see how we \ncan continue to ignore it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are about to come to a vote on \nthis amendment. I begin simply by complimenting the sponsors of the \namendment for what I know is a well-intended effort to address one of \nthe most consequential of all the issues we must face. I certainly \ndon't deny a very strong case can be made for following through with \nwhat is described as the intent of this amendment. I happen to come \ndown on the other side, and I am going to try to explain the reasons \nwhy I believe this amendment ought to be defeated. But it is not \nwithout high regard for the sponsors, both Senator Gregg and Senator \nLeahy, and the effort they are making.\n  Let me just say, as to the question of immunity, one thing that I \nthink needs to be said is that there is no immunity in this bill, \nperiod. There is none. No one should be misled. There is no immunity in \nthis legislation. There are ways with which we deal with the tobacco \ncompanies and their legal standing, but no one should say that the bill \nprovides immunity for the tobacco companies. On the issue of immunity, \nI think the managers of the bill have made great progress over the \ncourse of the last week. Working with the administration, they have \nimproved dramatically what was done initially in the Commerce \nCommittee. What the Commerce Committee itself did, in my view, is raise \nserious concerns that I, frankly, felt had to be addressed if, indeed, \nwe were going to resolve the overall issue of how we approach tobacco \npolicy in the future.\n  There were special protections for the tobacco industry that were \nwritten into the committee bill originally, which I believe were very, \nvery seriously in error as a matter of public policy. For example, \nallowing parent companies of tobacco companies total immunity would \nhave been wrong. To say that we are going to ban all claims based on \naddiction would have been wrong. To say that we were going to prevent \nState courts from hearing all claims would have been wrong.\n  Mr. President, I want to make sure that all of our colleagues \nunderstand that every one of those special provisions has now been \neliminated. All of those special provisions no longer exist. The \nmanagers' amendment, which is now part of the bill, has eliminated all \nof them. The only remaining provision is a cap on yearly payments, and \nthat cap has been raised from $6.5 billion to $8 billion. So before any \nSenator is called upon to make their vote, I hope they understand that \nsimple fact--perhaps I should say those simple facts. There is no \nimmunity in this bill; there are no special protections, unlike what \nwas reported out of the Commerce Committee. What is left is a cap that \nhas been raised by $1.5 billion annually.\n  Let me emphasize something else about that cap. The cap is available \nonly to those companies that agree to additional advertising \nrestrictions beyond what is contained in the FDA rule. They have to \ncommit never to challenge the entire bill to be eligible to come under \nthat cap. They can't advertise and they can't challenge the provisions \nof this legislation just to be eligible. And then there is one more \nthing. Everybody needs to understand that in order just to be able to \ndo that, they have to pay out an upfront payment of $10 billion. So \nhere is what we are offering the tobacco companies: You pay the country \n$10 billion; you agree to limit your advertising way beyond what the \nFDA rule will provide. You also agree not to challenge the provisions \nwithin this bill, and then we will fit you under an $8 billion \nliability cap. And only those companies which make those commitments \nare eligible. Only those companies that make those commitments will \nhave State suits settled.\n  Any company that says, ``Wait a minute, that is too high a price. You \nare asking me to limit my advertising way beyond what FDA is going to \ntell me. You are telling me that I have to accept every provision in \nthis legislation. You are telling me I have to pay forth $10 billion, \nand if I don't do that, you are saying I still have to face all those \ncourt suits in the States''--well, companies that refuse to sign the \nprovisions under this bill get absolutely nothing. So a tobacco company \nis faced with the prospect of coming under an $8 billion liability cap \nby agreeing to all these additional provisions or getting nothing, \nunder this legislation. They will continue to face lawsuits in the \nStates if they don't sign onto the provisions that we have laid out in \nthis legislation.\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\n  But it even gets more complicated for tobacco companies. We are not \ngiving anything away by putting in an $8 billion cap. We are getting \nsomething we can't get through our own legislation. We can't legislate \nthe advertising restrictions that go beyond the FDA rule without \nraising first amendment questions. And we could not prevent the tobacco \nindustry from challenging other provisions of the bill. That is a \nproblem. The cap is our way of addressing that particular, very serious \nproblem.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of what the tobacco companies have to do \nto come under that $8 billion yearly cap, beyond what I have already \nmentioned. Of course, I have mentioned the advertising restrictions. I \nhave mentioned the upfront payment. I have mentioned that they have to \nagree not to challenge the terms of the legislation, not to challenge \nthe FDA authority. They cannot challenge the look-back surcharges. That \nis, they can't challenge the provisions that hold them accountable for \nreducing youth and teenage smoking. They can't challenge those look-\nback provisions or any of the payments, for if they challenge any of \nthat, it is all over and they are back right where they started. They \nfall outside the cap and they are subject to every single state lawsuit \nand the unlimited liability that they are facing right now.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that the tobacco companies will lose \nthe protection of the cap if they fail to comply with any one of the \nterms--not all of them; all they have to do is miss on one of them.\n  So, Mr. President, I don't know how you get any tougher than that. \nEven if the companies comply with all of those provisions, they could \nlose the cap for other reasons: If they miss the youth smoking targets \nby 20 percent or more, if they are caught smuggling or aiding and \nabetting smuggling, and if they fail to make an annual payment within \nthe year that it is owed. All of those additional criteria are locked \nin with this bill.\n  So I don't know, Mr. President. It sounds to me like that is about as \ntough as it gets. First of all, they have more restrictions than they \nhave ever had in any other set of circumstances. They are required to \npay more money. They are subject to discipline each and every year with \nregard to an array of very tight provisions. And what they get in \nreturn is an $8 billion cap on liability.\n  Mr. President, I will oppose the Gregg amendment because I believe \nthe managers' amendment approaches the issue in the right way.\n  It gives protection only to those tobacco companies that go further \nthan we legislate, that acknowledge the need to limit advertising in a \nway that we can't legislate in this bill. The other tobacco companies, \nthose that do not sign up, will have no cap and will continue to fight \nit out in the courts in all of the States where these cases are being \ncontested.\n  I think we have to do all we can to reduce teen smoking. Additional \nadvertising restrictions and a commitment made by tobacco companies not \nto challenge the law will increase our likelihood of success--not \ndecrease it, increase it.\n  Mr. President, for all those reasons, as well-intended as this \namendment is, I hope my colleagues will think very carefully and very \nconscientiously about how important this question before the Senate \ntruly is. We must do what we can to ensure passage of this legislation, \nto ensure that we stay tough on these companies, that we make them to \ndo what we know they must do to reduce teen smoking, and to comply with \nthe intent and the spirit of our objectives in this law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the regular order is that I am \nrecognized, and then the Senator from Arizona is to be recognized for a \ntabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a lot of folks have spoken today, and I \nreserved commenting on each speech until this time. I recognize that we \nwant to get on with a vote--I don't want to delay that process--but I \nbelieve a few points need to be made to clarify the ground, to blow the \nsmoke away, if I may use that metaphor, from the issue.\n  Let's begin with the question of immunity and whether or not immunity \nis granted in this bill.\n  Immunity for the purposes of this debate has become a term of art. \nLike so many terms that we use here in the Senate, it may not be the \nmost precise term but it is the term that accurately from the political \nstandpoint defines the event here.\n  The fact is that under this bill the tobacco industry is going to be \ngiven a special preferential position in the order of American \ncommerce, a position which no other industry will have, a position \nwhich is totally outside of the traditional manner in which we have \nmanaged our marketplace under our capitalist system.\n  The limitations in this bill on the ability of individuals who have \nbeen harmed by the tobacco companies are considerable. They are \nsignificant and they will impact people. Pure logic tells you this, \nbecause, obviously, if the argument is being made that the only way you \ncan get the tobacco company to come back to the table is if you give \nthem these protections, there must be something pretty darned \nsubstantive to these protections.\n  So very obviously the limitations which are being placed on the \ncapacity of the American consumer to recover for the damage that has \nbeen caused to him or her by the tobacco companies are significant, if \nthis bill passes. Let me list a few of them.\n  There will be limitations on the amount of recovery on punitive \ndamages because there is a cap. There will be limitations on the amount \nof damages recovered from compensation damages because there is a cap. \nThere will be a preemption of actions by States, municipalities, and \ncounties for future claims. There will be immunity for wholesalers, \nretailers, insurers, and the ingredient suppliers for past and future \nclaims. There will be, most importantly, a structure set up where the \ntobacco companies will pick who is going to be the winner and who is \ngoing to be the loser on the issue of lawsuits brought against them.\n\n  What an ironic situation, as I have said before on this floor.\n  The way this cap works, it is the first person to the courthouse to \nget a settlement who gets the money. And the tobacco companies, since \nthey are the ones being sued, can pick who is going to win. If they are \nsued by three different groups--a group of schoolteachers from New \nHampshire, a group of kids from Pennsylvania, a group of friends from \nOhio, and another group of friends from Illinois--they can settle with \nthe friend from Ohio, and the friends from Illinois. If the cap is used \nup, the schoolteachers and the kids are out of it. They are out of it \nfor that year, and they well may be out of it forever depending on how \nmuch the cap is used up, and in the next year, also.\n  So the people who are injured who have brought the lawsuit find \nthemselves in the impossible position, or the ironic position, at a \nminimum, of having to go to the tobacco companies on bent knees and \nsay, ``Please settle with me first so I can get into the fund before \nsomebody else,'' which means that you inevitably create not an \nadversarial relationship but a supplicant relationship between those \nwho are suing and those who are being sued, which is not in the \ntradition of the American jurisprudence system, to say the least.\n  Equally important, the concept that an industry will have protection \nfrom lawsuits in the marketplace is antithetic to the American concept \nof a free market. The protection that consumers have today, no matter \nwhat product they buy, is they can go into the courtroom, if they are \nharmed by that product, and get redress. There are a lot of other ways \nthey can get redress, too. But the primary redress is that they can go \ninto that courtroom or one of the primary redresses, if they have been \nphysically damaged, or if somebody in their family has been killed, and \nthey can get a recovery, if they can make their case. That is called \nthe free market system. It is called the capitalist system. Under this \nproposal, that doesn't work.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I am going to make my statement. I know the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has made his on a\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\nseries of occasions, and then we are going to go to a vote. I am not \ngoing back and forth carrying this on any further. I am going to make \nmy statement. I have maintained a fair amount of reservation. So I \ndidn't extend this debate for a lengthy period. I would like to get us \nto a vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. Fair enough. Might I ask, Mr. President, if the Senator \nwould give me some idea of the length of time he expects to speak?\n  Mr. GREGG. I expect to speak for about another 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. So the marketplace is being fundamentally changed for one \nindustry alone, the tobacco industry. That, in my opinion, is obviously \na mistake.\n  Why is this being done? Representation as to why it is being done was \nmade by a number of Senators, and I think they are accurate to their \ntheories as to why it is being done. It is being done, to quote the \nSenator from Rhode Island, because they hope to bring the tobacco \ncompanies back to the table by putting in this significant benefit, \nwhich is protection from liability, immunity, or a form of immunity at \na minimum.\n\n  It was interesting that the Senator from Utah, who is very familiar \nwith this issue, said that even the caps, as it is presently \nstructured, aren't strong enough to bring--they aren't enough \nprotection to the tobacco industries to bring them back to the table, \nthat they don't do enough, that they don't go far enough. That is an \ninteresting comment, because what we do know is that the tobacco \ncompanies are not at the table right now. In fact, we know from the \nstatement of the chairman of one of the tobacco companies that they \nhave walked away from the table, and to quote him, ``There is no \nprocess which is even remotely likely to lead to an acceptable \ncomprehensive solution this year.''\n  So they are not planning to come back to the table. Yet, here we have \nthis deal which has been made, as I mentioned earlier, a deal with the \ndevil, the producers of this product, which kills people and addicts \npeople, and the devil walked away from the table. And now we have the \nunseemly situation of the U.S. Congress chasing after the devil saying, \n``Please take my plan. Please take it. Take it, please. Please, please \ntake this protection that we are offering.'' It really is unseemly. It \nis inappropriate. More importantly, it doesn't make any sense.\n  Why, if they are no longer participants in this process, would we \nwant to give them a protection which no other industry in this country \nhas today--it makes no sense--on the wish and the prayer that they are \ngoing to come back to the table someday in the future? I don't think \nso. I think it makes absolutely no sense that we should be making such \na fundamental change in the way we manage our market, such a \nfundamental way in the way we manage our jurisprudence system, on a \nwish and a hope and a prayer that an industry, which has shown itself \nto be so endemically irresponsible, will for some reason suddenly \nbecome responsible and return to the table. I find that to be a concept \nwhich holds very little validity.\n  But the most substantive reason to support the amendment which has \nbeen offered by myself and the Senator from Vermont and to change the \nlanguage in this bill--remember the language which we are offering here \nwas the original language of the healthy kid amendment, which was \nsupported by the President. I must say somebody should ask the \nPresident why he has changed his position on this because he did \nsupport this language initially. He formally and bluntly supported it.\n  But the primary concern here for supporting this language is this. We \nhave an industry which produced a product that they knew killed people, \nand the evidence is conclusive on that. We have an industry which \nproduced a product that they knew was addictive. Not only did they know \nit was addictive, but they increased the contents of that addictive \npart of the process, the nicotine, in order to increase the \naddictiveness of the product. They produced a product that was \naddictive, and they knew it was addictive. And then they took this \nproduct which killed people, which they knew killed people, which was \naddictive and which they knew was addictive, and they targeted the \nsales of it on our kids.\n  This is not an industry which deserves special protection from the \nU.S. Congress. Call it immunity, call it limited liability, use \nwhatever term of art you want to use, but the fact is, this is an \nextraordinary step of special protection for an industry which has \nproduced a product which is fundamentally bad, which they knew was bad, \nand which they targeted on kids.\n  While this Congress refuses to give that type of protection to other \nindustries which are producing products which save lives--we do not \ngive protection to medical devices which save lives; we do not give \nprotections to automobile manufacturers that improve the style of life; \nwe do not give protections to the computer manufacturer that improves \nthe style of life; we don't give protections to the drug manufacturers \nthat improve the style of life--we are going to give protection to the \ncigarette manufacturer, the tobacco producer that produced a product \nthat kills you, that is addictive, and that was targeted on kids.\n  The choice I think here is pretty clear. We can stick with a system \nthat has worked for 200 years, called the marketplace, where the \nconsumer has the right to go into the court system and defend \nthemselves and get a reasonable recovery, or we can structure a brand \nnew system to protect an industry which has proven itself beyond any \ntest to be a dishonorable industry, which has tried to destroy the \nlives of many Americans in order to sell its product.\n  From my standpoint, the choice should be simple. I hope the Members \nof the Senate will join with me and a fair number of other folks and \nSenator Leahy, who has been a strong advocate--and I very much \nappreciate his participation as a cosponsor of this amendment--in \npassing our amendment to eliminate this liability limitation by \ndefeating the motion to table which is going to be made by the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  I would like to say at this point before we go to the motion, I thank \nthe Senator from Arizona for his courtesy and the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his courtesy in moving this amendment to a vote. I \nappreciate their courtesy. They have been more than fair in allowing us \nthe opportunity to bring this forward and do it in a timely manner. I \nthank them for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before the Senator so moves, I would just \nask him if he might answer one question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, without prolonging this, I would ask the \nSenator from Arizona if he would agree--since there is no immunity and \nno liability limitation but only a cap on how much liability--that \nvoting to sustain the cap and against the Gregg amendment is, in fact, \ncompletely consistent with the budget amendment vote?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is a very articulate and enlightening question. The \nanswer is, the Senator is exactly right. Actually, it is a very \nimportant point.\n  I move to table the Gregg amendment and ask for the yeas and nays on \namendment No. 2433.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the underlying Gregg amendment No. 2433.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for a very \nenlightening and informative debate. It has been an important \ndiscussion, not on the amendment just voted on, but on the bill itself. \nObviously, we attempted to table the Gregg amendment, and it is \nsomething that is unfortunate, in my view, for the entire bill. At the \nsame time, just like with the attorneys' fees and other aspects of this \nissue, we will revisit this issue again. I believe it is important for \nus to continue to work through the bill and get it through the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I think the American people expect us to do that, and I think it is \nimportant that we continue to work on the many amendments of \nsignificant importance to the bill. I believe this aspect of it not \nonly will be revisited, but it is another chapter in a very long saga. \nYesterday, we had two very significant victories. Today, we had a \ndefeat. There will be more victories and more defeats as we go through \nthis very difficult process.\n  But at the end of the day, I am totally confident that this body and \nthe Congress will act in a responsible manner and adopt a comprehensive \npiece of legislation that will attack the nationwide problem of 3,000 \nchildren beginning to smoke every day and 1,000 of them being caused to \ndie early as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. I thank all those \nwho voted in favor of the amendment. And for those who opposed it, I \nrespect the opposition. But I believe we will move forward with a \ncomprehensive piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I join my colleague \nin saying that I think what Senator McCain and I and others hoped for \nwas the opportunity to be able to come to the floor and fight these \ntough issues. That is what we did. We just had a tough vote. Clearly, \nsome of us had hoped that the outcome would be different, because we \nhad a different view of where the bill might travel. But this by no \nmeans prevents us in any way from continuing forward in the process of \nmolding this legislation. This is precisely what the Senate ought to be \ndoing. It ought to be fighting hard over these votes. We ought to be \nable to come to an understanding of where the 51 votes lie. And then, \nultimately, we all know that hopefully we can come together with a \npiece of legislation that finds a conference committee and, ultimately, \nboth Houses of Congress.\n  So I thank my colleagues for this spirited debate and for the fact \nthat we have voted on two of the most critical issues with respect to \nthis legislation. I thank Senator Durbin for now bringing to the floor, \nthrough the leadership, an amendment on the issues of the look-back, \none of the other very important issues that needs to be resolved. I am \nconfident that we will have another healthy round of debate on that. I \nlook forward to continuing to proceed.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have had a defining moment in \nthis debate. Throughout this debate, our colleagues, who have brought \nto the floor of the Senate a bill that will raise $700 billion in \ntaxes, have said that they are not interested in the money, that the \nmoney is incidental, that what they want to do is raise the price of \ncigarettes.\n  We have made the point that this increase in the price of cigarettes, \nthis tax, will fall very heavily on blue-collar workers. Those making \n$15,000 or less will pay 34 percent of the cost, the taxes that are \nbuilt into this bill. Those making $22,000 or less will pay 47 percent \nof the cost. Those making $30,000 or less will pay 59.1 percent of the \ncost of the taxes embodied in this bill.\n  Even if this bill only raised the price of a pack of cigarettes by \n$1.50--and most estimates are that it will raise it by $2.50 at a \nminimum--it would mean that an average smoker in America would pay $356 \nof additional taxes as a result of this bill, and a blue-collar family \nwhere both the husband and wife smoke, would pay $712 a year more in \nFederal taxes. In fact, the table put out by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation shows something that, over and over, those who support the \nbill have tried to deny or neglect, which is that for those Americans \nwho make $10,000 or less, their Federal taxes will rise by 41.2 percent \nas a result of the taxes embodied in this bill.\n  Now, what Senator Domenici and I did earlier was send an amendment to \nthe desk that tried to give some of this money back to blue-collar \nworkers in the form of a tax cut. Our colleagues say, it is not the \nmoney we want; they say, we just want to raise the price of cigarettes. \nSo Senator Domenici and I took them at their word, sent an amendment to \nthe desk that said raise the price of cigarettes; but since this is \ngoing to impose a bone-crushing tax on moderate-income Americans, let's \ntake at least $1 out of every $3 that will be collected in this tax \nincrease and let's give it back to working families by repealing the \nmarriage penalty for families that make $50,000 or less. In other \nwords, it gets the impact on smoking that may come from a higher price \nas a result of the taxes in this bill but with our tax cut we avoid \nlowering the real income or living standards of blue-collar Americans \nwho, after all, are the victims here. The whole objective of the bill \nis to basically say people who smoke have been induced to smoke by the \ntobacco companies, and yet, paradoxically, the tax we are imposing is \nbeing imposed on the very people who have been exploited. In fact, the \nbill before us has an incredible provision which says every penny of \nthe tax has to be passed through, and it is illegal if a tobacco \ncompany absorbs any of this tax increase. Every penny of it, 59.1 \npercent of the tax increase, is on families that make less than $30,000 \na year. The victims of the smoking campaign by the tobacco companies \nare the people who are paying the taxes.\n\n  What Senator Domenici, Senator Faircloth, and I have said in our \namendment is this: Raise the tax, but give a third of the money back to \nworking families by repealing the marriage penalty for couples who make \nless than $50,000 a year. So you get the price impact on smoking, but \nyou don't end up brutalizing economically moderate-income people.\n  I think it is very instructive that after 3 days of debate where our \ncolleagues have said don't accuse us of wanting this money, we just \nwant to raise the price of cigarettes, that we sent an amendment to the \ndesk asking that $1 out of every $3 we are collecting in taxes be given \nback to moderate-income working families, and the Senate reacts in a \nconvulsion, and the leadership uses right of privileged recognition to \namend our amendment and to deny us the ability to offer a tax cut for \nthe very people who are going to find themselves crippled economically \nas a result of this tax.\n  So let me just suggest two points:\n  No. 1, I think this is further evidence this bill is about money. Our \namendment is hardly a far reaching amendment. We are just simply asking \nthat roughly one out of every three dollars of the tax be given back.\n  Second, it also suggests, it seems to me, the objective here is to \nprevent us from having an opportunity to vote on a tax cut.\n  I want to assure my colleagues--and I know Senator Domenici feels \nexactly the same way--that there is no way we are going to be denied \nthe right to offer this amendment. This won't be the last tax cut \namendment that we are going to have. Quite frankly, I don't understand \nif those who are for the bill are saying what they really mean, why \nthere isn't overwhelming support in both parties for giving a third of \nthis tax increase back to working families.\n  Let me say very briefly what the amendment does and then yield the \nfloor so that Senator Domenici, the cosponsor of the amendment, will \nhave an opportunity to speak.\n  Under current law if two individuals, a man and a woman, both of whom \nare working in the economy outside of the home, fall in love and get \nmarried, under current law they pay on average an additional $1,400 a \nyear in income taxes. So that, for example, if you had\n\n[[Page S5294]]\n\ntwo single people, and they didn't get married, and they filed an \nincome tax return jointly, they don't pay taxes on any income of less \nthan $10,200 a year. But if they fall in love and get married, even if \nthey file separately, they have to pay taxes on income of above $6,900 \na year. So we have an incredible provision of law that, in terms of \ndeductions, penalizes working people who fall in love and get married \nby taking away $3,300 of deductions from them.\n  Mr. President, I think it would be a general bipartisan consensus \nthat the family is the most powerful institution for progress and human \nhappiness in history. Yet our Tax Code penalizes people who get \nmarried. If you want to state it in a dramatic way, you can say that \nthe tax code provides an additional $3,300 of deduction by simply \nliving in sin rather than getting married.\n  This has been much discussed. There is a strong basis of support for \nrepealing it.\n\n  What we could do is simply this: Eliminate the marriage penalty \nimposed by the tax code for all families that make less than $50,000 a \nyear--and those families will pay about 75 percent of this tobacco tax. \nSmoking is primarily a blue-collar, moderate-income phenomenon in \nAmerica today. What we will do for couples that earn less than $50,000 \na year is give them the additional $3,300 deduction so that there will \nbe no economic penalty for people getting married. We will also allow \nthose who get an earned income tax credit to take the deduction before \nthey figure their eligibility for the earned income tax credit. So that \neven people who make very modest incomes will benefit from this tax \ncut.\n  This tax cut will take roughly $1 out of every $3 raised in taxes by \nthe tobacco tax and give it back to working families. So those who want \nthe higher price for tobacco to discourage consumption will get it, but \nwe will not crush economically moderate income people who have become \naddicted to nicotine and who smoke. We will not have the terrible \nparadox that while talking about firing bullets at these big tobacco \ncompanies our bullets are actually hitting the victims who have become \naddicted to nicotine.\n  So on that basis, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have not but for a few minutes spoken \nabout the issue before the Senate.\n  I want to make it very clear that I understand the difficulty in \nmanaging a bill of this size. It is an enormous and contentious issue, \nand Senator McCain should be commended for taking on such a difficult \ntask. I have nothing but admiration for those who are attempting to \ndevelop this legislation.\n  But I can say to the Senate that I cannot imagine that the rules of \nthis Senate are going to preclude Senators like Gramm and Domenici from \noffering amendments to this bill. We want to vote on whether we want to \nhave a tax cut as part of this new tax increase. Sooner or later we \nwill vote. I don't know what the two amendments offered by Senator \nDaschle are. Whatever they are, in due course we will vote on them. If \nby chance one of them wipes out ours, we will be back to offer other \namendments.\n  Let me talk about the history of imposing taxes on cigarette and \nrelated tobacco products. I am sure that I am not as good of a \nhistorian as my friend from Texas is, but is he aware the first \nreported effort to put a tax on tobacco was done by King James I in \n1604.\n  King James just didn't like the odor of tobacco. He wasn't a U.S. \nSenator and he wasn't part of a democracy. He simply issued a \nproclamation. ``Smoking is a custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to \nthe nose, harmful to the brain, and dangerous to the lungs.''\n  In 1604, King James said that. Now I used to be a smoker and I \nenjoyed it. I am just reporting on what King James said so I don't want \nthe smokers listening to this debate to get mad at me.\n  Then he proceeded to put a 4,000 percent increase on imported \ntobacco.\n  He didn't pretend that he wanted to accomplish some worthy public \npurpose. He just wanted to raise revenue--and a lot of it. He was a \ndictator, king, benevolent, whatever they call them. But he didn't have \nto worry about what we have to worry about. And that is the impact on \nour citizens of this huge tax and the size of government. Frankly, \nthere is not a word in history about this which said he was concerned \nabout kids. He just said what I had described to you, and put the tax \non and spent the money.\n  Frankly, people were no better off in those days. Even with a 4,000-\npercent increase people continued to smoke.\n  It is most interesting that without all of our science--I really \nthink our science is great to find cures for cancer--King James I said \nthat smoking was harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs. \nHaving said that, he wasn't concerned about teenagers or about cancer \nbecause he didn't know about cancer.\n  But as we proceed to work on this bill, I want to ask myself and ask \nthose who are working on this bill:\n  What do we really want to accomplish?\n  First, we contend that too many young people are starting to smoke. \nAnd we want to stop that. Make no bones about it. When we offer our \nsubstitute bill, we have done the best we can with a reasonable amount \nof money to try to stop teenagers from smoking. Too many young people \nare using drugs, and we want to try to stop that. And we want more \nresearch on serious illnesses, including cancer, so that someday we \nwill stop them in their tracks.\n\n  Now, that is the kind of substitute amendment we are going to offer. \nBut nowhere can anybody tell the Senate or the people of the United \nStates that you need over the next 25 years $868 billion in new revenue \nfrom cigarette-related products.\n  Where do I get that number?\n  I don't think it has been said this way, but I want to make it \nsimple.\n  The current Federal excise tax on tobacco is 24 cents a pack. It is \nscheduled to go to 39 cents a pack under current law. This bill \nincludes an increase equal to $1.10 cents. That is 1.49 in straight \narithmetic. And then the $1.10 is indexed for inflation or 3 percent, \nwhichever is greater.\n  Frankly, we are not really sure how much this bill raises, but an \nacceptable number is $868 billion, I say to my friend from Texas.\n  Now, I want to try to put that in perspective. The biggest program we \nhave taking care of the most people committed to monthly checks is the \nSocial Security Program. $868 billion would pay for Social Security for \n2 full years. $868 billion would pay for the entire Defense Department \nof America for 3 years.\n  This proposed tax increase in the McCain bill is bigger--when you put \nit into one basket, it is bigger than the gross domestic product of any \nof the following countries: Belgium, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, \nSwitzerland, et cetera.\n  Now, where did anybody come up with the idea that we needed every \nsingle penny of that to be spent on programs related to reimbursement \nto the States, to research, or to whatever? Where did the miraculous \nrelationship of $868 billion, the total receipts, to the need for \nprograms come from? There is no reason to it. There is no magic. I can \nassure you of that, if you only had a $300 billion tax increase, \neveryone would get by with $300 billion for this anti-smoking program.\n  But now we have gotten so grandiose about it that it is going to \nraise, over 25 years, over $868 billion under this bill.\n  Now, frankly, I believe it is only reasonable that part of this tax \nincrease be given back to the American people, and I am going to have a \nlot more to say about that.\n  But a tax is a tax. This tax has a good motive: to stop kids from \nsmoking. It may work--raise the price of cigarettes, and certain parts \nof the population may not buy them as much or may stop buying them. \nThere is not conclusive evidence as to what price point you have to \nraise the price to, to have the most effect. But I can tell you, in our \nsubstitute we are going to propose 75 cents, period--no increases, just \n75 cents. We believe that will keep the black market from going rampant \nand has as good a chance as any other number, by way of a tax, of \ndeterring young people from starting smoking or encouraging them to \nquit smoking from the economic standpoint.\n  Having said that, I want to tell you that there is nothing more \nonerous in the United States than the marriage\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\npenalty. Every once in a while, you will hear about a couple--it is not \nvery frequent, but it gives you the dimension of this penalty--who will \ngo to Mexico and get divorced the day before Christmas, and then they \nwill go to Las Vegas and get married after New Year's. And guess what. \nThey don't have to pay the marriage tax penalty. I am not sure if 500 \ndo that, but we know some used to. I am not sure if it is 5,000. But \nimagine that you have a law on the books of America that invites that \nkind of conduct.\n  In the extreme, the marriage penalty is punitive. And it is just \nwonderful to hear Senators and political leaders say, ``We are for the \nfamily.'' I assume that when you say, ``We are for the family,'' \nwithout regard to one's philosophy, I guess you would have to say \nmarriage is pretty important, too, because I think in some way it is \nrelated to the families. It used to be 100 percent related, but it is \nstill very important.\n  Now, why would you impose a tax that would say to those two people \nwho are married, ``You pay more if you are both working than if you are \nboth working and living together and not married''? Frankly, I will \ntell you that I have heard, personally, in my own ear somebody say, \n``We are not getting married because, after all, we love each other, \nbut we would have to pay $2,800 more in taxes, and it is just crazy, so \nwe are not going to get married.''\n  Now, I don't like to say that, but that is the case. And there are \nworse examples because they are much broader in terms of impact. The \naverage marriage penalty in this country is $1,400. In some cases, it \nis much higher; in other cases, it is somewhat lower.\n  In fact, if you look at comparable countries, Mr. President, 27 of \nthe OECD countries--they are tied together in terms of economic \nevaluations and assumptions and the like--19 countries tax husbands and \nwives separately, so there is no marriage penalty. What keeps the \nUnited States from doing that? Frankly, what has kept us in the past is \nthat we had too big a deficit, and if we cut taxes, then we figured we \nwere losing money and we would take it easy and careful and not fix \neverything in the Tax Code.\n  We have balanced the budget. Senator Gramm and I do not intend to \nchange a bit that approach to more and more surpluses. But when you \nimpose a brand new tax--and it is inconceivable that you would need \nevery penny of that tax for a program that deals with tobacco--frankly, \nthere are organizations running around that have never seen so much \nmoney. I have stopped some in the hall with buttons saying, ``Cigarette \nTax Now,'' and have asked them, ``Which one?'' Well, they said, ``We \nlike Senator McCain's improved.'' I said, ``Oh, but what's the goal?'' \n``Well, the goal is the highest tax we can get and the biggest program \nwe can get to spend money on teenagers and all kinds of health \nprograms.''\n  Growing a big government is not why we are raising the cigarette tax. \nI thought our big goal was to try to stop our young people from \nsmoking. Increasing the price of cigarettes plus a pro-active \nadvertising campaign against smoking and drugs could be effective. We \nalso need an attitude change at the cigarette companies. We also need a \nlittle more research. We need new penalties against those who sell to \nteenagers when they should not, and even to teenagers who smoke three \nor four times and they should not and know they are wrong. That is \nprovided for in the Gramm Domenici substitute. We would like to \nincrease the budget DEA, FBI, Customs, and DOD drug interdiction \nprograms.\n  But beyond that, what do we need all this money for? It is absolutely \nlogical--I have been here a long time. I have worked on appropriations. \nEvery year the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee comes to the \nfloor. I will say, ``You can't imagine, fellow Senators, how many \nrequests I had for money from my bill that I could not comply with.'' \nIn fact, I have seen some where you take out a batch of letters and \nsay, ``This is what I was asked to do that I can't do.'' But there is \nno relationship between the country prospering and being a great \ncountry and that pack of letters.\n  But now, look, here we have concluded--some have--that we would be \nremiss if we didn't dream up an expenditure for every penny of these \ntax dollars. Right? Now, why is that rational? Why should those of us \nsay, how about one-third of it going back to the taxpayers and going \nback to fix the most onerous, discriminatory tax against an institution \nthat we cherish and respect, one-third of the money.\n  I have not heard anybody say--and I hope, when we finally vote on the \nmarriage penalty, and that is not going to be the only tax cut \namendment offered, because if this one does not pass, there will be an \namendment to cut 1 percent from the lower brackets. There will be a tax \ncut amendment to expand child care credits. There will be a number of \ntax cut amendments that should be considered.\n  But how can anybody stand up in the Senate and say, if you take a \nthird of this huge tax increase the tobacco program for kids is not \ngoing to work?\n  I defy anybody to come up here and say, out of this pot of money and \nall these programs, if you don't keep them all, if you take one-third \nof the money and say, look, let's give it back to the taxpayers so we \nbegin to get rid of this marriage penalty, at least for those families \nwith $50,000 of income and under, I cannot imagine somebody will stand \nup and say:\n  ``But we won't be doing what we must do for our kids.'' I mean, if it \nis $868 billion, and you have $650 billion instead of $868 billion, can \nyou not put an effective anti-smoking and anti-drug program together?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question, and I \nam on your side. I am on your side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am just about finished and then I will be glad to \nyield.\n  Mr. FORD. I apologize.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So, from my standpoint, as I told some of my friends to \nwhom I said I was not in a hurry to pass this legislation, I said, why \ndon't we continue to work on this bill until we get back. I said that \nbecause it is very contentious and Senators ought to have a chance to \nvent their positions and let the American people try to understand.\n  I have not been able to come to the floor because I been trying to \nhelp finish the ISTEA bill. I have noticed that the Senate floor time \nhas been filled with Senators talking about this bill. There have been \nno long quorum calls. I do not think there has been anything dilatory.\n  But, frankly, I have a number of amendments that I believe should be \noffered. This is our best opportunity to consider tax cuts. I intend to \ntalk about this bill.\n  I have dedicated 20 years of my career in the Senate getting our \nGovernment's size under control. I have had Senators congratulate me, \nsaying we are finally getting Government down a reasonable in size; it \nis not going to be so big. And then all of a sudden I see this bill \nthat will supersize Government--and I will gather more information for \nyou so I can do more comparisons--but this bill will add probably as \nmuch in new programs to this Government as we have been able to cut \nfrom this Government in our deficit reduction programs of the last 4 or \n5 years combined.\n  Government is government. Taxes are taxes. And, in our system, there \nis a relationship between the two. The higher the taxes, the bigger the \ngovernment. And the higher the taxes, the less free are people.\n  I will commit that we ought to tax cigarettes to discourage kids from \nbuying and smoking cigarettes. Senator Gramm and I will propose taxing \ncigarettes at 75 cents a pack in our substitute. But I do not believe \nthere is any magic formula as to how much you have to spend to try to \ndissuade kids from smoking.\n  If $600 billion is not enough, and we need $886 billion over 25 \nyears, then you cannot give anything back to the taxpayers.\n  But what if $500 billion is enough?\n  Or $400 billion is enough?\n  Then I believe that some of the money should be given back to the \npeople? That is essentially the issue.\n  It is as big an issue as any issue before us, because we do not need \nall the money called for in the McCain bill I have just told you \nabout--a dollar and a dime plus 49 cents plus 3 percent added on every \nyear. We do not need all that money for a cigarette program so we ought \nto not use it all.\n  Senator Gramm and I are going to offer the Senate an opportunity to \ngive some of the money back to people in the form of a tax cut.\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\n  I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico \nyielding to me. I have a piece of legislation in to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty, already having been introduced. I found, to my \nsurprise, that 52 percent of married couples get a marriage bonus. Not \nmany people know that. There is a marriage bonus for 52 percent. I \nforget how many million couples get a marriage bonus of about $1,300-\nplus. The marriage penalty is about $1,400-plus. If you wipe out the \npenalty and the bonus, we have a surplus of about $4 billion. If you \ntake the marriage bonus away and wipe out the marriage penalty, it is \nalmost a $4 billion surplus.\n  In the Senator's proposal here, what does the Senator propose, to \nmake up the difference in the marriage penalty and you leave the \nmarriage bonus in place?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not aware. Maybe Senator Gramm can help me. I am \nnot aware we changed the marriage bonus if there is one on this.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Parliamentary inquiry, who has the floor?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have the answer to that question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. No, we did not change the marriage bonus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. What was the answer?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The answer was ``no.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We don't change the marriage bonus.\n  Mr. FORD. The marriage bonus still stays there at $32 billion? The \nbonus is $32 billion?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield, the marriage bonus was put \nin place for single-income-earning families years ago. At that time, \nunder 50 percent of the families in this country had two incomes. But \ntoday, 69 percent of the families in this country have two incomes. So \nthe bonus became a penalty, because people were not able to get married \nremain in the same tax bracket as two singles earning the same combined \namount. My colleague from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico are \ndoing here what I have done in another bill, which I introduced with \nSenator Faircloth of North Carolina. Our bill allows married persons to \nchoose to file as they do now or to file as single persons. That way, \nmarriage versus single status will not have any tax consequences \nwhatsoever. What we want in this country is fairness and equity in our \nTax Code.\n  Mr. FORD. I am trying to find out an answer here. I understand the \nmarriage penalty. I am opposed to it, and I am trying to find an answer \nto it and the unfairness of it.\n  In 1986, we repealed the two-earner deduction, but increased the \nstandard deduction for married couples, and reduced the number of tax \nbrackets from 15 to 2. The combination of these changes reduced the \nmarriage penalty considerably.\n  Now it appears the EITC gets involved here, and I understand the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Texas is eliminating that, or is he \nkeeping that in?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. First of all, I want to make it clear--and I assume both \nthe Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico agree with me--I \nam sure not ashamed of trying to let working families, moderate-income \nfamilies, keep more of what they earn. What we are doing here on the \nEITC is saying--let's say that you have two very low-income people, \nboth of whom work. They fall in love. They get married. What we are \nsaying is, to see whether they are eligible for the earned-income tax \ncredit, which they will be. In another example, a single mother with \ntwo children----\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry, who has the floor? \nAs I understand the rules, no Senator can yield to another Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I still have the floor, Mr. President. I yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator aware that a waitress who had three \nchildren, and made $9,000 a year, and her prayers were answered and she \nmet a janitor who made $12,000 a year and his prayers were answered and \nthey got married, not only would she lose a $3,000 tax deduction, but \nshe would lose her earned-income tax credit?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. I understand that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator aware that under the amendment that we have \noffered, that same couple would be able to lower their income by \n$3,300, before they measured whether they qualified for the earned-\nincome tax credit, so that the net result would be that moderate--\npeople who make such a low income that they don't pay any income taxes, \npotentially, would still benefit from the provision in our amendment, \nso that people who are paying as much as $712 as a couple in these \ntobacco taxes would get some of that money back through lower income \ntaxes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is exactly right. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon my \nyielding the floor--it is my understanding the junior Senator from \nTexas requests 10 minutes, and I request that she be recognized. \nFollowing that, the junior Senator from Illinois? I propound that in \nthe form of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair for his courtesy, as well as his \nparliamentary ruling.\n  Mr. President, as we debate this historic tobacco legislation today, \n3,000 children across the country will try smoking for the first time. \nOf those 3,000 children, one-third, or 1,000, will become addicted is \nthe only way to describe it, addicted to nicotine and will face a \nfuture of diminished health. The health consequences of the use of \ntobacco products is our country's most preventable public health \nproblem, and our goal in this legislation is to stop underage smoking.\n  Our debate on this tobacco legislation is, indeed, a historic event. \nLess than a year ago, with the announcement of the June 1997 settlement \nreached between the States' attorneys general and the tobacco industry, \nfew would have foreseen that we would have comprehensive legislation to \naddress the national problem of underage use of tobacco products on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. I give particular commendation to the \nNation's attorneys general who deserve much credit for putting this \nissue in the forefront of public debate.\n  A year ago, the conventional wisdom may very well have been that the \nSenate would be incapable of debating comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation. It was then said the tobacco industry was too strong, its \ngrip upon the Congress too powerful. Mr. President, a different force \narose.\n  The sustained efforts of the public health community, and in \nparticular the former Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. C. \nEverett Koop, and the former FDA Commissioner, Dr. David Kessler, these \ntwo, as well as other public health advocates, have kept the focus on a \ncommon goal: a major reduction and hopefully the eventual elimination \nof underage smoking.\n  This legislation may not be perfect, but it does represent an \nextraordinary accomplishment. The initial Commerce Committee bill \noffered by Senator McCain was a crucial step in ensuring that the \ntobacco industry would not be allowed to stop the effort to protect our \nNation's children. After the Commerce Committee reported out its bill--\nand I am proud to say as a member of that committee I joined with a \ngreat majority of my colleagues in voting to report that bill out of \ncommittee--the tobacco industry walked away from the legislative \nprocess and then began an orchestration by the industry to end our \nefforts to protect our children.\n  The tobacco industry badly miscalculated again. Instead, our resolve \nto protect our children's future has been strengthened. This effort is \nof vital importance for the children of our Nation and for their future \nhealth.\n  In the 11 months since the proposed 1997 settlement, 990,000 underage \nchildren have become smokers. One-third,\n\n[[Page S5297]]\n\nor approximately 330,000, of those children will eventually die \nprematurely because of tobacco-related illnesses. This is a tragic \nstatistic. This undermining of our children's future health must end.\n  If a child begins smoking before he or she reaches the age of their \n18th birthday, there is an 80 percent likelihood that child will \ncontinue to smoke into adulthood. For these young children, the \ndecision to try smoking has ramifications far beyond their \nunderstanding at such a tender age. These young people view themselves \nas I suppose all generations of young people have--as being \nindestructible. They do not realize, nor fully comprehend, the \nsignificance of their decision. That is a condemnation to a possible \nfuture of lifetime addiction to tobacco and a possible lifetime \nthreatening health condition.\n\n  I keep using that word ``addiction'' because that is what we are \ntalking about, Mr. President, addiction. How urgent our efforts are to \nreinforce these efforts have been highlighted by the recent report from \nthe Centers for Disease Control, a report which indicates that the \nincrease of tobacco usage by underage youth has increased by alarming \nproportions.\n  Just 7 years ago, 27.5 percent of all high school students in America \nsmoked. In 1997, that number had risen to 36.4 percent. At the same \ntime, the number of adult smoking was declining. Young African-\nAmericans historically have been able to resist the tobacco industry's \nadvertising reach and had relatively low levels of underage tobacco \nuse. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. Smoking by African-\nAmerican students has almost doubled in the past 7 years, the fastest \ngrowth rate of any youth group over the past 6 years. White youth \nsmoking has increased by 28 percent, and Hispanics have increased by 34 \npercent over the same time period.\n  Overall, 5.5 million of our Nation's 15 million high-school-age \nchildren are smokers. This report's findings are most distressing. \nRather than gaining, we are losing ground in our effort to protect our \nchildren's health.\n  The decision to smoke or not to smoke is, we are told, an adult \nchoice, and I share that perspective. But we have learned that the \ntobacco industry has systematically focused its marketing strategies on \nunderage smokers and then lied about it. They lied to the American \npeople. They lied to the Congress.\n  To get middle-school-age children--these are youngsters who are not \nyet in high school--to try smoking and then to get them hooked on \nnicotine is the key to the tobacco industry's future markets and \nprofits. To hook these children at this early age means these young \npeople will have been smoking for 3 to 5 years before they have reached \nthe legal age to make that decision, the age of majority or adulthood \nat 18. What the tobacco industry has done is tantamount to a crime.\n  Let me be clear I strongly believe underage children also bear \nresponsibility when they attempt to use, purchase or possess tobacco \nproducts, and they need to be held accountable for their illegal \nactivity. I am pleased that at my request this legislation includes \nprovisions to require States to have penalties so that underage youth \nwho do try to purchase a tobacco product will know it is illegal and \nthat it carries consequences. These penalties can include community \nservice, fines and suspension of driver's license privileges. But \nholding young people responsible for illegal smoking or possessing \ntobacco products in no way excuses the tobacco industry for its \nshameless efforts to encourage underage smoking.\n  Our underage children have been the premeditated focus of the tobacco \nindustry's effort to ensure there is a future, and I use their \nterminology, ``replacement market'' for their products. This industry \nhas for years strategized as to the methodology to entice our youngest \nchildren to identify tobacco product brands with the sole purpose of \ngetting them to try smoking as early as possible. This industry knew \nthe earlier a child tries smoking, the greater the likelihood will be \nthat child will continue to smoke and become addicted to nicotine. Once \naddicted to nicotine, that child will very likely continue smoking into \nadulthood, and then the industry will have accomplished its goal: the \ncreation of a future replacement market for its products.\n  In the tobacco industry documents recently made public, this is \nmanifestly clear. An R.J. Reynolds document states:\n\n       This young adult market, the 14 to 24 group. . . \n     represent[s] tomorrow's cigarette business. As this 14 to 24 \n     age group matures, they will account for a key share of the \n     total cigarette volume--for at least the next 25 years.\n\n  Yesterday, Mr. President, I was privileged to attend the White House \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. I was impressed with the more than \n1,400 youngsters who gathered, representing America's youth, who made a \ndetermination not to be fooled by the tobacco industry. These young \npeople have already made a choice, and that choice is to say ``no'' to \nthe tobacco industry's attempt to take their future health away from \nthem.\n  The tobacco industry has tried to manipulate the legislative process \nby intimidation. But the industry's saber rattling about its ability to \nwin trials has been seriously undermined by its own actions.\n  The tobacco industry, among other criticisms of this bill, has \nconsistently maintained that any legislation not limited to the $386.5 \nbillion originally negotiated amount by the attorneys general and the \ntobacco industry in their June 1997 settlement would result in the \nbankruptcy of the industry.\n  The legislation we debate today is estimated to cost over $516 \nbillion over 25 years, and the tobacco industry is asserting that such \nan amount would result in their bankruptcy.\n  However, I think it is noteworthy to point out that during the course \nof the congressional deliberations on the attorneys general-industry \nsettlement, the tobacco industry itself has settled that it has \nvoluntarily entered into an agreement with the State of Mississippi for \n$3.4 billion, the State of Florida for $11.3 billion, the State of \nTexas for $15.3 billion, and, most recently, the State of Minnesota for \n$6.6 billion.\n  Now, the tobacco industry's willingness to pay these multibillion-\ndollar judgments in just 4 of the 41 States makes two very important \npoints. First, the industry's contention with respect to bankruptcy has \nbeen proven to be specious. These four settlements extrapolated to the \nremaining State lawsuits would cost the industry approximately $500 \nbillion, nearly the same amount as the cost of the McCain legislation.\n  A further note. This industry was prepared, as a consequence of the \nJune 1997 settlement that it voluntarily entered into, to decrease \nyouth smoking by approximately 40 percent. The industry did not seem \ntoo concerned in June of 1997 that a loss of 40 percent of their market \nwould bring about bankruptcy. And it does seem logical to believe that \nthe industry would not have voluntarily negotiated a settlement if they \nbelieved that settlement would put them out of business.\n  A second point, if I may, Mr. President. The magnitude of these \nsettlements only served to verify the industry's determination not to \nallow any lawsuit to go to a jury because they are fearful of the \noutcome--just what a jury might do once a jury fully understands the \negregious misconduct of this industry and the impact it has had upon \nour Nation's children.\n  So the tobacco industry has also pulled out another old scare tactic, \nthat this legislation creates a monster, convoluted, massive new \nbureaucracy. Quite to the contrary, this legislation does not. All \nadministrative efforts need to assure that the proper implementation of \nthis historic legislation will be done by currently existing agencies.\n  This legislation does provide for a very strong Food and Drug \nAdministration role in the efforts to stop underage tobacco use and to \nassure the public of our Nation that its safety and the safety of our \nyoung people will be its paramount concern.\n  Now, I have consistently supported the FDA's efforts to reduce \nunderage smoking. I am pleased that this bill will reinforce and, \nindeed, strengthen the ability of the FDA to continue to protect the \npublic health of our citizens. The legitimate concerns raised by \nconvenience store retailers who had feared they could, as a retail \ngroup or class, be prevented from selling tobacco products under the \nproposed\n\n[[Page S5298]]\n\nFDA regulations have been addressed. These retailers have now expressed \ntheir support for the proposed State licensing of business entities \nselling tobacco products as a means of further controlling access of \nthese products to underage children. Under the revised FDA regulation \nsection, the FDA will be able to revoke a retailer's license, on an \nindividual basis, to control those retailers who do not abide by sale \nrestrictions. This will protect those responsible retailers who are \ncommitted to preventing underage access to tobacco products, and to \npunish those who irresponsibly do not do all they can to prevent young \npeople from illegally purchasing tobacco products.\n  Mr. President, equally ridiculous to the bureaucracy ``scare'' is the \nassertion that a massive black market will emerge. On the floor, we \nhave heard over and over again the black-market warnings of Jim Pasco, \nthe executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police. What tobacco \nsupporters fail to tell us is that this same gentleman is on the \npayroll of Philip Morris, this country's largest tobacco company.\n\n  So I conclude, Mr. President, by observing that the arguments made by \nthe opponents of this legislation are pure smokescreens. The issue is \nreally simple: Will Congress have the courage to vote on the side of \nAmerica's youngsters and to protect our youngsters from the possible \nlifetime health-crippling afflictions that are attributed to the use of \ntobacco that cause the premature death of hundreds of thousands of \npeople each year or will it support the tobacco industry?\n  I hope my colleagues will take the courageous and historic step to \nvote for this legislation and to protect the young people in America.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized to speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak \nafter Senator Durbin. We have an amendment that we are offering \ntogether, and I would like to be able to speak right after his speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Would the Senator yield before she starts for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator might yield \nto me for 1 minute.\n  Mr. FORD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, everyone agrees that children should \nnot smoke. They do not have the maturity or judgment to understand the \nrisks of their decision.\n  Mr. FORD. May we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Where we differ is, how do we achieve this result? \nForty States have now filed lawsuits to engage the tobacco industry in \naccepting the responsibility for its actions. Recent evidence \ndemonstrates tobacco companies targeted children in their advertising, \nand the industry may have manipulated scientific research in its favor. \nThis, obviously, is outrageous.\n  We have a historic opportunity to limit youth smoking and to disclose \nall the information concerning the health risks of adult tobacco use.\n  Four States have moved forward and reached settlements. My State is \none of those. As a member of the Commerce Committee, which drafted the \nfirst version of the legislation before us, my principal concern was to \nensure that nothing we did at the Federal level would undermine the \nagreements that have been reached by the individual States.\n  I appreciate Senator McCain for his support of my amendments in the \ncommittee, most of which are in the bill before us, that would hold \nthose States harmless.\n  In my view, the most critical aspect of the Texas settlement and of \nthe State attorneys general agreement that was reached with the \nindustry was the restrictions on advertising and marketing that the \nindustry accepted. These restrictions were tacit admission by the \nindustry that its practice of marketing to teens was unacceptable.\n  These restrictions are critical to our cause of reducing teen \nsmoking. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the tobacco \nindustry did reduce its advertising, the greatest effect would probably \nbe among teens. This report notes that studies show that teens are more \nsensitive than adults to brand-specific advertising.\n\n  I voted for the original version of this bill in the Commerce \nCommittee in large part because of the testimony of the attorneys \ngeneral. They said the industry acquiescence in a ban on advertising, \ncombined with a limit on industry liability, was the critical policy \nmix needed to attack the problem of teen smoking. That is why I voted \nagainst the Gregg amendment that was just before the Senate. That \namendment will remove the liability limits.\n  The reason a limit on liability was deemed important by the attorneys \ngeneral was that the tobacco companies are the source of funds for the \nsmoking cessation programs in this bill. If tobacco companies are sued \nout of business, new ones that aren t held to the standards of this \nbill will replace them and we will have the worst of all worlds. We \nwill have new tobacco companies that do not have liabilities because \nthey haven't advertised to teens and committed the other misdeeds of \nthe present ones. They will not be bound by the restrictions on \nadvertising. I am afraid we will do more damage if we pass a bill that \nhas no limitations on liability and no restrictions on advertising. \nThis balance between advertising restrictions and liability limitations \nis what the attorneys general put forward, and I think we must \nrecapture it.\n  In the Texas agreement and in the State attorneys general agreement, \nthe tobacco companies are partners in the effort to stop teen smoking. \nLargely through the voluntary advertising and marketing restrictions in \nthe legislation that was before the Commerce Committee, we would be \nable to achieve our result to stop teen smoking. The tobacco companies \nhave now walked, and I am afraid this is not a good development. I hope \nwe can restore the balance and, in our zeal to punish the tobacco \ncompanies, that we do not destroy the very companies we expect to pay \nfor the programs in our bill that can end teen smoking.\n  Without the advertising restrictions, I believe what we have before \nthe Senate is a tax bill. We have to decide if raising the price of \ncigarettes would have the effect of stopping teens from buying them.\n  Now, most parents would be experts in answering the question: Will \nthe demand for cigarettes by teenagers go down if we raise the price? \nThey know, for example, that a $200 pair of tennis shoes or a $75 pair \nof sunglasses sound perfectly reasonable to a teenager. To those teens, \nthere probably isn't much difference between a pack of cigarettes that \ncosts $2.25 or $3.75. Unfortunately, the Congressional Budget Office \nstudy tends to support this common sense observation. According to the \nCBO study that said teens are sensitive to advertising, teens are not \nvery responsive to tobacco price changes. In fact, studies show that, \nunder some circumstances, there is no impact on teen demand when \ncigarette prices rise.\n  I have spoken to teens about this. I have asked them, Will raising \nthe price from $2.25 to $3.75 make a difference? What I have found is \nthat teens do think this is a pocketbook issue. But it is not the one \nyou think. It is not the money in their pocketbooks that will make the \ndifference to teens; it is their driver's license. Teens say that what \nwill really deter them from smoking is the threat of losing their \ndriving privileges. In fact, a study by the Texas Department of Health \nfound that 64 percent of teenagers said they would not smoke if they \nthought they would lose their driver's licenses. This was compared to \n48 percent who said a $250 fine would deter them. My State legislature \npassed legislation that imposed tough penalties on tobacco use for \nunderage Texans, including suspension of their driver's licenses.\n  I am very concerned about what I consider to be essentially a tax \nbill, because we have lost the balance that we had in the attorneys \ngeneral agreement. If it is going to be a tax bill, let's be honest; it \nis a tax bill on lower- and middle-income people. It may also lead to a \nblack market problem.\n\n[[Page S5299]]\n\n  Before I came to the U.S. Senate, I was the treasurer of the State of \nTexas. In Texas, the treasurer was the tobacco tax collector. I have \ndealt with the black market. I have seen how differences in tobacco \ntaxes between states affect the black market. My agency did raids on \nflea markets and roadside sales of illegal cigarettes that didn't have \nstamps on them, and I can tell you something: We stopped truckloads \ncoming from Louisiana into Texas and into the flea markets because \nthere was a significant difference in taxes between Louisiana and \nTexas--it s a 21 cent a pack difference today. In fact, the estimates \nof the nonpartisan Tax Foundation show that my State of Texas loses \n$172 million in revenue annually due to the black market in tobacco. \nThat is because we live next to a State that has a 21-cent lower tax \nand next to a country, Mexico, where cheaper cigarettes are available.\n\n  In Canada, they had the exact same experience when they increased the \ncigarette tax in 1991. Smuggling became such a problem that many \nprovinces cut their own taxes to make it less lucrative. What did that \nlead to? Instead of smuggling, there was a black market between the \nProvinces. The government of British Columbia estimates losses of as \nmuch as $100 million a year.\n  This is the reason that the National Association of Police \nOrganizations has asked us to be very cautious with the legislation \nbefore the Senate. According to the executive director, Mr. Robert \nScully, this bill could lead to an increase in cigarette smuggling \nbeyond the control of organized law enforcement.\n  All of us are struggling to try to do the right thing. I believe that \nI can truthfully say every Member of the U.S. Senate has the same goal: \nTo stop teen smoking. However, how we get there is the question, and I \ndon't think we are close to agreement on what is the right path to that \ngoal.\n  I am not going to vote for taxes that will run out of business the \ntobacco companies that can pay for the health and smoking cessation \nprograms. This would result in the emergence into the market of new \ncompanies not bound by our restrictions because they would have no \nhistory of wrong-doing. Then we would have no funding for the health \nprograms, no voluntary restriction on the advertising, and we will \nnever reach the goal of stopping teen smoking.\n  I am not going to vote for a tax increase that is so high that it \ncauses a black market in my State of Texas as well as Arizona, New \nMexico, and California, that borders Mexico, or where the price of \ncigarettes is very cheap. I am not going to vote for a bill that does \nnot have a reasonable chance of a balance that will achieve the goal of \nstopping teen smoking.\n  We are going to have a lot of votes. I hope we can come up with a \nbill that I believe will reach that reasonable balance. I have not seen \nit yet. I hope that in the end we will not pass a bill that will create \na black market, that will create more crime, that will take away the \nsource of revenue that could help us pay for ads to stop teen smoking. \nAnd I hope we will not, in our zeal to punish the tobacco companies, \nhave them walk away from the restrictions on advertising which they can \nonly do voluntarily because it is their first amendment right to do so.\n  I hope I can vote for a responsible bill, Mr. President. I hope \neveryone in the Senate will come together to try to achieve an \nagreement that will produce the result of stopping teen smoking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Oregon has a \nunanimous consent request. Would he be able to make that request \nwithout jeopardizing my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time--I \nhave offered an important look-back amendment in the Commerce Committee \nand worked with Senators Durbin and DeWine--that I be allowed to \naddress this amendment after Senators Durbin and DeWine this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, for those who are following this debate, I hope they \nwill understand that we are genuinely trying to move this bill to final \npassage. This bipartisan bill is the product of the Commerce Committee, \ncrafted by Senators McCain, Kerry, Hollings, and others in an effort to \ndo something historic to reduce the number of teenagers and children in \nAmerica who are lured into the addiction of smoking.\n  We have tried to establish a procedure on the floor, which \noccasionally we have been able to hold to, and occasionally we fail. \nBut that procedure was to allow each side to offer an amendment. Of \ncourse, Senator Gregg had offered his amendment, and, after some \nmotions, then Senator Gramm of Texas offered his amendment. At that \npoint, I was supposed to have been next. But as it stands, now I am \ncoming up with this look-back amendment in this fashion. It is an \namendment which I am happy to sponsor with Senator DeWine of Ohio, as \nwell as Senator Wyden of Oregon, Senator Chafee of Rhode Island, \nSenators Harkin, Collins, Kennedy, Snowe, Daschle, Conrad, and Reed. \nThis is truly a bipartisan amendment. I hope that those who are \nfollowing this debate will understand the significance of this \namendment.\n  The look-back provisions in the bill are really important in terms of \nenforcement. This term look-back is a relatively new term. It is not \none created by the Congress. It is, in fact, a term of art which came \nabout as a result of negotiation after the State attorneys general sat \ndown with the tobacco companies. This is really an effort to make \ncertain that the tobacco companies keep their word and reduce the \nnumber of young people in America who are smoking.\n  We have talked about imposing a new tax, or fee, on tobacco products \nwith the belief that it will reduce teen smoking. But we are not \ncertain. We don't know how much we will be able to achieve by \nincreasing the tobacco fee by $1.10 a pack. We believe it could be \nsignificant. But it may not be enough.\n  That is why we have what is called a look-back provision. This is how \nit works. In years to come, we will do a survey of teenagers across \nAmerica, and we will take a look particularly at children who are \nsmoking. We will try to determine how many are smoking. We will also be \nable to determine what brands of tobacco they are using. With that \ninformation, we will be able to measure the effectiveness of the goal \nof this bill. We will look back on a periodic basis to determine how \nmany children have been taken from the ranks of smokers or have not \nbeen recruited in the first place, and we will take a look at what they \nare smoking.\n\n  The look-back provisions are an important part of the agreement with \nthe States' attorneys general. The tobacco companies knew this had to \nbe part of the bargain. They couldn't walk away from the table with all \nof the things they hoped for, walk away from liability in a State suit, \nfor example, without some assurance that they were in fact going to be \ngenuine in their efforts to reduce teen smoking. The look-back language \nthat is included in the McCain bill which came from the Commerce \nCommittee is a very good start, but only a start.\n  That is the reason I am offering this amendment with Senator DeWine \nand others. We want to construct an effective look-back provision that \nwill change companies' behavior and give them incentives to stop \nmarketing to children.\n  Our look-back amendment does two very important things. First, it \nshifts the emphasis on any look-back assessment so that it will fall \nprimarily onto tobacco companies that are the worst offenders rather \nthan primarily on the industry as a whole. That is a major element in \nthis debate.\n  If you were to ask what is the difference between the Durbin and \nDeWine amendment as opposed to the Commerce Committee bill, it is the \nfact that when we look back and determine whether or not the tobacco \ncompanies are keeping their word, whether in fact they are no longer \nmarketing and selling to children, we believe at least in this \namendment that we should hold individual companies responsible. The \nMcCain bill, the Commerce bill, as good as it is--I think it\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\nis a good bill--looks at it primarily from an industry viewpoint. I \nwill try to spell out here in more detail why I think that is not the \nway to go.\n  The second thing we do that is very important is, we restore the \nsmoking reduction targets that were originally agreed to by the tobacco \nindustry in their proposed settlement with the States' attorneys \ngeneral last June. On both scores, this amendment is about \naccountability. Will these companies change their behavior? Will they \nstop their insidious marketing practices? Will they get honest in terms \nof the retailing of their product? We can find out. We can measure it. \nWe can hold them accountable. If they don't live up to the reduction \nlevels proposed in the legislation, they will face financial incentives \nto create the right climate and the right results.\n  Why do we need look-backs? Effective look-back provisions can help \nachieve the goal of reducing youth tobacco use and change the current \nincentives that drive tobacco companies to market to children. Make no \nmistake. We have gone through this debate over and over. You will \nrecall that for years the tobacco companies used to say, ``This isn't \nfair. We are not trying to sell to kids.'' Then, of course, lawsuits \nwere filed across the Nation. We required them to disclose the \ndocuments they were using. Along come these documents. It turns out \nthat these tobacco company executives were not as honest as they should \nhave been.\n  You all may recall this great scene that occurred about 4 years ago \nin the U.S. House of Representatives when the eight tobacco company \nexecutives came before the Commerce Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives. This ``gang of eight'' raised their hands and solemnly \nsaid under oath that nicotine is not addictive. America laughed, \nbecause they knew that once again the tobacco companies had made an \nincredible statement, literally one that had no credence whatsoever. \nWhen the tobacco companies told us nicotine wasn't addictive, that they \nwere not adding nicotine or manipulating it in cigarettes, that they \nwere not trying to sell to kids, it turns out they were wrong on all \ncounts. So much for the credibility of the ``gang of eight.'' \nIncidentally, they are no longer the managers of these companies. But, \nnevertheless, their successors still have to be held accountable.\n  Today, each new child who starts to smoke represents a new profit \nopportunity for tobacco companies. Tobacco companies have a tough go of \nit. Think about it. If you were running their business--every year they \nlose 2 million of their best customers. But a half a million people \nwill die from tobacco-related diseases. Another 1.5 million will \nfinally be able to quit and break the habit, or will die of other \ncauses.\n  If you are running a company losing 2 million customers a year, you \nneed new ones. Where will you turn? You know adults are not your most \nlikely market. They are usually smarter, a little more mature, and they \nknow the danger of tobacco. They are not easily lured into the \naddiction. You have to go after the kids, and get the kids in their \nrebellious youth when they are willing to try anything and think they \nare going to live forever, and get them started on tobacco. If you can \nget a kid to start smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco, it will \ndevelop into an addiction. The drug in that tobacco will go into that \nchild's system and create a craving for this product that is very tough \nto stop. For those children who think that it is an easy thing to quit \nthis addiction, it is not. The earlier they try to stop, the better. \nBut the tobacco companies know that.\n  Since most smokers start as children, children are the only available \nreplacement smokers to take the place of these 2 million lost \ncustomers. In addition, we know that smokers are generally very loyal \nto the first brand that they smoke. We all know people who will only \nsmoke certain brands--Marlboros, the cancer cowboy's cigarette, or \nKools, Camels, whatever it happens to be. Many people who started with \nthe brand when they were kids stay with it for a lifetime, albeit a \nshortened lifetime.\n  These facts and the desire to give their shareholders steady profits \nlead the tobacco companies to market to children to ensure their future \nmarkets. The strong look-back provisions will totally reverse the \neconomic incentives for marketing to children. It will say to the \nindustry and to each company that they have an incentive to prevent \ntheir products from appealing to children. Manufacturers will start \nusing what they have learned about teenage tobacco use to avoid having \nchildren use their products because every new child who picks up a \ncigarette or pockets a can of snuff will be an economic loss to the \ncompany.\n  Our goal is not to punish the companies or gain revenues. If this \nnever generates a cent, that would be fine. But basically what we are \ntrying to do is meet the smoking reduction targets. Our goal is to \ncreate the incentives which help achieve actual reductions in underage \ntobacco use so companies might never have to pay a penny of these look-\nback assessments. We are going to do our part. We are going to have \nyouth access restrictions, counteradvertising, public education, and \nother governmental efforts to reduce youth smoking. We expect the \ntobacco manufacturers to do their part as well. And that is what this \namendment is all about--accountability.\n  Why focus on company-specific assessments? In the bill that is \npending, a much greater share of the look-back assessments are imposed \non the whole industry rather than on specific companies. There is a $4 \nbillion annual cap on industry-wide payments that is much greater than \nthe company-specific assessment. Although the company-specific charges \ncould be as much as $3 to $4 billion in extreme cases, it is more \nlikely they are going to be a lot smaller. If all the companies miss \ntheir target by 10 percentage points, the company-specific surcharges \nwould only equal $640 million. If they miss by 20 percent, it would be \n$1.3 billion compared to nearly $4 billion for the industry as a whole.\n  Let me show a chart here which gives you an idea of the difference \nbetween the look-back provisions that we are discussing.\n  Consider the fact that we are setting these targets to reduce youth \nsmoking, and these targets say that over a 10-year period of time we \nare going to bring down smoking among kids by a certain percentage.\n  What happens, let's say, in the fifth year after this legislation \npasses when the tobacco companies as an industry are supposed to reduce \nthe number of kids smoking by 40 percent? What happens if the largest \ncompany misses it by 20 percent, if instead of having a 40-percent \nreduction, they only have a 20-percent reduction?\n  Look at what occurs. Under this comparison of the Commerce Committee \nbill, and this amendment by Senator DeWine and myself, the industry as \na whole would face a penalty of 10 cents a pack and the individual \ncompany 9 cents a pack if they miss it by 20 percent under the Commerce \nCommittee bill.\n  But look at the other side now if our amendment prevails--6 cents for \nthe industry per pack, but 29 cents for the offending company. Doesn't \nthat make more sense? If we know as a result of our surveys that the \nkids are smoking Camels, for example, shouldn't R.J. Reynolds be held \naccountable? They are the company that makes the brand. They market the \nbrand. They retail the brand. They have an obligation under this law to \nreduce teen usage of their brand of cigarettes.\n  If you don't do that, think of the perverse situation where one \ncompany is trying its best to reduce teen usage and youth usage and \nanother company ignores it. Under this bill, the penalty is spread \nacross the industry by and large, and there is not that much of a \nforfeiture of funds for the individual company as would occur under the \nDeWine and Durbin amendment. We want to make this more company-\nspecific.\n\n  This approach, which currently is in the bill, risks creating \nincentives for some company to keep building future market share. There \nis money to be made here. As long as these kids are smoking, these \ncompanies are making money. We want to make sure the profit is taken \nout of this. Our amendment increases the company-specific payments, \nreduces the industry-wide payments.\n  This amendment will not necessarily increase the price of cigarettes. \nI want to really pause for a moment on this point because I think it is \nso important. We have had a lengthy debate\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\nover the last several days about whether or not we are imposing, at \nleast indirectly, new taxes on lower income individuals, whether by \nraising the price of a package of cigarettes we are passing along to \nlower income and middle-income individuals more of a tax burden.\n  Think about this for a moment. Assume we have two companies and the \nDurbin-DeWine amendment is enacted. One of the companies is doing a \ngood job; it is reducing its sales to minors--very happy with the \nresults. The other company has made a calculation. The other company \nsays we are not going to be so tough or restrictive. We will, frankly, \nlook the other way. We are going to continue to do some marketing that \nwe know appeals to kids. We are going to kind of tell our retailers we \nare not going to enforce the law that stringently, and so look what \nhappens. If that occurs under the existing bill, they are both going to \nbe treated equally in the industry-wide assessments; both will be \nfacing these additional costs per pack equally.\n  Under our approach, it will be significantly different and the \ncompany that is a bad actor, the company that is not trying to reduce \nsales to kids is a company that will face a much, much larger charge \nper pack. Now, what do you do? If you are the company that has been \nselling to kids, it turns out kids are smoking your brand, you are \nfacing this kind of payment. You can't add this price to the package of \ncigarettes because your competitor isn't doing the same. You have to \nabsorb this cost in your bottom line. So the consumers are protected \nfrom the price increase, and basically the company really pays a price \nfor what they have done.\n  This bill presently before us also reduces youth smoking reduction \ntargets relative to what the industry agreed to last year. This second \nand very important element in the bill is one I would like us to pause \nand reflect on. Just last year, these tobacco companies came together, \nand with the State attorneys general said we agree to the following \ntargets to reduce the number of smokers each year.\n  Well, a year has passed. The issue has come to Capitol Hill. We \ndebated it back and forth and now we have a chance to enact this \nlegislation. What has happened during the course of that year? The \ntobacco companies have done very well. They have done very well in \nluring more children into this addiction. In fact, since 1991, we have \nseen a dramatic increase in the percentage of kids who are smoking. \nThat is a sad commentary. It is a sad fact of life.\n  What Senator DeWine and I are doing in our amendment is going back to \nthe original targets the tobacco companies set in their agreement with \nthe attorneys general. So instead of the McCain or Commerce Committee \nbill reducing smoking by 60 percent of kids over 10 years, we hit a \ntarget of 67 percent in the equivalent course of time, getting them to \nquit or sparing more kids from the possibility of becoming smokers and \nof facing disease and premature death. Four-hundred and fifty thousand \nmore children will be protected with the Durbin-DeWine amendment by the \nyear 2008 than in the underlying bill. There will be 450,000 fewer \nsmokers if the tobacco companies continue to meet their reduction \ntargets of 67 percent instead of 60 percent; 150,000 fewer premature \ndeaths--we know that about a third of smokers are going to die young as \na result of this habit; $2.8 billion in lifetime social costs are \navoided; and we have the same real target as the original proposed \nsettlement. I think that makes sense.\n  The next question is the constitutionality question. The tobacco \ncompanies claim that these look-back provisions are unconstitutional. \nBut both the Department of Justice and the Congressional Research \nService have studied the issue and concluded they are wrong. Just as we \nhold companies responsible for clean air attainment standards, we can \nhold them responsible to help reduce youth smoking rates.\n  The courts have required that there be a rational basis for this type \nof program, and this amendment is based on a very rational \nconsideration. If companies' assessments or surcharges raise their cost \nof doing business as usual, they will consider it an incentive to \nchange their behavior and use the knowledge they have gained over the \nyears in terms of selling to kids, to stop selling to kids.\n  With regard to the argument that this might violate due process, the \npurpose of the look-back assessments is to supplement the other \nmeasures in the bill designed to reduce youth smoking rates, including \nthe bill's price increases, and to encourage the industry, which is \nuniquely able to develop innovative strategies, to take the action to \nminimize youth smoking.\n  The look-back provisions don't violate the Constitution's bill of \nattainder. All of us who studied the Constitution over the years \nwondered if we would ever run into a case where somebody would start \ntalking about a bill of attainder. I didn't think I would ever face \nthat in my life on Earth, and here we are on the floor of the Senate \ntalking about a bill of attainder.\n  The bill of attainder in the Constitution prohibits singling out \nparticular individuals or entities for legislatively mandated \npunishments. The tobacco companies have said: Oh, this look-back \nprovision is a bill of attainder. The Department of Justice states the \nlook-back provisions apply to all manufacturers of tobacco products, \nnot a single company, and would operate as one component of a \ncomprehensive industry-wide reform. Additionally, look-back provisions \nare not penalties for industry misconduct so much as an affirmative \nstep to reduce youth smoking.\n  I think the tobacco industry's constitutional argument is a weak one, \ndesigned to shift away the attention from their marketing to kids.\n  Let me respond quickly to a few other items, and then I will be happy \nto defer to my colleague and cosponsor, Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand where you are going with this, and it is \nbeginning to take hold. But in this piece of legislation, does HHS have \nthe ability to put on the educational programs that would reduce youth \nsmoking and the tobacco industry would have no control over that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I thank the Senator for raising that.\n  Mr. FORD. But the point here, then, is that I am putting out all this \ninformation, and it doesn't work; then you get fined. I am a little bit \nconcerned about that. I understand where the Senator is coming from. \nBut I think we need to cover one more base, that if the tobacco \nindustry is going to be responsible for the percentage reduction, and, \nif it isn't, then they pay, they ought to be able to be charged with \nadvertising, or something, rather than letting HHS do it. And if it \ndoesn't work, they get penalized.\n  As we say down home, ``Something about that ain't right,'' and I hope \nthe Senator, with all his knowledge of this area, would look somehow to \nbe sure that, if you are going to be charged with a penalty here, \nsomehow you ought to have some input on how it is completed. You might \nbe able to clear me up on that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Kentucky raises a dilemma, and that is: \nHow much could we trust the tobacco industry coming up with the goal?\n  Mr. FORD. They can't.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think it is more likely a public health agency will try \nto reduce those numbers. I can recall a few years ago the tobacco \ncompanies said, ``We are going to stop marketing to kids, and we are \ngoing to tell these kids we don't want their business.'' And they \ndelivered their message by buying full-page ads in the Wall Street \nJournal. There may be some kids who read the Wall Street Journal, but \nnot a lot of them. It is far better to take that information and \nmessage and put it on a television show the kids are likely to watch.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my friend, I take this as if they were doing it to \nme as an individual and saying that you are going to be penalized--I am \ngoing to be penalized if your program doesn't work. And some companies, \na brand only has about 1 percent of youth. They don't like it, and they \ndon't use it. But if you reduce it down, if it is 1 percent, which one \nbrand is, then you have to reduce that to six-tenths of 1 percent. That \nbecomes very difficult when it is all adults.\n  I agree with what you are trying to do. I hope somehow or another we \ncan make it fair rather than unfair.\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his question, and I hope what we \nare doing is a coordinated effort. It is an effort which increases the \nfee on a package of cigarettes, which we have been told by economists, \nin and of itself, will reduce youth usage. It is an effort to change \nthe advertising so that, by and large, children are not affected by the \nlure of that advertising. It is an effort by the Government--and the \nSenator is right--through HHS and others, to deliver this message \neffectively. But finally it comes down to the tobacco companies \nthemselves who make the product and market the product and sell the \nproduct. And they bear a responsibility, too, a responsibility which, \nif they don't live up to it, is going to result in a charge against \neach package of cigarettes.\n  Let me just conclude with two or three points before deferring to the \nSenator from Ohio. Some say the 67 percent reduction figure over 10 \nyears is too high. I don't believe it is. Marijuana use by 12- to 17-\nyear-olds declined 76 percent from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. \nThe smoking rate among black 12th graders in the late 1970s was the \nsame as the rate for all teenagers today. It declined by 76 percent \nfrom the late 1970s to the early 1990s, without advertising \nrestrictions, education, and counteradvertising envisioned in the \ncurrent legislation.\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of adult smokers and 70 percent of \nadolescent smokers regret ever starting to smoke. I think we have a \nsituation here where 67 percent is a figure that can be reached, and \nthe actual number of young people who would then stop smoking is one \nthat was agreed to by the tobacco companies when they met with the \nattorneys general just last year.\n  Why do we want to strengthen this bill? Because, frankly, we believe \nthat unless the industry is held to this standard on a specific company \nbasis, the results will not be what we hope they will be. Some people \nsay the amount of the payment here is more than the lifetime profit \nfrom each new young smoker.\n  First, let's not get caught up in the debate of what is a lifetime \nprofit from a new smoker. Is it only $500 or $1,000 or $1,500? I am not \nsure we accept these claims.\n  Second, these companies are not just profit maximizers; they want \nvolume. Why? Why would the tobacco industry want volume over profit? \nBecause they are dealing with people who are addicted to nicotine, who \nwill have to follow them up the track as the price increases. So they \ndo not focus just on profits but also on volume. And we have to find a \nway to reduce the volume when it comes to children.\n  Third, even this calculation does not get to the true cost of \naddicting a child on tobacco. The American Medical Association has \nestimated we would have to increase the surcharges to $400 million per \npercentage point--more than 6 times what the bill does in its company-\nspecific look-back--to cover the societal cost of each additional \nsmoker. It is about more than tobacco company profits; it is about the \ncost to America and American families as a result.\n  I think what we are setting out to do here is create a payment \nstructure that is reasonable. Under the bill, companies will pay an \nindustry-wide payment of $80 million for each of the first 5 percentage \npoints by which they missed the targets, $160 million for each of the \nnext 5 points, $240 million for the next 12, maxing out at $4 billion. \nEach company that misses the target will pay a company-specific \nsurcharge of $1,000 multiplied by the number of children by which a \ncompany falls short of in its target. There is no maximum for the \ncompany-specific surcharge, which could reach as much as 3 to 4 billion \ndollars in an extreme case.\n\n  Under our agreement, companies will pay an industry-wide payment of \n$40 million for each of the first 5 percentage points by which the \nindustry as a whole misses the targets, plus $120 million for each of \nthe next 15 points, with a maximum of $2 billion. Each company that \nmisses the targets will also pay a company-specific surcharge equal to \nthe company's share of youth smokers multiplied by $80 million for each \nof the first 5 percentage points, $240 million for each of the next 19 \npoints, with a maximum of $5 billion.\n  The potential maximum surcharges are similar in the aggregate. Ours \nis weighted towards companies as opposed to towards the industry as a \nwhole.\n  Let me close by saying that I am happy that this is, in fact, a \nbipartisan amendment. For those who have argued on the floor over the \nlast 2 days that they want to make certain that we don't increase the \nprice of the product too much for lower-income groups, the Durbin-\nDeWine amendment addresses that directly. When you go company-specific, \nthe money comes off the bottom line. For those who say that the targets \nthat the State attorneys general agreed on to reduce the number of kids \nsmoking were reasonable, as those tobacco companies said then, this \nbill returns to those targets. We think this is sensible. Let us reward \nthose companies which are engaged in good conduct, reducing youth \nusage. Let us make those pay who do not engage in good conduct.\n  I am happy to have this amendment offered today in the Senate, and I \nam proud to have as my cosponsor the Senator who will be speaking next, \nmy friend who served in the other body with me and now is the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine.\n  At this point, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, to offer this amendment, an amendment to make \nthe tobacco companies more accountable in our collective effort to \nreduce youth smoking.\n  Specifically, our amendment would make a few improvements--a few \nimprovements, but significant ones--to the so-called look-back \nprovisions of this current legislation. The look-back provision in the \ncurrent bill sets targets for the reduction of teen tobacco use. And, \nthen, it imposes assessments, or surcharges, on individual tobacco \ncompanies and the entire tobacco industry if these reduction targets \nare not met.\n  Our amendment would make two simple modifications to Chairman \nMcCain's look-back provision.\n  No. 1, our amendment, like the McCain bill, would impose a surcharge \non specific companies as well as the entire industry, if reduction \ntargets are not met. Both our amendment and the McCain amendment are \nblends of those two formulas. They are different, a different blend, as \nI will talk about in a moment.\n  Our amendment puts a larger emphasis, though, on the company-specific \nsurcharge. We do this because we believe the threat of a surcharge \nagainst specific companies will give them a much stronger incentive to \nlimit teen tobacco use. In a sense, it is sort of the American way. We \nhold people accountable. We hold them accountable--we give them the \nbenefit of what they do as well as the detriment if they do something \nwrong.\n  (Mr. BENNETT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DeWINE. Second, Mr. President, our amendment will increase the \ntargets for reduction of youth tobacco use over what is in the McCain \nbill. But actually with our amendment, we are restoring, as Senator \nDurbin has pointed out, the original reduction targets that were agreed \nto by the industry last year in the global settlement. The net effect \nof our amendment is to restore what the tobacco companies said and \nagreed to last year and said that they could do.\n  Let me repeat, we are not increasing the final reduction targets. \nRather, we are simply restoring the original targets that were agreed \nto in last year's settlement.\n  Before getting into the specifics of this amendment, I first \ncongratulate my good friend, John McCain, who has put together a very \ncredible, a comprehensive, a good bill. He has faced a very difficult \nchallenge and has crafted an excellent piece of legislation. This is a \ncomprehensive package that attacks teen smoking in a variety of ways. I \nbelieve this thorough approach, when all the pieces of the puzzle are \nfinally put together, will significantly reduce teen smoking. Let's \nmake no mistake about it, that is our objective--to reduce teen \nsmoking; to reduce the number of young people every day in this country \nwho start smoking.\n  I have followed the policy evolution of the look-back provisions \nsince they\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\nwere first proposed in that global tobacco settlement announced last \nJune, announced by the attorneys general and by the leading tobacco \ncompanies' executives. That settlement contained a look-back provision. \nThat settlement contained this brand new and innovative idea--the idea \nthat we could enlist the tobacco industry in our fight to reduce teen \nsmoking by simply giving them a disincentive to hook young people on \ntobacco.\n  The look-back provision in the original settlement called on the \ncompanies to work with us to reduce youth smoking by 60 percent after \nthe passage of 10 years. That 60 percent was to be phased in at several \nintermediate levels. The settlement negotiators, including the tobacco \nindustry, all agreed to these reduction targets. They obviously \nbelieved that they were achievable.\n  The settlement then gave the tobacco industry a big shove, a big \nshove to meet these targets by calling for an industry-wide surcharge \nin any year the targets were missed. The amount of the surcharge was to \nbe based on how much the industry missed the reduction targets, up to a \nmaximum or limit, a cap of $2 billion.\n  While I look at this, I recognize really from the beginning, the \nlook-back could be a tremendously useful tool in reducing youth \nsmoking. The tobacco industry, driven by a profit motive, has been \nincredibly effective in convincing our children to start smoking. If \nthe financial disincentive was strong enough, we would have a way to \nput the industry's expertise to prevent youth smoking and to turn this \nwhole thing around.\n  After studying the settlement's look-back proposal, I have two basic \nconcerns: First, I was concerned that the proposed surcharges were not \nhigh enough to work as a significant deterrent to the tobacco \ncompanies. Second, I had some concerns about the settlement's way of \ndistributing the surcharges across the entire industry; in other words, \nhow they determined who was going to pay what. This was an issue I \nexplored in several committee hearings, both in the Judiciary Committee \nand in our Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  This approach, frankly, if I can use the term, seems almost \nsocialistic to me, the provision that was originally agreed to. The \nprovision calls for looking back first at the end of 3 years and \nperiodically after that to see how well the tobacco industry had done \nin reducing youth smoking, and then once we found that out, \nirrespective of how an individual brand did or individual company did \nin reducing youth smoking, to then say, ``OK, we're going to spread it \nout in the industry; in fact, we are going to spread it out, not based \non the percentage of youth who were smoking a particular brand, we are \ngoing to take that penalty and spread it out among adult users.''\n  So if a particular company had 20 percent, for example, of the youth \nmarket, but 60 percent of the adult market, then, in fact, that company \nwould end up taking 60 percent of the burden of the look-back penalty. \nIt is, in effect, socialism. It is something I think that should offend \nevery Member of the Senate. It is not right, it is not fair, and that \nis why we are changing it in this amendment. Frankly, that is why \nSenator McCain put together an amendment, a compromise, that did, in \nfact, begin to go down this road. Our amendment simply goes a little \nfurther.\n  Any company under the original settlement that did its job in \nreducing youth tobacco use would have to share the benefit of this good \nbehavior with its fellow tobacco companies. Likewise, a company that \nfailed to reduce youth smoking would not bear the brunt of the \nresulting surcharges because the payments would be spread across the \nindustry.\n  This approach would have the effect really of diluting the incentive \nfor individual companies to work as hard as they can to prevent teens \nfrom using their products. After all, why would a company try to \nprevent kids from smoking its cigarettes, perhaps creating a \ncompetitive disadvantage for itself in the larger adult market when \nother companies would share in the reward for whatever success they had \nin reducing teen smoking? It just doesn't make sense.\n\n  The way the payments are allocated to the specific companies in an \nindustry-wide approach on the basis, as I pointed out, of the adult \nmarket share, would also dilute the incentive for companies to do a \ngood job. Let's take a quick look at the example of Philip Morris, the \nmaker of Marlboro.\n  This company, through the use of the Marlboro Man and other marketing \ncampaigns, has been unbelievably successful in selling cigarettes to \nour underage smokers, to our kids, to our children. In 1993, 60 \npercent--60 percent--of all teen smokers used Marlboro, when in the \noverall market for adults, Marlboro only had 23.5 percent of the market \nshare.\n  Let's look at how the industry-wide look-back approach would affect \nPhilip Morris. After all, Philip Morris is responsible for a majority \nof youth smoking. This is the main company at which look-back \nincentives should be aimed.\n  Industry-wide look-backs allocate the industry-wide assessments to \neach company based on its adult market share. So if the company misses \nits reduction targets and is then required to pay, Philip Morris is \nonly responsible for 23 percent of that total, because that is the \ntotal market they have, even though Philip Morris is responsible for 60 \npercent of youth smoking.\n  In the case of Philip Morris, under these statistics, if in a year \nthe tobacco industry did not meet its targets and there was a penalty \nthat had to be assessed under the law, the division clearly would not \nbe equitable. Philip Morris is responsible for 60 percent of the \nproblem, 60 percent of the kids smoking, and yet they would only pay 23 \npercent under this straight provision.\n\n  Let me again point out that Senator McCain has changed this and moved \nit in the right direction. Our amendment moves it even further towards \nmore emphasis on company-specific penalties.\n  Mr. President, what do we think Philip Morris will do under this \nindustry-wide look-back? Will the look-back do what it is supposed to \ndo, get Philip Morris to try to reduce the number of children who it \nsells to? Mr. President, to me it is pretty obvious what would happen. \nBecause this industry-wide look-back forces other companies to pay for \nthe sins of Philip Morris, I would expect Philip Morris would simply \nignore the look-back. The industry-wide look-back in this particular \ncase would fail to do what it is supposed to do. In the case of Philip \nMorris, it would fail to give the proper incentive to the very company \nwith the most responsibility for stopping kids from using its products.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I started calling for a tougher look-back \nthan the original settlement and for one that would be imposed on \nindividual companies that fail to reach the targets rather than on the \nentire industry. In other words, an effective look-back proposal is one \nthat would commit each company, each tobacco company to feel the \nimpact--whether good or bad--of its own behavior.\n  And let us not kid ourselves, Mr. President. The tobacco companies \nwill be able to, through marketing techniques, through their dealings \nwith their dealers, through what advertising they will still be able to \ndo, they will be able to have a substantial impact on youth smoking.\n  Yes, the Government is going to come in under this bill and we will \nhave some anticigarette campaigns. The Government will be involved in \nother things. This will not be brand specific. This will be across the \nindustry. It will, we hope, have the effect we intend it to have. But \nthe fate of each company will still remain in each company's hands. And \nthey should be accountable for what they do. They should be given--sort \nof the American way, Mr. President--they should be given an incentive \nto do what is right and they should be, if I can use the term, \n``punished'' if they do not do what is right. It is the right way to \napproach the problem.\n  Mr. President, I worked with the chairman of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, Senator Jeffords, to include a tough company-\nspecific look-back in this legislation. Prior to the Commerce \nCommittee's markup of S. 1415, I wrote to Chairman McCain to request \nthat his legislation's look-back surcharges be higher than the original \nsettlement, and that they be assessed against individual companies.\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\n  Mr. President, by the time this legislation reached the Senate floor, \nChairman McCain and the Commerce Committee had improved the bill's \nlook-back provisions, and they had done it in two very significant \nways. I commend them for it. In the version of this bill that came out \nof the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain increased the level of the \nindustry-wide surcharge and the overall cap in the look-back. This \nserved to provide a stronger incentive for tobacco companies not to \ntarget youth.\n  Further, the Senator from Arizona went even further in this regard in \nthe managers' amendment he offered this week. Specifically, Senator \nMcCain added a company-specific look-back surcharge in addition to the \nindustry-wide surcharge.\n  Mr. President, by including both a company-specific look-back and \nsurcharges stronger than those in the settlement, Senator McCain's \nlook-back provision represents a clear improvement from last year's \nsettlement. It will be more effective. It will be fair.\n  What the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I are doing as we \noffer this amendment is to simply refine and improve the McCain look-\nback provisions. And we do this in two fundamental but necessary ways.\n  Mr. President, the most important modification included in the \nDurbin-DeWine amendment is a stronger company-specific look-back. The \nargument for this is simple. The higher the company-specific surcharge \nis, the more powerful an incentive each company has to prevent children \nfrom using its products. By putting more of the burden on individual \ncompanies, we can provide a much more powerful incentive for tobacco \ncompanies----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's point is well taken. The Senate \nis not in order.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair and my colleague from West Virginia.\n  By putting more of the burden on individual companies, Mr. President, \nwe can provide a more powerful incentive for tobacco companies to meet \nthese reduction targets, especially among those companies that have \ngained the most from the youth market.\n  Basically, the Durbin-DeWine amendment would direct more of the \nsurcharge amounts to be paid on a company-specific basis. The initial \nassessments--ones that are charged if a company misses its reduction \ntarget by a few percentage points--in our amendment would be higher \nthan in the McCain amendment. In addition, unlike the McCain bill, our \namendment would also bump up the surcharge once a company misses its \nreduction target by more than 5 percentage points.\n\n  Let us look at one specific example to demonstrate the differences of \nthe two approaches. Suppose we had two cigarette manufacturers--company \nA and company B. Each controls, let us assume, half the market, \nincluding half of the youth market. Let us say company A has succeeded \nin meeting its reduction goals for reducing youth use, but company B \nfailed to reduce its targets and failed, in fact, by 10 percentage \npoints.\n  Company A has done the job. Company B has not. Here is how the total \nsurcharges, to take a specific example--including both the company-\nspecific and the industry-wide assessments--would break down under the \nMcCain bill and the Durbin-DeWine amendment.\n  Under McCain, company A, the good actor, the good company, is \nresponsible to pay $200 million, but would only pay $100 million under \nthe Durbin-DeWine amendment.\n  Company B, on the other hand, the company that saw the increase, \ncaused the increase in youth smoking, would be charged $750 million \nunder McCain, but would pay $900 million under Durbin-DeWine. That is a \n20 percent higher payment under the Durbin-DeWine amendment for the \ncompany that failed. More equitable.\n  So, as you can see, our amendment would shift the financial burden \ntoward the company or companies that are responsible for the continued \nyouth smoking, but also away from companies that do the right thing. \nBecause companies will know that they are on the hook for how well they \ndo, they have that much more incentive to prevent children from using \ntheir products.\n  Another way to demonstrate this, Mr. President, and to demonstrate \nthe shift we are asking for in our amendment is to look at the overall \nbottom line. The McCain bill would impose an industry-wide cap, a \npotential maximum of $4 billion. This cap represents the maximum amount \nwhich would be assessed against the entire industry under these \nprovisions.\n  Although there is no cap in McCain for company-specific surcharges, \nlet us assume each and every company missed its target by, say, 25 \npercentage points. In that case, the surcharges would all add to about \n$1.6 billion. So that is the bottom line for McCain--$4 billion imposed \nacross the entire industry, shared among all the companies, and about \n$1.6 billion for the individual companies that had not met its goals.\n  The Durbin-DeWine bottom line is as follows: The industry-wide cap is \n$2 billion, and the total amount of company-specific surcharges, under \nsimilar circumstances, would be $5 billion. That is only for that \nspecific example.\n  Mr. President, the real story I am trying to convey with these \nnumbers is simple: Our amendment has a greater focus on the company-\nspecific look-back and thus provides a stronger incentive for tobacco \ncompanies to prevent children from using their products.\n  Mr. President, our amendment makes one other fundamental change to \nthe McCain bill. Our ultimate reduction target--10 years hence--is a \n67-percent drop in the number of teens who smoke. In the McCain bill, \nthe end goal or target is 60 percent. On the surface, the McCain target \nappears to be the same as the 60-percent target in the original \nsettlement the attorneys general reached last June.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues, this is a settlement that everyone \nagreed to. And the tobacco companies said, ``Yes, we will be held \naccountable. And, yes, we can get these targets.'' So it seems as if it \nis the same under the current McCain language.\n  But actually, on closer examination, the McCain target falls a little \nshort of that original target in real terms. The reason why it falls \nshort is the McCain and settlement reduction goals--although the same \non the surface; appear the same--each use different starting points or \ndifferent baselines.\n  The McCain bill calls for a 60-percent reduction from a higher \nbaseline figure than was used in last year's settlement. Because of \nthis, the McCain youth reduction targets are easier to meet than the \noriginal settlement. Again, not a great deal of difference. But all our \namendment does, very simply, is take us back effectively to that \noriginal settlement, which I think was our original intent of what we \nshould do.\n  What the Senator from Illinois and I are doing is restoring the \noriginal reduction goals from youth tobacco use from the settlement. \nThe Durbin-DeWine amendment sets a reduction target of 67 percent, but \nafter accounting for the different baselines--our reduction goal is \nequivalent to what is in the settlement. It is exactly what the tobacco \nindustry last year agreed was reasonable and that they said they could \nreach.\n  Again, I want to thank my friend from the land of Lincoln, Senator \nDurbin, and his staff for their work in putting this proposal together. \nLet me also thank Senator Wyden, who will speak in a moment, Senators \nChafee, Wyden, Daschle, Snowe, and Collins for joining us as original \ncosponsors of this amendment. This is truly a bipartisan amendment. I \nalso appreciate the work of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and \nothers in the public health community for their assistance and support. \nThis amendment also has had the active support of former Surgeon \nGeneral C. Everett Koop--and I certainly appreciate that. Finally, I am \npleased that the New York Times has expressed its support for the \namendment in an editorial in yesterday's edition.\n  Mr. President, the choice before us is simple--we have the \nopportunity here to vote on an amendment that will improve the one \nbasic purpose of this legislation: to reduce youth smoking. By holding \nindividual tobacco companies more accountable for failing to reduce \nyouth smoking, and by restoring the original targets set by the tobacco\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\ncompanies themselves, the Durbin-DeWine amendment will make a real \ndifference in young lives. I urge my colleagues to join us on behalf of \nour young people and support the Durbin-DeWine lookback amendment. It \nis the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I offered the amendment in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee to toughen the look-back penalties for one reason. I believe \nthat stronger look-back penalties provide a powerful tool to actually \nchange the course of history and hold the tobacco companies accountable \nwhen they pursue youthful customers.\n  A brief review of the history indicates that the tobacco companies \nwon't change on their own. For example, if you look at every previous \neffort, every single previous effort on the part of the Congress to \nhold the tobacco companies accountable, the tobacco companies, in fact, \nhave found a way to get around those efforts. That is what happened \nwhen the Congress sought to go forward with restrictions on \nadvertising. That is what happened when the Congress legislated warning \nlabels. And that is what happened when the Synar amendment was enacted.\n  Many will remember our colleague who served in the other body. Mike \nSynar wrote very tough legislation that would, in effect, require that \nthe States carry out the laws to protect our kids when they were \ntargeted. The tobacco companies found a way around that.\n  So the tobacco companies have found a way around every single \nprevious legislative effort on the part of the Congress to hold them \naccountable. Those who would like to know more about this history can \nlearn about it simply from the documents that have come out since the \n1994 hearings in the Health Subcommittee on the other side of the \nCapitol.\n  Now, the tobacco companies would like us to believe that they will \nchange the course of history and their behavior on their own. Many of \nthe Senators will remember after the original attorneys general \nsettlement the tobacco companies took out very large advertisements in \nboth the Nation's newspapers and in the electronic media. The basic \nmessage of those ads that were taken out by the tobacco industry when \nthey were encouraging support for the original settlement, was their \nmessage that it was a new day. Tobacco companies said it is a new day. \nThere will be improved corporate citizenship on the part of the tobacco \nindustry, and that the sordid history that came out after 1994 in those \nvarious documents was a part of the past.\n  I think the inclination of every Member of the U.S. Senate is to say \nindustry can change. Our colleague, Senator Durbin, made mention of the \nfact that many of the executives who testified in 1994 aren't alive \ntoday. So a number of us were very hopeful that it would be a new day \nin terms of tobacco industry behavior. But when the Senate Commerce \nCommittee held hearings earlier this year under the leadership of \nChairman McCain, we received powerful evidence that things really had \nnot changed.\n  I will cite one example in which I was personally involved. In 1994, \nwhen I was a member of the Health Subcommittee on the other side of the \nCapitol, Henry Waxman brought the Nation's tobacco executives before \nthe Health Subcommittee. It came to light that the Brown & Williamson \ncompany at that time was genetically altering nicotine, genetically \naltering nicotine to give it a special punch and to hook their \ncustomers. This was, of course, a flagrant example of subverting the \npublic interest. It was documented by the Food and Drug Administration. \nAt that time, the Brown & Williamson company assured the country \nthat they would not engage in that conduct again.\n\n  During the course of our preparation for the hearings in the Senate \nCommerce Committee 4 years later, I and other members of the committee \nlearned from news reports and others that there was evidence that, in \nfact, Brown & Williamson was again genetically altering nicotine and \nagain engaging in this detrimental conduct that they pledged to the \ncountry they would never engage in again in 1994.\n  So when the CEO of the Brown & Williamson company came to the Senate \nCommerce Committee with the other executives, I asked specifically \nabout what kinds of practices the company was engaged in with respect \nto genetically altered nicotine. The CEO of that company said, in fact, \nthat they were again selling this product, and in their words, in \nresponse to a question I asked that day, they admitted that they were \nworking off ``a small stockpile of genetically altered nicotine,'' \nengaging in conduct that they pledged the country in 1994 that they \nwould never engage in again.\n  The reason I bring this example up is that if a tobacco company will \nengage in that kind of brazen conduct, in that kind of conduct when \nthey are under the hot spotlight of the U.S. Congress, as they have \nbeen for many months, what are they going to do when the attention of \nthe Congress and the country turns elsewhere? This isn't about conduct \nof 20, 30, 40 years ago. We know that took place in the past. A number \nof us were very interested in knowing whether the companies really did \nwant to change of their own accord. Many of those who have opposed \ntough look-back penalties have used this argument in the past. \nCompanies are changing. These kind of tools of big government are \ncertainly unnecessary, at best.\n  The Brown & Williamson example where they are working off a small \nstockpile of genetically altered nicotine at this time is certainly \nstrong evidence that these companies have not really changed and it is \nnot the new day that the Congress and the country were told about after \nthe original settlement from the attorneys general.\n  Given that past history, over 20, 30, 40 years, and the most current \nhistory, the Brown & Williamson example which, by the way, the Justice \nDepartment is now conducting a criminal inquiry into, there have \nalready been pleas in this regard--given that past history and the \nhistory present, many of us are not willing to say that it is actually \na new day in the tobacco industry.\n  Mr. President, I want the Senate to know why I am particularly \nskeptical. I was a member of the Health Subcommittee of the other body \nin 1994, Chairman Waxman, the late Mike Synar, and others, did an \nextraordinarily good job of questioning the executives. But when it \ncame to my turn during those hearings, I recognized that it had not yet \nbeen put on the public record whether these executives believed that \nnicotine was addictive.\n  So, in 1994, at those hearings, I went down the row with each of the \nexecutives, one by one by one, each of them, and asked them whether \nnicotine was addictive. And each of them under oath at that time said \nthat nicotine was not addictive.\n  I like to think that moment contributed in some way to the important \nlegislation we have before us, contributed to our positions for \nenacting strong legislation. But it seems to me that set of hearings \nand the documents that have come to light will only make a real \ndifference over time if we now follow up on those early efforts and \npass the strongest possible look-back legislation. That is why I \noffered a very tough set of additional penalties when companies don't \nmeet their specific targets for reducing youth smoking under the \nCommerce Committee bill. That is why I am pleased to be able to join \nSenators Durbin, DeWine, Chafee, and others this afternoon.\n  The bottom line, with respect to our amendment--many of the details \nhave been addressed--but the bottom line is if you do not have \naggressive look-back penalties, look-back penalties that really zero in \non aggressively the companies in a specific way, you effectively \npenalize the companies that try to change their behavior twice. You \npenalize them once through the industry assessment and second through \nthe loss of market while other companies continue to market to children \nand a future market share.\n  This amendment represents a fairer approach. It does not allow the \nCongress, in effect, through loopholes in this look-back set of \nprovisions, to place a company that does try to clean up its act, does \ntry to change history, we make sure under our amendment that company \nwouldn't be placed at a competitive disadvantage when they said, now we \nare going to change and not seek out children.\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\n  Let me also say that because the number of teen smokers has actually \ngrown since the original settlement was announced last summer, the \nchanges that we offer today will essentially hold the industry to a \nreduction level to which they have already agreed. So, in fact, this \namendment is stronger than what came out of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee on the 19-to-1 basis. But given what we have seen with, \nagain, the number of teen smokers actually increasing, this, in effect, \nsimply ensures that the industry is held to a reduction level to which \nthey have already agreed.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, Senators Durbin and DeWine went into a \nnumber of the details with respect to how the look-back legislation \nworks. I don't think all of that needs to be belabored at this time. \nBut I would like to say that to me what this amendment is all about is \nreversing the course of history. History shows that in the past when we \nwould write these laws, the tobacco companies would bring their \nentrepreneurial and advertising talents to the task then of getting \naround them. And the tobacco companies have more of that kind of \nadvertising and entrepreneurial talent than anybody else around. They \nwould always find a way to evade the law.\n  Learning from past history with respect to the warning labels, with \nrespect to electronic ads, with respect to the way in which the \nindustry got around the Synar amendment, we are making it clear that we \nare going to have the tools to rein in the scoff-law companies, those \nthat do not clean up their acts as they have pledged to do. We do so in \na realistic way. We do so in a fashion that makes sure that companies \nthat really have changed won't be put at a competitive disadvantage.\n  I would say, finally, Mr. President, and colleagues, to those of you \nwho have talked to me personally about those 1994 hearings, and what \nhappened during the course of those 7 hours where the executives said \nthat cigarettes were like Hostess Twinkies, cigarettes weren't \naddictive, and they never preyed on children, if you really want to \nreverse the course of history, if you really want to hold the companies \naccountable, if you really want to rein in the conduct that we saw \ndemonstrated again in the Senate Commerce Committee when Brown & \nWilliamson admitted that they are now using genetically altered \nnicotine, if you want to change that behavior, vote for this bipartisan \namendment, because this is something that is going to change the course \nof history and make sure that these companies don't prey on our \nyoungsters in the years ahead.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to respond to my colleagues who \nare proposing this amendment. But, first, I would like to make some \ngeneral comments about the bill to complement some of the comments I \nmade earlier today, some of which were related to a statement from the \nJoint Tax Committee which I inserted into the Record, the chart that \nthey put together on the net cost of the bill. They have now added a \nline to their estimate. I want to include that in the Record as well. \nThis is the price per pack of cigarettes under this bill with all these \nnew taxes and surcharges and look-backs.\n  I will tell my colleagues that for 1998, the year that we are in \nright now, before this bill goes into effect, Joint Tax assumes the \nprice of cigarettes is $1.98. They assume for 1999--I want our \ncolleagues to hear this--Joint Tax says the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes goes up to $2.88, a 90-cent increase. The next year, $3.24; \nthe next year, $3.41; the next year, $3.66; the next year, $3.83; by \nthe year 2004, it is over $4, $4.06 per pack. The next year it is \n$4.12; the next year, $4.78; by the year 2007, 9 years from now, the \nprice per pack, $4.48. The price today is less than $2.\n  This isn't coming from Don Nickles. This came from Joint Tax. I \nhaven't agreed with everything that Joint Tax has done in estimating \nthis bill. But in this estimate, they have added some of the other \naspects of the bill, including the look-back.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  RECONCILIATION OF GENERAL TOBACCO INDUSTRY PAYMENTS UNDER S. 1415, AS AMENDED, AND NET FEDERAL REVENUE EFFECT OF SUCH PAYMENTS ESTIMATED BY THE JOINT \n                                         COMMITTEE ON TAXATION ON MAY 19, 1998, BEFORE THE LOOK-BACK PROVISIONS                                         \n                                                                [In billions of dollars]                                                                \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                           Fiscal year--                                                \n                Provision                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007   1998-2003  1998-2007\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Mr. President, I wish to address the amendment by my \nfriends and colleagues from Illinois, Ohio, and Oregon dealing with \nincreasing the look-back penalties.\n  I made a statement earlier today that I think the look-back provision \nin this bill is one of the most unworkable provisions that anybody \ncould dream up. I say ``unworkable.'' I don't think it will work. But I \nwould like to maybe bring to my colleagues' attention how they propose \nthat it should work.\n  To make the look-back penalties work, they say we are going to \nempower the Secretary of the Treasury to do a poll. It says to conduct \na survey. The survey is on a national basis. They are going to measure \nthe type of tobacco product used in the last 30 days. They are going to \nconduct this survey with methodology that he determines is appropriate. \nThey are going to identify the name brand that the youngsters use. They \nare going to be surveying kids. They are going to be surveying people \nfrom ages 11 to 17. And they are going to ask them a question: ``Did \nyou smoke, and what brand did you use?'' Then they are going to put all \nthis information together. I don't think they are going to ask this of \nevery teenager in America. So it is going to be a random survey.\n  Then they are going to compare the results of this survey to the \nmandates in the bill. If we don't meet the targets, or if the \nconsumption of tobacco by teenagers is higher than what this bill says \nthey should be, the tobacco companies are going to be assessed \npenalties. And the penalties are very large. The penalties in the look-\nback provision under the negotiated settlement with the attorneys \ngeneral went up to $2 billion. The penalties that came out of the \nCommerce Committee were $4 billion--$3.96 billion.\n  And then the penalties which were rewritten by the administration and \nintroduced on Monday came out $4.4\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\nbillion maximum, and now the amendment that we have in the Chamber says \ntake that to $7.7 billion, and also increase the target rate to 67 \npercent.\n  Why do rates make a difference? Well, for every point you are out of \ncompliance, you are assessed a penalty, and the penalty is large. The \npenalty for not making the target under the attorneys general \nnegotiated agreement was $80 million per point missed.\n  Well, the penalty under this bill is $240 million per point missed. \nIt is three times as large as that proposed under the original \nsettlement. That is just the industry-wide look-back. There is also a \nsegment that applies to the product, and it has a penalty that is $200 \nmillion per point missed.\n  If this sounds confusing, it is because it is, and it is in this \nbill. My point is it is not going to work very well. You are telling \nthe Secretary of Treasury to take a poll, and then we are going to deem \nthat this poll is correct.\n  Now, all of us have used surveys. We have all had polls. But this \nbill has language that I guess people want to become law which says the \nsurvey using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \nconclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for the purposes of \nthis act.\n  So we are saying, whatever the Secretary says, it is accurate. It is \na done deal. And then they are going to and ask the kids, did you \nsmoke? Now, they don't ask them, did you smoke 10 times? Did you smoke \na pack a day? They can smoke one cigarette during that 30-day period \nand they are counted. And if this thing worked just right, a tobacco \ncompany would have to pay $1,000 because a youngster smoked one \ncigarette. I find that to be pretty high. And I might mention, this is \nreally supposed to go after young people who are smoking illegally. \nThey are smoking illegally. Let's put the penalty on the young person \nfor breaking the law. Instead, we are going to do a random survey, a \nrandom survey that has to determine every single percentage for every \nsingle tobacco product. There is a de minimis level. We are not going \nto hit the smallest companies, I guess. I don't know how many different \ntobacco products there are. I don't know them very well. I don't smoke. \nI can only think of three or four cigarette brands. I don't smoke. And \nmy guess is there is probably a lot of teenagers who don't either, but \nthey can remember maybe the biggest name brands. I can remember \nMarlboro and Winston and maybe Virginia Slims. So if somebody said, do \nyou smoke? I might be able to remember those name brands.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, could I help the Senator with the names of \nsome packs of cigarettes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. In a minute. That youngster taking the survey, if they \nmention a name brand, whether that was the brand they smoked or not, it \ncomes out in the calculation of this data which is deemed accurate, \nproper, and correct. Then, that company can be subjected to enormous \nfines.\n  In the proposal, in the amendment that we have pending, the fines \nthat are brand specific go up to $5 billion. They are also indexed for \ninflation. That is a pretty big penalty.\n  Then there is a $2.2 billion look-back that applies industry-wide. \nThe Secretary of Treasury takes this survey and tries to determine what \npercentage of young people are smoking each brand in the country, and \nif each one of them by brand product missed this target, then they are \nassessed penalties that can go up to $7.7 billion and even higher in \nthe outyears.\n  This is not a good plan. This is not a workable plan. I tell my \ncolleagues, if you want to do something to reduce teenage smoking, come \nup with something else. If you want to come up with higher taxes, just \nincrease the tax. I have heard some people say you don't need $1.50 \nbecause we have a big look-back and it's really $1.50 anyway. If you \nwant to make it a $1.50, make it a $1.50, but call it a tax. Make it \nclear. Make it honest. This is a scheme. We are going to deem a poll to \nbe accurate, and authorize the Secretary to assess enormous penalties, \nin the billions of dollars.\n\n  That doesn't make sense. Now, if you really want to reduce teen \nsmoking, do something else. Say to teenagers, if you are caught \nsmoking, we are going to slap your wrist. The second time we are going \nto make you clean up a park, the third time maybe a financial penalty. \nWe don't have that in this bill. And I don't want the Federal \nGovernment to do it because I don't want to federalize these actions, \nbut instead we should encourage the States to enforce the law.\n  It is against the law for teenagers below the age of 18 to smoke in \nany State. If you don't want anybody to smoke that is 18 years old, try \nand increase the age to 20 or 21. You have that right. But to come in--\n--\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I correct the Senator?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. I don't believe it is unlawful to smoke. It is unlawful to \npurchase.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the correction. Let me make the comment, \nMr. President. In every State in the Nation it is unlawful to purchase \ncigarettes.\n  Mr. FORD. Now.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And if we want to decrease teenage consumption, maybe we \nshould encourage the States to pass laws it is against the law to \nconsume and put some responsibility back on the individual. Instead, we \nare allowing this massive growth of government.\n  It doesn't make sense. It is not workable. It is not fair. And I \ndon't think it will be effective. I also don't think parts of it will \nbe constitutional, and I don't think we have willing participants by \nthe tobacco companies. So it is just not a good deal. For people who \nwant to raise taxes, raise taxes. Be up front, be honest. If you want \nto do something else, do something else to get teen consumption down. \nBut this bill is not going to work. It is just not a workable plan. \nFrankly, if it wouldn't work at $4.4 billion, it won't work at $7.7 \nbillion.\n  I urge my colleagues examine this look-back provision, see how \ncomplicated it is, see how confusing it is to give the Secretary this \npower, and to decide this is not the right way to legislate. It is not \nthe right way to tax, and let's come up with something better. I hope \nsomething better would include some personal responsibility and \naccountability for people who are breaking the law. If a teenager \npurchases, it is against the law if they are under the age of 18. And \nif you really don't want them to smoke, maybe we should encourage the \nStates to have laws against the consumption as well.\n  I appreciate my----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have a question. Is the Senator saying that tobacco \ncompanies do everything they are supposed to do and yet when we take \nthe survey, we are not as successful as we hoped to be and so we are \ngoing to impose a fee on them?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is exactly right. You know, I am sure if \nthis survey was taken during the Fourth of July break, it would have a \nlittle higher incidence of teen smoking than it would at some other \ntime in the year. But if they smoke a cigarette, they are counted in \nthe affirmative and the penalty would be $1,000.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware that as part of the original \nagreement between the industry and the attorneys general, the industry \nitself was the one that agreed to this? All they are doing here is \nincreasing it. Is the Senator aware of that? And is the Senator aware \nthat this puts him in a position which is far different even from the \nindustry by attacking a proposal that was agreed to by the tobacco \nindustry itself, who would----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to answer the question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Have experienced these penalties, who would have been \nsubject to them and obviously must have had some confidence in the \nsurvey the Senator is deriding; otherwise they never would have entered \ninto the agreement because the penalties would have accrued to them. Is \nthe Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to tell my colleague from Arizona that \nhe makes a good point but he is absolutely wrong. What the industry \nagreed to, according to the settlement, is that they would pay $80 \nmillion per point of noncompliance, up to a total of $2 billion. What \nwe have before us is two\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\nsurveys, penalties up to $4.4 billion, and an amendment to go to $7.7 \nbillion.\n  Does my colleague from Arizona realize there is a difference between \n$7.7 billion and $2 billion? and that $5.5 of this new penalty is \nproduct-specific? and the industry did not agree to a product-specific \npenalty? These provisions were not in the industry settlement, as I am \nreading it right now.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Did you ask me a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No.\n  Mr. McCAIN. You didn't.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator not agree with me that whether the \ntobacco companies agreed to it or not, that article I of the \nConstitution gives the Congress the power to tax? and that we ought not \nto be delegating that power to a poll?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I agree totally. And I also tell my colleague and friend \nfrom Texas, I wasn't part of the tobacco companies' deal. I am part of \nthe Finance Committee. And I think if we are going to legislate on \ntaxes, we ought to do it right. This is not the right way to tax.\n  I will also tell my colleague from Texas, I have heard people say the \ntobacco industry is confident they can challenge these look-back \nassessments and win in court and have it thrown out as \nunconstitutional. Regardless of the constitutional argument, I say this \nis a crummy way to tax. I don't want to give the Secretary of the \nTreasury the authority to conduct a poll and then determine that the \npoll is accurate, proper, correct for purposes of this act, and be able \nto make assessments. Under the agreement the tobacco companies agreed \nto, it was up to $2 billion. Under the bill that came out of the \nCommerce Committee, it was $3.96 billion. Under the bill the \nadministration wrote and introduced on Monday, it came up to $4.4 \nbillion. And on the amendment we have pending now, it is $7.7 billion, \nalso indexed for inflation.\n  The industry did not sign off on any $7.7 billion look-back.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Just two questions. No. 1, you are not here to represent \nthe industry, are you?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, sir. I could care less----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Second, when you put your hand on the Bible and you swore \nto uphold the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic, you were not saying, well, I'll uphold the \nConstitution and article I, the power of Congress to tax, only in those \ncases where the tobacco companies didn't agree to let a pollster raise \ntaxes, did you?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. A ``pollster\"?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I got on the Finance Committee because I did not like \nthe way our tax system was structured. I want to work with our \ncolleagues from Mississippi and Texas, to take the Tax Code and rewrite \nit and come up with something that is fair, flat, and simple. This is \ntobacco bill just the opposite. This is a mess. We could clean this \nbill up a lot if we went through the conventional process, if we had \nthe Finance Committee mark up this bill on the tax side and call a tax \na tax.\n  Instead, we have this unbelievably complicated system, and the look-\nback is maybe the most complicated. Delegating to the Secretary of the \nTreasury to take a poll, and then, if they don't meet the targets that \nwe set, we are going to assess them billions of dollars, up to $7 \nbillion or $8 billion, I find to be ludicrous. It doesn't make sense. \nIt is not a good way to legislate.\n  That is the reason that the Commerce Committee doesn't have taxation \npower, in the Senate. In the Senate, the Finance Committee has the \npower to raise taxes.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. And not the attorneys general and not the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thought the Finance Committee did take up this issue \nand ended up raising taxes, and doing all kinds of other havoc to it in \n24 hours. I wonder what they would have done in 72.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will tell my friend and colleague, the Finance \nCommittee did consider this bill for 24 hours. I didn't support their \n$1.50 tax increase, but I think their $1.50 tax increase is a lot more \nhonest, is a lot more plain, a lot more doable. We have excise taxes on \ntobacco today of 24 cents. Congress last year, when we passed the kid-\ncare bill, increased that another 15 cents. So, tobacco taxes are going \nto 39 cents already in present law.\n  People say that the Commerce Committee bill, the administration bill, \nincreases that another dollar and a dime. That takes the tax to $1.49. \nBut they do not call it a tax, they call it a fee. So we are telling \neverybody who is in this industry--and we have wholesalers and \ndistributors and so on--that the tax is $1.49 and it is increasing. But \nthat bill, the bill that we have before us, doesn't saying anything \nabout a dollar and a dime. It says put all these billions of dollars \ninto a fund. That is not very workable. It is not very legitimate. I \nthink we should have the committees of jurisdiction take this bill.\n  The Finance Committee did take the bill, but unfortunately the \nCommerce Committee and the administration looked at our changes, and \nthey just ignored them. They dropped the changes that the Finance \nCommittee made.\n  I resent having the Commerce Committee write the tax portions of this \nbill as well as I resent the Commerce Committee writing the ag portions \nof the bill. And I think those are two of the more contentious and two \nof the more difficult things that we have to deal with. The committee \nthat marked it up didn't have, in my opinion, the taxation expertise, \nthey didn't follow the same taxation procedures that we have on every \nother excise tax in history. And, frankly, I think the Agriculture \nCommittee should have written that instead of the Commerce Committee as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I know we are having a lot of fun here, but \nfor the information of all Senators, there will be no further votes \nthis evening. The Senate has tried to work out an agreement that would \nresolve the impasse that we have right now parliamentary, and with \nregard to the substance of those amendments, but we have not been able \nto get that worked out yet. There are very strong feelings on both \nsides of the amendments that are pending, so I can understand that. So, \nsince we haven't worked out an agreement, I now ask there be a period \nfor the transaction of morning business with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas reserves the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Would it be possible for us to just have a short final \nstatement on this issue? Or would you prefer we do it--\n  Mr. LOTT. I would prefer you do it in morning business, because if \nyou had a short final statement, there would need to be a short final \nreaction. I see the Senator from Massachusetts is anxious to get \nrecognition.\n  Mr. GRAMM. In that case, it is not worth it.\n  Mr. LOTT. You can continue in morning business.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5308-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5308-S5309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tomorrow we will convene at 9:30, and there \nwill be 1 hour for morning business, and then we will begin \nconsideration of two items tomorrow, calendar No. 299, H.R. 2709, \nrelative to Iran sanctions, with a total of 3 hours for debate. We \nalready entered into an agreement back before the Easter recess as to \nhow this issue would be considered, on or before May 22. So we will \nhave this issue up tomorrow. There could be an amendment offered by \nSenator Levin. But we hope to get that up tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\n  I won't even announce at this moment exactly which one of these two \nbills will come first, because we will need to see, for instance, if \nthe ISTEA highway and infrastructure bill is ready to go. As soon as we \nget it, we want to take that up. But it will be the Iran sanctions \nissue, and then we will consider and dispose of the ISTEA conference \nreport. So, votes will occur tomorrow, probably at least one, maybe two \nor three. It will depend on how these issues develop.\n  Some people are saying, Will the ISTEA conference be completed? I am \ntold by the leaders that they will be able to complete it tonight. They \nmay need a little extra time in the morning to make sure that Senators \nwho are affected one way or the other have been briefed as to exactly \nwhat is in it, but they know that we need to complete this legislation \nbefore we go home for Memorial Day recess, and we should be committed \nto get that done.\n  With that, I yield the floor and the morning business would be in \norder.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to.\n  Mr. FORD. I approve of what you have been doing. I think you have a \nhard job and you have done well. One thing that bothers me--you come to \nKentucky to see friends and family one of these days. There are a lot \nof holds here and a lot of people are caught up in holds that have \nnothing to do with the disagreement among Senators. Next week, the \nUranium Enrichment Corporation will make a final decision on whether \nthey go public or whether they go sell to an individual. And we have \none member who needs to be on that. She has been held up 4 months now, \nand that vote and that expertise, for 4 years, needs to be on that \nboard.\n  I hope that somewhere--it is on our side as well--but when I get our \nside worked out, then it comes back on that side.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I can say to the Senator from Kentucky, I know he is \ninterested in this nominee. Over a week ago, I believe, we had it \ncleared.\n  Mr. FORD. We did until we got problems on this side.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then I thought we worked it out again, and another problem \npopped up.\n  Mr. FORD. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. But I think we will take another run at it tomorrow and see \nif we can maybe work it out.\n  Mr. FORD. The only reason I am asking is, we have the budget process. \nThe Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, has worked hard on this. \nIt should not be jammed up because of a hold on the Senate floor for an \nindividual who has nothing to do with it, and it is jeopardizing the \nbudget process, because funds are in there as it relates to the sale of \nthis item.\n  So I just--I plead with you, if you can, and I will do the best on my \nside, and if somehow, tomorrow, we will not be back, able to do it--and \nI do not want a recess appointment. It will all be over before the year \nexpires. I don't like to do recess appointments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will say to the Senator from Kentucky, I realize Margaret \nGreene----\n  Mr. FORD. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Needs to be released. We also have worked out, I believe, \nan agreement that involves releasing Mr. Barry for the Department of \nthe Interior and Mary Anne Sullivan to be counsel at the Department of \nEnergy. We would like to move all three of those.\n  Mr. FORD. I agree with that, and I will try to help. My pleadings \nhave fallen on hard times.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will work on it tonight and tomorrow. Keep working on \nit.\n  Mr. FORD. I appreciate it. I want you to know--I want everybody to \nknow--we are trying to operate in an efficient manner, and other things \nare jeopardizing the ability to do it in an efficient manner.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I need to respond, of course, to the \nSenator from Oklahoma who somehow now regrets or complains about the \nfact that this legislation went through the Commerce Committee. My \nunderstanding is, unless I am having some mental lapse, that the \ndecision was made by the leadership to move the bill through the \nCommerce Committee.\n  My understanding is that was the instruction of the distinguished \nassistant majority leader and the other members of the leadership, to \nmove it through the Commerce Committee, because it was clear it was not \ngoing to go through the other committees. Now the Senator from Oklahoma \nseems terribly distraught that it didn't go through the other \ncommittees when he was the major person to move it through the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. NICKLES. May I answer to that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield, if the Senator from Oklahoma has \na short question, because we are operating----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I don't have a question. I want to respond.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If you don't have a question, then I suggest you wait \nuntil the expiration of my time.\n  The second point is that the Finance Committee did insist, insist, \ninsist and got this bill, and they came up with a result that the \nSenator from Oklahoma didn't like. There were amendments pending, that \nis my understanding, in the Finance Committee--I was watching on C-\nSPAN--that would have done even more damage to the legislation, at \nleast from the viewpoint of the Senator from Oklahoma, who thinks that \nthe bill is too encompassing, too large a tax increase, et cetera, \nwhich he has spoken at length about on this floor today. I am curious \nabout what would have happened if the Finance Committee had kept the \nbill even longer.\n  As far as the Agriculture Committee is concerned, the Agriculture \nCommittee bill is in the bill as a result of the majority leader \ninserting it. The Senate will have its way on that.\n  But I want to come back to the fundamental issue of the look-back \nprovision. Mr. President, I didn't invent the look-back provision. It \nwasn't my idea. I have very talented staff and advisers and friends. \nThe look-back provision came from the agreement that was entered into \nby the attorneys general of the 40 States and the industry.\n\n  Have they changed? Yes, the look-back provisions have changed. Should \nthey be changed back? Should I support the Durbin amendment? No, \nbecause I think it makes it worse. But the look-back provision concept \nwas generated by the belief of every public health group in America \nthat you can't trust the tobacco companies.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from New Mexico and \nothers trust the tobacco companies and believe that they will really \ntry to reduce teen smoking. They may do that, but most observers \nbelieve that after commitment after commitment and promise after \npromise and lying to Congress about the fact of whether they enticed \nkids to smoke or not, the fact is we found out they did. So the look-\nback provision, I inform my colleagues, does not mean you have any \nconnection with the tobacco industry, but you ignore the fact that the \ntobacco industry can't be trusted, and unless there are penalties \ninvolved, then the industry will not do what they say they will do, \nbecause they have already said they would try not to entice kids to \nsmoke, and they did. That is the reason for the look-back provision.\n  Philosophically, that may not be something that is acceptable to the \nSenator from Oklahoma, the Senator from Texas, or the Senator from New \nMexico. But the reality is that is the view of every public health \norganization in America. Every living--every living--Surgeon General in \nAmerica today has said you have to have these provisions in the \nlegislation if you want to attack the issue of kids smoking.\n  That is the view--and we have the letter, I have the letter from the \nSurgeons General, every Surgeon General since 1973. Perhaps those who \noppose this know more than they do. I don't know, I don't know more \nthan they do.\n  With startling candor, Dr. Claude Teague set forth the plain facts \nabout the addictive nature of nicotine in his chilling 1972 internal \nmemorandum discussing the crucial role of nicotine. He said:\n\n       Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both \n     habituating and unique in its variety\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\n     of physiological actions. Realistically, if our company is to \n     survive and prosper over the long term, we must get our share \n     of the youth market.\n\n  ``We must get our share of the youth market.''\n  I commend this to the reading of the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Oklahoma. It is clear that the tobacco companies attempted \nto entice youths to smoke. So, therefore, in the agreement made by the \ntobacco companies, freely entered into by the tobacco companies, there \nwere look-back provisions. Perhaps the Senator from Oklahoma doesn't \nlike the size of them, but it is hard for me to understand how he can \nargue against the rationale behind it.\n  Another slip occurred----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to answer it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In 1987, just months before the national launch of the \nJoe Camel campaign, on October 15, 1987, a memorandum stamped ``RJ \nsecret'' from a file that, incredibly, bears the name ``youth target'':\n\n       Project LF is a wider circumference nonmenthol cigarette \n     targeted at younger adult male smokers, primarily 14- to 24-\n     year-old male smokers.\n\n  I can go through document after document for the Senator from \nOklahoma. What I am asking him to understand is why these look-back \nprovisions are there, because the tobacco companies tried to entice \nyoung people to smoke, and here are the documents. In the agreement of \nJune 20, 1997, the tobacco industry admitted that they had enticed kids \nto smoke. Therefore, since they could not be trusted, then there should \nbe provisions that penalize the tobacco companies if, indeed, youth \nsmoking went up, which they are committed not to do. That is something \nin which they freely engaged.\n\n  I can understand if the Senator from Oklahoma has a problem with the \nsize of those look-back provisions. I cannot understand why the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma would not understand why the look-back provisions are \nthere. When we talk about all the adjectives that the Senator from \nOklahoma has described these look-back provisions, the facts are, \naccording to every living Surgeon General, according to every public \nhealth organization in America, according to Dr. Koop, according to Dr. \nKessler, according to every health expert in America, the fact is there \nhas to be provisions that will punish the tobacco companies, as well as \nincentivize them to stop and reduce teenage smoking.\n  Now that, I suggest, is reality. Again, I am not speaking from my \nknowledge and expertise. I am not speaking from my background. I have \nto go, when I don't know about issues, to the experts. It is rarely \nthat I find experts who are completely in agreement on an issue, and \nevery expert in America is unanimous in saying we have to have some \nprovisions that punish the tobacco companies if they don't do what they \nsay they are going to do.\n  When the tobacco industry entered into the agreement, they promised \nto do everything they could to reduce teen smoking. That was part of \nthe agreement they entered into. So how in the world somebody would say \nthat when you swear to defend the Constitution of the United States \nthat you would totally disagree with every health expert in America, \nfrankly, is something I don't understand.\n  These proposals have been pummeled pretty heavily for the last couple \nof days, including from the Senator from Texas who has been here quite \nawhile, and including others.\n  I want to say, I am coming to respond to this because this \nlegislation is based on an agreement the tobacco industry voluntarily \nentered into. It seems to me the Senator from Oklahoma's and the \nSenator from Texas' problem is not with this legislation, it is with \nthe original agreement. And, frankly, they have every right to disagree \nwith it.\n  But the reason why many of the provisions were put in that \nlegislation and were entered into was because the best minds in America \non this issue said, ``You need look-back provisions, you need to \nrestrict advertising, you need to have programs that have to do with \nyouth cessation, you need to have research, you need to have funding \nfor the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control. This is what you need \nin order to stop kids from smoking.''\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Now, if you want--for a question, I would be glad to \nrespond, which is the normal--\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator used my name about 14 times. I would like to \nrespond, because you made a couple allegations I resent and I would \nlike to respond. But I would like to make a statement, not a question. \nI would like to make a statement. It would only take me about 4 \nminutes. But I would like to respond since my name has personally been \nmentioned, I think, 14 times. I am counting.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Of course the Senator from Oklahoma's name has been \nmentioned, because I am trying to respond to the Senator's statements \nabout the legislation. If he would prefer I not mention the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma or saying a certain Senator, but I listened very \ncarefully as a certain Senator attacked this legislation very strongly, \nin all candor and sincerity.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am trying to respond to those comments that were made \nabout the legislation. I think that is the normal give-and-take of \ndebate here on the floor. I am saying that--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know my colleague from \nTexas has been waiting to speak on the amendment. But there were a few \nthings implied by my colleague's statements, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee. He said, ``The Senator from Oklahoma doesn't agree \nwith the look-back assessments that were part of the attorney general's \nagreement. And if the tobacco companies agree to it, why would he be \nopposed to look-back?''\n  I was not part of that agreement. I think my colleague from Arizona \nonce said, ``Why don't you introduce the tobacco settlement so we can \nmark up from that bill?'' I did not do it. The chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee did. I did not do it because I was not comfortable with it. I \ndid not do it because I do not want to introduce a bill that says \ntobacco companies will be exempt from class action suits.\n  I did not do it because I looked at look-back assessments and said, \n``That's no way to tax.'' I think there is a right way to tax and a \nwrong way to tax. This is the wrong way to tax. And so to attack me and \nsay that if I am against look-back penalties I am also against every \nhealth professional or expert is ridiculous.\n  I think this is a crummy way to tax. I have told my colleagues, you \nwant a tax? Tax. Call it a tax. Don't hide behind saying, ``It's a fee. \nIt's an assessment.''\n  I just read the attorneys general's deal with the tobacco companies. \nThey did not say anything about having a survey and deeming it ``proper \nand correct'' and so on. My point being, I am not part of the deal that \nthe attorneys general negotiated. They did not ask me. I am part of the \nFinance Committee, which is responsible for raising taxes. This \nCongress has already raised tobacco taxes. And if Senators want to \nincrease them again, they have the right.\n  We raised the tobacco tax last year. I did not vote for it. I do not \nknow if my friend and colleague from Arizona did or not. But we \nincreased tobacco taxes last year 15 cents. The increases have not gone \ninto effect yet, but they will. They are on the books. And that is the \nway we should do it. That is the way the system works. This convoluted \nsystem of industry payments going up to $1.10, plus look-back penalty \nis wrong. Originally the look-back was $2 billion in the settlement, \nand then the Commerce Committee bill was $3.96 billion, and then the \nbill that was introduced on Monday that we have before us is $4.4 \nbillion. And then the amendment that was offered this afternoon goes to \n$7.7 billion.\n\n  I am just saying this is not a workable tax. And I did not agree to \nthe tobacco settlement. So my colleague from Arizona, I believe \ninsinuated that I support the tobacco companies. I do not support the \ntobacco companies. I just think this is a crummy way to tax, and I \nresent this idea that whoever opposes look-back is supportive of the \ntobacco industry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I--\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is not true.\n\n[[Page S5311]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could comment, I in no way intended that----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In any way, that implication, I say to my friend from \nOklahoma. I said on numerous occasions that his views on this are \nsincere and heartfelt. I hope the Senator understands that. And I say, \nI understand that my colleague from Oklahoma knows that I have been \nhere for a number of days now, and there have been assaults not only on \nthe bill itself but on the committee.\n  You made some remarks about it, et cetera, and I just felt I would \ndefend it. But at the same time, the Senator from Oklahoma is sincere \nin his beliefs, and they are held with integrity. And I do not in any \nway imply that there is any relationship there. I wanted to clear that \nup.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that.\n  I am going to make two other very quick remarks. One, the negotiated \nlook-back with the attorney generals was not product specific. And the \namendment that we have before us goes to $5.5 billion in penalties on a \nproduct specific basis, which means we are going to do a survey on \nevery tobacco product used by teenagers and assess penalties on every \nsingle product. Now, isn't that bureaucratic, isn't that a mess.\n  I hope people will understand this is a big expense. And some people \nthink it is a move in the right direction. I think it is a move in the \nwrong direction.\n  Before my colleague from Arizona leaves, he said, ``Didn't Senator \nLott ask Senator Nickles to head this tobacco effort up and pull all \nthe committee Chairs together,'' and we then assigned the \nresponsibilities to the Commerce Committee chairman?\n  I say that when I was involved in this particular phase of it, that \nthe linchpin of granting immunity--and I see that as a linchpin in this \nlegislation fell to the Commerce Committee. If there was going to be a \ndeal--and that is what the attorneys general's settlement was \npredicated on--the fact that if you grant tobacco companies limited \nimmunity from class action suits, they will pay so many billions of \ndollars, about $15 billion.\n  Now, conceivably, that could be put in the Commerce Committee. But I \nreally believe that the Finance Committee should have jurisdiction over \nthe tax. I have been upset about it ever since. I do think that if we \nare going to have a tax, we ought to call it a tax. We should not hide \nbehind fees and we should not have look-backs assessments. I think \nthese issues are the responsibility of the Finance Committee. And I \nthink if we did that, we would tax tobacco just like we always taxed \ntobacco.\n  I think the Commerce Committee, with all due respect, did a crummy \njob. Its bill has different prices for different brands of snuff. It \nexempts some tobacco companies from a tax. It hits other tobacco \ncompanies hard. I find that to be inequitable. I think the tax should \nbe so much per product, and let us just say how much a pack it is, how \nmuch a can it is and how much a pouch, so people will know. I believe \nthat very, very strongly. And so I communicate that to my friend and \ncolleague.\n\n  I appreciate the fact that my friend from Texas has been so patient. \nI yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have debated this thing all week. We are \nin morning business and we are carrying on the debate, so I guess it \nshows people feel strongly about it.\n  I want to make it very clear what the issue is on this look-back \nprovision. The Senator from Arizona acts as if by the tobacco companies \nagreeing to the procedure that somehow that sanctifies this procedure. \nThe Senator from Arizona acts as if by the public health experts \nbelieving we should have a penalty that somehow that sanctions this \nlook-back provision.\n  My concern with the look-back provision is not that it is a penalty; \nmy objection to the look-back provision is that it is clearly patently \nunconstitutional. And it is unconstitutional on two bases. No. 1, the \nConstitution, in article I, says it shall be the power of Congress to \nlay taxes. The most fundamental power of Congress is to tax. This bill \ndelegates the power to tax to a public opinion poll and to the \nSecretary of the Treasury --clearly unconstitutional.\n  Secondly, this bill puts a company in a position that if they have no \ncontrol over the decision of a 14-year-old, and the 14-year-old makes a \ndecision, that company can be punished for the decision of the 14-year-\nold, even though there is no evidence whatsoever that they have had any \nimpact on that decision. Clearly, that violates British common law and \nit violates the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  So the point I am making is not that public experts don't have a \nposition, not that tobacco companies don't have a position, not that \nthe Senator from Arizona doesn't have a position, but there is a \nConstitution. When we all stood right down there below that first step \nand put our hand on the Bible and swore to uphold the Constitution \nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic, we made a commitment, one I \ntake very seriously.\n  So the problem with this provision besides it being absolutely \ncomical--who would have ever thought we would have a bill where you \nwould do a public opinion poll, and based on what 12- and 13-year-olds \nsay in a public opinion poll, you would have a pollster, in essence, \nempowered to raise taxes? Who ever heard of such a thing? Not only does \nthis not pass the Constitution test, this doesn't pass the laugh test. \nThis is one of the most absurd provisions I have ever seen.\n  Now, granted, if our only defense of it is, well, the tobacco \ncompanies supported it, I didn't know that we had turned the writing of \nlaw over to the tobacco companies or the health experts or the public \nchoice advocates.\n  My point is, this provision is embarrassingly silly and \nunconstitutional. I would be ashamed to vote for a bill that had a \nprovision in it where you let a pollster's finding trigger tax \nincreases, rather than an act of Congress, where Congress, in general \nsession, assembled, passes a tax bill that is signed by the President. \nThat is the issue we have raised here--not who cut what deal and who \nsigned off on what, but, basically, two very relevant tests: No. 1, the \nConstitution test; and, No. 2, the laugh test. I think this provision \nfails both of those tests.\n  I think the more people know about these provisions, the less support \nthere is going to be for this bill. To the extent that we draw public \nattention to this, perhaps we will come to our senses, and if we want \nto make taxes higher, make them higher. But don't empower some pollster \nto take over the constitutional powers of the Congress. It won't stand \nconstitutional muster for a minute, and it makes us potentially the \nlaughingstock of the public. That is what the issue was about--not that \nall of these so-called advocates for the public interest support the \nprovision, not that the tobacco companies have endorsed it. The \nquestion is: Is it constitutional, and is it laughable? The answer is: \nNo, and yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas has indicated that \nthe bill is unconstitutional with respect to the look-back provisions. \nWe have an opinion from the Congressional Research Service on the look-\nback provisions, and this is what they say: ``We conclude that the bill \nwhich may be refined further in the amendment process does not appear \nto pose serious constitutional concerns and would seem to satisfy a \nshowing of rationality and legitimate government action.''\n  So while the Senator from Texas has determined this bill \nunconstitutional, the Congressional Research Service says otherwise. \nThey say this bill is constitutional. They say that it will satisfy a \nshowing of rationality and legitimate government action.\n  We have heard a lot of arguments out on the floor today. We have had \na number of Senators dominate the discussion, and, frankly, I had begun \nto wonder if they were afraid to debate and afraid to vote. That is \nwhat is going on here. We are in the ``stall,'' because some are afraid \nto debate and they are afraid to vote. They won't even allow a debate \nto occur out here on the floor. They reject any interchange, any \ndiscussion. Instead, they just want to give speeches to stall and \ndelay.\n  So, maybe it is time for us to have a debate. I don't know why they \nwon't\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\ncome out here and debate. Let's have a debate, and let's see what the \nAmerican people conclude after that.\n  Now, we have heard all day that this is disproportionately affecting \nthe lowest-income people. This is a levy on them. The first thing I \npoint out is, people choose what they do. Nobody is going to pay a \npenny of tax if they don't go to the store and buy the cigarettes. They \ndon't have to do that. There is no requirement to do that. This is no \nlevy on their income; this is their choice.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about personal \nresponsibility. This is a question of personal responsibility. It goes \nbeyond that. Nobody is talking about the taxes imposed on all the rest \nof us who are expected to pick up the tab because this industry imposes \ncosts on society that aren't being covered by them. Mr. President, the \nrest of us are being expected to pay taxes, to pay the Medicare bill \nestimated at $22 billion a year imposed by this industry. The Medicaid \nProgram has over $11 billion a year of cost imposed on them because of \nthis industry. That is not covered.\n  How did we get here? We got here because State attorneys general sued \nthe tobacco companies--sued them. And the basis for the lawsuit was, \nthe tobacco industry was imposing costs on State Medicaid Programs. Of \ncourse, part of State Medicaid Programs is financed not only by State \ntaxpayers but by Federal taxpayers. Federal taxpayers have had costs \nimposed on them because of the use of tobacco products. It is only fair \nto the vast majority of people who don't smoke that they have some of \nthese costs relieved from them. Three-quarters of the people in this \ncountry do not smoke, and they are being expected to pick up the tab \nfor the industry's actions, for what this industry has done. That is \nnot fair. It is time to redress some of this balance. The three-\nquarters of the people who get stuck with the bill each and every year \nsay, ``Wait just a minute now. It is time for this industry to pay a \nfuller share of the costs it imposes in this society.''\n  The best estimates we have are that the use of tobacco products costs \nthis society $130 billion a year. Those are the costs being imposed by \nthis industry. People smoke 24 billion packs of cigarettes a year. So \nthe costs per pack being imposed on this society are $5 a pack. Those \nare the costs being imposed by this industry on all the rest of us. Who \nis paying that tab? Every other taxpayer, every single one that doesn't \nsmoke, is being stuck with that bill.\n  We are saying it is time for the industry to start paying a fair \nshare of the costs that it imposes on this society and all the rest of \nus. That is just a matter of fairness.\n  Now, why do we have look-back provisions? Senator McCain is precisely \nright: The reason there are look-back penalties imposed is because this \nindustry has a history of going after young people. They try to addict \nthem because they know they become lifetime smokers, and they know if \nthey don't get them young and early, they don't get them.\n  If there is any question about what this industry has done, let me go \nback to my top 10 tobacco tall tales. No. 7 was, ``Tobacco companies \ndon't market to children.'' Here is their own document, a 1978 memo \nfrom a Lorillard tobacco executive. These are not words, these are the \nwords from a tobacco company executive: ``The base of our business are \nhigh school students.'' That is the base of their business. They know \nwhat the base of it is. That is why they have been going after kids \nwith their marketing and advertising campaigns for years.\n  Tall Tale No. 8: Again, the claim, ``Tobacco companies don't market \nto children.'' Their own documents, a 1976 R.J. Reynolds research \ndepartment forecast: ``Evidence is now available to indicate that the \n14 to 18-year-old-year-old age group is an increasing segment of the \nsmoking population. RJR must soon establish a successful new brand in \nthis market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over \nthe long term.''\n  What could be more clear?\n  They are going after kids with advertising, with marketing, because \nthey understand they are the base of their business.\n  Tall tale No. 9: Again, the claim that the tobacco companies don't \nmarket to children.\n  From their own documents, a 1975 report from Philip Morris \nresearcher, Myron Johnston:\n\n       Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been \n     attributable in large part to our high market penetration \n     among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . my own \n     data . . . shows even higher Marlboro market penetration \n     among 15-17-year-olds.\n\n  This is why it is necessary to have a look-back provision. This is \nwhy it is necessary to say, if you do not achieve the goals for \nreduction of youth smoking, you are going to pay an economic penalty, \nbecause nobody knows more about marketing to kids and how to \nsuccessfully hook them than the tobacco industry. They spend hundreds \nof millions of dollars learning how to effectively get across to them. \nAnd they are the only ones that have the best information, or I should \nsay they are the ones who have the best information on what might work \nto allow youth smoking to decline. The best way to get an effect of \nwhat we are serious about here, reducing youth smoking, is to give the \ncompanies an economic incentive to achieve those goals.\n  Unfortunately, in the McCain bill most of the penalty is given on an \nindustry-wide basis. The Durbin amendment is seeking to shift that so \nmost of the penalty is on a company-specific basis. Why? First, if you \npunish everybody equally you punish the good with the bad. \nUnfortunately, that is what the McCain bill does because they put most \nof the penalty industry-wide. It doesn't matter if you are a good \ncompany and you really achieve the goals for reducing youth smoking, or \nyou are a bad company. You still pay the penalty. That is not \nindividual responsibility. Frankly, that is socialism. That has \neverybody in the pot together, good or bad.\n  Second, having a penalty that is largely based, industry-wide, \ncreates a perverse incentive. With an industry-wide penalty, if a \ncompany does the right thing and reduces youth smoking, it still pays \nthe penalty. In fact, it pays twice. It pays the penalty, and it \nsuffers the loss of market share from not addicting young kids. What a \nperverse incentive that is.\n  Mr. President, the third point that needs to be made is that because \nall the companies will pay the same surcharge, they can just treat this \nas a cost of doing business and pass that surcharge along to the \ncustomers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it all boils down to the question at the \nbottom, which is, What are we going to do to reduce smoking in this \ncountry? Why is that the goal? Because we have 400,000 of our fellow \ncitizens dying every year from smoking-related diseases. It is the No. \n1 health challenge in the country that is avoidable. It is No. 1. There \nis nothing else that kills this number of our fellow citizens. The \nestimate is for every three that are smoking, one will die of smoking-\nrelated diseases.\n  I have held hearings now all across America. Everywhere we have gone \npeople have come forward and described the agony and the tragedy caused \nin American families by the use of this product. This is the only legal \nproduct in America when used as intended by the manufacturers that \naddicts and kills its customers. There is no other product that fits \nthat bill. The only one, the only legal product, when used as intended \nby the manufacturer that addicts and kills its customers.\n  People in this country are asking us to stand up and do something to \nhelp them--to help them keep their kids from using this drug, and a \ndrug it is--to help them avoid the disability and death that attends \nthe use of tobacco products. We are not going to prohibit the use of \ntobacco because we have 45 million people in this country that smoke. \nWe don't have a very good history with prohibition.\n  We can do something to help American families deal with the agony \ncaused by the use of these products. We should not avoid the \nopportunity to act.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business with Senators to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Biden pertaining to the introduction of S. 2110 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are ready to close down the Senate \ntonight, and we are about ready to end, really, the debate on the \ntobacco bill for this week. This bill will be back in the Chamber. We \nwill be debating it in the future. I think we got off to a very good \nstart. No one ever said that this was going to be an easy bill. This is \na very complicated bill. Congress is doing something we have never done \nbefore. It is very complex. So we knew going in it was not going to be \neasy.\n  Nothing important ever is easy. It is important that we continue to \npush on because there is a lot at stake. I would submit what is at \nstake, really, is the future of tens of thousands of our young people. \nWe all know the statistics. We all know what the facts are. We all know \nhow important it is we stop young people from starting to smoke. We \nknow the reality that if the child does not start tobacco use at 19 or \n20, hasn't smoked, the odds are the child isn't going to smoke. We also \nknow most people start when they are young, start when they are way \nunderage and it is illegal to smoke, cannot smoke if they do, and we \nknow that is when they get started.\n  We have heard the statistics. We know the statistics about the 3,000 \nchildren starting to smoke every day. We know the statistics that \nroughly a third of them will die premature deaths, some horrible \ndeaths, because of smoking. So I think we all know what is at stake.\n  I think it is important as we complete this week to remind ourselves \nthat, yes, it is tough. This is a tough bill. This is a tough world. \nThis is contentious. But that is what we get paid to do. That is why \npeople send us here--to make tough decisions. I think we need to remind \nourselves that this really is a historic opportunity. It is a historic \nopportunity that has been presented the country, and has been presented \nthis Senate, and has been literally put in our laps. We can either take \nup this opportunity and do what is right and do something very \nconstructive, or we can pass it by. This is a historic opportunity. It \nwas really given to us because of the settlement that was announced \nlast June by tobacco companies and by the attorneys general, an \nunprecedented settlement, a settlement that cannot go into effect \nwithout a comprehensive bill passing the Senate, passing the House, and \nultimately being signed into law by the President.\n\n  Let me commend Chairman John McCain for the work he has done in \nbringing this bill to the floor. Let me commend him for the work he has \ndone this week, keeping this process moving forward. It is clear that, \nif we are going to reduce teenage smoking, there has to be a \ncomprehensive approach. It is like most things in life, there are no \nsimple answers. If there were simple answers, we would have found them \na long, long time ago.\n  Raising the price of cigarettes, raising the price of tobacco, is an \nimportant element to reduce teenage smoking. There is an inverse \nrelationship, clearly, between the cost and the use. But we also know, \nbased on every study that we have seen, everything that we have looked \nat, I think most of us have come to the conclusion that raising the \nprice of cigarettes alone will not do it, that we have to do other \nthings. We have to stop the advertising for cigarettes that appeal \ndirectly to children--get rid of the Joe Camels, or those who will \nfollow Joe Camel; get rid of the Marlboro Man; get rid of the cartoon \nfigures; get rid of the advertising that any parent looks at for 1 \nsecond and knows this is clearly targeted at children or, if it is not \ntargeted at children, at least has a tremendous appeal for children. \nThat has to be stopped.\n  We have to have counteradvertising. We have to take all the ingenuity \nof Madison Avenue and use it, instead of killing people, use that \ningenuity and use that talent to save kids. It is available, and it is \nout there, and we can do it.\n  We have to worry about law enforcement. Again, it is no different \nthan dealing with drugs in that respect. You have to have education, \nyou have to have advertising, but you also have to have law \nenforcement. We risk, as we increase the price of cigarettes and \ntobacco, expanding the black market that already does exist in this \ncountry. We have to worry about that. We have to worry about the \nenforcement of the laws that every State has about underage smoking. We \nhave to figure out better ways to enforce that law.\n  So, we have to do all of these things. And as we proceed in the weeks \nahead on this bill, and as we talk about it and we debate it and argue \nthis point and argue that point, let's keep our eye on the ball. Let's \nkeep our eye on the objective. For this Senator from Ohio, at least, \nthere is only one objective, and that is to reduce the number of our \nkids who start smoking. If we can do that, if we can do it in \nsignificant numbers, we will have accomplished a great deal.\n  That is what this bill that Senator McCain has brought to the floor \nis all about, and that is what we have to get accomplished. This is a \nhistoric opportunity. It is a unique opportunity.\n  Let me talk for a moment, if I could, about the amendment that \nSenator Durbin and I have brought to the floor this evening. It is an \namendment that we believe will make a difference. It is an amendment \nthat will bring about more accountability, hold the tobacco companies \nresponsible, make them liable for their actions, make them more \naccountable, and we think will make them do the right thing.\n  Our amendment deals with what we call look-back. I think we have to \nkeep in mind--I have had the opportunity to listen to a portion of the \ndebate from some of my colleagues who followed Senator Durbin and \nmyself, Senator Wyden--who spoke in favor of the amendment. I have \nlistened to what some of my colleagues who have raised some questions \nabout the amendment have had to say.\n\n  In response, let me make a couple of comments. First of all, the \npeople this is targeted at, the people we are targeting, are the \ntobacco companies. And the tobacco companies agreed to a look-back \nprovision. They agreed to a very, very significant look-back provision. \nThat was the provision which was included in the settlement that was \nannounced last June. So they agreed to it. They are the ones who \nthought they could meet the 60-percent reduction target in 10 years, \nand that is a significant target. But they said, ``We can do it.'' So \nthis isn't something that we dreamt up here in the Senate; this is \nsomething that the parties looked at, and all of them said, ``We can do \nit.'' And it is clear that they can.\n  It makes sense, I think, what we have done in the Durbin-DeWine \namendment. That is, we have taken John McCain's very good look-back \nprovision, and I think we have improved it. We have made it more \ncompany-specific. What do you mean, company-specific? The original \nlook-back provision was an interesting provision, really, in the sense \nthat it was socialism. I don't know any other word to describe it.\n  It basically said: Look, here are the targets. The tobacco companies \nagree on these targets. We are going to look back, after 3 years, and \nthen after a few more, and ultimately after 10 years. And every few \nyears, we are going to look back and see if the tobacco companies are \nhitting their targets in reducing teenage smoking. They said: We can \nget to 60 percent reduction in 10 years. And we phase that in--they \nphased it in, in their agreement, over that period of time.\n  Every so often, we are going to look to see how we are doing. And if \nwe determine that the reduction is not taking place, or the targets are \nnot being hit, then the tobacco companies agreed--let me emphasize \nagain--agreed that they would pay a penalty.\n  The interesting thing is, when this was put together, however, how \nthe\n\n[[Page S5314]]\n\npenalty was calculated. The agreement was that it would be calculated \nindustry-wide. So you would look to see what the total reduction in \nteenage smoking was. And then, each company--you figure out what that \ntotal penalty was. It is the penalty the tobacco companies agreed to. \nYou take that pot of money, that penalty pot, and you divide it up \namong the tobacco companies, based on their total market share. So if \none tobacco company had 30 percent of the market, they would get 30 \npercent of the cost of the penalty, irrespective of whether or not they \nwere a leader in the sale of cigarettes to young people or whether they \ndidn't sell a cigarette to a young person; it didn't make any \ndifference.\n  We looked at this and came to the conclusion that it really didn't \nmake a lot of sense to base it entirely on that procedure. We came to \nthe conclusion that the tobacco companies should be held accountable \nfor what they did specifically. So we came up with this amendment with \na variation of what Senator McCain had done, where he blended the \npenalties, basically making part of the penalties being applied \nindustry-wide--that form of socialism we talked about--part of the \npenalties being applied case by case, company by company.\n  We have kept a blend in the Durbin-DeWine amendment, but we put more \nemphasis on company-specific. We think it makes sense to hold the \nindividual tobacco companies accountable for the reduction in their \nproduct that is being sold to kids. Now, some of my friends have come \nto the floor and said, ``Well, look, that's not really fair. Tobacco \ncompanies can't control what they sell to kids.''\n\n  With all due respect, that doesn't make any sense. They control it \ntoday. They control it by their advertising. They control it by whom \nthey target. They control it by how they market the product. There is a \nreason that Marlboro has 62 percent of the market. There is a reason \nthey beat everybody else out in getting the kids market, the illegal \nsales market, the kids-under-18 market. They have been darned good at \nit. So we have seen, decade after decade, these companies being very \ngood at this and being able to figure out how they can target a niche \nmarket and how they can get into kids who are just starting to smoke.\n  To say that, now, if we give them an incentive not to do it, give \nthem a disincentive and charge them not to do it and they agree not to \ndo it, to say they can't control what they are doing makes absolutely \nno sense.\n  My colleague from Kentucky came to the floor and asked, I think, a \nvery legitimate question--Senator Ford. He said--I will paraphrase what \nhe said, but, basically: Look, you are holding the tobacco companies \nliable. But the Government is going to be the one who is going to be \ndoing the counteradvertising. And the Government is going to be doing \nother things to reduce teenage smoking.\n  I think the answer to what Senator Ford said is, yes, that is \ncorrect, the Government is going to be involved in countermeasures. The \nGovernment is going to be involved in trying to reduce teenage smoking. \nBut that doesn't mean the cigarette companies will still not be players \nand still will not have things that they can control.\n  Make no mistake about it, under this bill or any of the different \nversions of this McCain bill, tobacco companies still are going to be \nable to impact how teenagers smoke, and whether or not their product is \nmarketed to teenagers, and whether their product is sold to teenagers, \nand whether they target teenagers. How can they do it? Well, they can \ndo it in many ways. They can do it by advertising. The bill has \nrestrictions on advertising.\n  Yet, advertising is still going to be permitted. So how they target \nthat advertising and what kind of advertising they place and where they \nplace it is going to clearly impact on whether or not young kids \nunderage buy cigarettes.\n  Tobacco companies will control that. They will control advertising. \nThey will control how they market the product as they do today. They \nwill control how they target the product as they do today. They can \nrun, if they want to--and this is clearly within their control--their \nown antismoking campaigns aimed at kids. They clearly can do that.\n  We hope the more money they spend on that, the more emphasis they \nwill put on that, it will reduce the consumption of their own product. \nClearly, how the tobacco companies market and advertise will impact \nyouth smoking. They have some responsibility. We have to hold them \naccountable.\n  My friends, particularly on this side of the aisle, always talk about \naccountability. We are in an age of accountability, whether we are \ntalking about welfare or whatever we are talking about. We are in an \nage of accountability where people need to be accountable for their own \nactions. What the Durbin-DeWine amendment says is the tobacco companies \nought to be responsible for their own actions; the tobacco companies \nought to be judged not by what they say but by what they do. The \ntobacco companies ought to be charged and looked at and judged by what \nthe results are. That is all we are saying.\n  I find that to be a pretty conservative point of view, and a point of \nview that most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle always talk \nabout and, I think, support. If we look at it in this way, this is, in \neffect, a very conservative amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Durbin-DeWine amendment changes the incentives. We \nget rid of the profit motive. We give the incentive to prevent kids \nfrom smoking. We give that incentive to the tobacco companies.\n  Another issue that was raised a few moments ago in regard to the \ngeneral look-back provision which our amendment contains and the McCain \nbill does, of course, is whether or not these surveys are accurate. The \nstatement was made or the assertion was made, ``How in the world can \nyou hold tobacco companies liable for surveys?''\n  First of all, they agreed to it. They agreed to it. They agreed to \nthe broad survey of looking at the industry and looking at how much \nteenage smoking was occurring. They agreed to that.\n  Second, these same tobacco companies rely on surveys to do \nadvertising. They rely on surveys to do everything in regard to \nmarketing. Mr. President, I don't think there is one of us in this \nSenate who has not come to the floor when we talk about illicit drugs \nin this country, not a one of us has not come to this floor and cited \nstatistics based on surveys about whether the consumption of drugs \namong our young people is going up or going down. We take them at face \nvalue, we rely on them, we make policy based on them and we make \ndecisions based on them.\n  We have had a debate ongoing for the last 6 to 9 months in this \nSenate in which I have been involved on several different occasions \nwhere we have lamented the fact that among the very youngest of our \nchildren who are starting to use drugs, the consumption is going up at \nthe same time the fear factor is going down. And we picked that up from \nthe national surveys being done. Drug-Free Youth Group, we rely on that \nin our decisions.\n  I think it is clear that surveys scientifically done, correctly done, \nclearly can tell us what percentage of the youth market is smoking and \nwhat percentage of the youth market is smoking Marlboros. There is no \ndoubt about it. We can come within a very, very close percentage, a \nfraction of a percentage of getting that figure.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by again congratulating Senator McCain \nfor bringing this bill to the floor. It is a comprehensive approach. At \nthe end of the day, when all the days are over and this finally made \nits way through the Senate, if we are going to have something \nworthwhile, it has to be a comprehensive approach.\n  We have to be concerned about driving up the cost, the price, because \nwe know that will have an impact. We have to counter advertising. We \nhave to have some control of the advertising and the cigarette \ncompanies ultimately need to agree to that.\n  As this process goes through, it is sometimes not a pretty process, \nit is certainly not an easy process, but it is our process, a \ndemocratic process, and I remain optimistic that we will end up with a \ncomprehensive bill that will reduce teenage smoking significantly, that \nwill save lives and that will be a bill of which we can all be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5309-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5314-S5315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO FORMER SENATOR GEORGE MITCHELL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, April 10, 1998 was not only Good Friday and\n\n[[Page S5315]]\n\nPassover for millions of people around the world. It was a day that \nmarked a beginning for the people of Northern Ireland. A beginning on a \npath toward peace after thirty long years of civil conflict that \nclaimed over 3000 lives. Although a great deal of work lies ahead to \nensure that the peace agreement signed in Belfast is adopted by all \nparties and faithfully implemented, the agreement is an achievement of \nimmense historic significance.\n  Over the years, like so many Americans who are proud of their Irish \nheritage, I have wondered if I would live to see this day. Some years \nago, not long after the first cease-fire began, I traveled to Northern \nIreland and met with both Catholics and Protestants. Both longed for \npeace. Both asked me to urge President Clinton, who had taken a chance \nfor peace when he granted a visa to Gerry Adams, to stay the course. We \nall knew there would be setbacks. We knew more innocent blood would be \nlost. But while some longed for a past that was gone and others for a \nfuture that could never be, most knew that violence could not bring \npeace and that the only way to a better life was through compromise.\n  The April 10th agreement represents the culmination of a tremendous \namount of effort, and a great deal of courage, by many people. As party \nleaders, John Hume, whom I consider it a great privilege to call a \nfriend, Gerry Adams, and David Trimble brought their constituents' \nlonging for peace to the negotiating table and understood the \nresponsibility history had thrust upon them and the need to find the \nmiddle ground. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish \ncounterpart, Bertie Ahern, deserve enormous praise for putting the full \nweight of their offices and their personal reputations behind the \nnegotiations.\n  Several other people I want to pay tribute to are former Irish Prime \nMinisters Albert Reynolds and John Bruton, and former Foreign Minister \nDick Spring, who put the peace process in motion and labored day and \nnight to keep it moving forward despite setbacks. Throughout this \nperiod Former Irish Ambassador Dermot Gallagher and his successor Sean \nO'Huiginn played a critical role keeping us informed here in Washington \nas they worked to further the peace process.\n  But I want to make particular mention of our former Senate colleague, \nGeorge Mitchell, whose wisdom, steady perseverance and total dedication \nto the cause of peace enabled the parties to find a way to put the \nyears of hatred behind them and look to a new day.\n  Senator Mitchell came from humble beginnings. Born to Lebanese and \nIrish immigrants in rural Maine, he worked his way through Bowdoin \nCollege and Georgetown Law School. As a federal judge and from the time \nhe joined the Senate in 1982, he demonstrated patience, even-handedness \nand commitment to the public good. As Majority Leader, he served as an \narticulate national spokesman, a trusted colleague and a good friend.\n  As the first serving U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, \nPresident Clinton made a commitment to the peace process early on, \ncourageously put his prestige on the line by granting a visa to Gerry \nAdams, and showed great foresight in his appointment of Senator \nMitchell as chairman of the negotiations. As I said at that time, I \ncould not have imagined a person better suited to bring the sides \ntogether and forge a common path to the future. George Mitchell managed \nto do what many in the foreign policy establishment said was \nimpossible. As the crafter of the agreement, he has given hope to \nmillions of Irish citizens, and in doing so he has shown the world that \neven the most seemingly intractable conflicts, even the most bitter \nhatred, can be overcome.\n  Mr. President, an April 18, 1998 article by Mark Shields in the \nWashington Post gives a good description of Senator George Mitchell and \nhis latest achievement. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 18, 1998]\n\n                         The Politics of Peace\n\n                           (By Mark Shields)\n\n       After hearing the happy news from Ireland that peace could \n     actually break out there, I found my notes from a campaign \n     speech given in 1993 by an American politician. This is what \n     he said then about his earlier career as a federal judge:\n       ``In that position, I had great power. The one I enjoyed \n     exercising most was when I presided over what are called \n     naturalization ceremonies.\n       ``They're citizenship ceremonies. People who come from all \n     over the world who had gone through the required procedures \n     now gathered before me in a federal courtroom, and in that \n     final act I administered to them the oath of allegiance to \n     the United States. And then, by the power invested in me \n     under the Constitution, I made them Americans.\n       ``It was always a very emotional and moving ceremony for me \n     because my mother was a Lebanese immigrant and my father was \n     the orphan son of Irish immigrants.\n       ``My parents had no education. My mother could not read or \n     write English. And they worked--my mother in a textile mill, \n     and my father as a janitor--all of their lives, to see that \n     their children had the education and the opportunity they did \n     not have. . . .\n       ``And after every one of those ceremonies, I spoke \n     personally with each of the new citizens. I asked them where \n     they came from, how they came, why they came. Their answers \n     were as different as their countries of origin. But through \n     those answers ran a common theme best summarized by a young \n     Asian man who, when I asked him why he came here, responded \n     in slow and halting English.\n       `` `I came here,' he said, `because here in America \n     everybody has a chance.' A young man who had been an American \n     for five minutes summed up the meaning of our country in a \n     single sentence.\n       ``Many of us, most of us in this room, derive great \n     benefits from our citizenship. And most of us are citizens by \n     an accident of birth, not by an act of free will.\n       ``With those benefits come responsibility, and foremost \n     among those responsibilities is our obligation to see to it \n     that those who follow us, the generations yet unborn, have \n     opportunity, have hope, have the right to a good, decent \n     life, a good job, a good-paying job, the opportunity to feed, \n     clothe, house and educate one's children in the best way \n     possible.''\n       Much, too much, has been written in recent years about the \n     politics of values. That 1993 speech expressed \n     straightforwardly the values of an American politician--\n     George Mitchell, Democrat from Maine, former Senate majority \n     leader--who, over the past 22 months, through a combination \n     of heroic patience, consummate prudence and a near-unique \n     ability to publicly submerge his own ego, has crafted the \n     peace plan for Northern Ireland.\n       Politics is the peaceable resolution of conflict among \n     legitimate competing interests. That is what Mitchell brought \n     to Belfast from Waterville, Maine, after working his way \n     through Bowdoin College and night law school at Georgetown \n     University. A committed partisan, he helped run the two \n     losing national campaigns of his mentor, Sen. Edmund Muskie \n     of Maine.\n       Neither a plaster saint nor politically invincible, \n     Mitchell himself ran in 1972 for the chairmanship of the \n     Democratic National Committee and lost to Robert Strauss of \n     Texas. In the Watergate election of 1974, when Democrats \n     swept nearly everything, Mitchell still lost the governorship \n     of Maine to an independent. When Muskie left the Senate in \n     1980 to become secretary of state, Mitchell was chosen to \n     succeed him.\n       At the 1987 Iran-contra hearings, Mitchell gave a civics \n     lesson to the nation, as he bluntly advised the grandstanding \n     Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North to ``recognize that it is \n     possible for an American to disagree with you on aid to the \n     contras and still love God and still love this country as \n     much as you do.\n       ``Although He is regularly asked to do so, God does not \n     take sides in American politics. And in America, disagreement \n     with the policies of the government is not evidence of lack \n     of patriotism.''\n       British Prime Minister Tony Blair was indispensable to the \n     peace agreement. So, too, was Irish Prime Minister Bertie \n     Ahern. And the courageous Protestant and Catholic leaders in \n     the North. President Clinton, against the jaded opposition of \n     the foreign policy establishment and over the objections of \n     his own State and Justice Departments, took the bold risks \n     for peace. He has been a leader.\n       But it was the son of George and Mary Saad Mitchell of \n     Waterville who was to grow up and remind us in Easter week \n     1998 that politicians can also be peacemakers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5314-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5315-S5316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to respond to a floor speech \nmy good friend and colleague Senator Leahy recently delivered. In that \naddress, Senator Leahy once again brought attention to the so-called \nvacancy crisis that is facing our Federal Judiciary. Now, I don't blame \nSenator Leahy for that. After all, that is his job. He needs to press \nus a bit to move judges for the Clinton Administration. And indeed, we \nhad some disconnects in the past that prevented us from holding \nhearings on perhaps as many judges as we would have liked.\n  That having been said, I am pleased that Senator Leahy and I have \nworked out some of the kinks in the process and have worked together to \nensure that qualified nominees are confirmed. Similarly, I am happy to \nreport that I have worked over the last few months with White House \nCounsel Chuck Ruff to ensure that the nomination and confirmation \nprocess is a collaborative one between the White House and members of \nthe Senate. I think it's fair to say that after a few bumpy months in \nwhich the process suffered due to inadequate consultation between the \nWhite House and some Senators, the process is now working rather \nsmoothly. I think the progress is due to the White House's renewed \ncommitment to good faith consultation with Senators of both parties. I \nalso want to compliment Senator Leahy for his willingness to work with \nme to get hearings scheduled for nominees. Let me take a moment, \nhowever, to correct some of the pernicious myths that persist on the \nsubject of the confirmation process.\n  Quite simply, contrary to what you may have read in the popular \npress, there is no general vacancy crisis. So far this year, the Senate \nhas confirmed 26 of President Clinton's nominees. We have confirmed a \ntotal of 62 Judges this Congress, in addition to a number of Executive \nbranch nominees. In fact, 266 active Federal Judges, or roughly 35% of \nall sitting Article III judges, were appointed by this Administration. \nAs of today there are 768 active Federal Judges. What does that number \nmean? It means that there are currently more sitting federal judges \nhearing cases than in any previous administration. In fact, since \nbecoming Chairman, I have yet to cast a vote against a single Clinton \njudicial nominee.\n  Just as a matter of comparison, at this point in the 101st and 102nd \nCongress when George Bush was president and Democrats controlled the \nSenate, there were only 711 and 716 active judges, respectively. Thus, \nwe have 50 more sitting federal judges today than we did in 1992, yet \nsome would have us believe that our federal courts are being \noverwhelmed by a tidal wave of cases.\n  Keep in mind that the Clinton administration is on record as having \nstated that 63 vacancies is virtual full employment of the federal \njudiciary. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists the \ncurrent number of federal judicial vacancies as 76, a far cry from the \n``nearly 100'' I have heard some claim. In fact, by the \nadministration's own admission we are 13 judges away from a fully \nemployed federal judiciary. Which begs the question: if we are only 13 \njudges away from full employment how can we be mired in a vacancy \ncrisis? Only 13 judges out of 843 authorized--I think it is time to put \nthe vacancy crisis argument to rest.\n  Moreover, let's compare today's vacancy level of 76, with those that \nexisted during the early 1990's when the Democratic and Republican \nparties' fortunes were reversed. In May of 1991, there were 148 federal \njudicial vacancies. One year later, in May of 1992, there were 117 \nfederal judicial vacancies. I remember those years. I don't, however, \nremember one comment about it in the media. I don't recall one \ntelevision show mentioning it. I don't recall one writer writing about \nit. Nobody seemed to care. Nobody, that is, except the Chief Justice of \nthe United States, William Rehnquist. Back then, in his year-end \nreport, he called upon the Democratically controlled Senate to confirm \nmore judges, much like he did this past year. Yet no one seemed too \nconcerned about the Chief Justice's comments back then. Now, when we \nhave a Democrat in the White House, all of a sudden it has become a \ncrisis when we have virtually half the vacancies today that we had in \n1991. And it becomes a crisis even though the Chief Justice's message \nis virtually the same now as it was back then.\n  I also think it important to note that at the end of the Bush \nAdministration, there were 115 vacancies, for which 55 nominees were \npending before the Judiciary committee. None of those 55 nominees even \nreceived the courtesy of a hearing, however. Compare this to the 65 \nvacancies remaining at the end of President Clinton's first term. I \nthink there is quite a difference.\n  Some have mentioned a deliberate effort among Republican members of \nthe Senate to unduly delay the confirmation of Judicial nominees. \nNothing could be further from the truth. The judiciary committee has in \nfact processed nominees at a remarkably fast pace this session. Of the \n25 nominees currently pending in the Judiciary committee without a \nhearing, 10 were received since April. Today, there are only 5 nominees \npending on the Senate Floor, and I expect that we will vote on their \nconfirmations before the session ends.\n\n  A good deal has been said by critics with regard to the vacancies on \nthe Second and Ninth Circuits. It is true that these two circuits have \nhad unusual difficulties. It should be mentioned, however, that \nnominations to the Ninth Circuit were held up to decide whether the \nCircuit should be split or not. Now that a commission is in place to \nstudy that issue, we have been able to move a number of Ninth Circuit \nnominations. In fact, we have confirmed more judges to the Ninth \nCircuit --three--than to any other circuit. Of the five Ninth Circuit \njudges still pending in the Senate, two have had hearings and one is \npending on the floor. We received two of the other nominees only this \nsession. And there are still vacancies remaining on that circuit--two \nvacancies of which have not even received a nominees. And one of those \nvacancies has been open since December of 1996.\n  This represents a failure not on the part of the Judiciary Committee \nbut on the Clinton Administration. President Clinton's failure to \nnominate judges expeditiously has in fact slowed the process, as the \ncommittee is left with an increasingly smaller base of qualified \nnominees to hold hearings on. In fact, fewer than half of the current \nvacancies have nominees pending, with many of those having incomplete \npaperwork. Rather than succumbing to the petulance of finger pointing, \nwe all would be better served by an administration committed to sending \nus qualified nominees as expeditiously as possible.\n  Now, we also acknowledge that there have been problems with \nconfirming\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\nnominees to the Second Circuit, but we have made a strong effort to \nameliorate them. Unfortunately an unexpected illnesses have taken their \ntoll on the Second Circuit, but we have done our part in committee. Two \nof the four nominees to that court are pending on the Senate floor, the \nother two recently had a hearing, and I expect will be voted out of \nCommittee on Thursday.\n  Apparently, President Clinton has not shared this sense of urgency \nwith regard to the Second Circuit. In fact, of the five current \nvacancies on that court, one sat without a nominee for almost two \nyears, another did not receive a nominee for over ten months, and the \nother waited just over eight months to receive a nominee. Most \ndisturbing of all is the seat vacated by Senior Judge Jon Newman, \nvacant since July 1, 1997, which is yet to receive a nominee. As I have \nstated so often before, I'm a pretty good chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, but I can't get judges confirmed that have not been \nnominated.\n  Now, while the debate about vacancy rates on our federal courts is \nnot unimportant, it remains more important that the Senate perform its \nadvice and consent function thoroughly and responsibly. Federal judges \nserve for life and perform an important constitutional function, \nwithout direct political accountability to the people. Accordingly, the \nSenate should never move too quickly on nominations before it. Just \nthis past year we saw two examples of what can happen when we try to \nmove nominations along perhaps too quickly. In one instance, a nominee \nfor a federal district court was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee before all the details of her record as a state trial judge \nwere known. As it happens, the District Attorney in the nominee's city, \nwho happened to be of her party, and the district attorneys' \nassociation in her home state all publicly opposed the nomination, \nsetting forth facts demonstrating a very serious anti-prosecution bias \nin her judicial record. It's cases like these that underscore the \nimportance of proceeding very deliberately with nominations for these \nmost important life-tenured positions.\n  Let me make an important point here: federal judges should not be \nconfirmed simply as part of a numbers game to reduce the vacancy rate \nto a particular level. While I plan to continue to oversee a fair and \nprincipled confirmation process, as I always have, I want to emphasize \nthat the primary criteria in this process is not how many vacancies \nneed to be filled, but whether President Clinton's nominees are \nqualified to serve on the bench, and will not, upon receiving their \njudicial commission, spend a lifetime career rendering politically \nmotivated, activist decisions. The Senate has an obligation to the \nAmerican people thoroughly to review the records of the nominees it \nreceives to ensure that they are capable and qualified to serve as \nfederal judges, and as part of that assessment of qualification, to \nensure that nominees properly understand the limitations of the \njudicial role.\n  Clearly, I believe the Committee has done its part. I hope to \ncontinue to work with the Administration and with Senator Leahy to \nensure that qualified individuals will serve on the federal bench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5316-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEMORIAL DAY 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, since the Civil War, more than 1.1 million \nAmerican veterans have lost their lives in service to our Nation. I am \nhumbled by their sacrifice.\n  I am grateful for the price they have paid for our liberty, the \nterrible price of individual lives, of men and women who were part of \nfamilies. As we approach this Memorial Day, I want to pause a moment \nduring this debate to remember their gift.\n  I am especially proud of Utah's proud tradition of honorable service. \nThe story of the Mormon pioneers who made the grueling trek across the \nplains and over the Great Divide to escape persecution, in search of \nreligious freedom is well known. Perhaps less well known is the story \nof the Mormon battalion.\n  Mr. President, in 1846, while there was an active order in effect in \nthe state of Missouri for the extermination of Mormons, these Americans \nwho had been driven from their homes in Nauvoo, Illinois, were asked to \nassemble a battalion of 500 men. With their ranks and strength already \nsignificantly depleted by disease, hardship, and persecution, most \nwould have understood if the story had ended with an indignant refusal \nto respond to the request.\n  Instead, led by Brigham Young, these fathers, brothers, and sons who \nhad seen their rights as Americans trampled, stepped forward to answer \ntheir country's call. I might mention that among them was a young man \nnamed Orrin Hatch.\n  This same, passionate willingness to serve one's country still \nthrives throughout my state. I remember today and honor the 147,000 \nveterans throughout the state of Utah who have honorably served. But, \non Memorial Day, we especially remember those who left in service to \nour country but who did not return.

The message this vote sends \nis clear: American support for NATO is firm, our leadership on both \nsides of the Atlantic is strong, and there is a solid bipartisan \nfoundation for an active U.S. role in transatlantic security.\n  I thank Majority Leader Lott, Minority Leader Daschle, Senators Helms \nand Biden, Senator Roth and the members of the NATO Observer Group, and \nthe many others who have devoted so much time and energy to this \nhistoric effort. The continuous dialogue and consultation between the \nAdministration and the Congress on this issue was a model of bipartisan \npartnership. I am committed to ensuring that this partnership continues \nand deepens as we proceed toward NATO'S 50th anniversary summit next \nyear in Washington.\n  The resolution of ratification that the Senate has adopted contains \nprovisions addressing a broad range of issues of interest and concern, \nand I will implement the conditions it contains. As I have indicated \nfollowing approval of earlier treaties, I will of course do so without \nprejudice to my authorities as President under the Constitution, \nincluding my authorities with respect to the conduct of foreign policy. \nI note in this connection that conditions in a resolution of advice and \nconsent cannot alter the allocations of authority and responsibility \nunder the Constitution.\n                                                  William J.

The NEH supports \nan impressive range of humanities projects advancing American \nscholarship and reaching millions of Americans each year.\n  The public has been enriched by many innovative NEH projects. These \nincluded a traveling exhibit, companion book, and public programming \nexamining the history and legacy of the California Gold Rush on the \noccasion of its Sesquicentennial. Other initiatives promoted humanities \nradio programming and major funding for the critically acclaimed PBS \nseries, ``Liberty! The American Revolution.''\n  The NEH is also utilizing computer technologies in new and exciting \nways. Answering the call for quality humanities content on the \nInternet, NEH partnered with MCI to provide EDSITEment, a website that \noffers scholars, teachers, students, and parents a link to the \nInternet's most promising humanities sites. The NEH's ``Teaching with \nTechnology'' grants have made possible such innovations as a CD-ROM on \nart and life in Africa and a digital archive of community life during \nthe Civil War. In its special report to the Congress, ``NEH and the \nDigital Age,'' the agency examined its past, present, and future use of \ntechnology as a tool to further the humanities and make them more \naccessible to the American public.\n  This past year saw a change in leadership at the Endowment. Dr. \nSheldon Hackney completed his term as Chairman and I appointed Dr. \nWilliam R. Ferris to succeed him. Dr. Ferris will continue the NEH's \ntradition of quality research and public programming.\n  The important projects funded by the NEH provide for us the knowledge \nand wisdom imparted by history, philosophy, literature, and other \nhumanities disciplines, and cannot be underestimated as we meet the \nchallenges of the new millennium.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to conduct a \nstudy of the Niobrara River watershed and the operations of Fort \nRandall Dam and Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River to determine the \nfeasibility of alleviating certain bank erosion and sedimentation \nproblems; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             NIOBRARA RIVER AND MISSOURI RIVER LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced S. 1672, \nthe Missouri River Erosion Control Act of 1998. It will create an \nimportant new program to provide homeowners on the Missouri River with \nthe assistance they need to protect their homes from shoreline erosion.\n  Today, my colleague Senator Johnson and I are introducing a second \nbill that I hope will help to preserve the character of the Missouri \nRiver for generations to come. Up and down the Missouri River, South \nDakotans can tell you that the river is slowly changing as a result of \nthe dams built under the authority of the Pick-Sloan Act. While the \ndams undoubtedly have made positive contributions to South Dakota by \ncontrolling floodwaters and making affordable electricity available to \npromote rural development, they also ended the Big Muddy's ability to \ncarry a full sediment load for long distances. Sediments are now being \ndeposited into shallow areas of the river, causing the water table to \nrise, flooding shoreline lands and worsening erosion. In addition, the \nsediment build-up has made navigation nearly impossible in some areas.\n  These problems have grown particularly severe near the city of \nSpringfield, where a delta is forming downstream from the confluence of \nthe Missouri and Niobrara Rivers. In order to better understand the \ncauses of the sediment build-up and to develop solutions to address it, \nI am introducing legislation today to direct the Corps of Engineers to \nconduct a study of the lower Missouri and Niobrara River watershed. It \nis my hope that this study will provide the blueprint necessary to \nalleviate the sediment build-up, reduce future sedimentation, and \npreserve the character of the rivers for years to come. I hope my \ncolleagues will give this legislation their full support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2105\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the boundaries of Arches National Park, \nUtah, to include portions of certain drainages that are under the \njurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, and to include a portion \nof Fish Seep Draw owned by the State of Utah, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             the arches national park expansion act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nexpand the boundaries of Arches National Park. I appreciate my \ncolleague Senator Hatch for joining me in this effort. The House \nversion of this bill, H.R. 2283 sponsored by Mr. Cannon, was passed \nlate last year.\n  Most Americans recognize the familiar landscape of Arches National \nPark. It encompasses some of the most unique lands in the Southwest. \nDelicate sandstone arches, stunning vistas, contrasting colors, \nsweeping desert valleys, maze-like rock formations, and rugged gorges \ncharacterize the panorama in the park. In 1929, when the park was \ncreated, knowledge of ecosystem management was almost nonexistent. Park \ndesignation preserved these unique geological treasures but also relied \non fairly rigid park boundaries which has resulted in some \nfragmentation of ecological areas within the park. This bill authorizes \na 3,140 acre expansion to include the beautiful and unique Lost Spring \nCanyon parcel contiguous with the eastern boundary of the Arches. This \naddition will enhance the ecological protection of Arches.\n  The Arches National Park Expansion includes portions of the following \ndrainages: Salt Wash, Lost Spring Canyon, Fish Seep Draw, Clover \nCanyon, Cordova Canyon, Mine Draw, and Cottonwood Wash. These areas are \ncurrently under the jurisdiction of either the Bureau of Land \nManagement or the State of Utah. Once the expansion is complete, the \nPark Service will continue to protect the wilderness values of these \nlands. No road or campground construction will occur in the new \naddition. Lost Spring Canyon will continue primarily to be used for \nback-country hiking. It is not in danger of being overrun by thousands \nof park visitors simply by the nature of the rugged terrain and the \ndistances involved. But it makes good management sense to bring these \nareas under park management.\n  Public lands debates are far too contentious in the West, \nparticularly in Utah. While it is unfortunate that we have not been \nable to reach consensus on issues like wilderness, I am pleased that \nthe expansion of Arches National Park is an issue which a diverse group \nof interests do agree. Local officials, the Grand Canyon Trust, the \nNational Parks and Conservation Association, environmental groups, the \nState of Utah, the Utah Congressional delegation, and the \nAdministration all support this bill.\n  This legislation is good for Arches National Park and is a great \nexample of how it is possible to reach consensus among public lands \ninterests. The expansion will enhance the visitor experience of Arches \nby expanding back-country opportunities. It makes good management sense \nfor both BLM and the Park Service. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nmoving this legislation quickly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today along with my \ngood friend and colleague, Senator Bennett, as a cosponsor of the \nArches National Park Expansion Act of 1998. This is an inexpensive, \npractical, common-sense proposal that has gathered widespread support.\n  Arches National Park is known world-wide for its spectacular canyons \nand rock formations. When Arches National Park was created 25 years \nago, the park boundaries were set with little regard to naturally \noccurring borders. Specifically, Lost Springs Canyon, located in the \nnortheast corner of the park, was divided in half by the park \nboundaries.\n  Mr. President, this worthwhile legislation would expand the \nboundaries of the park by approximately 3,140 acres, incorporating the \nLost Spring Canyon. The new, expanded boundary would better follow the \nnatural borders dictated by the position of the canyon rim rather than \nthe section lines and manmade features. Adding Lost Spring Canyon to \nthe 73,400 acres already included in Arches National Park would bring a \nvariety of new arches, balanced rocks, spires, and other geologic \nfeatures under park protection and management. The addition of Lost \nSpring Canyon would also include the option of a ``back-country'' \nexperience in Arches National Park.\n  The widespread support this bill enjoys is the result of careful \nefforts to balance competing interests. The Utah School Trust, the \nGrand Canyon Trust, the National Parks and Conservation Association, \nand the National Park Services have voiced support for the proposed \nbill. Local officials, interest groups, and a majority of the residents \nof Grand County have been consulted for input and are also supportive \nof the boundary change.\n  Again, I am pleased to cosponsor the Arches National Park Expansion \nAct of 1998. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n        Reed):\n  S. 2107. A bill to enhance electronic commerce by promoting the \nreliability and integrity of commercial transactions through \nestablishing authentication standards for electronic communications, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                  ELECTRONIC COMMERCE ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\nMr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today with Senators Wyden, McCain, \nand Reed I introduce the Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act. This \nlegislation will bring the federal government into the electronic age, \nin the process saving American individuals and companies millions of \ndollars and hundreds of hours currently wasted on government paperwork.\n  Mr. President, the Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act would require \nfederal agencies to make versions of their forms available online and \nallow people to submit these forms with digital signatures instead of \nhandwritten ones. It also sets up a process by which commercially \ndeveloped digital signatures can be used in submitting forms to the \ngovernment and permits the digital storage of federal documents.\n  Each and every year, Mr. President, Americans spend in excess of $600 \nbillion simply filling out, documenting and handling government \npaperwork. This huge loss of time and money constitutes a significant \ndrain on our economy and we must bring it under control. That is why we \nneed this legislation.\n  By providing individuals and companies with the option of electronic \nfiling and storage, this bill will reduce the paperwork burden imposed \nby government on the American people and the American economy. It will \nallow people to move from printed forms they must fill out using \ntypewriters or handwriting to digitally-based forms that can be filled \nout using a word processor. The savings in time, storage and postage \nwill be enormous. One company, computer maker Hewlett-Packard, \nestimates that the section of this bill permitting companies to \ndownload copies of regulatory forms to be filed and stored digitally \nrather than physically will, by itself, save that company $1-2 billion \nper year.\n  Other companies will experience similar savings, and the results for \nthe overall economy will be enormous. Mr. President, the results for \nAmerica's small businesses, which bear a disproportionate portion of \nthe paperwork burden, will be enormous and may in some cases spell the \ndifference between business success and failure.\n  Mr. President, the easier and more convenient we make it for American \nbusinesses to comply with paperwork\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nand reporting requirements, the better job they will do of meeting \nthese requirements, and the better job they will do of creating jobs \nand wealth for our country. This legislation will help businesses and \nsmall businesses in particular as they struggle to satisfy Washington \nbureaucrats while retaining sufficient resources to satisfy their \ncustomers and meet their payrolls.\n  The most important benefit of this legislation, however, lies in the \narea of electronic innovation. Currently, digital encryption is in a \nrelatively undeveloped state. One reason for that is the lack of \nopportunity for many individuals and companies to make use of the \ntechnology. Another is the lack of a set industry standard. By allowing \nuse of this technology in the filling out of government paperwork, and \nby establishing a standard for digital encryption, the federal \ngovernment can open the gates to quick, efficient development of this \ntechnology, as well as its more application throughout the economy. The \nbenefits to American businesses as they struggle to establish paper-\nfree workplaces that will lower administrative costs, will be \nsignificant, and will further spur our national economy.\n  Efficiency in the federal government itself will also be enhanced by \nthis legislation. By forcing government bureaucracies to enter the \ndigital information age we will force them to streamline their \nprocedures and enhance their ability to maintain accurate, accessible \nrecords. This should result in significant cost savings for the federal \ngovernment as well as increased efficiency and enhanced customer \nservice.\n  The information age is no longer new, Mr. President. We are in the \nmidst of a revolution in the way people do business and maintain \nrecords. This legislation will force Washington to catch up with these \ndevelopments, and release our businesses from the drag of an obsolete \nbureaucracy as they pursue further innovations. The result will be a \nnation and a people that is more prosperous, more free and more able to \nspend time on more rewarding pursuits.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (by request):\n  S. 2108.

Option to receive accelerated death benefits\n\n       ``(a) For the purpose of this section, a person shall be \n     considered to be `terminally ill' if such person has a \n     medical prognosis that such person's life expectancy is less \n     than a period prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs. The maximum time period prescribed in \n     regulation shall not exceed 12 months.\n       ``(b) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall prescribe \n     regulations under which any terminally ill person insured \n     under Servicemenbers' Group Life Insurance or Veterans' Group \n     Life Insurance may elect to receive in a lump-sum payment a \n     portion of the face value of the insurance as an accelerated \n     death benefit reduced by an amount necessary to assure that \n     there is no increase in the actuarial value of the benefit \n     paid, as determined in regulations issued by the Secretary. \n     The Secretary may prescribe by regulation the maximum amount \n     of the accelerated death benefit available under this section \n     that the Secretary finds to be administratively practicable \n     and actuarially sound, but in no instance shall the benefit \n     exceed 50 percent of the face value of the person's insurance \n     in force on the date the election is approved.

Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill entitled the ``Servicemembers' and Veterans Group Life \n     Insurance Accelerated Death Benefits Act.'' I request that \n     this bill be referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       This draft bill would amend title 38, United States Code, \n     by adding a new section which would provide that group life \n     insurance benefits may, upon application, be paid to a \n     terminally ill person insured under Servicemembers' Group \n     Life Insurance (SGLI) or Veterans' Group Life Insurance \n     (VGLI). Traditionally, individuals have purchased life \n     insurance in order to protect their dependents against \n     financial loss due to their death. The proceeds have served \n     to replace the lost income of the insureds and to cover their \n     final expense. However, commercial life insurance companies \n     have more recently included accelerated-benefit provisions in \n     policies, which permit policyholders to receive payment of \n     all or part of their life insurance policy's face amount \n     prior to their death to provide for their needs during their\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\n     final days. This draft bill would allow terminally ill SGLI \n     and VGLI insureds to have access to a portion of the death \n     benefits of the insurance proceeds provided under SGLI or \n     VGLI coverage before they die in order to meet the financial \n     burdens of medical and living expenses, but also would \n     preserve a portion of the benefits for their dependents.\n       Section 2 of this draft bill would provide that benefits \n     would be payable to insured persons with a medical prognosis \n     of a life expectancy of less than a period prescribed by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but the maximum period \n     prescribed by the Secretary would not exceed 12 months. The \n     Secretary would be authorized to promulgate regulations \n     prescribing the maximum amount of the accelerated death \n     benefit available under section 2, but in no event would the \n     maximum amount exceed 50 percent of the face value of the \n     person's insurance in force on the date the election is \n     approved. The insured would be able to choose to receive less \n     than the maximum amount prescribed by the Secretary, as \n     prescribed by regulation. Payment of benefits under this bill \n     would be reduced by an amount necessary to assure that there \n     is no increase in the actuarial value of the benefits paid. \n     The benefits would be exempt from taxation, see also 26 \n     U.S.C.A. Sec. 101(g)(1)(A), and creditors' claims, and would \n     not be subject to attachment, levy, or seizure before or \n     after receipt by the insured. In return for this election, \n     the insured would sever all rights that any beneficiary might \n     have had in the portion of the proceeds which are paid as \n     accelerated death benefits. The accelerated death benefits \n     election would be irrevocable and monthly deductions for SGLI \n     and premiums for VGLI would be reduced in accordance with the \n     percentage reduction in the face amount of the insured's \n     policy as a result of the election. If a SGLI insured elects \n     to receive accelerated death benefits under section 2 of this \n     proposed legislation and the SGLI policy is then converted to \n     VGLI as provided in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1968(b), the amount of the \n     accelerated benefits paid would be subtracted from the amount \n     of the VGLI available under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1977(a). The \n     Department of Veterans Affairs would be required to issue \n     regulations regarding the form and manner in which an \n     application for accelerated death benefits must be made.\n       This legislative proposal would reduce receipts annually by \n     a negligible amount; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-\n     you-go (paygo) requirement of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). This proposal should be \n     considered in conjunction with other proposals in the \n     President's FY 1999 Budget that together meet the paygo \n     requirement.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Togo D. West, Jr.,\n                                         Acting Secretary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2109. A bill to provide for an exchange of lands located near \nGustavus, Alaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n       Glacier Bay National Park Boundary Adjustment Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of \nintroducing legislation, that when enacted, will provide for a cleaner \nelectrical system for Glacier National Park and Preserve in Alaska.\n  Vice President Al Gore in his opening remarks to the President's \nCouncil on Sustainable Development on January 13, 1994 said ``Our \nobjective is results that are cleaner for the environment and cheaper \nfor the economy.'' My objective for Glacier Bay National Park and the \nnearby Gustavus community mirrors that of the Vice President--to \nproduce electricity that will be cleaner for the environment and \ncheaper for the economy.\n  Glacier Bay National Park currently generates its own electrical \npower using diesel generators. The electrical generation equipment now \nin place is expensive to maintain and is unreliable. It is my \nunderstanding that over the years there have been at least two oil \nspills into the waters of Glacier Bay, the tank farm is leaking, and \nthe current electrical system is in need of major repair. In short, the \ndiesel system at Glacier Bay is unacceptable in environmental terms\n  Before we spend tax payers dollars to add band-aids to this \nantiquated system, we ought to consider an environmentally sound and \ncheaper option for the production of electrical power.\n  Fortunately, there is a viable option. Enactment of this legislation \nwould allow the placement and installation of a small water powered \nelectrical system in the Fall Creek area on the southeast corner of \nGlacier Bay National Park and Preserve.\n  Before park advocates take out their swords and start drawing lines \nin the sand, I want to make it very clear that I am not suggesting that \nwe allow for the construction of a Hoover Dam in a National Park. I am \nsuggesting that a ``run of stream'' small diversion weir be placed \nalong Fall Creek within the boundaries of the Park.\n  Since the Fall Creek area of this proposed hydro power system is in a \nWilderness area designated by Congress, any redrawing of boundaries of \nGlacier Bay National Park or other procedure to permit the system \nrequires Congressional approval. As envisioned, the site required will \namount to approximately 78 acres. If only the ``footprint'' is \nconsidered, as little as 5 acres would be utilized.\n  I believe there are considerable environmental benefits and economic \nadvantages to be gained by eliminating dependence upon diesel fossil \nfuel and converting to a small water powered electrical system to \nprovide power to the community of Gustavus and the National Park \nService in Glacier Bay. In addition to providing clean, cheaper, stable \npriced, hydro electricity, substantial savings will occur to the State \nof Alaska, the National Park Service and to consumers. Significant \neconomic savings from appropriations and increasing operational \nexpenses for the existing systems, along with the environmental \nenhancements will have continuing long term benefits that more than \ncompensate for a loss of some 5 acres for the Fall Creek System. These \nmultiple benefits should be sufficient merit alone to justify a \nrestructuring of Park boundaries to accommodate the new electrical \ngenerating system.\n  I realize that however meritorious the proposal may be, taking \nWilderness out of a system or lands out of a park will be unacceptable \nto some. Under the provisions of this legislation lands removed from \nthe boundaries of the Park will be replaced with State lands in another \npark. In other words, there will be no net loss of Wilderness.\n  We need to clean and protect the environment at Glacier Bay and \nGustavus, this legislation is the beginning. The completed project will \nserve as a conservation model to other communities--an example of \nsignificant environmental advantages coupled with substantial economic \nsavings to the public and government which could be realized elsewhere, \nparticularly in the rural communities of Alaska.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America, in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Glacier Bay National Park \n     Boundary Adjustment Act of 1998.''\n\n     SEC. 2. LAND EXCHANGE AND WILDERNESS DESIGNATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) Subject to conditions set forth in \n     subsection (c), if the State of Alaska, in a manner \n     consistent with this Act, offers to transfer to the United \n     States the lands identified in paragraph (2) in exchange for \n     the lands identified in paragraph (3), selected from the area \n     described in Section 3(b)(1), the Secretary of the Interior \n     (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall complete \n     such exchange no later than 6 months after the issuance of a \n     license to Gustavus Electric Company by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC), in accordance with this Act. \n     This land exchange shall be subject to the laws applicable to \n     exchanges involving lands managed by the Secretary as part of \n     the National Park System in Alaska and the appropriate \n     process for the exchange of state lands required by state \n     law.\n       (2) The lands to be conveyed to the United States by the \n     State of Alaska shall be determined by mutual agreement of \n     the Secretary and the State of Alaska. Lands which will be \n     considered for conveyance to the United States pursuant to \n     the process required by State law are: (1) lands owned by the \n     State of Alaska in the Long Lake area within Wrangell-St. \n     Elias National Park and Preserve; or (2) other lands owned by \n     the State of Alaska.\n       (3) If the Secretary and the State of Alaska have not \n     agreed on which lands the State of Alaska will convey by a \n     date not later than six months after a license is issued \n     pursuant to this Act, the State of Alaska shall convey \n     (subject to the approval of the appropriate official of the \n     State of Alaska), and the United States shall accept, within \n     one year after a license is issued, title to land having a \n     sufficiently equal value to satisfy state and federal law, \n     subject to clear title and valid existing rights, and absence \n     of environmental contamination, and as provided by\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\n     the laws applicable to exchanges involving lands managed by \n     the Secretary as part of the National Park System in Alaska \n     and the appropriate process for the exchange of state lands \n     required by state law.

A bill to authorize the Federal program to prevent violence \nagainst women, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                     violence against women act ii\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Violence Against \nWomen Act--II.'' I am pleased to be joined by several Senators who are \ncosponsoring this legislation--including Senators Specter, Boxer, \nSnowe, Murray, Moseley-Braun, Mikulski, Dodd, Lautenburg, Wellstone, \nKennedy, and Durbin.\n  Mr. President, when I introduced the Violence Against Women Act eight \nyears ago--in June, 1990--it was not clear that the Senate would ever \neven consider this legislation. The fundamental reason--just eight \nyears ago, few thought it either appropriate or necessary for national \nlegislation to confront the problem of domestic violence.\n  From 1990 to 1993, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I convened \nsix hearings on the bill, released six reports on the problems of \nviolence against women, convinced the Judiciary Committee to favorably \nreport the bill to the full Senate on three times and had to re-\nintroduce the bill twice.\n  But, it was not until November, 1993--nearly 3 and \\1/2\\ years after \nintroduction--that the full Senate even considered the Violence Against \nWomen Act. In September, 1994, the Violence Against Women Act became \nlaw.\n  But, even passage of the act into law did not end the significant \ndebate on the issue of whether the problem of violence against women \nmerited a national response. As my colleagues will recall, throughout \nthe summer of 1995, the Congress debated whether or not we should \nactually fund the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Fortunately, by the fall of 1995, the Congress finally reached a \nconsensus--the Federal Government can and should provide resources and \nleadership in a national effort to end the violence women suffer at the \nhands of men who profess to love them.\n  That consensus has held to this day.\n  And, at the most practical levels, that consensus has been rewarded:\n  The murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at the hands of \ntheir ``intimates'' fell to an 19-year low in both 1995 and 1996.\n  Thousands of trained police officers are on the streets arresting \nabusers before they can victimize again; police officers are working as \nnever before to guide victims toward help; prosecutors have been added \nto the front-lines to put these abusers where they belong--behind bars; \ntens of thousands of women have been provided the shelters necessary to \nprotect themselves and their children; battered women are being \nprovided a whole range of support services--counseling, legal help for \nsuch matters as getting a ``protection from abuse'' orders; and a new \nnational domestic violence hotline has already answered nearly 200,000 \ncalls for help.\n  Mr. President, our consensus in the Congress reflects a fundamental \nconsensus in our Nation--the time when a woman has to suffer in silence \nbecause the criminal who is victimizing her happens to be her husband \nor boyfriend is over.\n  Today, we must build on this consensus and deliver on its promise--\nbecause for all the strides we have made, there remain far too many \nwomen who will go home this evening knowing in the nervous pit of their \nstomach that there is a better than even chance that they will get the \nhell beat out of them.\n  I don't know that any of us who have not been in this situation can \ntruly understand what it must be like--an understanding which would, in \nturn, also help us recognize the tremendous need to take action.\n  Perhaps we can gain a glimmer of such an understanding if we recall \nour school-boy memory--and every man in this Chamber I know has at \nleast one of these--a memory of sitting in class, dreading the time \nwhen the recess bell would ring, because the school bully told you that \nhe was going to beat the daylights out of you on the playground. \nImagine feeling that dread every day. Imagine feeling that twist in \nyour guts as an adult.\n  That is what every man in this Senate, this Congress and this Nation \nmust remember as we continue to debate what we can--and what we \nshould--do to combat violence against women.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today--the Violence \nAgainst Women Act II--has one simple goal: make more women safe.\n  This legislation seeks this goal by building on the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act--continuing what is working; seeking improvements to \nfix those efforts which could work better; and expanding the national \nfight into those areas where the need is clear, but our efforts have \nneglected.\n  Beyond describing some of the specifics of the legislation being \nintroduced, I want to make it clear, there are many other ideas and \nproposals that should be considered before the full Senate debates this \nlegislation. Also, I am sure there are several refinements to improve \nwhat is currently in this bill.\n  There are several Senators who are developing these other proposals \nand refinements--for there are many Senators who are deeply committed \nto combating violence against women. And, I hope that my colleagues \nwill review this legislation, offer their insights and lend their names \nas co-sponsors and leaders in the fight against domestic violence.\n  Still, as my colleagues review this legislation, I believe they will \nfind that it offers comprehensive and sensible responses to violence \nagainst women.\n  To highlight just some of the specific aspects of this legislation, \nlet me start with what I believe to be the central component of the \nViolence Against Women Act II--the money, continuing the dollars for \ncops, prosecutors, judges, shelters, and all the elements which are \nworking.\n  This requires one simple step--continue the violent crime reduction \ntrust fund which the Biden crime bill set up several years ago. This \ntrust fund is due to expire in the year 2000.\n  Let me remind everybody how it is funded. We agreed that we would \nreduce the number of Federal workers by over 200,000. We reduced them \nby 271,000. We agreed that the paychecks that were being paid to those \nFederal workers would be taken and put in the trust fund, and that \ntrust fund would only be used to fight crime, a part of which is to \nfight domestic violence. That fund, that trust fund, that separate \nentity's authorization expires in the year 2000. This legislation first \nand foremost extends it, extends it to the year 2002. And it does not \nrelitigate the balanced budget agreement upon which we agreed last \nyear. It is accommodated within that balanced budget agreement.\n  Beyond this fundamental step, there are four key policy areas \naddressed in my new legislation.\n  1. Strengthening law enforcement's tools.\n  2. Improving services for the victims of violence.\n  3. Reducing violence against children, not only the frequent and \nhorrible side effects of violence against women but also the wellspring \nof future generations of abusers because all of the data shows that \nthose who witness abuse, ironically and tragically, tend to become \nabusers.\n  4. To bolster the antidomestic violence training and education \nprograms to enlist many more professionals in our fight to deal with \nviolence.\n\n\n                     Strengthening Law Enforcement\n\n  On the law enforcement front, the bill introduced today, starts with \nneeded improvements to bolster the inter-state enforcement of ``stay-\naway'' or protection orders.\n  To give a practical example, let's say a woman from my home State of \nDelaware gets one of these protection orders against and old boyfriend \nwho has been stalking and beating the heck out of her. Let's also say \nshe works in Pennsylvania.\n  This is the scenario which led the original Violence Against Women \nAct to call on states to honor the protection orders of other states. \nWe did so\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\nbecause the cops recognize the simple reality--they know what will \nhappen sooner or later if the old boyfriend keeps showing up at the \nwoman's work. And, the cops in Pennsylvania don't want to wait for the \nworst to happen--they want to nail the guy for violating the protection \norder, stopping violence before it happens--in other words, community \npolicing.\n  The problem--the cops in Pennsylvania may not know about that there \nis a valid protection order issued by the State of Delaware. We propose \ntoday a few simple fixes: Permitting state and local cops to use their \n``pro-arrest'' grants for this information sharing; encouraging states \nto enter into the cooperative agreements necessary to help interstate \nenforcement; and calling on the Justice Department to help develop new \nprotocols and disseminate the ``best practices'' of state and local \ncops.\n\n  Pretty simple, but all are extremely necessary--and I hope we can all \nsupport such common sense measures.\n  I won't go into nearly as much detail in describing the law \nenforcement initiatives proposed in this bill, but just to ``tick'' \nsome of these off--we propose to: Bolster the resources available for \ncourts to handle domestic violence and sexual assault cases; target the \n``date-rape'' drug with the maximum federal penalties; continue funding \nfor police, prosecutors, law enforcement efforts in rural communities, \nand for anti-stalking initiatives; extend the support of local police \n``pro-arrest'' efforts--a program expiring this year; and provide new \nlaws to protect our military support personnel stationed, as well as \nour female military personnel who may be assaulted off-base--where, too \noften, lax foreign laws give a ``free-pass'' to their victimizer.\n\n\n                   Assisting the Victims of Violence\n\n  Of course, a comprehensive effort to reduce violence against women \nand lessen its damages must do more than just arrest, convict and \nimprison abusers--we must also help the victims of violence. This \nlegislation proposes to assist these crime victims in three fundamental \nways:\n  Immediate protections from their abuser--such as battered women's \nshelters; help so that they can have access to the courts and legal \nassistance necessary to keep their abuser away from them; and removing \nthe ``catch-22s'' that may literally often force women to stay with \ntheir abuser--such as the discriminatory insurance policies which could \nforce a mother to choose: turn-in the man who is beating me or keep \nhealth insurance for her children.\n  Those are the three general policy goals, but to be more specific, \nlet me outline just how our legislation proposes to boost the \nprotections for the victims of violence:\n  First and foremost, we must build on our successful effort to provide \nmore shelter space for battered women and their children. Senator \nspecter and the appropriations committee has done tremendous work to \nboost annual funding for shelters to $78 million--enough for about \n200,000 battered women and their children.\n  Unfortunately, the unmet need for shelter remains significant. For \nexample, data from six states, which together have about 16% of the \nNation's population had to turn away more than 45,000 battered women \nwho were seeking shelter because they simply did not have the space. \nExtrapolating these figures to the entire nation suggests that about \n300,000 battered women and their children are turned away from shelters \nevery year.\n  As I said, the current appropriations for shelter space stands at \nabout $78 million. This legislation boosts this amount to $175 million \nover the next four years. The additional $100 million over current \nservices will close the ``shelter-gap''--of roughly 300,000 battered \nwomen and their children. This will bring us closer to the day when all \nbattered women will have a safe, secure place when they need it most.\n  Of course, we phase in this increase--but, it is clear to us that we \nmust take the basic, fundamental step if we are to protect these \nvictims of violence.\n  As I said, we must also provide women with the assistance necessary \nso that they can get access to help from our justice system. We do so, \nin some clear and common sense ways, such as:\n  Re-authorizing the expiring program to provide about $1 million per \nyear for victim/witness counselors in federal court; as Senators \nWellstone and Moseley-Braun have recognized, women should not have to \nchose between showing up at court to make sure her abuser is punished \nand losing her job--so, this legislation includes their proposal to \nextend the protections of the Family & Medical Leave Act to the victims \nof domestic violence;\n\n   Continuing the national Domestic Violence Hotline (at a cost of \nabout $2 million per year); and\n   Developing a national network of trained, volunteer attorneys who \nwill help each of the nearly 100,000 women who, each year, call the \nnational hotline for help.\n  The other component of our plan to aid the victims of domestic \nviolence is to target what I refer to as the ``catch-22'' problems.\n  Senator Murray has identified one source of just such a ``Catch-\n22''--the fact that some insurance companies and plans deny women \nhealth, disability, property or life insurance protections because the \nwoman is a victim of domestic violence.\n  In starkest terms, this forces a woman to chose between reporting--\nand trying to end--the violence she is suffering or her children's \nhealth care.\n  This must end--we must pass Senator Murray's proposal, included in \nthis legislation, to protect the victims from abuse from insurance \ndiscrimination.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that in the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act we took bi-partisan action to end another such \ninsidious ``choice.'' In 1994, we worked out provisions so battered \nimmigrant women--whose ability to stay in the country was dependent on \ntheir husbands--would not have to chose: stay in America and continue \nto get beaten or leave their husbands, end the abuse, but have to leave \nAmerica (perhaps even without their children.)\n  While we had fixed some aspects of this problem in 1994, there remain \nother aspects of immigration law which leave a woman with just such a \nhorrible, unfair and immoral choice. With Senator Kennedy, we have \nworked to include in this legislation several of these corrections.\n  I urge my colleagues to support--and even build upon--our efforts to \nput an end to these real problems.\n\n\n                   Reducing Violence Against Children\n\n  A third area where this legislation seeks action is on reducing \nviolence against children. As my colleagues know, households where the \nwife is beaten are much more likely to also be home to child abuse and \nneglect. In addition, the research findings are clear--children who \nwitness violence are much more likely to repeat the cycle when they are \nadults and they have a wife and children.\n  Here, our legislation proposes to continue two long-standing \nprograms--\n  Resources to serve runaway and homeless youth who are victims of \nsexual abuse; and\n  The resources provided for Court-Appointed Special Advocates and \nspecial child abuse training for court personnel through the Victims of \nChild Abuse Act (originally co-sponsored by Senator Thurmond and myself \nin 1990.)\n  The current appropriations for all these programs total about $25 \nmillion--we propose to increase that annual amount by about $10 \nmillion.\n\n\n                    Improving Research and Training\n\n  The remaining area targeted by the Violence Against Women Act--two \nincludes several efforts to help train and educate those already on the \nfront-lines of the battle against violence against women.\n  Senator Boxer has recognized that one of the leading reasons why \nwomen enter hospital emergency rooms is because they were beaten at the \nhands of a man. So, this bill, includes her proposal to increase the \nnumber of health professionals who are trained in the identification, \ntreatment and referral of victims of domestic violence and sexual \nassault.\n  Over the past few years, I have worked with several corporations \n(including, DuPont, Polaroid, Liz Claiborne, and The Body Shop) who \nhave begun their own workplace initiatives--everything from 24-hour \nassistance hotlines for their employees, training to help managers \nbetter recognize domestic violence, and even comprehensive employee \nassistance efforts.\n  Helping other companies start or improve--again, on their own \ninitiative--\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\nsuch anti-violence efforts is the reason this legislation includes a \nnational workplace clearinghouse on violence against women.\n  The clearinghouse will provide technical assistance and help \ncirculate ``best practices'' to companies interested in combating \nviolence against women.\n  Another practical problem out in the field relates to the complex \nnature of criminal investigations into sexual assault cases. To assist \nthe cops in the field who face these investigations, this legislation \ncalls on the Attorney General to evaluate and recommend standards of \ntraining and practice of forensic examinations following sexual \nassaults.\n  I want to make clear, this legislation does not allow any Federal \ndictates--but only some assistance to those in the field.\n  Finally, this legislation continues the authorization for rape \nprevention and education programs. These programs provide public \nawareness and education efforts to both teach young women how to \nprotect themselves from rape and attack, as well as to help build their \nself-esteem.\n  Mr. President, I have just offered the most general outline of the \ncontents of the Violence Against Women Act--Two. I urge my colleagues \nto review this legislation. I am confident they will find this bill a \ncomprehensive and practical response which will help us meet a goal I \nbelieve is shared by every member of this Senate--making more women \nsafer.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle in introducing the Biden-Specter ``Violence \nAgainst Women Act II'' (VAWA II), a bipartisan effort to continue and \nstrengthen the many vital Federal programs which work to combat \nviolence against women. I thank Senator Biden in particular for his \nleadership in crafting this important legislation.\n  Clearly, violence against women knows no social, economic, or \ngeographic bounds. It affects rich and poor, young and old. Women are \nassaulted in their homes, on the streets, in the workplace, and on \ncampuses. In 1992, I cosponsored the original ``Violence Against Women \nAct'' (VAWA), which amended other anti-violence legislation to include \nacts of violence against women as crimes. Although it did not pass that \nyear, we worked hard to include this vital legislation in the 1994 \nomnibus anti-crime legislation. Since enactment of the Violence Against \nWomen Act, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have worked \nto ensure that programs under this law are funded adequately.\n  Domestic violence in particular is an epidemic which VAWA programs \nseek to address. Within the last year, 3.9 million American women were \nvictims of physical abuse and another 20.7 million were verbally or \nemotionally abused by their spouse or partner. A recent study found \nthat the medical costs associated with these attacks amount to over \n$857.3 million. In my State of Pennsylvania, more than 500,000 citizens \nwill be victims of domestic violence each year, and the estimated \nmedical cost exceeds $326 million. In 1995 and 1996, I held hearings in \nPennsylvania on the issue of domestic violence and violence against \nwomen in general, and have visited battered women's shelters in \nPittsburgh and Harrisburg to see first-hand the kind of physical and \nemotional suffering so many women endure.\n  Within the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education, which I chair, Violence Against Women Act \nprograms received $128.7 million for fiscal year 1998. I have also \nsupported Violence Against Women Act programs funded within the \nDepartment of Justice, which totaled $270.7 million for fiscal year \n1998.\n  The Biden-Specter VAWA II legislation extends and expands the vital \nVAWA programs supported by my Subcommittee. Currently funded at $76.5 \nmillion, Shelters for Battered Women and Their Children would double \nits authorization in four years. The National Domestic Violence \nHotline, which has received over 120,000 calls since February 1996, is \nanother successful resource which would receive a substantial increase \nin its authorization. The VAWA II proposal would authorize an \nadditional $15 million over four years for the Rape Prevention and \nEducation Program, currently at $45 million, and would institute new \ncoordination between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to administer the CDC Prevention and Intervention \nResearch to Combat Violence Against Women.\n  The Biden-Specter VAWA II legislation also includes provisions to \naddress the issue of violence against women on college campuses across \nthe country. Recognizing the grave importance of battling this problem \nin a targeted manner, I introduced the ``Campus Crime Disclosure Act of \n1998'' (S. 2100) on May 20, 1998. Sexual assaults throughout the United \nStates, including sexual assaults on campuses, are on the rise. \nIndependent research and studies show that 20 percent of college-aged \nwomen will be victims of sexual crimes at some point in their \npostsecondary academic career. Studies also show that rape remains the \nmost underreported violent crime in America, with approximately one in \nevery six rapes reported to police. The Campus Crime Disclosure Act, \ntightens existing campus security law to discourage higher educational \ninstitutions from the underreporting of offenses covered by the 1990 \nCampus Security Act.\n  I have also continuously worked to ensure that women receive the \nbenefit of the Federal investment into public health programs. I helped \nestablish the Public Health Service's Office of Women's Health in 1991, \nwhich develops, coordinates, and stimulates women's health programs and \nactivities across all Federal agencies. Funding for this program has \nincreased from $450,000 in fiscal year 1991 to $12.5 million in fiscal \nyear 1998. Even in an era of constrained spending, these expenditures \nare well worthwhile on this important subject.\n  I believe that by the passage of legislation such as the Biden-\nSpecter Violence Against Women Act II, we are on the right track to \nhelping women to combat the incidence of domestic violence, and \nvictimization in general. I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring \nthis important legislation, and I urge its swift adoption.\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate in 1993, \nviolence against women had reached a crisis point. The epidemic had \nspread through every community, across every ethnic group, and did not \ndiscriminate based on income, or age.\n  In 1994, Congress responded to this crisis. The enactment of the \nViolence Against Women Act in 1994 established a national strategy for \ndealing with this crisis. No longer would this kind of violence be \ntolerated. Congress made violence against women a federal crime and \nthrew the weight of the federal government behind efforts to end this \nviolence.\n  Senator Biden was instrumental in drafting the original VAWA. I am \ngrateful for his efforts in the past and have always appreciated his \nwork on behalf of this issue. I also want to thank Senator Specter for \nhis efforts to funding these important programs. I have worked with him \non the Appropriations Committee and have experienced first hand the \nbenefits of having him on my side on an important family violence issue \nin the 1998 Labor, HHS Appropriations bill.\n  Enactment of VAWA in 1994 for me is one of my top legislative \naccomplishments. I know that we made a difference. I know that \nproviding the resources to help women who are victims of violence seek \nsafety and justice has saved hundreds of lives. I have visited battered \nwomen's shelters and talked to many advocates who tell me how important \nVAWA is. Reauthorization of this historic act must be a priority of \nthis Congress. We can build on the success of VAWA and work to end \nviolence against women.\n  I want to thank Senator Biden for working with me to include a \nprohibition against insurance discrimination in this legislation. I \nfind this practice of discriminating against victims of domestic \nviolence offensive and outrageous. To victimize a woman twice is \ninexcusable. Insurance policies that deny women health insurance or \nhomeowners insurance simply because they have been victims of domestic \nviolence can no longer be tolerated. To say that a victim of domestic \nviolence engages in high risk behavior similar to a sky\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\ndiver or race car driver is beyond comprehension. Enactment of VAWA \nreauthorization legislation will end this practice.\n  Believe me, insurance discrimination is a reality. I know of several \ncases, including one in my own state of Washington, where an insurance \ncompany refused to honor its obligation because the loss was the result \nof a domestic violence situation. There are many more documented cases \nof discrimination. Insurance companies should be ashamed of this kind \nof practice. Today we have a means to end it.\n  Enactment of this reauthorization legislation is an important step. \nBut, it is only part of the solution. We must do more. We can help \nensure that services are available to protect women and resources to \nlocal law enforcement to deal with the epidemic. However, the only real \nsolution to ending domestic violence is economic security and stability \nfor the woman. VAWA offers temporary solutions, but long term solutions \nrequire tearing down economic barriers for these women. Work place \ndiscrimination, lack of affordable child care, housing shortages, \npunitive welfare requirements, inability to change a Social Security \nnumber are all examples of these barriers.\n  Removing the economic barriers for victims of domestic violence is \nour next great challenge. I have been working with advocates in the \nState of Washington on legislation that would serve to end the economic \nsanctions many victims face.\n  But, first we do need to ensure the immediate safety of these women \nand their children. We need to provide resources to law enforcement to \nprotect women and we need to guarantee that the courts treat offenders \nas violent criminals. The legislation that we will be introducing today \naccomplishes these goals.\n  This is one piece of legislation that will make a difference.\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I call upon my colleagues to \nsupport the Violence Against Women Act of 1998 which we introduce \ntoday.\n  Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women in the \nUnited States. Every 9 seconds, a woman is physically abused by her \nhusband or boyfriend. 42 percent of all murdered women are killed by \ncurrent or ex-partners. Approximately 95 percent of the victims of \ndomestic violence are women. More than 3 million children witness acts \nof domestic violence every year.\n  In 1994, Congress passed the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA). Under VAWA, the Department of Justice awarded over $483 million \nunder to the states for domestic violence programs. The largest portion \nof the money goes toward ``STOP'' grants, which bring together police, \nprosecutors, counselors, shelter providers and other organizations to \ndevelop coordinated services for women dealing with domestic violence.\n  These funds make a difference in women's lives. My home State of \nCalifornia has received more than $46 million under VAWA, plus an \nadditional $19 million for battered women's shelters and services.\n  With VAWA funds, Los Angeles County increased the number of shelters \nfrom 18 in 1994 to 25 shelters today, adding 200 additional shelter \nbeds for women and children. One organization, the 1736 Family Crisis \ncenter, opened a new shelter in large part due to VAWA funds. The \nValley Oasis shelter in the high dessert expanded its number of beds \nsignificantly, again due in large part to VAWA. Throughout California, \nVAWA helped fund more than 77 domestic violence shelters.\n  In California, in fiscal year 1998 alone, VAWA provided: $875,000 to \nfund domestic violence and children's services such as counseling, \nshelters, and safety planning; $1.8 million for specialized domestic \nviolence units in local law enforcement agencies; $2.7 million to fund \nprosecution units that specifically handle domestic violence cases; and \n$1.2 million for its multi-disciplinary sexual assault response team \nvictim advocate project, which brings together police officers, \ndoctors, nurses, advocates, and counselors to respond to victim's needs \nwithin hours of a sexual assault.\n  VAWA funds sheriffs in San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles to \nconduct domestic violence training for thousands of law enforcement \nofficers and for individuals involved in community-oriented policing \n(the COPS program) throughout the State. This legislation will help \ncontinue and expand these and other programs across the country.\n  VAWA II includes important improvements. It encourages training for \nhealth care providers to help them identify the signs of domestic \nviolence and refer patients to appropriate services. It protects women \nfrom the horrors of ``date-rape'' drugs by placing the drug Rohypnol in \nFederal Schedule 1--the strictest level of federal drug penalties and \ncontrols. It improves protections for older women, women with \ndisabilities, and women on college campuses.\n  With VAWA II, we are taking the next crucial steps to help keep \nAmerican women and children safe. I commend NOW Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund for its leadership on this issue, and the many \norganizations that have fought to protect and to provide services for \nbattered women and their children. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today as an \noriginal co-sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act II. I commend \nSenator Biden for his hard work on this continuing effort to combat \nviolence against women. I believe we are making great progress as a \nnation to make our streets and our world safer by cracking down on \nviolent crime. This new law represents the continuing Federal effort to \ndeal with these crucial issues. I am encouraged by the bipartisan \nsupport for this bill. Protecting the lives of women and children \nshould not be a partisan issue. Both Democrat and Republican members of \nthe United States Senate are taking a solid stand against the \ndisgraceful and cowardly crime of domestic violence.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this important legislation for \nthree reasons. First, this bill continues the fight for a safer world \nby providing new and continuing grants to improve the criminal justice \nsystem's protections for women and children. Second, it provides \nimportant training for those involved in the response to citizens \nabused by domestic violence. Third it expands and strengthens the \nservices available to victims of violence.\n  The Violence Against Women Act II is a big step forward in the effort \nto keep women, children and communities safe. One of the most critical \ncomponents of this bill is the reauthorization of the STOP Grant funds \nfor vital programs in our states. This allows the states to obtain the \nmoney they need to create and mobilize effective strategies against \nviolence. In my state of Maryland, the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney \nGeneral of Maryland created the Family Violence Council to find ways to \nreduce and prevent family violence. With the STOP Grant funds Maryland \nreceived through the 1994 Violence Against Crime Act, the Council has \nbeen able to effectively assist a statewide initiative against crime. \nThis money has been used to help Maryland develop policies and \nprocedures against domestic violence. It has been used to ensure the \ndevelopment of the best possible laws to protect victims and hold \nabusers accountable. We have coordinated community programs that \nprotect victims. We have made efforts to break the cycle of violence \nbetween generations. And we have stood together as citizens of Maryland \nand said that violence against women is something we cannot and will \nnot tolerate.\n  Second, this legislation provides the authorization for money to \ntrain people to respond to domestic abuse. It amends the STOP and Pro-\nArrest grants and makes states and local courts specifically eligible \nfor funding. These are the same programs that brought police and \nprosecutors into the loop of personnel who combat violence toward \nwomen. The bill we are introducing today takes the next vital step. It \nexpressly targets funds to the courts and helps engage them in the \nfight against domestic violence. By educating judicial staff and \nofficers of the court about the special issues raised by violence \nagainst women, we completed the circle of people who must work in \npartnerships to end these crimes. Judges and officers are often the \nfirst people a victim will meet in the criminal system when seeking \nlegal intervention. The judicial staff are the ones\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\nwho can set the stage for whether or not a victim will proceed with her \nclaim. This legislation ensures that all personnel in the criminal \njustice system are educated and trained to handle cases of domestic \nviolence. This ensures that the proper support, services and protection \nare available to those who need it most.\n  Finally, I support this bill because of the services it provides for \nthe victims of these destructive crimes. In 1992, we witnessed a \nnational travesty. In 1992 the National Domestic Violence Hotline went \nout of business. Not because there was no domestic violence. At that \ntime, the hotline averaged 7.5 calls an hour, 180 calls a day and \n65,520 calls a year. The hotline went out of business because it had no \nfunding. That means lives were lost because our citizens had an \nemergency hotline number that no longer worked. That means more \nchildren were beaten and murdered every day who might have been able to \nget the help they needed. That means the federal government was not \nmeeting its duty to stop the deadly cycle of violent crime.\n  We cannot and must not allow this to happen again. That is why in \n1994 we included a new provision in the law to authorize grants to \nrevive the national hotline. That is why today we are now increasing \nand extending authorizations to meet the growing demands on the \nHotline. Today any woman or child with access to a telephone can dial \n1-800-799-SAFE and get the help they urgently need from a qualified and \ninformed professional.\n  Domestic violence in this country was ignored for far too long before \nwe passed the first Violence Against Women Act. Annually, at least 2 \nmillion children and 2 to 4 million women are abused by the people \nclosest to them. These statistics truly send home a very strong \nmessage: The most vulnerable members of our society have historically \nnot been served by our government. These alarming crime rates resound \nloudly and should be heard by every legislator elected to Congress.\n  We must remain keenly aware of the fact that four women a day are \nkilled at the hands of their batterer. That fifty-seven percent of \nchildren under 12 who are murdered are killed by a parent. That every \nfifteen seconds a woman is beaten by her husband or boyfriend. The \nViolence Against Women Act II will continue the effort to combat this \nviolence toward women. The time is now to act and to continue our \nfight. No woman should live in fear that any person will get away with \nhurting her or her children. I have stated in the past that if you \nintend to harm a woman that you better stay out of my state of \nMaryland. I strongly encourage every single member of the Senate to not \nonly vote for, but to actively support this crucial \nlegislation.\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud co-\nsponsor of this Violence Against Women Act. I was a co-sponsor of the \noriginal Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and will work hard to see \nthis Violence Against Women Act pass as well. As you well know my wife \nSheila and I do a lot of work trying to reduce violence in homes. That \nis a big priority for us. And the passage of the 1994 Violence Against \nWomen Act was a first big step and an historical occasion.\n  It was the culmination of over twenty-five years of hard work by \nlocal and national organizations. It was an acknowledgment that this \nkind of violence within families is everybody's business. It was the \npublic recognition that for all too many women the home, rather than \nbeing a safe place is a very dangerous place. And finally it sent a \nclear message that violence against women was a crime that would not be \ntolerated. It sent a clear message that we as a nation were committed \nto ending violence against women. At that time we thought we were \nintroducing a comprehensive bill to end violence against women. We have \nlearned a great deal since the passage of the first Act and with that \nknowledge we know we can and must do better. We have also learned that \nviolence against women is multi-faceted problem that must be addressed \nin many ways. While the first Act provided important funding to improve \nservices to abused women and improve the criminal justice system, the \nstatistics show we must do more. In my own state of Minnesota, at least \n17 women were killed in 1997 by their intimate partners. In that same \nyear, over 4,000 women and over 5,000 children used domestic violence \nshelters in my state. I am sure that the provisions provided in VAWA \nallowed so many women to be served. I am sure that the provision in \nWAVA allowed law enforcement, in my state and across the country, to \nbetter address cases of domestic abuse. But now we must broaden our \napproach to this critical problem.\n  And so today we introduce the Violence Against Women Act II. This \nlegislation not only reauthorizes and improves the initial commitment \nset forth in VAWA, but also addresses the impact of violence against \nwomen in areas of child visitation, sexual assault prevention, \ninsurance discrimination, as well as violence in the workplace and on \ncampuses. The initiatives in this bill, as I'm sure my colleague Joe \nBiden will attest, were developed as part of a collaborative effort \nwith researchers, advocates and service providers alike. Seeing the \nproblems that victims face on a daily basis, they have helped us to \ndevelop legislation that will assist women who have been victims of \nviolence.\n  I have worked hard at addressing the severe economic consequences of \ndomestic abuse on working women and am proud to say that VAWA II \nincludes provisions to ensure access to family and medical leave \ncoverage. With the passage of this Act women will be allowed to be \nabsent from work so that they can deal with the domestic violence in \ntheir lives. Under this legislation victims of abuse could use family \nand medical leave to attend court hearings and go to appointments with \nhealth care providers. In addition this legislation specifies that \nunemployment compensation should be provided if employment is \nterminated due to domestic abuse. If a woman loses her job because of \nthe abuse she is experiencing in her home then she will be assured \naccess to unemployment compensation. In other words, this legislation \naddresses the fact that the cycle of violence will not be interrupted \nunless victims of abuse are assured of economic security and \nindependence.\n  Another facet of domestic violence that has been recognized since the \npassage of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act is the discrimination \nthat victims of abuse face. I have worked hard at ending discrimination \nby insurance companies against victims of abuse and am proud to be able \nto say that this issue is well addressed in VAWA II. After years of \nwork by advocates, encouraging women to come forward and report their \nabuse, we now find that they are being discriminated against based on \ntheir status as victims of that abuse. We all know that denying women \naccess to insurance they need to foster their mobility out of an \nabusive situation must be stopped. Under this legislation insurance \ncompanies could no longer discriminate against victims of abuse in any \nline of insurance.\n  And finally, I would just like to mention the provision to provide \nsafe havens for children. It is time we address the danger that \nchildren and victims of abuse are subjected to during visitation \nsessions with former partners. Let us stop further violence from \noccurring by providing safe centers for children who are members of \nfamilies in which violence is a problem. These centers will provide a \nsafe environment in which children can visit with their parents without \nrisk of being exposed to violence in the context of their family \nrelationships. These centers will also save the lives of mothers by \nproviding secure and supervised environments where they can drop off \ntheir children to visit with their abusers. Stopping the cycle of \nviolence means providing safe places for women and children inside and \noutside the home.\n  While we worked hard in the first Violence Against Women Act to make \nstreets and homes safer for women by investing in law enforcement \ninitiatives, we have learned that a woman's safety is dependent on her \nability to achieve economic as well as physical security. The measures \nthat I have mentioned are only some of the pieces that show the \ncomprehensive nature of this bill. It is a reflection of what we have \nlearned and the acknowledgment that we can and must do better. The \nViolence Against Women Act II is an impressive piece of legislation \nthat deserves serious attention in this Congress. I look forward to the \nhearings\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nand debates on this bill and look forward to working on and seeing it \npass.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 2111. A bill to establish the conditions under which the \nBonneville Power Administration and certain Federal agencies may enter \ninto a memorandum of agreement concerning management of the Columbia/\nSnake River Basin, to direct the Secretary of the Interior to appoint \nan advisory committee to make recommendations regarding activities \nunder memorandum of understanding, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               columbia river and snake river legislation\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to establish the conditions under which certain Federal \nagencies may enter into a memorandum of agreement with non-federal \nentities concerning management of the Columbia River and Snake River \nBasin in the States of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington.\n  This bill is not an endorsement of the draft Three Sovereigns \nagreement, but arises from ongoing concerns I have about the proposal. \nThe livelihoods of many Northwest residents are at stake in upcoming \ndecisions about Columbia River operations, and they deserve a voice in \nthis process.\n  The bill formalizes public input to federal agencies involved in the \nproposed ``Three Sovereigns'' agreement, or any similar agreement, by \ncreating an advisory committee representing: local governments; \ncustomers of the Bonneville Power Administration; upstream ports; \nfishing interests; shippers; irrigators; environmentalists; forest land \nowners and grazers. This committee will advise the federal agencies on \nmatters to be addressed under the agreement, including the economic and \nsocial impacts of any proposed recommendations.\n  Currently, two significantly different drafts of a ``Memorandum of \nAgreement for Three Sovereigns' Governance of the Columbia River Basin \nEcosystem'' are out for public comment. However, the public comment \nprocess was so ill-defined initially that I had to write one of the \nchief proponents of the agreement to request that this process be \nbetter defined. Further, it has been reported to me that at the public \nmeeting held in Pendleton, Oregon, on the draft agreement, there was no \nclerk reporter to record people's comments in detail. This has not \ngiven those who depend on the river system much confidence in their \nability to provide input into any forum established under a Three \nSovereigns' agreement.\n  Developing a successful regional solution to management of the \nColumbia/Snake River system will involve a broad range of stakeholders. \nWhile not a perfect model, the 1994 Bay-Delta Accord in California has \nbeen successful, in large part, because the water users and \nenvironmental groups were parties to the Accord. The bill would not, \nhowever, require changes in the draft memorandum of agreement itself, \nor impose conditions on the states or the tribes. But it is appropriate \nfor the Congress to establish certain conditions for federal \nparticipation in any such agreement.\n  In addition to establishing this advisory committee, the bill \nrequires each federal agency that is a signatory to the Three \nSovereigns' agreement to publish and make available to the public, \nincluding over the Internet, all scientific data used to formulate \nrecommendations and all methodologies used to prepare cost-benefit \nanalyses.\n  The bill also provides a mechanism to resolve disputes among federal \nagencies involved in the Three Sovereigns' agreement. The Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget will designate an official who, at \nthe request of a non-federal party to the agreement, will have the \nauthority to reconcile differences between the federal agencies on any \nissue before the Three Sovereigns. In this manner, the non-federal \nsignatories are not caught between differing federal agencies.\n  The Three Sovereigns' agreement, if signed, would establish a process \nthat is very similar to the statutory obligations of the Northwest \nPower Planning Council with respect to fish and wildlife \nrecommendations. Therefore, the bill requires the Council to report to \nthe Congress annually on how the recommendations on fish and wildlife \nactivities under any agreement would be coordinated and reconciled with \nthe Council's statutory responsibilities.\n  Finally, to enhance budget coordination among federal agencies \nregardless of whether an agreement is entered into, the bill requires \nthat the President's annual budget proposal include a cross-cut budget \nshowing proposed spending for activities in the basin by the federal \nagencies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and to support \nstakeholder involvement in the development of a regional solution to \nColumbia and Snake River issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and insure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSES AND GOALS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to create \n     incentives to achieve reductions in the percentage of \n     children who use tobacco products and to ensure that, in the \n     event that other measures contained in this Act prove to be \n     inadequate to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use \n     by minors, tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. \n     These additional assessments are designed to lower youth \n     tobacco consumption in a variety of ways, including by \n     triggering further increases in the price of tobacco \n     products, by encouraging tobacco companies to work to meet \n     statutory targets for reductions in youth tobacco \n     consumption, and by providing support for further reduction \n     efforts.\n       (b) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required performance objectives for percentage \n     reductions in underage use of tobacco products set forth in \n     this title are achieved.\n\n     SEC. 203. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SURVEYS.\n\n       (a) Annual Performance Survey.--Beginning not later than \n     1999 and annually thereafter the Secretary shall conduct a \n     survey, in accordance with the methodology in subsection \n     (e)(1), to determine for each type of tobacco product--\n       (1) the percentage of all children who used such type of \n     tobacco product within the past 30 days; and\n       (2) the percentage of children who identify each brand of \n     each type of tobacco product as the usual brand of the type \n     smoked or used within the past 30 days.\n       (b) Use of Product.--A child shall be considered to have \n     used a manufacturer's tobacco product if the child identifies \n     the manufacturer's tobacco product as the usual brand of \n     tobacco product smoked or used by the child within the past \n     30 days.\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n       (c) Separate Types of Products.--For purposes of this \n     subtitle (except as provided in subsection 205(h)), \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco shall be considered separate \n     types of tobacco products.\n       (d) Confidentiality of data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information, or described in the information, being \n     identifiable, the information may not be used for any purpose \n     other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     use for such other purposes. The information may not be \n     published or released in any other form if the individual \n     supplying the information, or described in the information, \n     is identifiable unless that individual (or that individual's \n     guardian) consents to its publication or release in other \n     form.\n       (e) Methodology.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of young \n     individuals;\n       (B) measure use of each type of tobacco product within the \n     past 30 days;\n       (C) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n       (D) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) based on \n     the point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     the tobacco products of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(D) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) for the \n     purpose of measuring compliance with percent reduction \n     targets and calculating surcharges provided that the \n     precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of children reporting use of a type of tobacco \n     product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of the tobacco products of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95 percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (f) Additional Measures.--In order to increase the \n     understanding of youth tobacco product use, the Secretary \n     may, for informational purposes only, add additional measures \n     to the survey under subsection (a), conduct periodic or \n     occasional surveys at other times, and conduct surveys of \n     other populations such as young adults. The results of such \n     surveys shall be made available to manufacturers and the \n     public to assist in efforts to reduce youth tobacco use.\n       (g) Technical Adjustments.--The Secretary may make \n     technical changes in the manner in which surveys are \n     conducted under this section so long as adjustments are made \n     to ensure that the results of such surveys are comparable \n     from year to year.\n\n     SEC. 204. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Baseline Level.--The baseline level for each type of \n     tobacco product, and for each manufacturer with respect to \n     each type of tobacco product, is the percentage of children \n     determined to have used such tobacco product in the first \n     annual performance survey (in 1999).\n       (b) Industry-Wide Non-Attainment Assessments.--For the \n     purpose of determining industry-wide non-attainment \n     assessments, the performance objective for the reduction of \n     the percentage of children determined to have used each type \n     of tobacco product is the percentage in subsection (d) as \n     measured from the baseline level for such type of tobacco \n     product.\n       (c) Performance Objectives for Existing Manufacturers.--\n     Each existing manufacturer shall have as a performance \n     objective the reduction of the percentage of children \n     determined to have used each type of such manufacturer's \n     tobacco products by at least the percentage specified in \n     subsection (d) as measured from the baseline level for such \n     manufacturer for such product.\n       (d) Required Percentage Reductions.--The reductions \n     required in this subsection are as follows:\n       (1) In the case of cigarettes--\n       (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual performance \n     surveys, 20 percent;\n       (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual performance \n     surveys, 40 percent;\n       (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 55 percent; and\n       (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey and \n     each annual performance survey thereafter, 67 percent.\n       (2) In the case of smokeless tobacco--\n       (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual performance \n     surveys, 12.5 percent;\n       (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual performance \n     surveys, 25 percent;\n       (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 35 percent; and\n       (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey and \n     each annual performance survey thereafter, 45 percent.\n       (e) Report on Further Reductions.--The Secretary shall \n     report to Congress by the end of 2006 on the feasibility of \n     further reduction in underage tobacco use.\n       (f) Performance Objective Relative to the De Minimis \n     Level.--If the percentage of children determined to have used \n     a type of the tobacco products of an existing manufacturer in \n     an annual performance survey is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level, the manufacturer shall be considered to have \n     achieved the applicable performance objective.\n       (g) Performance Objectives for New Manufacturers.--Each new \n     manufacturer shall have as its performance objective \n     maintaining the percentage of children determined to have \n     used each type of such manufacturer's tobacco products in \n     each annual performance survey at a level equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level for that year.\n       (h) De Minimis Level.--The de minimis level shall be 1 \n     percent of children for the applicable year.\n\n     SEC. 205. MEASURES TO HELP ACHIEVE THE PERFORMANCE \n                   OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Annual Determination.--Beginning in 2001, and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary shall, based on the annual \n     performance surveys conducted under section 203, determine if \n     the performance objectives for each type of tobacco product \n     under section 204 has been achieved and if each manufacturer \n     has achieved the applicable performance objective under \n     section 204.

of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by a manufacturer for a year, \n     the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such manufacturer \n     under this paragraph.\n       (2) Cigarettes.--For each calendar year in which a \n     cigarette manufacturer fails to achieve the performance \n     objective under section 204(c), the Secretary shall assess a \n     surcharge on that manufacturer in an amount equal to the \n     manufacturer's share of youth incidence for cigarettes \n     multiplied by the following surcharge level:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     If the non-attainment percentage for the manufacturer is:                The surcharge level is:           \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot more than 5 percentage points                                   $80,000,000 multiplied by the non-attainment\n                                                                                                      percentage\nMore than 5 but not

calendar year in which a \n     smokeless tobacco product manufacturer fails to achieve the \n     performance objective under section 204(c), the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on that manufacturer in an amount \n     equal to the manufacturer's share of youth incidence for \n     smokeless tobacco products multiplied by the following \n     surcharge level:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     If the non-attainment percentage for the manufacturer is:                The surcharge level is:           \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot more than 5 percentage points

incidence.--For purposes \n     of this subsection, the them ``manufacturer's share of youth \n     incidence'' means--\n       (A) for cigarettes, the percentage of all youth smokers \n     determined to have used that manufacturer's cigarettes; and\n       (B) for smokeless tobacco products, the percentage of all \n     youth users of smokeless tobacco products determined to have \n     used that manufacturer's smokeless tobacco products.\n       (5) De minimis levels.--If a manufacturer is a new \n     manufacturer or the manufacturer's baseline level for a type \n     of tobacco product is less than the de minimis level, the \n     non-attainment percentage (for purposes of paragraph (2) or \n     (3)) shall be equal to the number of percentage points by \n     which the percentage of children who used the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products of the applicable type exceeds the de \n     minimis level.\n       (d) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (b)(2), (b)(3), (c)(2), and \n     (c)(3) shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year; exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (e) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed. The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n       (f) Business Expense Deduction.--In order to maximize the \n     financial deterrent effect of the assessments and surcharges \n     established in this section, any such payment shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (g) Procedures.--In assessing price increase assessments \n     and enforcing other measures under this section, the \n     Secretary shall have in place procedures to take into account \n     the effect that the margin of error of the annual performance \n     survey may have on the amounts assessed to or measures \n     required of such manufacturers.\n       (h) Other Products.--The Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations establishing performance objectives for the \n     reduction of the use by children of other products made or \n     derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption if \n     significant percentages of children use or begin to use such \n     products and the inclusion of such products as types of \n     tobacco products under this subtitle would help protect the \n     public health. Such regulations shall contain provisions, \n     consistent with the provisions in this subtitle applicable to \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, for the application of \n     assessments and surcharges to achieve reductions in the \n     percentage of children who use such products.\n       (i) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n       (j) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought under \n     this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall be held \n     responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 206.

FINDINGS.\n\n         Congress finds the following:\n         (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products \n     are critically important to the public health.\n         (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n         (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not \n     achieved on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that \n     will result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n         (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and insure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSES AND GOALS.\n\n         (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     create incentives to achieve reductions in the percentage of \n     children who use tobacco products and to ensure that, in\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\n     the event that other measures contained in this Act prove to \n     be inadequate to produce substantial reductions in tobacco \n     use by minors, tobacco companies will pay additional \n     assessments. These additional assessments are designed to \n     lower youth tobacco consumption in a variety of ways, \n     including by triggering further increases in the price of \n     tobacco products, by encouraging tobacco companies to work to \n     meet statutory targets for reductions in youth tobacco \n     consumption, and by providing support for further reduction \n     efforts.\n         (b) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required performance objectives for percentage \n     reductions in underage use of tobacco products set forth in \n     this title are achieved.\n\n     SEC. 203. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SURVEYS.\n\n         (a) Annual Performance Survey.--Beginning not later than \n     1999 and annually thereafter the Secretary shall conduct a \n     survey, in accordance with the methodology in subsection \n     (e)(1), to determine for each type of tobacco product--\n         (1) the percentage of all children who used such type of \n     tobacco product within the past 30 days; and\n         (2) the percentage of children who identify each brand of \n     each type of tobacco product as the usual brand of the type \n     smoked or used within the past 30 days.\n         (b) Use of Product.--A child shall be considered to have \n     used a manufacturer's tobacco product if the child identifies \n     the manufacturer's tobacco product as the usual brand of \n     tobacco product smoked or used by the child within the past \n     30 days.\n         (c) Separate Types of Products.--For purposes of this \n     subtitle (except as provided in subsection 205(h)), \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco shall be considered separate \n     types of tobacco products.\n         (d) Confidentiality of data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information, or described in the information, being \n     identifiable, the information may not be used for any purpose \n     other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     use for such other purposes. The information may not be \n     published or released in any other form if the individual \n     supplying the information, or described in the information, \n     is identifiable unless that individual (or that individual's \n     guardian) consents to its publication or release in other \n     form.\n         (e) Methodology.--\n         (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n         (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of \n     young individuals;\n         (B) measure use of each type of tobacco product within \n     the past 30 days;\n         (C) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n         (D) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) based on \n     the point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     the tobacco products of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n         (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(D) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) for the \n     purpose of measuring compliance with percent reduction \n     targets and calculating surcharges provided that the \n     precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of children reporting use of a type of tobacco \n     product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of the tobacco products of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95 percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n         (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A \n     survey using the methodology required by this subsection is \n     deemed conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for \n     purposes of this Act.\n         (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n         (f) Additional Measures.--In order to increase the \n     understanding of youth tobacco product use, the Secretary \n     may, for informational purposes only, add additional measures \n     to the survey under subsection (a), conduct periodic or \n     occasional surveys at other times, and conduct surveys of \n     other populations such as young adults. The results of such \n     surveys shall be made available to manufacturers and the \n     public to assist in efforts to reduce youth tobacco use.\n         (g) Technical Adjustments.--The Secretary may make \n     technical changes in the manner in which surveys are \n     conducted under this section so long as adjustments are made \n     to ensure that the results of such surveys are comparable \n     from year to year.\n\n     SEC. 204. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES.\n\n         (a) Baseline Level.--The baseline level for each type of \n     tobacco product, and for each manufacturer with respect to \n     each type of tobacco product, is the percentage of children \n     determined to have used such tobacco product in the first \n     annual performance survey (in 1999).\n         (b) Industry-Wide Non-Attainment Assessments.--For the \n     purpose of determining industry-wide non-attainment \n     assessments, the performance objective for the reduction of \n     the percentage of children determined to have used each type \n     of tobacco product is the percentage in subsection (d) as \n     measured from the baseline level for such type of tobacco \n     product.\n         (c) Performance Objectives for Existing Manufacturers.--\n     Each existing manufacturer shall have as a performance \n     objective the reduction of the percentage of children \n     determined to have used each type of such manufacturer's \n     tobacco products by at least the percentage specified in \n     subsection (d) as measured from the baseline level for such \n     manufacturer for such product.\n         (d) Required Percentage Reductions.--The reductions \n     required in this subsection are as follows:\n         (1) In the case of cigarettes--\n         (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual \n     performance surveys, 20 percent;\n         (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual \n     performance surveys, 40 percent;\n         (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 55 percent; and\n         (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey \n     and each annual performance survey thereafter, 67 percent.\n         (2) In the case of smokeless tobacco--\n         (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual \n     performance surveys, 12.5 percent;\n         (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual \n     performance surveys, 25 percent;\n         (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 35 percent; and\n         (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey \n     and each annual performance survey thereafter, 45 percent.\n         (e) Report on Further Reductions.--The Secretary shall \n     report to Congress by the end of 2006 on the feasibility of \n     further reduction in underage tobacco use.\n         (f) Performance Objective Relative to the De Minimis \n     Level.--If the percentage of children determined to have used \n     a type of the tobacco products of an existing manufacturer in \n     an annual performance survey is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level, the manufacturer shall be considered to have \n     achieved the applicable performance objective.\n         (g) Performance Objectives for New Manufacturers.--Each \n     new manufacturer shall have as its performance objective \n     maintaining the percentage of children determined to have \n     used each type of such manufacturer's tobacco products in \n     each annual performance survey at a level equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level for that year.\n         (h) De Minimis Level.--The de minimis level shall be 1 \n     percent of children for the applicable year.\n\n     SEC. 205. MEASURES TO HELP ACHIEVE THE PERFORMANCE \n                   OBJECTIVES.\n\n         (a) Annual Determination.--Beginning in 2001, and \n     annually thereafter, the Secretary shall, based on the annual \n     performance surveys conducted under section 203, determine if \n     the performance objectives for each type of tobacco product \n     under section 204 has been achieved and if each manufacturer \n     has achieved the applicable performance objective under \n     section 204. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal \n     Register such determinations and any appropriate additional \n     information regarding actions taken under this section.\n         (b) Industry-Wide Non-Attainment Assessments.--\n         (1) Industry-wide non-attainment percentage.--The \n     Secretary shall determine the industry-wide non-attainment \n     percentage, if any, for cigarettes and for smokeless tobacco \n     for each calendar year.\n         (2) Non-attainment assessment for cigarettes.--For each \n     calendar year in which the performance objective under \n     section 204(b) is not attained for cigarettes, the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on cigarette manufacturers as \n     follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 If the non-attainment percentage is:

tobacco product is less than the de minimis level, the \n     non-attainment percentage (for purposes of paragraph (2) or \n     (3)) shall be equal to the number of percentage points by \n     which the percentage of children who used the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products of the applicable type exceeds the de \n     minimis level.\n         (d) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n         (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (b)(2), (b)(3), (c)(2), and \n

The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n         (f) Business Expense Deduction.--In order to maximize the \n     financial deterrent effect of the assessments and surcharges \n     established in this section, any such payment shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n         (g) Procedures.--In assessing price increase assessments \n     and enforcing other measures under this section, the \n     Secretary shall have in place procedures to take into account \n     the effect that the margin of error of the annual performance \n     survey may have on the amounts assessed to or measures \n     required of such manufacturers.\n         (h) Other Products.--The Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations establishing performance objectives for the \n     reduction of the use by children of other products made or \n     derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption if \n     significant percentages of children use or begin to use such \n     products and the inclusion of such products as types of \n     tobacco products under this subtitle would help protect the \n     public health. Such regulations shall contain provisions, \n     consistent with the provisions in this subtitle applicable to \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, for the application of \n     assessments and surcharges to achieve reductions in the \n     percentage of children who use such products.\n         (i) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n         (j) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought \n     under this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall \n     be held responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 206.

Mr. President, this weekend, Americans from all \nwalks of life turn their thoughts to those men and women who died in \nthe service of our nation. From the early heroes of the Revolutionary \nWar through those who fought and died in the Persian Gulf, about 1.1 \nmillion Americans have sacrificed their lives to preserve our precious \nfreedom and to meet our commitments to allies around the globe. We are \nprivileged to enjoy the benefits of the ultimate sacrifice that those \nmen and women in our Armed Forces made on our behalf. We take this day \nto honor their memory and offer our deepest gratitude.\n  I remember when I was a young man, hearing those stirring words of \nPresident John Kennedy when he said, ``Ask not what your country can do \nfor you, but what you can do for your country.'' Those words rang loud \nand clear in the hearts and minds of my generation. They captured our \nspirit and renewed our commitment to serve America.\n  Perhaps the noblest heroes of my generation were those who, in the \nmidst of the great debate over Vietnam, stepped forward to serve their \ncountry and paid the ultimate sacrifice. Those sacrifices were borne \nfrom the same spirit that John Kennedy urged upon all of us in 1961. \nRegardless of political persuasions, none could argue that those who \ndied in Southeast Asia were not among America's finest men and women. \nWe salute them today, and will always remember and be grateful for \ntheir patriotism and sacrifice.\n  Those brave men and women who died in Vietnam, however, were not \nunique in American history. The legacy of courage, sacrifice, and \npatriotism has a long history in this country. During this century some \n33,651 Americans lost their lives in Korea, 417,316 died during World \nWar II, and 117,708 perished during the First World War. Almost 500,000 \nAmericans--both North and South--lost their lives fighting for the \nAmerica they believed in during the Civil War. We owe each and every \none of those veterans and their families a debt of gratitude.\n  I hope that every New Mexican and every American will take time this \nMemorial Day to find a quiet moment to consider the enormity of what \nour fallen friends and families have bequeathed us. This nation is \nblessed beyond all others---providing us with a political system that \nguarantees each of us life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We \nare free to speak our minds. We are free to practice our faiths. We are \nfree to travel this great land and be with whomever we choose. These \nprecious gifts of freedom have not come free. They have endured through \nthe blood of American heroes and heroines. We pause this day to say \n``thank you.'' We won't forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5343-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MISSOURI BROADCASTERS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Missouri \nradio and television stations for their contributions to public \nservice. This year, in a survey conducted for the Missouri Broadcasting \nAssociation by Public Opinion Strategies, it was determined that \nMissouri Broadcasters aired $44 million worth of public service \nannouncements (PSA) in 1997. This amount was fourth best among the \nthirty-eight states who participated.\n  The survey reported that Missouri television stations air an average \nof 175 PSAs each week and radio stations air an average of seventy-five \nper week. That comes to a total of 18,775 PSAs weekly. Every television \nstation and 94 percent of radio stations in Missouri participated in \nfundraising efforts for charitable organizations last year. Those \norganizations received a total of $17.3 million in charitable donations \nbecause of the on-air PSAs made by Missouri's broadcasters.\n  The most frequent PSAs dealt with drug and alcohol prevention and \nabuse. Other common PSAs covered anti-crime efforts, hunger, poverty, \nthe homeless, anti-violence and AIDS prevention. No other industry can \nmake the impact that broadcasters can make. I am proud to say that the \nMissouri broadcasters are some of the best.\n  I commend the Missouri broadcasters for their untiring dedication in \nhelping charitable causes in Missouri. It does make a difference and \npeople are benefitting from these broadcasters' efforts. I join the \nmany who thank the Missouri broadcasters for their support throughout \nthe year. Whether it be charities, weather warnings or public health \nannouncements, I know the Missouri broadcasters will be on-air to lead \nthe cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5343-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5343-S5344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING THE CONNECTICUT EDUCATION ASSOCIATION ON ITS 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are many things about my home \nstate of Connecticut that are a source of great pride to its people, \nbut few are greater than the overall quality of our state's public \nschools. Connecticut students are performing at the highest levels in \nthe nation on federally sponsored standardized tests. Three out of four \nConnecticut public school students go on to pursue higher education. \nAnd our public school students have outperformed students from private \nand parochial schools in our state.\n  Many people have contributed to the quality of our public schools, in \nparticular our parents and students. But the backbone of Connecticut's \npublic schools is its teachers. In my view, they are the finest in the \ncountry, and there are numbers that back me up. More than 80 percent of \nConnecticut's public school teachers have advanced degrees, the highest \npercentage in the country. They are among the nation's most experienced \nteachers, with the average teacher having taught for more than 15 \nyears. And the greatest testament to the quality of their teaching is \nthe accomplishments of Connecticut's students.\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\n  One organization, more than any other, has worked to ensure that \nConnecticut's children are taught by the finest teachers in the \ncountry, and that organization is the Connecticut Education Association \n(CEA).\n  The CEA is a membership organization that represents nearly 30,000 \nelementary and secondary public school teachers in our state. Through \nthe years, the CEA has consistently promoted the value of public \neducation, encouraged public awareness of the resources needed to \nprovide quality education, and emphasized the importance of the teacher \nin the education process.\n  This is a significant year for the CEA: it celebrates its 150th \nanniversary. Over the past century and a half, the Association has been \na consistent champion of children, teachers, and public education, and \ntoday, its voice on education issues is as strong as ever. There is no \njob more important than teaching our children, and I would like to \nthank and congratulate the Connecticut Education Association for a job \nwell done. I wish them all the best as they celebrate this anniversary \nand continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5343-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today Senator Sarbanes, the \ndistinguished Ranking Member on the Senate Banking Committee, and I \nhave announced that we will hold hearings on June 17th to begin the \nprocess of Senate consideration of the Financial Services Act of 1998, \nrecently passed by the House of Representatives.\n  America is the financial leader of the world, and New York is the \ncapital. But we cannot remain complacent. We must recognize that the \nworld is changing and global competition is tougher than ever. We must \nmeet this change head on. If we are to remain competitive and maintain \nour preeminent position in the marketplace, we must provide a climate \nthat allows our financial system to be as efficient, and competitive as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, simply put, financial modernization will provide \nconsumers with more choices. Financial institutions will be able to \nprovide even more diverse services. Insurance companies, securities \nfirms, brokerage houses, local banks and other institutions will be \nallowed to compete fairly with one another. But we must remember that \nwhile expanding the freedom of every American to make their financial \nchoices, we must not sacrifice the safety and soundness or place the \ntaxpayers at risk.\n  The issues surrounding financial modernization have in the past \nproven to contentious. Our hearing next month will allow an open and \nfrank dialogue with the Administration, industry groups and \nconsumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5344-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WILLA CATHER\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, writer Willa Cather fashioned from \nher experiences uncommon stories of the character of Nebraska's people \nand landscapes. It is my pleasure to pay tribute to Cather because, \nlike many Nebraskans, her writing continues to inspire me.\n  This year, we celebrate three major anniversaries in Cather's life. \nSeventy-five years ago, Cather won the Pulitzer Prize for ``One of \nOurs.'' One of her best known novels, ``My Antonia,'' will have its \n80th anniversary on September 21st. Finally, December 7th marks the \n125th anniversary of her birth.\n  Cather's writings illustrate a Nebraska of stark landscapes, epic \nfrontiers, and mysterious grandeur. Her characters are often placed in \na Nebraska panorama to which Cather gave breathtaking expression. \nShortly after moving from the east to Nebraska at the age of nine, \nCather realized that that shaggy grass country had gripped me with a \npassion I have never been able to shake. It has been the happiness and \nthe curse of my life.''\n  For Cather in ``My Antonia,'' Nebraska is raw and vast, the material \nout of which countries are made. . . naked as the back of your hand.'' \nOut of the passion she felt for Nebraska's materials, Cather wrote with \nunparalleled sensitivity about the soil, trees, and wildflowers of the \nlandscape. In The ``Song of the Lark,'' the cottonwoods are the light-\nreflecting, wind-loving trees of the desert, whose roots are always \nseeking water and whose leaves are always talking about it, making the \nsound of rain.''\n  The inhabitants of the land are connected to and determined by this \nlandscape. Thus, in many of Cather's novels, the character is a \npioneer, whether literally or as artist, one breaking new ground, \nfinding his or her own path, creating his or her own landscape. In the \nhands of Cather's sparse and evocative prose, questions of the \npioneering self shaped by experience and tested by difficulty indicate \nCather's commitment through her characters to integrity.\n  Readers continue to feel the special relationship between the wonder \nof Nebraska and the dignity of its people through Cather's well known \nnovels ``O Pioneers, My Antonia, One Of Ours,'' and ``Death Comes for \nthe Archbishop,'' as well as her poetry and other stories. I invite you \nto join me in honoring Willa Cather on the 75th anniversary of her \nPulitzer Prize, the 80th anniversary of ``My Antonia,'' and in memory \nof her 125th birthday.\n  In ``The Wild Land,'' Cather writes, The history of every country \nbegins in the heart of a man or a woman.'' Thanks to Cather's artistry, \nwe continue to be moved by the written recordings of Nebraska's \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5344-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5344-S5345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SPACE DAY\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of ``Space \nDay'' to recognize the accomplishments and achievements we have made in \nthe United States over the last quarter of the century in space-related \nactivities.\n  The space industry has rapidly evolved from public sector dominance \nto private sector innovation. Throughout the industry's infancy, the \nDepartment of Defense's military operations and the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration's activities dominated the \nemerging space frontier. These DOD and NASA initiatives served as \ncatalysts in the commercialization of space. Many advances in \ntechnology have resulted, leading to new jobs, industries, and exciting \nnew opportunities for uses of space that we cannot yet imagine.\n  The growth within the space industry, and the opportunities created \nhave been dramatic. The space industry is a major contributor to our \neconomy, and has spurred technological advances over the past 20 plus \nyears. In 1996, total industry revenues from the commercial sector \nexceeded those from the government sector for the first time ever. \nRevenues from the space industry are currently running at approximately \n$85 billion annually, and are projected to increase to approximately \n$121 billion by the year 2000.\n  Although participation in space initiatives has been and continues to \nbe capital intensive, this arena is fertile ground for smaller \nentrepreneurs and innovative startups. One of the key factors has been \nthe huge market for satellite launches. The demand for \ntelecommunications services and the distribution of television and \ncable programming caused the satellite capacity to expand. This \nindustry is continuously evolving to include a host of new satellite-\nbased services including worldwide mobile telephony, and infrastructure \nfor the television industry. Through continued Federal investment in \nspace ventures, we can also see other emerging applications such as \ndistance learning, telemedicine, and the exploration of microgravity \nconditions of materials in a clean space environment on the \nInternational Space Station.\n  Transferrable technologies--``spinoffs''--from government space \ninitiatives are now being used in various commercial applications. For \nexample, as a result of tests aimed at improving the performance of \nNASA's Space Shuttle, the Boeing Company was able to hone its design of \nthe Boeing 777 aircraft at NASA's facilities. Several NASA innovations \nwere instrumental in the development of that aircraft, including wind \ntunnel tests to confirm the structural integrity, use of lightweight \ncomposite structures for increased fuel efficiency and range, and the \nuse of computer modeling to conduct advanced computer-based aerodynamic \nanalysis. The is the largest twin engine jet manufactured today. Other \nsuch spinoffs include fire retardant materials used in space flight \nsuits now being used for fire fighters and automotive insulation for \nrace car drivers, and various sensors that monitor radioactive \nmaterials and environmental control, to cite just a few.\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\n  The benefits to the taxpayer through the development of new \nindustries, new products, new services, and improved quality of life \nrepresents a substantial return on the national investment in space-\nrelated initiatives.\n  Today, on Space Day, we recognize and honor those visionaries, \nentrepreneurs, and leaders who have made great accomplishments in the \nadvancement of technology through space-related endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5344-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA SCHOOL OF LAW AND GEORGIA GOV. \n                              CARL SANDERS\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize The University \nof Georgia School of Law's many years of accomplishments and \nachievements, and to honor former Governor of Georgia Carl Sanders, who \ngraduated from UGA's Law School 50 years ago.\n  I would like to applaud the commitment and hard work of the entire \nlaw school community: the faculty, staff, students, and alumni. The \nreputation of the school continues to grow and prosper each year.\n  Over the years UGA has produced thousands of successful lawyers, \nincluding many leaders and policy makers. Since opening its doors in \n1785, the law school has graduated five U.S. Senators, 30 Members of \nCongress, nine governors, including Gov. Carl Sanders, eight Speakers \nof the Georgia House of Representatives and 54 Appellate Judges.\n  I recently had the opportunity to deliver the commencement speech to \nthe 1998 graduating class of The University of Georgia School of Law \nand was reminded of the impact and value of the law.\n  In order for the law to be respected, and for us to be respected as \nauthorities on the law--whether as lawyers, law enforcement or \nlawmakers--there must be a sense of morality behind the law. It is a \nbasic historical fact that people will not obey unjust law.\n  As I look around Washington I see many reminders of the importance of \nthe law. The inscription on the Supreme Court building is: ``Equal \njustice under law.'' There is an inscription over the 10th Street \nentrance of the U.S. Department of Justice Building in Washington which \nreads: ``Justice in the life and conduct of the State is possible only \nas first it resides in the hearts and souls of its citizens.'' Justice \ncomes before the law. All of us who touch the law are bound by this \njustice and honor.\n  With justice and morality behind the law, we strengthen it. Without \nit, the law is weakened. If all of us who touch the law do not abide by \nthese terms, the law loses its credibility. Ultimately, those of us who \ntouch the law have a responsibility to lead others to respect it.\n  The men and women who have graduated from The University of Georgia \nwith law degrees over the past two hundred years have and will continue \nto strengthen and uphold the law of this nation. I ask my colleagues in \nthe Senate today to join me in saluting and congratulating The \nUniversity of Georgia School of Law for instructing and graduating men \nand women who have shaped our nation's history during the last two \ncenturies, including Gov. Carl Sanders and other Georgia lawmakers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5345-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR THE CONTINUATION OF SERVICE AND EXTENSION OF TERM OF \n    SERVICE OF MEMBERS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FINANCE CONTROL \n                               AUTHORITY\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

MONDANI\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe greatest leaders and supporters of public education that the State \nof Connecticut has ever known: Thomas P. Mondani. This past March, the \nState of Connecticut was saddened by his passing at the age of 63.\n  Tom Mondani served as executive director of the Connecticut Education \nAssociation (CEA), the State's largest teacher organization, for longer \nthan any individual in the organization's 150-year history.\n  Mr. Mondani began his career in public education as a social studies \nand English teacher in Moodus, CT in 1959. He joined the CEA staff in \n1963 as a research consultant and was promoted to director of research \n2 years later. As director of research, he compiled and published \nnumerous studies of statistical data related to educational \nexpenditures in Connecticut.\n  When Tom Mondani was appointed executive director in 1971, his work \nin school finance made him a recognized authority on research and \neducation legislation in the State.\n  Mr. Mondani also served in Connecticut's State legislature. In 1965, \nhe was elected to the first of his two terms as a State representative, \nand in 1970, he moved from the House to the State Senate. As a State \nlegislator, Tom Mondani worked diligently on education issues, and he \nauthored legislation that provided maintenance of all accumulated \ntenure and sick leave rights for teachers who had been incorporated \ninto recently formed regional school districts.\n  Tom Mondani left public office in 1971 when he accepted his \nappointment as CEA executive director, and he often utilized the \npolitical skills that he developed in the General Assembly during his \n22-year tenure. He worked with teachers as well as political leaders to \nsecure the passage of many laws to help Connecticut's teachers, \nincluding improvements in teacher freedom of residency and the \nestablishment of binding arbitration for teacher-board of education \nnegotiations. During his tenure from 1972 to 1994, he helped develop \nmajor advancements for students and teachers in the areas of teacher \nstandards, public school finance, and collective bargaining.\n  Most recently, Tom Mondani served as vice chair of the State Board of \nGovernors for Higher Education.\n  In 1994, the CEA Board of Directors voted unanimously to recognize \nTom Mondani's contributions by bestowing him with the organization's \nmost prestigious award: the CEA Friend of Education Award. And not only \ndid CEA present him with the award, but they also renamed the award in \nhis honor.\n  Upon his passing, countless people, including teachers, parents, and \nformer Governors spoke out in praise of this remarkable man. They spoke \nof his commitment to the children of Connecticut. They remembered his \nleadership, wisdom, integrity, intellect and fairness. They said that \nhe elevated the thinking in the State about children, teachers, and \npublic education.\n  I would like to join the chorus of voices singing the praises of this \nhonorable man. I knew Tom Mondani, and I saw first-hand his commitment \nand dedication to helping others and improving the quality of our \npublic schools. The people of Connecticut will miss him dearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5345-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5345-S5346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GENE E. HUCKSTEP\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a very popular Sunday night \ntelevision show, entitled, ``Touched by an Angel'' focuses on stories \nwhere people's lives have been affected in a positive way by angels who \nare sent from Heaven to serve among us.\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\n  I rise today to pay tribute and honor a very dear friend who might \njust qualify as one of those angels that serves to minister to his \nfellow man.\n  This past week, a former Presiding Commissioner of Cape Girardeau \nCounty, Gene Huckstep, completed his successful service on Earth just \nbefore reaching his 70th birthday.\n  Gene Huckstep was widely loved and universally respected, but he was \nat first appearance not one you would figure to be an angel. Gene was a \npowerfully-built man who could be as rough as he needed to be. He \nlaughingly told stories about his educational career, which at times \nbordered on juvenile delinquency. He was sent in the military to shape \nup.\n  Then, in a career fueled with brushes with death, by his calculation \nhe used up about 39 lives. In the Army as a tank driver he once was \nbadly burned when the tank caught fire when it was being refueled, and \nanother time when his tank went into water 25 feet deep he barely \nescaped drowning.\n  After his service career he returned to his native Cape Girardeau and \nsaw death and destruction first-hand when the May 21, 1949 tornado \nstruck. After taking a baby from the hands of a dying man impaled on a \ntwo-by-four, he searched for other survivors and fell into a cellar \nfracturing three vertebrae and leaving him in a body cast from hip to \nneck.\n  His outstanding service to his fellow man began in 1965 when his \nfamily-owned body shop bought a gas-powered saw which led law \nenforcement agencies to begin to call on Gene to rescue victims in \nserious car accidents.\n  He faced many life and death situations cutting people out of burning \nautomobiles to save their lives; in some cases losing the battle to \nflames before he could extricate them.\n  One time he was trying to retrieve a drowning victim when friends on \nthe bank saw swarms of cottonmouth water moccasins coming toward him. \nThey pulled him out with a grappling hook that saved him from \npotentially fatal snake bites.\n  Over his career in 22 years he personally extricated victims from \n1,976 serious car accidents. For these victims and their families, Gene \nHuckstep truly was an angel.\n  His service to mankind continued well beyond his extrication \nbusiness. In 1978 he was elected Presiding Commissioner of Cape \nGirardeau County with strong bipartisan support and led the way on many \nimprovements in the county including a new jail, a veterans home, and \nmany other worthwhile benefits.\n  In the private sector he led the drive for a new emergency room at \nSt. Francis Hospital, and he served as Chairman of the Board of Cameron \nMutual Insurance Company.\n  His specific charitable contributions are far too many to recount, \nbut it is safe to say he left his community a far better place because \nhe touched so many things for the good of the community and his fellow \nman.\n  As one who was blessed by his friendship as well as his political \nsupport, I shall always remember his generosity, his good humor, and \nhis genuine concern for others. Our thoughts and prayers are with his \nlovely wife Betty, his family, and his many close friends. I shall \nalways treasure his memory and the fact that he was spared from \ndangerous situations so many times to carry on his work among the \npeople of southeast Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5345-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TULARE, SOUTH DAKOTA HIGH SCHOOL BAND TRAVELS TO CANADA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nwelcome home the 351st MP Company who recently returned from Bosnia on \nApril 3, 1998. The President sent our service men and women to Bosnia \nin an effort to bring peace to the region. I think it is appropriate to \nrecognize the important and extensive contributions of our Reserve \nForces without whom this extended mission probably would not have been \npossible.\n  The 351st, consisting of 182 personnel, primarily from the City of \nOcala, FL, was mobilized on August 19, 1997 and ordered to Bosnia under \nthe command of Captain Keith Holmes. Prior to their departure, the unit \nunderwent extensive training at both Ft. Benning, GA and Ft. Polk, LA, \nbefore being sent to Bosnia-Herzogovina. In Bosnia, the unit was split \nbetween two base camps, Eagle Base and Bedrock, located in Tuzia \nvalley.\n  While in Bosnia, the 351st participated in operation Joint Guard. The \noperation's major focus was to provide a stable environment for \nimplementation of the General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP). The \n351st conducted numerous peacekeeping missions, which included: area \npresence patrols, weapons storage site inspections, quick Reaction \nForce duties on Eagle Base, and protective services for numerous senior \nU.S. Army officers, culminating with the President of the United States \nduring his visit to Bosnia.\n  In leaving their families and their jobs, the men and women of the \n351st have endured personal sacrifice and demonstrated their deep sense \nof duty to their country. It is only through the recognition and use of \nreservists as an integral part of our total force structure that the \nUnited States has been able to demonstrate its commitment to peace and \nsecurity in Bosnia. And, through this commitment, the United States has \nmade possible the promise of safety and hope of reconciliation to the \npeople of this troubled region.\n  In its role, the 351st has served as a shining example of the \nindispensable role of Reservists in our Armed Forces. Reservists who \nanswered the call of duty when their country asked them to serve have \nmy deepest respect and gratitude. Accordingly, it gives me great \npleasure to welcome home the 351st MP Company and thank them for a job \nwell done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5346-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5346-S5347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS C. HOLBROOK\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDouglas C. Holbrook, who will be retiring from his position as \nSecretary-Treasurer of the American Postal Workers Union in November, \n1998. Mr. Holbrook is being recognized for his service to the men and \nwomen of the American Postal Workers Union at their 14th Biennial \nNational Convention, which will take place in my home town of Detroit, \nMichigan, from July 20-24, 1998.\n  Douglas Holbrook was born and attended high school in Virginia, and \nmoved to Michigan to study labor relations and administration at Wayne \nState University in Detroit. While in Detroit, Mr. Holbrook began his \ncareer with the U.S. Postal Service as a part-time clerk. His abilities \nwere quickly recognized by his fellow employees, and he began his \ndistinguished career in labor relations with the Detroit District Area \nLocal. After serving as Trustee, Editor of the Detroit Postal Worker \nand Vice President, he was elected President of the District Local in \n1966. Mr. Holbrook served in this position until being chosen to fill \nthe unexpired term of his predecessor as Secretary-Treasurer of the \nAmerican Postal Workers Union.\n  The American Postal Workers Union is the largest union of postal \nworkers in the world. Under the steady and determined leadership of Mr. \nHolbrook, APWU has truly been a powerful force for workers rights, fair \npay and a safe\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nworkplace.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCatherine Kalinowski who has been named the Colorado State champion in \nThe Citizens Flag Alliance Essay Contest. This young lady was charged \nwith the task of writing an essay on the theme, ``The American Flag \nProtection Amendment: A Right of the People . . . the Right Thing to \nDo,'' and did a fine job of making the case for protecting the greatest \nof our national symbols.\n  As many in this Chamber know, I am a strong supporter of a \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of our flag. The \nAmerican flag is a great symbol of our Nation, and it should be \nregarded with the highest of honors. It is a part of our national \nidentity, representing the hopes, dreams, and honor of our country.\n  As I read this essay, one passage struck me as particularly \ninsightful. I believe that Catherine sums up our beliefs best when she \nwrites,\n\n       The visage of the nation's flag has altered as it has aged, \n     with modifications in the dimensions, design, and number of \n     stars; yet changing appearance has not impeded the flag from \n     becoming the principal image of American ideals.\n\n  I would like to submit the full text of Ms. Kalinowski's essay for \ninclusion in the Congressional Record at this time.\n  Mr. President, Catherine Kalinowski represents the best and brightest \nthat America has to offer. Young people like her are our future, a \nfuture that is brighter because of her commitment and resolve. On \nbehalf of all Coloradans, I would like to congratulate Catherine and \nwish her the best of luck in the upcoming national competition.\n  The essay follows:\n\nThe American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People . . . the \n                           Right Thing to Do\n\n                      (By Catherine M. Kalinowski)\n\n       ``Stars and Stripes Forever,'' a song by John Philip Sousa \n     proclaims the American flag as ``the flag of the free'' and \n     ``the Banner of the Right.'' Sousa declares ``May it wave as \n     our standard forever,'' but may it? The flag of the United \n     States of America is so loosely protected by state and \n     federal laws that the molestation of the flag has become \n     acceptable. America's flag has gone from being a symbol of \n     freedom and righteousness to one of commercialism and \n     insurrection.\n       As the Colonists fought for the rule of the land they \n     considered their own, creation of a separate identity from \n     England became important. Before a fleet of the Continental \n     Congress set out to intercept British supply boats coming \n     into Boston, Col. Joseph Reed wrote to his commander, General \n     George Washington. ``Please to fix upon Some particular \n     Colour for a Flag--& a Signal, by which our vessels may know \n     one another.'' Col. Reed's letter of request was lamentably \n     late, forcing the ships to sail under their old flags. The \n     flag issue was settled when on June 14, 1777, Congress, \n     ``Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be \n     thirteen stripes alternate red and white; that the union be \n     thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new \n     constellation.'' And by November 1, 1777, Stars and Stripes \n     were seen flying from a US ship under the command of \n     Continental Navy Captain John Paul Jones. The flag on Jones' \n     vessel was the first to represent the United States in a \n     foreign port and to receive recognition as representing \n     America as a nation, being given a nine-gun salute by the \n     French at Quiberon Bay. Though originally needed for the \n     practical objective of identification at sea, the creation of \n     Old Glory became significant to the establishment of the \n     nation.\n       The visage of the nation's flag has altered as it has aged, \n     with modifications in the dimensions, design, and number of \n     stars; yet changing appearance has not impeded the flag from \n     becoming the principal image of American ideals. Life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is embodied in every \n     stitch of the US flag. As United States Senator Paul Fannin \n     wrote, ``Those who tear down the flag reveal their hatred for \n     everything good and great in our country, because the flag is \n     a symbol of what we want America to be--a land of justice, \n     opportunity, equality and compassion.'' New York Mayor \n     John V. Lindsay viewed the flag as having individual stars \n     and stripes to represent the individuality of the \n     country's citizens; however, because the same flag flies \n     over all Americans, the flag ``binds us together in the \n     common enterprise we call America.'' A representation of \n     so much positive in American society, a representation of \n     the United States itself, it is unfortunate that the flag \n     is becoming insignificant.\n       During the beginning of this century, most states enacted \n     laws to discourage flag desecration, outlawing placing any \n     marks or pictures of the flag, forbade any flag usage for \n     commercial purposes, and banned any physical destruction of \n     flags or any'' act or words' that publicly cast ``contempt'' \n     on the flag. These standards have been obscured to the point \n     of oblivion. The flag is pictured on everything from apparel \n     and political paraphernalia to automobiles and boxes of \n     cereal. Depicted on every corner, the flag no longer receives \n     the veneration due to it. Penalization for defiling the flag \n     through acts such as flag burning was practiced until what \n     has been called the 1989-1990 Flag Burning Controversy. \n     Gregory Lee Johnson was arrested in 1984 for burning a flag \n     in Dallas, Texas. Under Texas' Venerated Objects law, Johnson \n     had committed a crime and was sentenced to the maximum \n     penalty of one year in prison and a fine of $2,000. An \n     appeals court reversed Johnson's conviction by a 5-4 vote on \n     April 20, 1988. Dallas County, in response to the Texas Court \n     of Criminal Appeals, requested the ruling of the U.S. Supreme \n     Court. The decision of the Supreme Court upheld through \n     another 5-4 vote the conclusion of the Texas court, agreeing \n     that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment. In \n     response to the Johnson decision, there have been votes for \n     an amendment protecting the flag, but none with enough \n     majority to adopt the amendment.\n       Constitutionality of flag burning has been supported by the \n     guarantee of free speech, including symbolic speech, in the \n     First Amendment. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that \n     freedom of speech has limits; restricted areas of speech \n     include obscenity, defamation, speech that leads to illegal \n     action, fighting words, and speech in public schools. Because \n     obscenity is generally defined as anything that violates \n     society's standards of decency, desecration of Old Glory \n     could be considered indecent, thus unprotected by the \n     Constitution. The consideration of actions protected as \n     speech also allows for destruction of the flag to be viewed \n     as fighting words, exceeding another limit of the First \n     Amendment. In Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme \n     Court defined ``fighting words'' as words that, ``have a \n     direct tendency to cause acts of violence.'' Flag burning \n     seems a fighting word as it often leads to acts of violence. \n     When considering obscenity and fighting words, the flag does \n     not appear to be protected by free speech. Therefore, it \n     seems in order to go ahead and proceed with the next step, \n     creating an American Flag Protection Amendment.\n       To propose such a protection amendment, two-thirds of the \n     members of both houses of Congress or the same percentage of \n     members of a national convention must vote for the proposal \n     of the amendment. Once proposed, three-fourths of the states \n     must ratify the amendment by a vote in each state's \n     legislature or state convention. If enough citizens gave \n     their support of an American Flag Protection Amendment, the \n     representatives of the people would surely follow their will \n     and obtain protection for the banner of the nation.\n       American's flag needs and deserves to be treated with \n     dignity, and it is the right of the public to rally for \n     Constitutional protection of the magnificent symbol of the \n     United States. So much time as already elapsed--now is the \n     time to act justly on the behalf of Old Glory. With swift \n     action, Stars and Stripes will be able to, ``wave as our \n     standard forever.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5347-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5347-S5348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MORDECHAI STRIGLER\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today is a bittersweet day at the \nJewish Theological Seminary in New York City where the annual \ncommencement ceremony will include an unprecedented presentation of a \nposthumous honorary doctorate to Mordechai Strigler, the talented \neditor of the Yiddish Forward who died last week at the age of 76.\n  I rose almost a year ago today to share with the Senate the news of \nthe Forward's centenary. This remarkable newspaper, which once helped \nhundreds of thousands of new immigrants learn about their new homeland, \nnow prints Yiddish, Russian and English weekly editions. The Yiddish \nedition has gone from a daily press run of 250,000 copies to a weekly \nrun of 10,000, but has retained much of the literary excellence and \nsocial conscience that has so characterized the Forward during its \nstoried history.\n  Mordechai Strigler was born in 1921 in Zamosc, Poland, and was sent \nto study in a yeshiva at age 11. In 1937 he began work as a rabbi and \nteacher in Warsaw.\n  When the Germans occupied Poland in 1939, he tried to escape to \nRussia, but was caught at the border. He spent\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\na few months at the Zamosc ghetto with his parents and then five years \nin several concentration camps. In Buchenwald, he was a member of the \nResistance and served as a covert teacher for the children incarcerated \nthere. He was liberated on April 11, 1945.\n  After the war, he began writing furiously and prolifically for the \nnext 53 years until his death. He chronicled the slave-labor camps and \ndeath factories in a six-volume Yiddish series called ``Oysgebrente \nLikht'', which means ``Extinguished Candles''.\n  In 1955, Strigler published two volumes called ``Arm in Arm with the \nWind,'' a historical novel about Jewish life in Poland in the 17th and \n18th centuries.\n  His newspaper career began in Warsaw just before the war and \nflourished in Paris after the war. In France, he served as editor of \nUnzer Vort (Our world), a Yiddish daily.\n  While in New York, he was offered the editorship of the Kemfer, a \nposition he held until 1995. He published such classic Yiddish writers \nas Abraham Reizen, H. Leivik, Chaim Grade, and Jacob Glatstein.\n  In 1978, Strigler was awarded the Itzak Manger Prize in Jewish \nLiterature, one of the most distinguished prizes in the field.\n  He became editor of the Yiddish Forward in 1987, following the \nretirement of Simon Weber, and he remained at its helm until last \nmonth.\n  ``The death of Strigler marks not only a sad transition for his \ncolleagues in the Yiddish, Russian, and English editions of the Forward \nbut also a milestone in the area of Yiddish-language journalism and the \nliterature of the Holocaust,'' the English-language Forward said in an \nobituary.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the English edition of the \nForward's moving editorial tribute to this talented journalist.\n\n                           Mordechai Strigler\n\n       Mordechai Strigler, the editor of the Yiddish Forward who \n     died Sunday at the age of 76, was one of the giants. Born at \n     Zamosc, Poland, he became famous at a young age as a genius \n     of Talmud. He was apprenticed to the greatest sages of his \n     time. He was at the barricades in Warsaw when the Germans \n     invaded. He fled toward Russia, but was captured by the \n     Nazis, who cast him into concentration camps. His parents and \n     three of his seven sisters perished. He himself was in, among \n     other camps, Maidenek, Skarhisko and Buchenwald, where he was \n     a member of the Resistance and where on liberation he was \n     spotted by Meyer Levin, who wrote about his heroism in his \n     memoir ``In Search''. Levin told of Strigler gathering \n     children secretly in the barracks and teaching them Yiddish \n     and Hebrew. He had lost his pre-war manuscripts during the \n     war. It is said that upon liberation he began writing \n     furiously. He continued until weeks before he died. He turned \n     out cycles of poetry and novels, as well as biblical \n     commentaries and analysis of rabbinic responsa and thousands \n     of items of journalism--editorials, dispatches, criticism and \n     feuilletons. Moving to Paris immediately after the war, he \n     became editor of Unzer Vort and joined the Labor Zionist \n     movement. As editor of the Yiddisher Kemfer and, later, the \n     Yiddish Forward as well, he maintained a courteous and gentle \n     exterior, but it belied an extraordinary toughness. No matter \n     how others around him might fume, he would go on doing what \n     he thought was right. His achievements are well known. He \n     touched Jews the world over, inspired his colleagues and set \n     a standard to which all the editors of the Forward, in \n     Yiddish, Russian, and English, look up.\n       Yet for all these achievements, there was a dimension to \n     Mordechai Strigler that remained a mystery, even to many of \n     us who worked in the same editorial rooms with him for years. \n     It had to do with his spiritual journey. Had history taken a \n     different turn, it is as a Torah sage that he might be \n     remembered today. But the Holocaust shook his faith and led \n     him to quarrel with God. He emerged to write poetry and \n     fiction. He entered the political fray for the labor faction. \n     Hope came to him from the establishment of the Jewish state, \n     which became, along with Jewish unity, his abiding passion. \n     After he reached America, he began corresponding with a young \n     woman in Jerusalem, Esther Bonni, a scientist. When they \n     finally met in Israel, a romance developed and marriage \n     followed. After the birth of their daughter, Leah, the \n     glimmer of Strigler's spiritual life began to shine again. \n     Leah talked at his funeral of Strigler's enduring attachment \n     to text and of his powers as a teacher. He was obsessed with \n     the accuracy of citations of Torah and Talmud, so that \n     whenever she asked a question, he would insist on checking \n     sources, even though he almost always knew the references by \n     heart. In recent years, his intimates relate, he had occasion \n     to lay tefillin. Even then it was said that he had not again \n     become a believer but was merely observing a mitzvah. Yet as \n     he lay dying at Roosevelt Hospital, his daughter read to him \n     for days from the Bible, holding the text in one hand and \n     here father's hand in the other. His daughter and wife sang \n     prayers in Yiddish and Hebrew, which for precious moments \n     brought him out of his coma. This is how this editor who had \n     lived and chronicled and tragedies and triumphs of our \n     century spent his last days--called back to consciousness, \n     however fleetingly, by the languages of the Jews.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5347-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5348-S5349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE: A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF OUR VISION OF THE \n                                 FUTURE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Spallation Neutron Source \ncurrently being developed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee will be the most \npowerful spallation source of neutrons in the world. It will enable \nscientists to ``see'' and thus understand the physical, chemical, and \nbiological properties of materials at the atomic level.\n  In nuclear physics, Mr. President, the study of neutrons led to the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, nuclear energy, medical isotopes, and \nour understanding of the energy and evolution of the stars and the \norigins of the solar system.\n  In condensed matter physics, neutrons are used--among other things-- \nto study magnetic materials, magnetic resistance, and the dynamic \naspects of glasses, liquids, amorphous solids, and phase behavior.\n  In materials science, neutrons are used to study diffusion, crystal \nstructures, the spatial distribution of impurities, and the stress \ncapacities of forgings, castings, and welds.\n  In chemistry, neutrons are used to determine molecular, crystal, and \nlarge-scale structure.\n  In biology, neutrons are used to determine the structure of protein \nand protein complexes in lipids and biological membranes, and to \ndetermine the molecular arrangements on biological surfaces to help us \nbetter understand the function of cell surface receptors.\n  The one common requirement in all of these research fields is an \nintense source of neutrons. And the only such source other than a large \nnuclear reactor is an energetic particle accelerator such as the \nSpallation Neutron Source.\n  Mr. President, as I've just pointed out with this by-no-means-\ncomplete list of examples, neutron scattering has now become an \nindispensable tool within a broad range of scientific disciplines: \nphysics, chemistry, materials science, nuclear physics, biology, earth \nscience, engineering and medicine--which is why the Spallation Neutron \nSource is a critical element of our vision of the future.\n  Far from a jobs program or a pie-in-the-sky experiment, Mr. \nPresident, spallation is the newest anchor of our national research \neffort. And it will contribute to America's economic and technological \ngrowth in thousands of ways.\n  By helping us understand the properties of materials at the atomic \nlevel, U.S. chemical companies will produce better fibers, plastics, \nand catalysts; U.S. pharmaceutical companies will produce better \ndrugs--with higher potencies and fewer side effects; U.S. automobile \nmanufacturers will build cars that run better and are safer to operate; \nand U.S. aircraft manufacturers will build planes that are stronger, \nlighter, faster, and safer--with fewer defects, lower stress levels, \nand greater fuel efficiency.\n  We'll create stronger magnets and magnetic materials--that will \nresult in more efficient electric motors and generators, better \nmagnetic recording tapes, computer hard drives, and medical magnetic \nresonance systems.\n  And all across America, U.S. industries will produce everything from \nbetter low-fat foods, credit cards, and cosmetics, to clothes that \ndon't wrinkle and bags that don't break, to better airport detection \nequipment and bulletproof vests.\n  In the next century, the achievements will be even greater--\nespecially in the field of medicine. We'll see drug delivery systems \nthat release medicine precisely when and where the body needs it--\nwithout side effects; artificial blood that will eliminate the need to \nscreen for viruses or procure exact blood types in times of emergency; \ncorrosion-resistant medical implants that will last a lifetime and \nnever have to be replaced; and smaller, faster electronic chips that \nwill lower energy costs and increase convenience in hundreds of \nproducts.\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, spallation is not only essential to \nthe advancement of important scientific research, it's absolutely \ncritical to retaining our competitive edge in the global economy and \nthe quality of life we have come to enjoy.\n  Completion of the Spallation Neutron Source--on time and on budget-- \nmust be a priority for another reason as well. Over the last 20 years, \nAmerica has fallen alarmingly behind Europe in the availability of up-\nto-date neutron sources and instrumentation. The major research \nreactors in our inventory--the HFIR at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the \nHigh Flux Beam Reactor--were built more than 30 years ago. With the \ndemise of the ANS (Advanced Neutron Source), and all it represented in \nterms of maintaining America's strength is neutron science, we cannot \nreasonably expect those aging facilities to sustain our entire neutron \nscattering effort.\n  Fortunately, unlike ANS--whose pricetag [$3B] and lack of public \nsupport caused the Administration to abandon the effort--Spallation is \nboth affordable [$2B] and strongly endorsed by both the White House and \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. President, the Spallation Neutron Source is a big part of that \nvision of our vision for the future. As with all of America's truly \nimaginative ventures--the space program, the Human Genome Project, the \nHubble telescope--its benefits will be felt for years to come.\n  But there is another reason Spallation must be supported, Mr. \nPresident. It is, in my view, exactly the kind of project the federal \neffort was designed to produce and support: It's good science--that is \nboth knowledge-driven and mission-driven; it will be fiscally \naccountable--if we in Congress do it right; it has a consistent \napproach; it will have measurable results; it will create a flow of \ntechnology, from research through commercialization; it will promote \nexcellence throughout the American research infrastructure, and across \na broad range of initiatives; and it will create partnerships among \nindustry, academia, and the national labs.\n  And because of the way it was set-up as a cooperative partnership \namong the national labs--Lawrence Berkeley will be responsible for the \nion source; Los Alamos, for the linear accelerator; Brookhaven, for the \naccumulator ring; Argonne, for the instrumentation and experiment \nfacilities; and Oak Ridge for the conventional facilities, target \napparatus, and overall project management--it will increase Congress' \nability to focus on the importance of science and technology; decrease \nthe likelihood that it will get side-tracked by politics; and ensure \nthat spallation is consistent and effective.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the real effects of this project don't \nend with Spallation, they begin with it--and with us and our commitment \nto science and technology future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5348-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER ON THE NAMING OF THE U.S.S. JIMMY \n                            CARTER SUBMARINE\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nformer President Jimmy Carter on the naming of the Navy's third and \nfinal Seawolf-class submarine, the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter.\n  After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, President \nCarter fulfilled a dream from his childhood in southwest Georgia by \nserving in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. As a submariner, he \nwas selected by the late Adm. Hyman Rickover to help in the development \nof the fledgling U.S. nuclear submarine program, a program which has \nrealized its full potential in the Seawolf-class attack submarines.\n  I had the privilege of attending the naming ceremony at the Pentagon \non April 27 with President and Mrs. Rosalynn Carter. Navy Secretary \nJohn H. Dalton praised the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter as a bridge to the next \ngeneration of attack submarines. The newest Seawolf vessel, named after \nthe only President to serve on a submarine, is currently being built \nand is due to join the U.S. fleet in December 2001.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate today to join me in saluting and \ncongratulating President Carter on his years of service in this \nNation's Navy, and later as Governor of my home State of Georgia and \nPresident of the United States. President Carter is respected by all \nAmericans for his efforts on behalf of our country both during and \nafter he held office. The naming of the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is a \nwonderful tribute to honor a great American in a manner befitting his \noutstanding service to this nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5349-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PAU-WA-LU MIDDLE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BRYAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nextraordinary disaster assistance efforts of the Grand Forks Air Force \nBase (AFB) and its branch of the American Red Cross.\n  Twelve months have passed since my state suffered the worst winter \nand spring of its history. A record eight blizzards dropped more than \neight feet of snow on North Dakota, and brought with them sub-zero \ntemperatures well into the month of April. The worst and final storm, \nBlizzard Hannah, glazed the state in a thick coat of ice, knocked out \npower for much of North Dakota, and made the snowmelt that followed \neven more devastating. On the heels of these paralyzing storms came a \n``500-year'' flood, driving thousands from their homes, many in the \nmiddle of the night.\n  The hasty evacuation of Grand Forks, North Dakota, was the single \nlargest evacuation in recent American history. Roused from their beds \nby the wail of sirens, many citizens left their city with little more \nthan the clothes on their backs. Homes inaccessible and loved ones far \naway, thousands lacked shelter.\n  I firmly believe that the evacuation of Grand Forks would have been \nimpossible without the Grand Forks AFB providing for those in need of a \nsafe place to sleep and something to eat. The Base opened the doors of \nits homes and cleared its hangars of aircraft to house neighbors in \nneed. It is estimated that 4,500 residents of Grand Forks found shelter \nat the air base.\n  The assistance of the Grand Forks AFB Red Cross was also invaluable. \nRed Cross volunteers worked tirelessly over the period of the flood \nfeeding the displaced, staffing the hospice center for the elderly, \nlocating loved ones, and ably dealing with the daunting task of \nsheltering thousands. Then, when the waters receded, the Grand Forks \nAFB American Red Cross continued its efforts: cleaning flood-damaged \nhomes, housing those whose homes remained unlivable, and working to \nmeet the needs of its neighbors. Six hundred fifty volunteers recorded \nnearly 48,000 hours of service in the flood and flood-recovery effort.\n  Mr. President, these were volunteers in the best sense of the word. \nThe men and women of the Grand Forks AFB Red Cross were not immune to \nthe emotional upheaval of last year's disasters in the Red River \nValley. These volunteers had families and jobs, and in many cases \nsuffered disaster losses of their own, but they gave of their time \nfreely. Though many of these men and women only enjoyed a brief stay at \nGrand Forks AFB, we North Dakotans will always consider them neighbors.\n  The dedicated and selfless service of Grand Forks AFB personnel made \nme tremendously proud of America's Air Force, and our base. I was \nparticularly impressed that Air Force personnel labored to battle flood \nwaters, even as their own homes were inundated. I felt it was the least \nI could do to author an amendment which ensured that all Grand Forks \nAFB personnel would have full access to an Air Force disaster relief \nprogram.\n  Together with all my fellow North Dakotans I would like to extend my \nsincerest thanks to Grand Forks AFB an the base's American Red Cross. \nThe base commander at the time, Brigadier General Kenneth W. Hess, and \nthe Station Manager of the American Red Cross at the time, Mary Martin, \ndeserve special thanks. Additionally, I would like to thank the current \nbase commander, Colonel James A. Hawkins, for his continued assistance \nin helping Grand forks get back on its feet. Under their leadership, \nthe base and the Red Cross helped save a community, and made the state \nand the Nation proud.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my letter to Brigadier General Kenneth W. \nHess be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                                 U.S. Senator,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 1997.\n     Brig. Gen. Kenneth W. Hess,\n     Commander, 319 Air Refueling Wing, Grand Forks Air Force \n         Base, Grand Forks, ND.\n       Dear General Hess: Working on the disaster has become all \n     consuming, but I did want to take a moment to let you know \n     how much I appreciate the courtesies you extended to me and \n     my staff on our recent stay. Too, I shall be forever grateful \n     to you for all you have done for the people of North Dakota.\n       The night-time evacuation of the city of Grand Forks would \n     have been impossible without the availability of the Grand \n     Forks Air Force Base facilities to those in need of shelter. \n     Your quick response and leadership made a situation rife with \n     danger manageable. This same helpful attitude was evident \n     everywhere on the Base--encouragement, hope, and a warm smile \n     went along with the uniform whether at the Emergency \n     Operations Center of the Command Center. And, kindness did \n     not hamper your efficiency--The Grand Forks Air Force Base \n     was a gracious host to the President of the United States and \n     six Cabinet Members in the midst of a disaster.\n       General Hess, you can be very proud of the men and women of \n     the 319 Air Refueling Wing. One Airman mentioned to a member \n     of my staff, ``We're glad to help out. We are just one big \n     Grand Forks family.''\n       With deepest appreciation,\n           Sincerely\n                                                      Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5350-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF ROSS P.

Marine, DHL, \nMHA, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Trinity Luthern \nHospital, Kansas City, Missouri, and former Administrator, Truman \nMedical Center East (Truman East), and the Director of Public Health \nfor the Jackson County Health Department (JCHD), is receiving the \nCitizen of the Year award from UNICO/Kansas City Chapter. As the \nrecipient, he may select a charity of his choice to receive half the \nproceeds from the awards dinner. Mr. Marine has chosen to give his \ndonation to the Truman Medical Center East Auxiliary's commitment to \nthe renovation of the Obstetrics Unit into a new Labor, Delivery, \nRecovery and Post-partum wing at Truman East.\n  UNICO stands for Unity, Neighborliness, Integrity, Clarity and \nOpportunity and is a national organization made up of men and women of \nItalian descent who work for positive community service. A Board member \nor current officer nominates the candidate, for Citizen of the year. \nCandidates must have an interest in their community and working with \nothers to make their community a better place.\n  Mr. Marine has continually shown that he not only has concern for the \nbetterment of his community, but has also taken a leadership role. He \nmade health care more accessible by starting five public health \noutreach facilities. Truman East received $38 million in renovation and \nexpansion because of Mr. Marine's efforts. While embracing the credo of \nUNICO, ``Service above Self,'' he has helped his community and \ntherefore Missouri as a whole. He has been appointed to numerous Boards \nof Directors and received many awards for all his outstanding \nachievements.\n  Commending Mr. Marine for his many years of service to his community \nand the field of medicine, I am glad to say that the State of Missouri \nis enriched with his wisdom and leadership. I join the many who \ncongratulate and thank him for his hard work and wish him continued \nsuccess in future years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5351-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CELEBRATION OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE DAY\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as the senior Senator from the \nstate that launched the Mercury astronaut pioneers into space, sent \nApollo astronauts to the moon, and has hosted numerous space shuttle \nlaunches since 1981, it is a tremendous privilege to lead the U.S. \nSenate in recognizing May 21 as ``International Space Day.''\n  Our nation's exciting adventure in space began just over forty years \nago, with the launch of the Explorer I satellite on January 31, 1958. \nThe celebration of this anniversary gave us cause to look back at \nAmerica's four decades in space. ``International Space Day'' gives us a \nchance to look forward and assess how to seize the space opportunities \nof the future.\n  Mr. President, forty years after we launched our first satellite and \nnearly thirty years since Neil Armstrong took mankind's first steps on \nthe lunar surface, Americans remain captivated by the exploration of \nspace.\n  Students across the nation eagerly study past achievements and future \nadventures in space exploration. In Florida, tourists flock to the \nKennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral to see the famed launch pads and \nrockets that have boosted man into space. Right here in Washington, the \nNational Air and Space Museum, National Space Society, and the \naerospace industry have put space right on Congress' doorstep.\n  ``International Space Day'' is an appropriate occasion to reflect on \nhow our exploration and utilization of space dramatically affects our \nday-to-day lives. It is especially timely this week, when the breakdown \nof the Galaxy Four satellite has wreaked havoc in our nation's \ntelecommunications sector. Many of us have constituents who were unable \nto listen to National Public Radio's reports on this week's floor \ndebate on comprehensive tobacco legislation. Thousands of Americans \nhave been inconvenienced because their pagers do not work. Doctors, \nbusinesses, television viewers and radio listeners--virtually everyone \nin our society--have been affected.\n  Relatively few Americans have had the opportunity to escape the \nEarth's atmosphere and gravity, but space affects all of us. Galaxy \nFour is just one example of how critical the utilization of space is to \nour economy. We are on the brink of a new frontier in commercial space \nactivity, with almost weekly launches of new communications satellites \nand the most competitive space launch market in decades.\n  In 1998, the Senate will have a unique opportunity to remove barriers \nthat impede U.S. companies in the exploration of this new frontier. \nU.S. Senator Connie Mack and I introduced the Commercial Space Act in \nthe Senate last fall and we hope to see it passed soon.\n  Mr. President, this is an exciting time to be discussing space issues \nin the U.S. Congress. At NASA's Kennedy Space Center--the nation's \npremiere launch base--the space shuttle continues to faithfully serve \nour manned space program. An international team of engineers and \nastronauts is assembling a new space station. In 1997 and early 1998, \nthe Mars Pathfinder blazed a four-wheel drive trail on the Red Planet \nand the launch of the Lunar Prospector marked our return to the moon. \nIn October, my colleague John Glenn of Ohio will return to space after \nthirty-seven years on Earth. VentureStar is under development as our \nnation's space vehicle of the future. And space tourism--featuring \nspace planes that operate from traditional airports--is becoming more \nand more of a likelihood.\n  I hope these developments inspire young Americans to develop the \nscience, math, and engineering expertise that our nation needs to \nmaintain its leadership in space. Congress should encourage efforts \nlike that of the U.S. Space Foundation's Mission Home, a program that \nbrings together space societies and aerospace companies to educate \ncommunities all over the nation about our exciting future in space.\n  Mr. President, Disneyland will rededicate its Tomorrowland on \nFriday--forty-three years after it first inspired young adventurers to \naim beyond the stratosphere. I will depend on all 100 members of this \nlegislative body to help make sure that the United States is actively \npreparing for its tommorowland by keeping our nation on the forefront \nof the exploration, utilization, and commercialization of space today. \nWorking together, we can ensure that every day is space day in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5351-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5351-S5352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH BIRTHDAY OF THE ISRAEL'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in 1948 when Israel was fighting \nits most costly war ever--the war for independence--Israel's future \nPrime Minister was told by the greatest military experts in the world \nthat his newly created State of 600,000 had no chance of surviving. \nNow, in 1998, Israel is celebrating its 50th year of independence.\n  I commend the Jewish Federation of the Scranton-Lackawanna community \nfor observing this historic occasion the weekend of May 1-3.\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\n  The State of Israel became a home for Jews after more than 6 million \nEuropean Jews were massacred during the Holocaust. Over the past 50 \nyears, Israel has acted as a refuge for thousands of Jews throughout \nthe world and integrated them into their society, while rebuilding a \nnation and creating an active democratic political system.\n  On May 17, I joined Mayor Edward Rendell and Israeli Consul General \nDaniel Ashbel in Philadelphia to celebrate Israel's 50th Independence \nDay birthday party. During the opening ceremonies, I thought of how \nIsrael is a land of wonderful contrast. It is both a nation of great \nhistory and a nation of great accomplishment. From the historical \nperspective, the events that have sprung forth from that land over the \ncenturies are overwhelming to even consider. No matter what religious \ntradition one might follow, the basic laws that went on to frame many \nof the tenants of our democratic form of government, and the rules of \nconduct in a civil society, came out of the land we have always called \nYis-ra-el.\n  Today, Israel has a growing economy, farms on land that were once \nclaimed by the deserts, and high-tech companies producing cutting edge \nproducts for our global marketplace. No other society in the course of \nhuman history can claim such progress in 50 short years. No other \nnation can claim to have risen to these heights from the horrors of the \nHolocaust. That is why Israel is so unique, so special, and so \ndeserving of our unyielding and unconditional support.\n  The United States has always maintained a relationship with Israel \nthat is based on mutual respect. America's commitment to Israel's \nsecurity undergirds the entire peace process and provides Israel the \nconfidence it needs to take very real risks for peace. I encourage the \nUnited States to continue to act in a respectable manner by not \nimposing a settlement on Israel that is contrary to its national \nsecurity interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5351-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    WE THE PEOPLE . . .

Mr. President, the Senate's Republican leadership \nis refusing to take action to end the judicial emergency in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  On March 25, the five continuing vacancies on the 13-member court \ncaused Chief Judge Ralph Winter to certify a Circuit emergency, to \nbegin canceling hearings and to take the unprecedented step of having \n3-judge panels convened that include only one Second Circuit judge. On \nApril 23, Chief Judge Winter was forced to issue additional emergency \norders. For two months and into the foreseeable future the Senate has \nneglected its responsibility to the people of the Second Circuit.\n  I have been urging favorable Senate action on the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit to fill a longstanding vacancy \nfor many months. That nomination remains stalled on the Senate \ncalendar. Two weeks ago the nomination of Chester J. Straub to the \nSecond Circuit was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. That \nnomination is now also on the Senate calendar awaiting action. Today, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee is favorably reporting two additional \nnominees to the Second Circuit, Judge Rosemary Pooler and Robert Sack. \nThat makes four nominees to the Second Circuit awaiting confirmation, \nfour nominees who can end the judicial vacancies crisis that plagues \nthe Second Circuit. But for the inaction of the Majority Leader in \ncalling for votes by the Senate on this qualified nominees, the crisis \ncould end this week. I, again, urge that action.\n  Before the last recess I introduced legislation calling upon the \nSenate to address this kind of judicial emergency before it takes \nanother extended recess. The Senate has pending before it four \noutstanding nominees to the Second Circuit whose confirmations would \nend this crisis.\n  Unfortunately Republican Senate leadership has not taken the judicial \nvacancies crisis seriously and has failed to take the concerted action \nneeded to end it. They continue to perpetuate vacancies in almost one \nin 10 federal judgeships.\n  With 11 nominees on the Senate calendar and 32 pending in Committee, \nwe could be making a difference if we would take our responsibilities \nto the federal courts seriously and devote the time necessary to \nconsider these nominations and confirm them. Instead, we are having \nhearings at a rate on one a month, barely keeping up with attrition and \nhardly making a dent in the vacancies crisis that the Chief Justice of \nthe United States has called the most serious problem confronting the \njudiciary.\n  By a vote of 16 to 2, the Judiciary Committee reported the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Senate. That was on March 5, 1998, over \ntwo months ago. No action has been taken or scheduled on that \nnomination and no explanation for the delay has been forthcoming. This \nis the oldest judicial nomination pending on the Senate Executive \nCalendar. In spite of an April 8 letter to the Senate Republican Leader \nsigned by all six Senators from the three States forming the Second \nCircuit urging prompt action, this nomination continues to be stalled \nby anonymous objections. Our bipartisan letter to the Majority Leader \nasked that he call up for prompt consideration by the Senate the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. That was over one month ago.\n\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York in \n1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton \nUniversity and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the \nNew York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney \nand was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is \nstrongly support by Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato.\n  She is a source of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic \nsupporters and to women. When confirmed she will be only the second \nwoman and second judge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on the Second \nCircuit.\n  Judge Rosemary Pooler was nominated back on November 6, 1997, as was \nRobert Sack, a partner in the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. They \nparticipated in a confirmation hearing on May 14 and were reported to \nthe Senate by the Judiciary Committee today.\n  Since May 7 the fourth pending nomination to the Second Circuit, that \nof Chester J. Straub, has also been on the\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\nSenate calendar. Mr. Straub is a partner in the law firm of Willkie \nFarr & Gallagher.\n  Judge Sotomayor, Judge Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester Straub can and \nshould all be confirmed to the Second Circuit before the Senate \nadjourns for its Memorial Day recess.\n  In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court warned that persisting vacancies would harm \nthe administration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court pointedly declared: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such \nhigh levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that \ntraditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.''\n  The people and businesses in the Second Circuit need additional \nfederal judges confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference \nof the United States recommends that in addition to the 5 vacancies, \nthe Second Circuit be allocated an additional 2 judgeships to handle \nits workload. The Second Circuit is suffering harm from Senate \ninaction. That is why the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit had to \ndeclare the Circuit in a state of emergency.\n  Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate \nfurther before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on \nthe nominees pending before it? I pray not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5352-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO EAST HIGH SCHOOL, FINALIST IN THE WE THE PEOPLE . . \n                   .

Their hard work was \nrewarded with an Honorable mention as one of the top ten finalists in \nthe competition.\n  I am always pleased when I have the opportunity to come to the Senate \nfloor to praise students that have taken an interest in their \ngovernment and their Constitution. By taking part in this competition, \nthe students of East High School have served to strengthen the \nfoundation of our democracy.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the participants, Daniel \nBerson, Lisa Bianco, Rosemary Blosser, Tristan Bridges, John Patrick \nCrum, Jessica Dismang, Belle Duggan, Sterling Ekwo, Heidi Gehret, Sarah \nGivens, Jamaal Harmon, Courtney Hopley, Scott Kronewitter, Melanie \nMcRae, Jennifer Newman, Gavin Rember, Jennifer Roche, Sarah Showalter, \nJessica Slenger, Lauren Strickland, Matthew Vellone, Feliz Ventura, \nMichaela Welch, and their teacher Ms. Deanna Morrison for doing such a \nfine job of representing Colorado.\n  I cannot overstate the achievements of these young people, they are \nsome of the best and brightest that America has to offer. I am proud to \nsay that I, along with all Coloradans, congratulate East High School on \na job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5353-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN MEN'S ICE HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniversity of Michigan hockey team on their 1998 NCAA Championship--The \nWolverines' second hockey title in three years.\n  On Saturday, April 4th, the Michigan hockey team defeated Boston \nCollege (3-2) in overtime for the championship. This is a remarkable \nachievement for a team which lost nine senior players from last year's \nteam, including the Hobey Baker trophy winner and 5 players who each \nscored 20 or more goals in the season. The 1997-98 Michigan team \nfeatured 10 freshmen, one of whom scored two goals in the final game, \nand another who scored the winning goal in overtime in the championship \ngame.\n  When the 1997-98 season started, it was expected to be a rebuilding \nyear for the Wolverines. The young team faced a difficult season \nagainst some of the toughest teams in the nation. Instead, the Michigan \nteam earned a 34-11-1 record, seizing every chance to display their \nathleticism, sportsmanship, teamwork, and perseverance.\n  The University of Michigan ice hockey players have always been among \nthe ``leaders and best.'' As the Wolverines celebrate this year's \nvictory, they also commemorate the anniversary of their first NCAA \ntitle fifty years ago, when the tournament began. In the last 50 years, \nthe Wolverines have brought nine championship titles back to Ann Arbor, \nmaking them the winningest team in NCAA men's ice hockey history.\n  The ``Victors'' are indebted to the strong leadership they have from \nHead Coach Red Berenson and players, Captain Matt Herr and Assistant \nCaptains Bill Muckalt and Marty Turco. These three seniors, along with \nChris Fox and Gregg Malicke, advanced to the Final Four four seasons in \na row. In addition, senior Bill Muckalt was named a Hobey Baker award \ncandidate and All-American player, and senior goaltender Marty Turco \nfinished his college career with one of the most impressive records in \ncollege hockey. The goalie's four years at Michigan gave him a record \nof 127 career victories and nine victories in NCAA elimination games, \nmaking him the winningest goaltender in NCAA tournament history. Turco \nwas also selected most valuable player in the Final Four after stopping \n28 shots in the championship game.\n  I extend my best wishes to the University of Michigan Men's Ice \nHockey Team on a tremendous season and the 1998 NCAA Championship--Go \nBlue!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5353-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5353-S5354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf \nof a charitable contribution worthy of note. Lymphatic filariasis is a \nterrible disease that our citizens are not likely to see here in the \nUnited States, but it is one of the World's most disabling and \ndisfiguring diseases. It affects people in 73 countries, mainly in \ntropical and subtropical areas of India, Africa, Asia and South \nAmerica.\n  The disease is caused by a parasite, carried by mosquitoes. Efforts \nto eliminate mosquitoes have not been successful in these regions, and \nthe result is an endless cycle of infection for human hosts.\n  The World Health Organization has embarked on a campaign to stop this \ndread disease. Lymphatic filariasis infects 76 million people world \nwide. The parasitic worms, often only the size of a thread, live in \nhumans by lodging in the lymphatic system. They live for up to six \nyears, producing millions of microscopic larvae that circulate in the \nblood. When symptoms appear, they can be devastating. Kidney damage and \npainful swelling of the extremities are typical examples of the \nsuffering endured by these victims.\n  The best previous defense against this disease was the administration \nof a single dose of two drugs, diethlycarbamazine of DEC and \nivermectin. But when these drugs are administered at the same time with \nanother drug, albendazole, the treatment is much more effective. \nAlbendazole additionally kills hookworm, a very severe problem, \nespecially in Africa.\n  Earlier this year, the World Health Organization's Division of \nTropical Diseases announced a program to eliminate lymphatic \nfilariasis. The cornerstone of this eradication program rests on the \nmost generous charitable contribution in history. SmithKline Beecham, \none of the world's leading healthcare companies, announced that they \nwill provide their drug albendazole free of charge for the WHO effort. \nIn addition to the drug donation, they are providing significant \nfinancial support to WHO to help implement the eradication program.\n  Yesterday, SmithKline Beecham testified before the House Committee on \nInternational Relations during a hearing on the Eradication and \nElimination of Six Infectious Diseases. Dr. David Heymann, WHO's \nDirector of Emerging and Communicable Diseases was also testifying. Dr. \nHeymann has been a great resource and help to me as I've learned about \nthe growing problem of global viral and bacterial epidemics.\n  The hearing was worth noting, because it featured the contributions \nof many in the private sector to eradicate disease. Rotary \nInternational has made great progress in their effort to eliminate \npolio around the world. Merck & Co. has very generously, provided their \ndrug Mectizan for the control of River Blindness, another filarial \nparasitic disease.\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n  Another tireless worker on behalf of World Health, and someone who \nplayed a major role in both the Merck and SmithKline Beecham donations, \nis former President Jimmy Carter. He deserves our thanks and \nrecognition for his efforts.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who may not have been aware of \nyesterday's hearing, I'd like to submit for the Record the statement \nprovided by Dr. Brian Bagnall, the Program Director for Lymphatic \nFilariasis for SmithKline Beecham. They are to be congratulated for \ntheir generosity and committment to world health.\n  The statement follows:\n\n        Testimony of Brian Bagnall, Ph.D, for SmithKline Beecham\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       My name is Dr. Brian Bagnall and I am the Program Director \n     for Lymphatic Filariasis at SmithKline Beecham. The company \n     is one of the world's leading healthcare corporations. We \n     market pharmaceuticals, vaccines, overt-the-counter \n     medicines, and health-related consumer products. We have \n     54,000 employees worldwide, 22,000 of them in the U.S.\n\n\n                     What is Lymphatic Filariasis?\n\n       The most eloquent answer I can provide is to show you the \n     following two-minute videotape which includes some comments \n     made by President Carter at a recent company meeting. (Shows \n     video--see appendix for text).\n\n\n     Dramatic Progress Achieved on Lymphatic Filariasis Eradication\n\n       The dreadful disease you just saw on the video is now \n     entirely preventable. SmithKline Beecham is committed to \n     doing whatever it takes to help rid the world of it.\n       SmithKline Beecham announced an agreement this past January \n     with the World Health Organization, through its Division of \n     Control of Tropical Diseases, to collaborate on a global \n     program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. This program was \n     established after much of the GAO report was drafted. So I'm \n     happy to be able to provide an update on our joint program. \n     It's a massive undertaking to attack the world's most \n     disabling and disfiguring tropical disease.\n       The necessary tools and strategies of diagnosing and \n     treating this parasitic worm infection have been developed \n     only recently. They have proven so effective that we can now \n     envision worldwide eradication of lymphatic filariasis by the \n     year 2020. Please note that this target date is ten years \n     sooner than the previous estimated date of 2030 which was \n     mentioned by WHO in March 1997 in their submission for the \n     GAO report. There has obviously been exceptional progress. \n     The aim is to treat people living in at-risk areas with two \n     antiparasitic drugs just once a year for four to six years.\n       One of the drugs will be albendazole, donated free of \n     charge by SmithKline Beecham. We are planning to produce \n     about 5 billion treatments to be used in the 73 target \n     countries over the next 15 of so years. In addition to the \n     drug donation, we will support the WHO efforts with financial \n     support, management expertise and education and training \n     help.\n       Together with WHO, we are currently in the planning and \n     organizing phase of the program. We hope to begin shipping \n     the first drug donations in the next 6 months to national \n     Ministries of Health which have submitted elimination plans \n     to WHO.\n\n\n           breaking the transmission of lymphatic filariasis\n\n       The treatment program I have described, devised by WHO with \n     the scientific and tropical medicine community, has a special \n     mission--breaking the transmission of lymphatic filariasis. \n     It is a truly preventive public health program aimed \n     particularly at children and young adults who are infected \n     with the parasite but who have not yet developed the long-\n     term effects of the disease.\n       The children usually show no symptoms whatsoever. I might \n     add that there is an additional and important benefit of the \n     program for children and women of childbearing age--the drugs \n     used will significantly reduce concurrent intestinal worm \n     infections, such as hookworm, which cause anemia, stunt \n     growth and inhibit intellectual development.\n       This strategic drug treatment program does not itself \n     reverse the clinical damage of elephantiasis which results \n     from decades of infection. Such disabled individuals will, \n     nonetheless, benefit from an effective parallel program being \n     recommended by WHO which focuses on skin hygiene and wound \n     prevention.\n       In some respects, lymphatic filariasis can be compared to \n     AIDS and HIV. Both diseases have a long latent period with \n     years of symptomless infection which can then be transmitted \n     to others. Both are now being treated with multiple drug \n     therapy.\n\n\n              private sector partnerships for the future.\n\n       I have said that SmithKline Beecham will do whatever it \n     takes to help rid the world of this simply dreadful and now \n     wholly preventable disease. But large organizations such as \n     WHO and SmithKline Beecham, even with support from the likes \n     of the World Bank, cannot do this alone. We are actively \n     seeking to build a Coalition of Partners for Lymphatic \n     Filariasis Elimination from the public, private and non-\n     profit sectors which make up the worldwide community of \n     public health resources for the developing world.\n       We also recognize the generous contribution Merck & Co. \n     have made in the past 10 years with their Mectizan Donation \n     Program for control of River Blindness, another filarial \n     parasite disease. We are keeping in close touch with them and \n     hope to work together in the future as part of a growing \n     private sector coalition to fight tropical diseases.\n       Over the past few months we have been encouraged by the \n     messages of support we have received since our program was \n     announced, including many of your colleagues from the House \n     and Senate. We, together with WHO, want to hear from anyone \n     who wants to join the campaign. We particularly seek partners \n     from other corporations who can help make a major difference \n     by donating their expertise in transportation and shipping, \n     information management, community treatment programs or the \n     provision of other essential drugs. We will gladly speak with \n     others from within the public and private sector about \n     joining us in this cause. And we seek and encourage \n     governments from the developed world to help as well.\n       Mr. Chairman, we applaud you and the Committee for holding \n     this hearing because it will sound a clear call for action by \n     both the public and private sectors to unite in eradication \n     of these seven terrible diseases.\n       I would like to conclude by saying that the lymphatic \n     filariasis elimination program complements SmithKline \n     Beecham's much broader approach to improve health. It is our \n     aim, through our products, services and community partnership \n     programs, to enrich the health of everyone in the world. Our \n     collaboration with the World Health Organization allows us to \n     directly improve the health of at least one-fifth of the \n     earth's population and this program will spearhead our \n     healthcare focus within global communities into the new \n     millennium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5353-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5354-S5355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              RANDOM HOUSE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, some while ago it was announced \nthat the German publishing firm of Bertelsmann had purchased Random \nHouse, the legendary New York publisher founded in the 1920s by Bennett \nCerf and Donald Klopfer. The brilliance of the authors published over \nthe years was exceeded only by that of the young editors that gave \ntheir works such superb attention. One of these was Jason Epstein. It \nwas my great fortune to have him as an editor of three books which \nRandom House published--``Coping: On the Practice of Government,'' \n``The Politics of A Guaranteed Income,'' and, with Frederick Mosteller, \n``On the Equality of Educational Opportunity.'' These were wonderfully \nproduced, no less wonderfully edited--500 or more pages each. \nThereafter, they were marketed with what I can only think of as loving \ncare. The subjects were anything but reader friendly, as you might say, \nbut Random House was author friendly and American letters are \nprofoundly in its debt. Recently, in the April 6 issue of the New \nYorker, The Talk of the Town began with a wonderful reminiscence by \nJason Epstein of his early years at Random House. I ask that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                  [From the New Yorker, Apr. 6, 1998]\n\n                           (By Jason Epstein)\n\n    Ink--Can the Bertelsmann Deal Take Publishing Back to Its Roots?\n\n       On the morning last week that the purchase of Random House \n     by Bertelsmann was announced, I happened to pass the office \n     of my colleague Bob Loomis and noticed the framed copy of the \n     Random House interoffice phone directory for 1958 that Bob \n     keeps on his bookshelf. The directory is about the size of a \n     postal card and lists some ninety names, including Bob's and \n     mine along with those of Bennett Cerf and his partner Donald \n     Klopfer, the founders of Random House, whose offices were \n     then on the parlor floor of the old Villard mansion, on \n     Madison and Fiftieth. We occupied the north wing. The \n     Archdiocese owned the central portion, which is now the \n     entrance of the Palace Hotel, as well as the south wing, \n     which now houses Le Cirque 2000.\n       Loomis and I joined Random House in the late nineteen-\n     fifties. Though we took our publishing responsibilities \n     seriously, we did not think of ourselves as businessmen but \n     as caretakers of a tradition, like London tailors or \n     collectors of Chinese porcelain. Bennett Cerf set the tone, \n     and it was his habit to run from office to office sharing the \n     jokes he had just heard over the phone from his Hollywood \n     friends. Several times a day Bennett interrupted meetings \n     between editors and authors in this fashion. Some authors \n     were delighted. But I remember an afternoon when a baffled \n     W.H. Auden asked if we could finish our conversation at \n     Schrafft's across the street. This was, I believe, the last \n     time he set foot in the Random House offices.\n       For me in those years, book publishing seemed more a sport \n     than a business--a sport that required skill and strict \n     attention to the rules, especially the rule that we had to \n     make enough money to stay in the game. But if we wanted to \n     make real money in a real business we knew that we should \n     forget about afternoons with Auden, Faulkner, and Dr. Seuss \n     and go down to Wall Street. But\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\n     this was unthinkable. It was always a pleasure when one of \n     our books became a best-seller, but what counted more was a \n     book that promised to become a permanent part of the culture. \n     Random House published many books that became both.\n       The editor's job was different then from what it is now. \n     Now layer upon layer of marketing specialists, sales \n     executives, and business managers separate the editor from \n     the bookseller. At the Villard mansion, we made these \n     publishing decisions ourselves. For years, I would begin my \n     day in the mailroom opening orders from booksellers, so that \n     I had the feel of the marketplace literally at my fingertips.\n       That time was magical and we never expected it to end, even \n     after Bennett and Donald took the company public, acquired \n     Knopf, and, in 1966, sold out to RCA. By the mid-seventies \n     the publishing industry had changed profoundly. The old \n     downtown neighborhoods where booksellers had once rented \n     inexpensive space and knew their customers by name had \n     largely vanished. Readers now bought their books in mall \n     chain stores. The bookseller in Pittsburgh or Portland whom \n     Loomis or I might once have called to recommend a first novel \n     had been out of business for years. Publishers now spoke to \n     their customers through marketing specialists doing their \n     best to fit the increasingly undifferentiated product \n     supplied by the editors into the still less differentiated \n     slots provided by the retail chains. Many worthy titles \n     couldn't be fitted to these new circumstances at all and \n     disappeared. In recent years the mall shops specializing in \n     best-sellers have been largely replaced by so-called \n     superstores, with much larger inventories of books. But the \n     link between writer and marketplace which had once been the \n     editor's function has all but vanished.\n       The Random House phone book is now the size of a small city \n     directory. Loomis and I are still listed, but after forty \n     years nearly everything else about book publishing has \n     changed. What had been a craft is now an irrational accretion \n     of improvisational adjustments to historic accidents, a \n     largely fossilized organism that can no longer be \n     deconstructed. Its future depends on how well its remaining \n     energies can be directed toward new technological \n     possibilities.\n       I am delighted to say that these possibilities already \n     exist. The widespread distribution of printed books via the \n     Internet is a reality a mere two and a half years after the \n     appearance of Amazon.com. The eventual shape of Internet \n     bookselling is not yet fully evident, but it is evident \n     enough to foreshadow a much more direct--and economical--link \n     between writer and reader than has existed in modern times. \n     The choice of a career in book publishing may seem bleak at \n     the moment, but if I were starting out today I might give it \n     a try. To publish a book that may make the world a little \n     more intelligible or decent can be almost as satisfying as \n     writing one. And soon it might just be possible to carry on \n     this work with even greater confidence than Loomis and I \n     shared forty years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5354-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING JOHN E. CORRIGAN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has \nworked tirelessly throughout his career to create economic \nopportunities in the northeastern region of this country: John E. \nCorrigan. Known by his friends as Jack, Mr. Corrigan has served for 23 \nyears as Regional Director of the U.S. Commerce Department's Economic \nDevelopment Administration. On Tuesday, May 26, 1998, in my home state \nof Connecticut, friends, family and admirers of this remarkable man \nwill gather to celebrate his retirement after nearly three decades of \nservice to his country as a public official. This celebration, \nsponsored by the Connecticut chapter of the Northeastern Economic \nDevelopment Association, will be a fitting tribute to an outstanding \npublic servant.\n  Jack Corrigan makes things happen. Throughout his career with the \nEDA, he worked to make dreams a reality. His success is evident across \nthe Northeast where he contributed to the creation of thousands of jobs \nand economic opportunities during his career. Indeed, Mr. Corrigan \nbrought new meaning to the term economic development. He looked not \nonly at specific applications, but enjoyed the foresight and vision to \nappreciate the domino effect which federal assistance could have on \nentire towns, cities, and regions.\n  As Regional Director of the EDA, Jack Corrigan administered a multi-\nmillion dollar grant program. These resources were allocated throughout \nthe region under his watchful eye, always ensuring that the money would \nprovide an economic stimulus for many individuals and businesses. \nJack's gentle style, measured approach, and good judgement helped many \npeople to turn their dreams into reality.\n  In addition to his service as Regional Director, Jack spent three \nyears as Director of the Office of Civil Rights for the EDA. In this \nposition, he distinguished himself as an effective advocate for civil \nrights and received the silver medal of the Department of Commerce for \nhis outstanding performance in this field.\n  From 1982 to 1985, Mr. Corrigan took a temporary reprieve from his \nRegional Director post to serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nOperations of the EDA. In this position, he was responsible for the \nagency's grant program and for coordinating the related activities of \nthe agency's six regional offices.\n  Jack Corrigan will be deeply missed at the Economic Development \nAdministration and throughout the northeast. His legacy, however, will \ncontinue as his exemplary public service is remembered and revered for \nyears to come. I applaud the lifetime achievements of a special man and \nwish him continued success in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5355-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5355-S5356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, on May 13, 1998, the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee unanimously supported Bill Ivey's nomination to be \nthe Chairman of the National Endowment\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\nfor the Arts (NEA). As a member of this committee, and as a Tennessean, \nI believe Bill Ivey will bring a much needed, new voice to this agency.\n  Many people in my home State have viewed the NEA as an elitist \nagency. Bill Ivey brings a new vision with a perspective of the real \nworld. In fact, a newspaper in Tennessee noted that the ``Country Music \nFoundation director would provide `Heart of America' leadership.''\n  Bill Ivey has been the Director of the Country Music Foundation in \nNashville, Tennessee since 1971. He has played an integral role in the \nNashville music community. He has taught at Vanderbilt University's \nBlair School of Music and has written a variety of essays on America's \nmusical traditions.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts has come under increased scrutiny \nin recent years. Both the American people and Congress have questioned \nits stewardship of the taxpayers' dollar. Through committee work and \nthe appropriations process, many innovative reform options have been \nconsidered, but few have been adopted. Bill Ivey offers the prospect of \na fresh start for the National Endowment for the Arts so that all \nAmericans will have pride and a stake in its activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5355-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 73\n\n         \n       Whereas on a level playing field, United States producers \n     are the most competitive suppliers of agricultural products \n     in the world;\n       Whereas increased United States agricultural exports are \n     critical to the future of the farm, rural, and overall \n     economy of the United States;\n       Whereas the opportunities for increased agricultural \n     exports are undermined by the unfair subsidies provided by \n     trading partners of the United States, and by various tariff \n     and nontariff trade barriers imposed on highly-competitive \n     United States agricultural products;\n       Whereas United States agricultural exports reached a \n     record-level $60,000,000,000 in 1996 compared to a total \n     United States merchandise trade deficit of $170,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the United States is currently engaged in a number \n     of outstanding trade disputes with the European Union \n     regarding agriculture matters and the disputes involve the \n     most intractable issues between the United States and the \n     European Union;\n       Whereas the outstanding trade disputes include the failure \n     to finalize a veterinary equivalency program, which \n     jeopardizes an estimated $3,000,000,000 in trade in livestock \n     products between the United States and the European Union;\n       Whereas the World Trade Organization has ruled that the \n     European Union must allow the importation of beef with growth \n     hormones produced in the United States;\n       Whereas the European Union has yet to fulfill its \n     commitment under the Agreement on Application of Sanitary and \n     Phytosanitary Measures reached as part of the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;\n       Whereas the European Union has promulgated regulations \n     regarding the use of ``specified risk materials'' for \n     livestock products which have a disputed scientific basis and \n     which serve to impede the importation of United States \n     livestock products despite the fact that no cases of bovine \n     spongisorm encephalopathy (mad cow disease) have been \n     documented in the United States;\n       Whereas the European Union has hindered trade in products \n     grown with the benefit of biogenetics based on claims that \n     also have a disputed scientific basis;\n       Whereas these barriers to biogenetic trade could have a \n     profound negative impact on agricultural trade in the long \n     run; and\n       Whereas there are also continuing disputes regarding \n     European Union subsidies for dairy, wheat gluten, and canned \n     fruits: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the European Union unfairly restricts the importation \n     of United States agricultural products;\n       (2) the restrictions imposed on United States agricultural \n     exports to the European Union are the most vexing problems \n     facing United States exporters in Europe;\n       (3) the elimination of restrictions imposed on United \n     States agricultural exports should be a top priority of any \n     current or future trade negotiations between the United \n     States and the European Union; and\n       (4) the United States Trade Representative should not \n     engage in any trade negotiations with the European Union that \n     undermines the ability of the United States to achieve the \n     elimination of unfair restrictions imposed upon United States \n     agricultural exports to the European Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5356-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5356-S5357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EXPRESSING SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING EUROPEAN UNION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Res. 232\n\n         \n       Whereas, in an unprecedented sale, the European Union \n     entered into a contract with a United States buyer to sell \n     heavily subsidized European barley to the United States;\n       Whereas the sale of almost 1,400,000 bushels (30,000 metric \n     tons) of feed barley was shipped from Finland to Stockton, \n     California;\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\n       Whereas news of the sale depressed feed barley prices in \n     the California feed barley market;\n       Whereas, since the market sets national pricing patterns \n     for both feed and malting barley, the sale would mean \n     enormous market losses for barley producers throughout the \n     United States, at a time when the United States barley \n     producers are already suffering from low prices;\n       Whereas the European restitution subsidies for this barley \n     amounts to $1.11 per bushel ($51 per metric ton);\n       Whereas the price-depressing effects of this one sale will \n     continue to adversely affect market prices for at least a 9-\n     month period as this grain moves through the United States \n     marketing system;\n       Whereas this shipment is part of about 2.1 million metric \n     tons of European feed barley that have been approved for \n     restitution subsidies by the European Union this year;\n       Whereas the availability of the additional subsidized \n     European barley in the international market not only \n     artificially depressed market prices, but also threatens to \n     open new import channels into the United States;\n       Whereas, as the world's largest feed grain producer and the \n     world's largest exporter of feed grains, the United States \n     does not require imported feed grains;\n       Whereas, at the same time that subsidized European barley \n     is being imported into the United States, some United States \n     feed grains are prevented from entering European markets \n     under European Union food regulations;\n       Whereas United States barley growers continue to suffer the \n     negative impacts of the sale, regardless of whether the \n     subsidized European barley was originally targeted for sale \n     into the United States and whether the subsidies comply with \n     the letter of current World Trade Organization export subsidy \n     rules; and\n       Whereas the sale not only undermines the intent and the \n     spirit of free trade agreements and negotiations, it also \n     moves away from the goals of level playing fields and \n     fairness in trade relationships: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF SENATE ON EXPORT OF EUROPEAN BARLEY TO \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       It is sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the European Union should--\n       (A) take immediate steps to waive the penalty for failure \n     to use restitution subsidies for barley exported to the \n     United States; and\n       (B) establish procedures to ensure that restitution and \n     other subsidies are not used for sales of agricultural \n     commodities to the United States or other countries of North \n     America;\n       (2) the President of the United States, the United States \n     Trade Representative, and the Secretary of Agriculture should \n     immediately consult with the European Union regarding the \n     sale of European feed barley to the United States in order to \n     avoid any future sale of any European barley to the United \n     States that is based on restitution or other subsidies; and\n       (3) not later than 60 days after approval of this \n     resolution, the United States Trade Representative and the \n     Secretary of Agriculture should report to Congress on--\n       (A) the terms and conditions of the sale of European barley \n     to the United States;\n       (B) the results of the consultations under paragraph (2);\n       (C) other steps that are being taken or will be taken to \n     address to such situations in the future; and\n       (D) any additional authorities that may be necessary to \n     carry out subparagraphs (B) and (C).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/21/senate-section/article/S5356-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-46\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.
