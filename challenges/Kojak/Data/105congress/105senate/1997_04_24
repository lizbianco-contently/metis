For the information of all Senators, today, at 10:30 a.m., \nthe Senate will begin a closed executive session in the Old Senate \nChamber to continue the debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention so \nthat Members can be briefed on certain classified information. This is \nthe first time in several years that we have had such a briefing. I \nurge all Senators to attend. I think they will find it very \ninteresting. They need to know what will come out of this briefing \nbefore they make a final decision.\n  The closed session is expected to last until approximately 12:30. \nAfter the expiration of time for the closed session, the Senate will \nthen immediately resume consideration of the treaty in this Chamber. By \nprevious consent, the Senate will continue the debate with respect to \nthe treaty until all time is expired or is yielded back under the time \nagreement. I think there is something like 1 hour 40 minutes or 2 hours \nof general time remaining, something about that amount.\n  In addition, by consent, the five motions to strike will be in order \nat any time following the closed session. Separate votes on each of the \nmotions are expected. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout \nthe day and into the evening in order for the Senate to complete action \non the treaty today. It would appear to me that the final vote will \ncome sometime between 8 and 9 o'clock probably, perhaps a little \nearlier, but that is the way it looks at this point.\n  Again, I encourage all Members to participate in this important \ndebate beginning in a few minutes in the Old Senate Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3567-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

We are \nkind of tight on time. Then, in accordance with the unanimous-consent \nrequest by the majority leader, I will yield 7 minutes of my time to \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico, [Mr. Bingaman].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  Mr. President, it was 30 years ago this week that I joined the U.S. \nArmy. It was 29 years ago this week, with my brother Tom, that I was \nfirst wounded in Vietnam. This is an important week of reflection for \nme as we take up the final hours of debate on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  I rise this morning to say that I will vote for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. America's national security interests are better served \nwith this treaty than without it. Our men and women in uniform are \nbetter served with this treaty than without it.\n  There are few Senators who have put as much time in on this issue \nthan I have, studying this treaty over the past few weeks. As a \nfreshman Senator, I began with very limited knowledge about this \nconvention. I had to understand it totally before I could make an \nintelligent vote on the treaty.\n  This treaty is much improved from the form in which it was first \nsubmitted to the Senate. I would have voted against this treaty in its \noriginal form.\n  But as the Framers of our Constitution intended, the Senate has \nworked its will and has substantially strengthened the final agreement. \nBecause of the strong leadership and negotiation, in my judgment, the \nbalance has tipped strongly in favor of ratification of this \nconvention.\n  The people of this country should recognize the important roles that \nMajority Leader Lott, Chairman Helms, and Senators Biden, Lugar, and \nKyl played in this debate. They allowed the Senate the opportunity to \nlisten, to learn, and to understand this treaty, to debate this treaty, \nand they have brought a more informed Senate together to vote on this \ntreaty as we will throughout the day.\n  That is what this body, the Senate, should be about, debating \nimportant issues that have consequences for all Americans. This \nconvention will have consequences for all peoples around the globe.\n  Under the leadership of Majority Leader Lott, Senator Biden, the \nadministration, and others, the Senate made 28 substantial changes to \nthe original treaty to address major problems in the treaty, several of \nwhich were key to improving it, in my opinion. The majority leader held \na news conference 45 minutes ago and read a letter from the President--\nas far as I know, unprecedented in arms control conventions--laying out \nsome of the concerns that this President has and this body has about \nissues in this convention. I think that, too, further strengthens this \ntreaty.\n  We fully protected the constitutional rights of our businesses \nagainst unlawful searches and seizures by ensuring that international \ninspection teams must obtain a search warrant before entering any \nAmerican facility. This means no challenge inspection will occur unless \na U.S. Federal judge finds probable cause to believe a violation of law \nhas occurred at that facility. The rights guaranteed under our \nConstitution will continue to reign supreme.\n  We ensured that the American military will be able to use nondeadly \nriot control agents, such as tear gas. As military operations become \nincreasingly complex and involve more areas with civilian populations, \nit is imperative that our military commanders have the maximum \nflexibility to employ a range of force, including nondeadly force.\n  We made clear that our existing national and international export \ncontrols will remain in place. The United States simply will not \ntransfer chemical technology in any manner that would weaken our \nexisting controls or military defense capabilities, or would tend to \nallow dangerous chemical technology to fall into the hands of pariah \nregimes.\n  We put in place safeguards to ensure that American intelligence data \nis protected whenever it is shared with the international organization \nthat will oversee operations of the convention. We also prohibited \nchemical samples taken at American laboratories from being transferred \noff American soil--an important provision that helps protect \nproprietary and security information.\n  And, we took steps to ensure that the new international organization \nset up to monitor and enforce the convention will not become an ill-\nmanaged bureaucracy that burdens the American taxpayer. We put a cap on \nthe American contribution to that organization, and we required the \norganization to establish and maintain an independent inspector \ngeneral.\n  I should like to close with this. As I have referenced, there are a \nnumber of improvements that have been made to this treaty. We have five \nmore proposed conditions that remain in disagreement that we will vote \non yet today. I will vote to strike at least four of those conditions \nbecause they would effectively prevent American participation in the \nconvention and would undermine the very purpose of this treaty.\n  This treaty, however, is no magic instrument that will guarantee \nAmericans and our troops safety from chemical attack. No treaty can \nsubstitute for unwavering American strength, determination, vigilance, \nand leadership. But this treaty is one more tool we can use to make \nchemical attacks less likely. It does improve our eyes.\n  With or without this treaty, the United States years ago decided \nnever again to use chemical weapons and is committed by law to \ncompletely destroy our stockpile of chemical weapons by early in the \nnext century. That decision was made during the Reagan administration \nand was reaffirmed by the Bush administration.\n  The important question now is, what can we do to give ourselves more \nleverage to press other countries to do the same? It is a very \nimportant question. Ratifying this treaty is not the end of our efforts \nto make chemical attacks on Americans less likely. To the contrary, it \nis only the beginning. As President Reagan's top arms control \nnegotiator, Ronald Lehman, said last week before our Foreign Relations \nCommittee:\n\n       Ratification is essential to American leadership against \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but \n     ratification alone is not enough. Strong follow-up involving \n     all branches of Government will be vital.\n\n  We must now use the tools of this treaty effectively. The treaty \ntools give us, I believe, the most effective way to deal with the \nproliferation of chemical weapons. We must keep America strong. We must \nkeep America vigilant. The Senate has an important and ongoing role to \nplay in making sure this treaty is implemented properly, and I am \ncommitted as a Senator to making that happen.\n  For me, this has never been a political issue, Mr. President. This \nvote is not about Republicans. It is not about Democrats. It is not \nabout conservatives, not about liberals. It is not\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\nabout Bill Clinton. It is not about Trent Lott. This vote is about \nAmerica's national security interests. It is about our young men and \nwomen in uniform all over the world who may someday face an adversary \nwith chemical weapons. It is about each Senator doing what he or she \nthinks is in the best interests of our country.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote for \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Before the Senator yields back all his time, if he will \nyield to me for a comment.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am obviously very pleased with the \ndecision the Senator from Nebraska made, but I want to state on the \nrecord that I would have been comfortable with whatever decision he \nmade, and I say that for the following reasons. I have been here for 24 \nyears. It has been a long time since I have been a freshman Senator, \nbut I remember how overwhelming it was and the pressures that are \nexerted, legitimate pressures, when major issues confront someone. I \nhave watched the Senator from Nebraska from the day he got here, \nbecause we serve on the same committee, attack with a seriousness of \npurpose I have seldom seen one of the most complicated issues that is \ngoing to come before this body this year. It was not merely determining \nwhat groups, what party, what factions of parties were for and against \nthe treaty. He wanted to know what article X meant in the language. He \nwanted to know whether article I trumped article X. He wanted to know \nthe details of it, and he addressed it.\n\n  He indicated that this is the eve of an anniversary. It seems \nappropriate and totally consistent, I am going to say for the record--I \nhope I do not embarrass him--what I said to him privately. I have also \nobserved another feature about him. This is a man whose conduct on the \nbattlefield is mirrored by his conduct in politics, in that when he \nthinks he is right he is not afraid to do whatever it is he thinks he \nshould do. And that comes through. That is what I mean when I say I \nwould have been comfortable and assured that he had given it every \nconsideration had he concluded to vote the other way. I want to \npublicly compliment him, not for the decision he made, but the way he \nmade the decision. I hope that does not cost him politically, for \nsomeone on this side of the aisle to compliment my colleague.\n  There is another freshman Senator I serve with, Senator Gordon Smith, \nwho may not come to the same conclusion, but he has addressed it with \nthe same kind of alacrity and commitment. So I just say it is a \npleasure to serve with the Senator and our colleague, Senator Smith. \nBut as I said, I am happy he came out the way he did. Regardless of how \nthe Senator came out, I would have been comfortable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I thank the manager of the bill, the Senator from Delaware, for \nyielding me time.\n  I also commend my colleague from Nebraska. I sat through a meeting \nwith him and the Senator from Delaware at the White House where he \nasked some very penetrating questions. The President and the Vice \nPresident were there. The Secretary of State was there. Our Ambassador \nto the United Nations and a great many individuals who studied this \ntreaty were there. And I am very pleased to see the decision that our \ncolleague from Nebraska has made.\n  Mr. President, a point that was made by the Senator from Nebraska I \nthink needs to be foremost in our minds, and that is that this is \ndifferent from all other treaties that have come before the Senate \nsince I have been here, in that this does not ask us to give up any \nmilitary capability that we have not already decided to give up.\n  Most treaties involve an agreement by us to give up military \ncapability in return for other nations giving up military capability. \nBut we have decided unilaterally during the Reagan administration and \nhave maintained the policy ever since then that we are going to \nrenounce the use of chemical weapons, destroy our stockpile of chemical \nweapons. What this treaty does is try to find ways to bring other \nnations to that same decision.\n  President Reagan did commit to that in the 1980's. President Bush \nreiterated that position. President Clinton has certainly done so as \nwell. That is a central part of this discussion that needs to be kept \nin mind.\n  A second part of the discussion that needs to be kept in mind is that \nby going ahead and ratifying this treaty, we give up no other tools \nthat we have to prevent chemical attack or to retaliate against someone \nwho might begin a chemical attack.\n  This is not: Do you want to have the ability to retaliate, or, on the \ncontrary, do you want the treaty? We are going to retain in the future \nall capabilities to retaliate which we presently have. We stated very \ndefinitively in one of the conditions that is attached to this treaty \nthat we will use a massive force to respond to any chemical attack. We \ndo not consider a chemical weapons attack by a potential adversary or \nadversary to be comparable to a conventional attack; therefore, people \nneed to know that we are not giving up any of our abilities or resolve \nin that regard.\n  I think these two factors are persuasive. We have chosen to destroy \nour own chemical weapons anyway, whether this treaty goes into effect \nor not. And, second, we maintain the ability to retaliate against any \nchemical weapons attack with all the strength that we have today.\n  So what does the treaty buy us?\n  It buys us an international agreement with other nations that will, \nhopefully, bring them also to give up their chemical weapons \nstockpiles. And it puts in place mechanisms to ensure that they do \nthat.\n  It buys us a guarantee that other nations which might have chosen to \nbuild chemical weapons will find it much more difficult to do so.\n  It buys us a likelihood that if anyone decides to cheat on the \ntreaty, we will have the ability to detect that. It enhances our \nintelligence-gathering capability substantially. As the Director of the \nCIA testified--he said this treaty gives us tools that we do not now \nhave to look into places where we cannot now look.\n  There have been some concerns raised. I will not go into those. I \nthink they have been addressed extensively in the various conditions \nthat have already been added to the treaty.\n  Let me just say a few words about the amendments that are being \nproposed.\n  The first amendment calls for us to withhold ratification until the \nRussian Duma agrees to the ratification and agrees to comply with an \nearlier statement about the destruction of chemical weapons.\n  Mr. President, what this does is essentially make our foreign policy \nand our national policy hostage to what the hard-liners in the Russian \nDuma decide to do. It gives the Russians an excuse for not ratifying \nthe treaty if we do not. I think it would be contrary to our best \ninterests.\n  A second amendment that will be offered, which I will oppose--or \nsecond effort to strike that I will support, deals with an amendment \nthat would destroy the potential benefits of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. It would require us to withhold ratification until various \nother countries, such as China, North Korea, Libya, and others, have \nratified the treaty.\n  Again, this provision would essentially shift to others the ability \nto define what is in our own best national interest. That cannot be a \ngood thing for the United States.\n  A third amendment deals with requiring us to reject inspectors from \ncountries that have supported terrorism.\n  Mr. President, we have the ability under the treaty to reject any \ninspectors we do not want to permit to come into this country and \ninspect. But it does not serve our interest to require, put into law a \nrequirement, that certain inspectors be rejected at this early stage \nbecause, clearly, that will give them the same ability to reject our \ninspectors. That is not in our best interest.\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\n  We will have the ability to decide any information that we will \nexchange with other countries. That has been a confusion about this \ntreaty, Mr. President, that needs to be cleared up.\n  When all the debate is concluded at the end of the day today, I \nbelieve it serves our national interest to go ahead and ratify the \ntreaty. I believe it will contribute to a more peaceful world. Like all \ntreaties, it lacks perfection. But the acid test is: Will this \ngeneration of Americans and future generations of Americans be less \nlikely to confront chemical weapons on the battlefield or in a civilian \ncontext if this treaty is ratified? In my view, it is clear that they \nwill be less likely to confront chemical weapons if we go ahead today. \nI hope very much my colleagues will join in supporting the treaty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Will the Senator withhold the quorum request?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I withhold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3568-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECESS UNTIL 10:30 A.M.

The time will be charged to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my dear friend, the \nchairman.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution of ratification. I \nwill take just a moment of the Senate's time to put this matter in a \nhistorical context.\n  Since its development by 19th century chemists, poison gas--as it was \nknown--has been seen as a singular evil giving rise to a singular cause \nfor international sanctions.\n  In May 1899, Czar Nicholas II of Russia convened a peace conference \nat The Hague in Holland. Twenty-six countries attended and agreed upon \nthree conventions and three declarations concerning the laws of war. \nDeclaration II, On Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases stated:\n\n       The Contracting Parties agree to abstain from the use of \n     projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of \n     asphyxiating or deleterious gases.\n\n  Article 23 of the Annex to the Convention added:\n\n       In addition to the prohibitions provided by special \n     Conventions, it is especially forbidden:\n       (a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons * * *\n\n  Our own Theodore Roosevelt called for a second peace conference which \nconvened in 1907. This time, 45 countries were in attendance at The \nHague, and reiterated the Declaration on Asphyxiating Gases and the \narticle 23 prohibition on poisoned weapons.\n  The Hague Conventions notwithstanding, poison gas was used in World \nWar I. Of all the events of the First World War, a war from which this \ncentury has not yet fully recovered, none so horrified mankind as gas \nwarfare. No resolve ever was as firm as that of the nations of the \nworld, after that war, to prevent gas warfare from ever happening \nagain.\n  Declaring something to be violation of international law does not \nsolve a problem, but it does provide those of us who adhere to laws \nmechanisms by which to address violations of them. In June 1925, the \nProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, \nPoisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare was \nsigned in Geneva. This reaffirmed the Hague prohibition and added \nbiological weapons to the declaration.\n  In the Second World War that followed, such was the power of that \ncommitment that gas was not used in Europe. It was expected, but it did \nnot happen.\n  Then came the atom bomb and a new, even more important development in \nwarfare. In time it, too, would be the subject of international \nconventions.\n  As part of the peace settlement that followed World War II, President \nRoosevelt, with the British, Chinese, and French, set up the United \nNations. In 1957, within the U.N. system, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency was established. The new agency fielded an extraordinary \nnew device, international inspectors, who began inspecting weapons \nfacilities around the world to ensure compliance. This was enhanced by \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which came into force in \n1970, allowing inspectors to monitor declared nuclear sites. This was \nan unheard of compromise of traditional sovereignty. It has not worked \nperfectly. The number of nuclear powers, or proto-nuclear powers, has \ngrown somewhat. But only somewhat: around 10 in a world with some 185 \nmembers of the United Nations. And never since 1945 has a single atomic \nweapon been used in warfare.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention incorporates the advances in \ninternational law and cooperation of which I have spoken; it extends \nthem. Its inspections can be more effective than the IAEA because of \nthe ability to conduct challenge inspections when violations of the CWC \nare suspected.\n  If the Senate should fail--and it will not fail--to adopt the \nresolution of ratification, it would be the first rejection of such a \ntreaty since the Senate in 1919 rejected the Treaty of Versailles, with \nits provision for the establishment of the League of Nations. It would \nbe only the 18th treaty rejected by the Senate in the history of the \nRepublic.\n  Every living Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the past 20 \nyears has called for ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Our beloved former colleague, Senator Bob Dole, has given his support \nand asked us to do what I think we can only describe as our duty. The \nPresident pleads.\n  Here I would note a distinction. In 1919, Woodrow Wilson could have \nhad the Versailles Treaty, we could have joined the League of Nations, \nif only he had been willing to make a modicum of concessions to then-\nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and majority leader, Henry \nCabot Lodge of Massachusetts. Wilson was too stubborn; in truth, and it \npains an old Wilsonian to say so, too blind. Nothing such can be said \nof President Clinton. In a month of negotiations with the current \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the current Republican \nleader, the administration has reached agreement on 28 of 33 \nconditions. Only five proved unacceptable. And, indeed, sir, they are. \nThe President could not in turn ratify a treaty with those conditions.\n  Again to draw a parallel with 1919. During consideration of the \nTreaty of Versailles, the Senate was divided into three primary camps: \nthose who supported the treaty; those who opposed the treaty, no matter \nwhat shape or form it might take--known as ``irreconcilables'' or \n``bitter enders''--and those who wanted some changes to the treaty, \nmost importantly led by Senator Lodge.\n  There are some modern day irreconcilables who oppose this Treaty for \nthe same reason they eschew international law: viewing it as an \nassertion of what nice people do. Such a view reduces a magisterial \nconcept that there will be enforced standards to a form of wishful \nthinking. A position which runs counter to a century of effort. Today I \nwould appeal to those Republicans who might compare themselves with \nSenator Lodge. Unlike 1919, this President has heard your concerns and\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\nworked carefully to address them in the form the resolution of \nratification containing 28 conditions which is now before the Senate.\n  To fail to ratify the CWC would put us on the side of the rogue \nstates and relieve them of any pressure to ratify the convention \nthemselves. As Matthew Nimitz has argued, the United States has a \nunique interest in international law because it cannot ``match the \nRussians in deviousness or the Libyans in irresponsibility or the \nIranians in brutality * * *. [It is the United States] which stands to \nlose the most in a state of world anarchy.''\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention builds on the laws of The Hague: a \ncentury of arms control agreements. It bans chemical weapons--hideous \nand barbaric devices--completely. International law can never offer \nperfect protection, but we are primary beneficiaries of the protection \nthat it does provide. I urge my colleagues to support this important \ntreaty.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Might I ask? Does time run consecutively and is it divided equally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. It will be divided equally.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my friend from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a congressional fellow \nfrom my office, Ashley Tessmer, be allowed in the Chamber during the \nChemical Weapons Convention debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention goes \ninto force April 29 with or without U.S. participation. This, after \nmore than 100 years of international efforts to ban chemical weapons, \nincluding the Hague Convention of 1889 and the Geneva Protocol of 1925 \nwhich placed restrictions on the use of chemical weapons. The history \nof chemical weapons use is a long one--from 1915 with the German use of \nchlorine gas in Belgium during World War I, to the Iraqi use of poison \ngas to kill an estimated 4,000 people in the Kurdish village of Halabja \nin 1988, and the very recent threat of chemical weapons use in the \nPersian Gulf war.\n\n  These chemical weapons are dangerous--not only because of \nintentional, but also accidental use. In Minnesota, I've listened to \nmany gulf war veterans who've told me about their experiences during \nthe conflict. Much is still unknown about chemical weapons use in the \ngulf and there is great concern throughout the Minnesota veterans \ncommunity. I've seen the tragic effects of this when I've met with gulf \nwar veterans who went to the gulf in perfect health but became \nseriously ill after they returned. While many are uncertain about the \ncauses of their illnesses, they suspect that exposure to toxic chemical \nagents was a factor.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell my colleagues about a story I recently \nheard concerning veterans who were part of the 477th Ambulance Company \nwho may have been exposed to toxic chemicals. After the war, a couple \nof company members went exploring the area nearby and noticed a spill \non the floor of a warehouse. There's no way of knowing now exactly what \nthe substance was, but they are concerned about possible exposure to a \nnerve agent. They were alarmed because even this kind of low-level \nexposure can be a serious threat to our soldiers' safety and health. \nThe plea from the Minnesotan who told this story is, ``Please! Get \neveryone to stop using this junk!'' Well, that is exactly what we are \ntrying to do, and ratifying the CWC is a vital step in that direction. \nIf we don't sign up, America's soldiers--and indeed, all Americans--\nwill be the worse for it.\n  Another Minnesotan who was a nuclear-biological-chemical warfare \nspecialist during the war talked about the panic and incorrect use of \nprotective equipment that occurred when there were scud alerts \naccompanied by CBW alerts. There were soldiers who just couldn't handle \nthe threat of possible chemical attacks. And why should we be \nsurprised? The use of chemical weapons is inhuman and even the \nperceived threat has to be psychologically damaging. These stories just \nstrengthen my resolve to do all I can to push for ratification of this \ntreaty.\n  Mr. President, we face a decision between taking a lead role in this \neffort or standing on the sidelines--this decision should not be \ndifficult for the United States which historically has taken the lead \nin arms control, seeking agreements that are in the national interest, \nverifiable, and contribute to world peace. I repeat in the national \ninterest, verifiable, and contribute to world peace. And there is no \nquestion in my mind that the CWC fully meets these standards.\n\n  To me, it is a great mystery why this treaty is not already ratified. \nAfter all, Congress directed in 1985 that all U.S. chemical munitions \nbe destroyed by 1999--since amended to 2004. Subsequently in 1993, the \nUnited States became one of the original signatories of the CWC, now \nawaiting ratification by this body. It would seem that there's nothing \nso dramatic as waiting until the last minute to make an obvious and \nsensible decision. This international treaty takes a major step forward \nin the elimination of the scourge of chemical weapons. As the world's \nonly superpower and leader in the fight for world peace, we must be out \nfront on this convention.\n  This treaty itself has a very interesting and solid bipartisan \nhistory as well as strong popular support, and I am mystified as to why \nsome of my colleagues want to reject a treaty for which we are largely \nresponsible. The CWC was conceived during the Reagan administration, \ncrafted and signed during the Bush administration and further \nnegotiated during the Clinton administration. Former President Bush has \ncontinued to proclaim strong support for ratification. Its bipartisan \ncreditials are thus impeccable. Legislators and national security \nexperts from both parties firmly support it. Former Secretary of State \nJames Baker argues that it is outrageous to suggest that either \nPresidents Bush or Reagan would negotiate a treaty that would harm \nnational security. President Clinton sees the accord as building on the \ntreaty than bans nuclear tests in the atmosphere that President Kennedy \nsigned more than three decades ago. The Senate now needs to complete \nthe weapons-control work to which Presidents Kennedy, Reagan and Bush \nand Clinton were and have been committed.\n  By at least restricting the manufacture, sale, and possession of \ntoxic chemicals capable of being used as weapons, the United States \nmakes it more difficult for rogue nations or terrorist organizations to \nobtain the raw material for weapons. Ultimately, we then better protect \nour soldiers and civilians. We should help lead the world away from \nthese graveyard gases, and not pretend they are essential to a solid \ndefense. Do we plan to use chemical weapons? No. Then do we lack the \ncourage to lead? I certainly hope not.\n  Mr. President, according to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, \nthe United States is the only nation with the power, influence, and \nrespect to forge a strong global consensus against the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  There is also support for this treaty from the armed services. I have \nthe unique perspective of serving on both the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I know that many \nveterans organizations support this treaty--VFW, VVA, Reserve Officers \nAssociation of U.S., American Ex-prisoners of War, AMVETS, Jewish War \nVets to name a few. What better testimony to its value? The treaty will \nreduce world stockpiles of weapons and will hopefully prevent our \ntroops from being exposed to poison gases. And, for my colleagues who \nare still not convinced on the merits of the treaty--over three \nquarters of the American public--as much as 84 percent in a recent \npoll, favors this treaty.\n\n  But why then are there opponents to this treaty? I cannot answer \nthat. I can only say that it is always easier to tear something down \nthan it is to build it. Ask ethnic minorities in Iraq--who\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\nwere the victims of Saddam's chemical attacks--why there are opponents. \nAsk Generals Schwartzkopf and Powell why there are opponents. According \nto General Powell, this treaty serves our national interest--to quote \nhis comments at last week's Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing: ``For \nus to reject that treaty now because there are rogue nations outside \nthe treaty is the equivalent of saying we shouldn't have joined NATO \nbecause Russia wasn't a part of NATO.'' If we don't sign this treaty, \ntheir will still be rogue nations. Ask the State Department, the \nintelligence community, the chemical manufacturers who stand to lose as \nmuch as $600 million in sales, why there are opponents to this treaty. \nAnd ask our own gulf war veterans who lived with the fear of chemical \nattack and may now be suffering the effects of exposure to chemicals \nwhy there are opponents. They and I will never understand it.\n  Mr. President, ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is \ncrucial to all nonproliferation efforts. If America's message to the \nworld is that the United States is not deeply concerned about the \nproduction of weapons of mass destruction, then it will encourage rogue \nstates to either continue clandestine projects or to begin producing \nthese weapons that could imperil U.S. troops in future conflicts. Lack \nof U.S. resolve on the CWC and the unraveling effect it would have on \nother arms control treaties, would make it easier for rogue states in \ntwo ways: they could more easily acquire chemical weapons materials and \nmore effectively hide their production programs. How can we best \nprotect the future of our children, our soldiers, our trade, our \ncountry's position in the world? By ratifying this treaty.\n  I'm deeply puzzled as to why, when at long last the Senate is on the \nverge of giving its advice and consent to CWC ratification, we are \nbeing asked to consider treaty-killer conditions. Again, I remind my \ncolleague, this treaty has been more than 15 years in the making with \ntwo Republican Presidents and one Democratic President involved in \nnegotiating and crafting the final product. It is the result of years \nof bipartisan efforts. The CWC has been strongly endorsed by former \nSecretary of State James Baker and former National Security Adviser \nBrent Scowcroft--both of whom served Republican Presidents. It also \nenjoys the support of our top commanders during the Persian Gulf war, \nincluding General Schwarzkopf, who clearly recognize that it is in our \nnational interest to ratify the treaty.\n\n  While I do not question the motives and integrity of my colleagues \nwho support these four killer conditions, it is clear that they are not \na result of insufficient Senate scrutiny and debate. In fact, the CWC \nhas been before the Senate since November 1993, when it was submitted \nby President Clinton. During the past 3\\1/2\\ years, the Senate has held \n17 hearings on the treaty and the administration has provided the \nSenate with more than 1,500 pages of information on the CWC, including \nover 300 pages of testimony and over 400 pages of answers to questions \nfor the record. It is important to recall that in April 1996 the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations voted the treaty out of committee by a \nstrong bipartisan majority, 13 to 5. Why then, only 1 year later, are \nwe confronting four conditions, any of which will prevent us from \nratifying the treaty by April 29 when it will automatically go into \neffect, and a fifth condition that is unacceptable and would undermine \nthe treaty?\n  Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues realize that the \nUnited States will incur serious costs if we don't submit instruments \nof ratification by April 29. Unless we join the convention now, the \nUnited States will be barred from having a seat on the executive \ncouncil, the key decisionmaking body of the convention, for at least a \nyear and, perhaps, longer. We would thus be precluded from influencing \nvital decisions to be made by the executive council regarding the \ndetailed procedures that will be followed under the convention. \nMoreover, sanctions against U.S. companies--the requirement that they \nobtain end-user certificates to export certain chemicals--will commence \non April 29 if we are not a convention party. If we still haven't \njoined in 3 years, U.S. firms would be subject to a ban on trade in \ncertain chemicals. In addition, U.S. citizens won't be hired as \nofficials or inspectors by the body that will implement the convention \nuntil the United States becomes a party to the CWC. And, even more \nimportant than these costs to the United States, is the fact that \nfailure to ratify the treaty, which was produced because of U.S. \nleadership, will have a negative impact on American leadership around \nthe world.\n  While I will never understand why we have come to such a pass, it is \ncrystal clear to me why we have to move to strike all five of these \nconditions. Mr. President, permit me to briefly summarize each of the \nfive conditions and to spell out the key reasons why I'm unalterably \nopposed to them:\n  CWC condition No. 29 on Russia precludes the United States from \njoining the convention until Russia ratifies and satisfies other \nspecified conditions. This is a killer condition that would hold \nhostage our ability to join the CWC to hardliners in the Russian Duma. \nAs the President put it, ``this is precisely backwards [since] the best \nway to secure Russian ratification is to ratify the treaty ourselves.'' \nI couldn't agree more with the President, whose position parallels that \nof Vil Myrzyanov, a Russian scientist who blew the whistle on the \nSoviet Union's CW program and strongly backs the treaty. In a recent \nletter to my distinguished colleague, Senator Lugar, he said ``Senate \nratification of the convention is crucial to securing action on the \ntreaty in Moscow.'' Unless, my colleagues join me in striking this \namendment, we'll be permitting Russian hardliners to decide our foreign \npolicy, while dimming prospects that Russia--which has the world's \nlargest stockpile of chemical weapons--will ratify the CWC. How can \nthis be in our national interest?\n\n  CWC condition No. 30 on rogue states bars the United States from \nratifying the CWC until all states determined to possess offensive \nchemical weapons programs, including China, North Korea, Libya, Syria, \nIran, and Iraq, and other states deemed to be state sponsors of \nterrorism, have ratified. This is a killer condition likely to prevent \nthe United States from ever joining the CWC. If this condition is not \nstruck we would be using the lowest common denominator as a principle \nfor determining our foreign policy. The United States would be placed \nin the bizarre and embarrassing position of allowing the world's most \nrecalcitrant regimes to determine when we join the CWC, if ever. As \nformer Secretary of State James Baker has said: ``It makes no sense to \nargue that because a few pariah states refuse to join the convention \nthe United States should line up with them rather than the rest of the \nworld.'' Makes no sense at all, which is precisely why I strongly \nsupport striking this condition.\n  CWC condition No. 31 on barring CWC inspectors from a number of \ncountries such as Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, from ever entering \nthe United States as part of CWC inspection teams. This is an \nunnecessary condition that has the potential to seriously hamstring CWC \nimplementation. To begin with, the United States already has the right \nunder the CWC to bar inspectors on an individual basis each year when \nthe CWC proposes its list of inspectors. If this condition is not \nstruck, it is likely to provoke reciprocity, resulting in other nations \nblackballing all American inspectors. This would have the perverse \neffect of undermining one of our main objectives in joining the treaty: \nto ensure American inspectors take the lead in finding violations. In \naddition, condition No. 31 would bar inspectors from a country like \nChina even if United States national security might be better served by \nletting them confirm directly that the United States is not violating \nthe CWC, but fails to require rejection of inspectors from other \ncountries who might be known spies or have a record of improper \nhandling of confidential data. Because of these serious flaws, I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in voting to strike this condition.\n  CWC condition No. 32 which prohibits the United States from joining \nthe CWC until the President certifies that the parties to the \nconvention have agreed to strike article X and amend article XI. This \nprovision is an outright killer that will prevent the United States \nfrom joining the Convention. Clearly the President can't make such a \ncertification prior to April, and likely won't ever be able to do so \nsince the\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\nConvention permits a single State party to veto such amendments. \nProponents of condition No. 32 wrongly contend that the Convention \nrequires the United States and other parties to share sensitive \ntechnology that will assist such countries as Iran to develop offensive \nCW capabilities.\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, neither article X nor article XI have such \nrequirements. Article X, which focuses mainly on assisting or \nprotecting convention member countries attacked, or facing attack, by \nchemical weapons, provides complete flexibility for states to determine \nwhat type of assistance to provide and how to provide it. One option \nwould be to provide solely medical antidotes and treatments to the \nthreatened state. This is precisely the option the President has chosen \nunder agreed condition No. 15 which specifies that the United States \nwill give only medical help to such countries as Iran or Cuba under \narticle X. Moreover, beyond medical assistance, the President has made \nclear the United States will be careful in deciding what assistance to \nprovide on a case-by-case basis. In sum, there is no valid \njustification for scrapping article X.\n  Opponents of the CWC contend that article XI, which addresses the \nexchange of scientific and technical information, requires the sharing \nof technology and will result in the erosion of export controls now \nimposed by the Australia Group of chemical exporting countries, which \nincludes the United States. While this is plainly not the case, the \nPresident under agreed condition No. 7 is committed to obtain \nassurances from our Australia Group partners that article XI is fully \nconsistent with maintaining export curbs on dangerous chemicals. \nCondition No. 7 also requires the President to certify that the CWC \ndoesn't obligate the United States to modify its national export \ncontrols, as well as to certify annually that the Australia Group is \nmaintaining controls that are equal to, or exceed, current export \ncontrols.\n  Mr. President, one final point regarding the Condition's proponents \nconcern that articles X and XI will require technology that will assist \nother countries to develop offensive chemical weapons programs. \nExchanges of sensitive technology and information provided under terms \nof both articles would be legally bound by the fundamental obligation \nof treaty article I, which obligates parties never to ``* * * assist \nencourage, or induce, in any, anyone to engage in any activity \nprohibited to a State party under this convention.'' This would ban \nassisting anyone in acquiring a chemical weapons capability.\n\n  I strongly urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me \nin voting to strike this condition.\n  CWC condition No. 33 would prohibit the United States from ratifying \nthe CWC until the President can certify high confidence U.S. \ncapabilities to detect within 1 year of a violation, the illicit \nproduction or storage of one metric ton of chemical agent. Since this \nis an unachievable standard for monitoring the treaty, this is a killer \ncondition that would permanently bar U.S. participation in the CWC.\n  Mr. President, no one can deny that some aspects of the CWC will be \ndifficult to verify, nor can anyone affirm that any arms control \nagreement is 100 percent verifiable. And, as Gen. Edward Rowny, who was \nspecial adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush, pointed out in the \nWashington Post any chemical weapons treaty is inherently more \ndifficult to verify than a strategic arms treaty, under which missiles \nand bombers can be observed by national technical means. For one thing, \nchemical weapons can literally be produced in thousands of large and \nsmall laboratories around the world. But the bottom line is one made \nsuccinctly and clearly by General Rowny: ``If we are within the CWC, \nwell-trained and experienced American inspectors, employing an agreed \nset of procedures, intensive procedures, will have an opportunity to \ncatch violaters. Outside the CWC, no such opportunity will exist.'' I \ncouldn't agree more. As in many other matters, the perfect is not only \nunattainable but is also the enemy of the good. I hope than many of my \ncolleagues will see this issue in the same light and will join me in \nvoting to strike condition No. 33.\n  In conclusion, I want to stress that America has always been a leader \nin international arms negotiations. America should continue this proud \ntradition of leading the way. We as a nation have the opportunity to be \none of the world's leading guardians of the peace through the \napplication of this treaty; we can participate in safeguarding our \narmed forces, our citizens, our children from the horrors of chemical \nweapons; we can lessen the likelihood of chemical weapons being used \nagain in warfare.\n  But to make all this possible, we must have the perspicacity and \nforesight to grab this fleeting opportunity, this historic moment where \nwe decide to join with other nations to improve the quality of life \nworldwide and assure a safer, saner world. We have just celebrated \nEarth Day--and I ask what better way to honor our planet is there than \nby now ratifying a treaty that will protect and safeguard her people?\n  Mr. President, there is not a lot of time to go through such an \nimportant issue, but I thought I would just draw from some very \npoignant and personal discussion back in Minnesota that we have had \nwith gulf war veterans.\n  To quote one of the veterans who himself is really struggling with \nillness which he thinks is based upon some exposure to chemicals during \nhis service in the war, he said, ``This is my plea. Please get everyone \nto stop using this junk.''\n  I really do think that the more I talk to veterans with their service \nin the gulf war fresh in their mind, many of whom are ill, many of whom \nare struggling with illness, who were fine before they served in the \nwar and are not now and want to know what has happened to them, there \nare two different issues. I have the honor of being on both the \nVeterans' Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. One, on \nthe Veterans' Committee, is to get to the bottom of this and make sure \nveterans get the care they deserve. But the other is when we have such \nan important treaty, such a historically important agreement which is \nin the national interest, which is verifiable and which contributes to \nworld peace and helps us get rid of this junk and is so important not \nonly to our soldiers-to-be but also to children and grandchildren, Mr. \nPresident, I do not think there is any more important vote that we can \nmake than one of majority support for the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  In my State of Minnesota, I know that people are overwhelmingly for \nthis agreement. People are under no illusion. They do not think it is \nperfect, but they think it is an enormous step forward for all of \nhumankind, an enormous step forward for people in our country, an \nenormous step forward for people in other countries as well. Since the \nUnited States of America has taken a leadership position in the \ninternational community, in the international arena, it would be, I \nthink, nothing short of tragic if we now were on the sidelines, if we \nwere not involved in the implementation of this agreement, if we were \nnot involved in exerting our leadership in behalf of this agreement.\n  I urge full support for this agreement, and I really do think I speak \nfor a large, engaged majority in Minnesota.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, time will be \ndeducted equally.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I withhold my suggestion of the absence of \na quorum. I yield 7 minutes to my friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. President Reagan began the negotiations on this \ntreaty. President Bush signed it. And President Clinton sent it to the \nSenate for our advice and consent.\n  We do a lot of things in this Chamber. Some of them are small and \nrather insignificant. But we also do some very big and important things \nand make some big and important decisions. The vote this evening on \nthis treaty is a very significant decision for the people of America \nand also people around the world.\n  There are some who have opposed virtually all efforts in all cases to \nlimit arms. They vote against all of the arms\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\ncontrol treaties, believing that they are not in our country's best \ninterests. I think they were wrong, and I think they have been proven \nwrong in a number of areas.\n  In previous arms control agreements, we have achieved significant \nsuccess in reducing the nuclear threat against this country. I held up \nin this Chamber--in fact, somewhere right near this spot--not too many \nmonths ago a large piece of metal that I held up from that missile is \nmetal that comes from the scrap heap because the missile does not exist \nany longer.\n\n  In the missile silo that existed, in the hole in the ground in the \nUkraine, that hole in the ground which contained a missile with a \nwarhead ensconced in that silo, there is now simply dirt. And in that \ndirt are planted sunflowers--no missile, no silo--sunflowers.\n  Now, why are sunflowers planted where a missile was once planted, a \nmissile with a nuclear warhead aimed at the United States of America? \nBecause of an arms control agreement which required that that missile \nbe destroyed. So sunflowers exist where a missile once stood poised, \naimed at our country.\n  Arms control agreements have worked. This particular convention which \nwe will vote to ratify today would eliminate an entire class of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  One could come to the floor of the Senate today and hold up a vial of \nsarin gas, and if one should drop that vial of gas on this desk and it \nwould break, those in this room might not be leaving the room; they \nmight not survive. If someone came here with a vial and a gas mask and \nwore the mask and appropriate protective clothing, then they would \nsuffer no consequences.\n  My point is, who are the most vulnerable in our world when there is a \npoison gas or chemical weapon attack? The population of ordinary \ncitizens is the most vulnerable. There are armies, if forewarned, that \ncan defend themselves against it, but the mass population of citizens \nin our countries is extraordinarily vulnerable to the most aggressive \npoison gas and chemical weapons known to mankind.\n  There are a lot of arguments that have been raised against this \nconvention, but none of them make much sense. Our country has already \ndecided to destroy our stockpile of poison gas and chemical weapons. We \nhave already made that decision. President Reagan made that decision. \nWe are in the process of finishing that job. The question before the \nSenate is whether we will join in a treaty ratified already by over 70 \nother countries, whether we will decide to work to eliminate chemical \nweapons and poison gas from the rest of the world, to decide that if \never American men and women who wear a uniform in service of our \ncountry go abroad or go somewhere to defend our country, they will not \nbe facing an attack by chemical weapons or poison gas.\n  That is what this debate is about. This is not a small or an \ninsignificant issue. This is an attempt by our country and others to \njoin together to ban an entire class of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken several times in this Chamber about the \nvote that we are to take today. This vote is late. This debate should \nhave taken place long ago, but it did not. We pushed and agitated and \npushed and pushed some more to get it to the floor of the Senate \nbecause we face a critical end date of April 29.\n  I commend those who finally decided to join with us and bring this to \nthe floor for a debate, but now as we proceed through several \namendments and then final passage, it is important for the future of \nthis country, for my children and the children of the world, that this \nSenate cast a favorable vote to ratify the treaty that comes from this \nconvention. It will be a better world and a safer world if we do that.\n  I want to commend those who have worked on this in Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, those whose view of foreign policy is that \nit is a safer world if we together, jointly, reduce the threats that \nexist in our world. Yes, the threat from nuclear weapons. We have done \nthat in arms control treaties. Those treaties are not perfect, but we \nhave made huge progress. And now, also, the threat of chemical weapons \nand poison gas.\n  I am proud today to cast a vote for a treaty that is very \nsignificant, and I hope sufficient numbers of my colleagues will do the \nsame. I hope that the news tomorrow in our country will be that the \nUnited States of America has joined 74 other countries in ratifying \nthis critically important treaty for our future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be divided equally.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont, who has an hour under \nthe agreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need \nunder the hour reserved to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will exercise its advice and consent \nauthority under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the United States \nConstitution. We have to decide whether we will advise and consent to \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention that has been the product of \nnegotiations conducted by the Reagan, the Bush and the Clinton \nadministrations. If we advise and consent to it, then President Clinton \nwill be free to ratify the convention. If we do not, of course, he does \nnot have that power to do so.\n  Last week I did not object to the unanimous-consent agreement by \nwhich the Senate is now finally able to consider the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. I did comment at that time on the manner in which we are \nproceeding. We have been forced to take the unusual step of discharging \nthis important treaty from the Foreign Relations Committee without the \nbenefit of committee consideration or a committee report. And, what is \nmost extraordinary, is that it is the Republican leadership for the \nRepublican majority that has insisted on this extraordinary procedure.\n  Last week we were required to discharge the Judiciary Committee from \nany consideration of S. 495, a bill that was taken up last Thursday \nwith no committee consideration, no committee report, and an absolute \nminimum of debate. In fact, the Senate was asked to consider a revised, \nunamendable substitute version of the bill that was not made available \nto us until that very afternoon. I raised concerns that it might, in \nfact, serve to weaken criminal laws against terrorism. I daresay at \nleast 90 out of the 100 Senators who voted on S. 495 last week had not \nread it and probably did not have much idea of what was in it.\n  I mention this because we have taken a lot of time for recesses this \nyear but we did not come up with a budget on April 15, even though the \nlaw requires us to do so. The leadership decided not to bring one \nbefore the Senate to vote on. Each one of us had to file our taxes on \nApril 15, or the IRS would have come knocking on the door, but even \nthough the law requires the leadership to bring up a budget bill, none \nwas. I am not suggesting we not bring up the Chemical Weapons \nConvention now. It should have been brought up last September. But I \nworry that the Senate is suddenly doing this, launching into issue \nafter issue, not following the kind of procedures that would enable us \nto really know what we are talking about. I suggest that we should be \nlooking at the way we have done this.\n  In 1988 I chaired hearings on the threat of high-tech terrorism. I \ncontinue to be concerned about terrorist access to plastique \nexplosives, sophisticated information systems, electronic surveillance \nequipment, and ever more powerful, dangerous weapons. With the sarin \nnerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system 2 years ago, we saw the use \nof harmful chemicals to commit terrorist acts.\n  In our Judiciary hearings in 1988, 1991 and 1995, we heard testimony \non easily acquired, difficult to detect chemical and biological weapons \nand explosions. On April 17, 1995, the date of the bombing of the \nMurrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, we all learned how easy it is \nfor somebody, intent on terrorism, to concoct a lethal compound out of \nmaterials as easily available as fertilizer.\n\n[[Page S3575]]\n\n  So, for more than a decade I have raised issues about the threats of \nnuclear, biological and chemical terrorism. I have worked with Members \non both sides of the aisle to minimize those threats. We have \ncooperated on measures included in the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, and the Antiterrorism Act, passed in April of \nlast year. We have concurred on those. Assuming we advise and consent \ntoday, and I think now that we will--I think some who wanted to hold it \nup realize that this is not the kind of posture they want to be in, \nespecially as a party going into elections next year--but, assuming \nthat we advise and consent and the President can ratify it, I look \nforward to working with Senator Hatch to promptly consider and report \nimplementing legislation that will continue the progress we are making \ntoday.\n  I look forward to hearings in the Judiciary Committee on S. 610, \nhaving that committee consider that measure and report it to the Senate \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n  I do not expect the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, to bottle up this measure or to deny the \nSenate the benefit of our committee's views. I am going to try to get \nsomething approaching regular order. We have not on anything else yet \nthis year, but maybe on this issue we could.\n  We have had the Chemical Weapons Convention before us since November \n1993. As the April 28, 1997, deadline approaches--after which our lack \nof ratification risks economic sanctions against our chemical industry \nthat would actually cost U.S. chemical companies hundreds of millions \nof dollars--I hope the Republican majority will join with the President \nand ratify it, and allow him to sign this treaty. I understand all \nDemocrats will vote for it. I hope enough Republicans will, too.\n  In fact, our good friend and former colleague, Senator Bob Dole, \nendorsed ratification yesterday. I hope others are now going to follow \nhim, because, really, we are deciding whether the United States will be \na member of a treaty that goes into effect on April 29, with or without \nus. No matter what we do on the floor of the Senate, this treaty goes \ninto effect on April 29. If we do not advise and consent, the United \nStates will be left on the outside of the world community, with states \nlike Iraq and Libya, which have refused to become parties to this \nimportant arms control measure. It is a fascinating situation, Mr. \nPresident. If we do not advise and consent, we can say we are standing \nshoulder to shoulder with Iraq and Libya because we did not join the \nchemical weapons treaty. This is one of the most ambitious treaties in \nthe history of arms control. It bans an entire class of weapons, which \nhave been one of the great scourges of the 20th century. In fact, this, \nalong with antipersonnel landmines, have been among the greatest \nscourges of 20th century warfare. This treaty prohibits a full spectrum \nof activities associated with the offensive use of chemical weapons, \nincluding the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling and \nassistance to anyone engaging in these activities.\n  The convention creates a comprehensive verification regime which \nmakes it easier to detect and monitor emerging chemical weapons \nthreats. The vigorous verification procedures established in this \ntreaty will help deter countries from developing chemical weapons, and \nwill make it more likely that cheaters are detected. Those nations that \ndo not ratify it, and we could be among them, will be subject to trade \nsanctions. Nonparticipating nations will also face increasing \ninternational pressure to comply, as their number dwindles to an \nunsavory few. I hope the United States will not be one of those \nunsavory few.\n  In the last day, I have heard preposterous statements from the Senate \nfloor about what damage this treaty will do to our national security, \nabout what a burden it will be on American business--the same \nbusinesses that are hoping that we will advise and consent to it; about \nhow rogue states will suddenly produce unconstrained amounts of \nchemical weapons to use on our soldiers. Others eloquently exposed \nthese charges for what they are: flat-out false.\n  What this debate is really about is how we monitor the rest of the \nworld to ensure the use of these weapons is deterred and minimized. For \nwe all know, the United States by law is committed to destroying our \nown chemical stockpiles by 2004. We are doing this because we know that \nthese weapons have limited military utility and because civilized \npeople around the world agree their use is morally wrong. And the \nUnited States is not going to use them.\n  So, how do we encourage other states to do what we are going to do \nanyway? Should we go at it unilaterally or multilaterally? Do we want \nAmerican inspection teams to mount short notice inspections of \npotential violators or not? Do we want international penalties to apply \nto those who flout this treaty or not? Are we safer if the Russians \ndestroy their 40,000 tons of chemical weapons, or not? Do we join with \nthe 74 nations who have ratified this treaty, and the 162 countries \nthat have signed it, or not? Or, does the United States, the most \npowerful nation in the history of the world, choose, somehow, to go it \nalone, with all the problems that would entail?\n  Let us not forget that the United States had a primary role in \ndesigning and shaping this treaty, from the time it was first proposed \nby President Reagan. In recent weeks, the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, working in concert with the Clinton \nadministration, has worked very hard to address the concerns that some \nMembers of this body have. Yesterday we passed 28 declarations to the \nresolution of ratification that provide even greater protections to \nU.S. business, and our soldiers, and those who are concerned about \nconstitutional violations.\n\n  Shortly, we are going to vote to strike five other conditions that \nopponents of the treaty say are necessary to address their concerns. I \nhope that, rather than addressing their concerns, we address the \nconcerns of the United States. Those five conditions should be seen for \nwhat they are, treaty killers, designed by those who have no desire to \nsee us participate in this treaty, no matter how many modifications we \nmake.\n  I want to speak briefly about two of the amendments. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nHelms, has been very insistent on them. They are important with respect \nto this treaty, and also with respect to the issue of antipersonnel \nlandmines. That is a matter of special importance to me.\n  Proposed condition 29 would, among other things, prohibit the United \nStates from ratifying the treaty until Russia has done so. Proposed \ncondition 30 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the treaty \nuntil all States having chemical weapons programs, including China, \nNorth Korea, and Iraq, have ratified the treaty. In other words, we \nwould say that China, North Korea, and Iraq would determine the \ntimetable for the United States. Can you imagine that in any other \ncontext? We would be screaming on this floor. Of course we would not \nallow that to happen. These conditions would effectively prevent the \nUnited States from ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention and allow \nthe world's most recalcitrant regimes to decide the rules of \ninternational conduct.\n  To its credit, the administration strongly opposed these amendments. \nIt argues, and I agree, that we should ratify the treaty even before \nRussia does, and even assuming that rogue States like Iraq and Libya \nand North Korea do not. In other words, even if these other nations \nwhich could easily produce chemical weapons do not join the treaty, the \nUnited States should still do so. Why? Because, by ratifying the treaty \nwe isolate the rogue nations, we make it harder for them to produce and \nuse chemical weapons. And, were they then to do so, if all of us had \njoined in this convention and they moved outside the convention, they \nwould suffer international condemnation and sanctions.\n  In support of this argument the administration has turned to some of \nour most distinguished military and national security leaders. Let me \nquote what they are saying about linking our ratification to Russia's \nor to the actions of such nations as China and Iraq.\n  Gen. Brent Scowcroft and former CIA Director John Deutch say:\n\n       [U.S. failure to ratify] gives Russia--which has the \n     world's largest stock of chemical weapons--an easy excuse to \n     further delay its own accession to the CWC.\n\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\n\n  Former Secretary of State James Baker says:\n\n       [S]ome have argued that we should not contribute to the \n     treaty because states like Libya, Iraq and North Korea, which \n     have not signed it, will still be able to continue their \n     efforts to acquire chemical weapons. This is obviously true. \n     But the convention . . . will make it more difficult for \n     these states to do so. . . . It makes no sense to argue that \n     because a few pariah states refuse to join the convention, \n     the United States should line up with them, rather than the \n     rest of the world.\n  Secretary of Defense William Cohen says:\n\n       [T]he CWC will reduce the chemical weapons problem to a few \n     notorious rogues. . . .\n\n  And last, but certainly not least, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf has said:\n\n       We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future wars. \n     And frankly, by not ratifying that treaty, we align ourselves \n     with nations like Libya and North Korea, and I'd just as soon \n     not be associated with those thugs in that particular battle.\n\n  I agree with General Schwarzkopf. I do not want to have the United \nStates lumped in with Libya and North Korea on the CWC.\n  By ratifying the treaty, we and the overwhelming majority of nations \nestablish the rules by which the conduct of nations is measured.\n  Will some nations violate the treaty? Perhaps. But that is no more \nreason to oppose ratification than it would be to oppose passage of \nother laws outlawing illegal conduct. We pass laws all the time, \ncriminal laws in this country, and treaties, that say what shall be a \ncrime or a violation of the treaty. We do not withhold passing them \nbecause somebody might break that law. It is one of the main reasons we \ndo pass a law, to try to deter unacceptable conduct.\n  And by isolating the rogue nations, we pressure them to refrain from \nproducing or using chemical weapons. When they tire of being branded \noutlaws, they may even join in ratifying the treaty and complying with \nit themselves.\n  The arguments we hear on the floor from some today in opposition to \nthis also apply to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Not all nuclear powers \nare signatories to that treaty. But the effect of the treaty is a \npowerful disincentive on any state, signatory or not, from testing \nnuclear weapons. We know there are some countries today that have \nnuclear weapons. They have not signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, but \nbecause the major countries have, it limits their own scope of \nactivity.\n  These treaties were the subject of many, many years of negotiations, \nnegotiations that went nowhere until the United States said that it \nwould renounce the use of chemical weapons, and stop nuclear testing. \nAnd once the United States said that, then negotiations were pursued \nvigorously. The treaties were signed within a few years time.\n  I commend the administration and other proponents of the CWC for \narguing so strongly and effectively in favor of ratification. The \nPresident has made the case very, very well, and members of his \nadministration have too.\n  I would say with some irony though, this is precisely the argument \nthat I have been using on antipersonnel landmines. I could repeat \nverbatim what the President, the White House staff, the Secretary of \nDefense, General Schwarzkopf, and former Secretary Baker have said. \nThese arguments apply lock, stock, and barrel to the problem of \nantipersonnel landmines. We all want Russia and China to be part of a \ntreaty banning antipersonnel landmines. But that is not going to happen \nany sooner than Iraq is going to sign the chemical weapons treaty.\n  Their failure should not be used as an excuse for the United States \nnot to sign a treaty banning antipersonnel mines when 100 other \nnations, including many that have produced and used landmines or have \nbeen devastated by their effects, are ready to sign such a treaty.\n  When the administration on the one hand says we have to go forward \nwith the Chemical Weapons Convention--and I agree--even though some \ncountries, the worst ones have not yet joined, it is unfortunate that \nthe administration then turns around and says we cannot do the same \nthing with antipersonnel landmines until everybody joins in.\n  No treaty is universal. In fact some treaties have taken effect with \nonly 20 signatories. But by establishing the international norm, the \nrogue nations are isolated and pressure builds on them to sign. And \nthat is the only way.\n  So I ask, Mr. President, why does the administration argue one way on \nchemical weapons but not follow through on its argument when it comes \nto antipersonnel landmines? Landmines are just as indiscriminate.\n  Why, when many more American soldiers and many more innocent \ncivilians, Americans and others, have been killed and horribly maimed \nby landmines than by chemical weapons?\n  The reason, of course, is we pushed for the Chemical Weapons Treaty \nbecause we have already renounced our own use of chemical weapons, just \nas we pushed for the Test Ban Treaty because we had renounced our own \nnuclear tests. But we have not yet renounced our use of antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  If we did do so, if the United States were to renounce its use of \nantipersonnel mines, as so many other nations have done, including many \nof our NATO allies, I guarantee that the administration would make \nexactly the same arguments in support of a treaty banning those weapons \nas it is making in support of the CWC.\n  They would say that we should not allow Russia, China, and others to \ndecide what the rules of international conduct should be. They would \nsay it makes absolutely no sense that because a few pariah nations \nrefuse to join a landmine ban the United States should line up with \nthem rather than the rest of the world. And they would say that a \ntreaty banning antipersonnel landmines would reduce the landmine \nproblem to a few notorious outlaws and make the world safer for all its \npeople. These are the arguments they made on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. They are right. They also would be right in making these \nsame arguments in support of a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines.\n  In fact, Mr. President, in a letter to the New York Times today by \nRobert Bell, the Senior Director for Defense Policy and Arms Control, \nNational Security Council, Mr. Bell wrote:\n\n       We will be in a much stronger position to make sure other \n     parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention do the same if we \n     are inside, not outside a treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 24, 1997]\n\n                U.S. Would Benefit From Chemical Treaty\n\n                          (By Robert G. Bell)\n\n       To the Editor:\n       Re A.M. Rosenthal's ``Matter for Character'' (column, April \n     22), on the Chemical Weapons Convention, which the Senate \n     will vote on April 24:\n       Mr. Rosenthal says that Article 10 of the treaty should be \n     a ``deal breaker'' because it allegedly would give \n     ``terrorist nations'' access to defensive technology that \n     would help them evade the defenses of responsible states.\n       Only countries that have joined the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, renounced chemical weapons and destroyed their \n     stockpiles can request defensive assistance--and then only if \n     they are threatened with or under chemical attack. Further, \n     President Clinton has committed to the Senate in a binding \n     condition that the United States will limit our assistance to \n     countries of concern, like Iran or Cuba--should they ratify \n     and comply with the treaty--to emergency medical supplies.\n       And we will be in a much stronger position to make sure \n     other parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention do the same \n     if we are inside, not outside a treaty that will compel other \n     nations to do what we decided to do years ago: get rid of \n     chemical weapons.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with Mr. Bell, and I know he worked tirelessly on \nthe CWC. But unfortunately, Mr. Bell, who I am sure is well motivated, \nhas not been willing to apply that same argument to antipersonnel \nlandmines. The Vice President will not apply that argument. Many of the \nsame people who are up here arguing for the Chemical Weapons Convention \nmake one argument for the Chemical Weapons Convention and turn that \nargument completely around when it comes to antipersonnel landmines \neven though we face a grave danger, every day, from antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  There are 100 million of antipersonnel landmines in the ground in 68 \ncountries, where every few minutes somebody is maimed or killed by \nthem. This is, in many ways, a greater danger\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\nto innocent people than chemical weapons. And I wish the \nadministration, I wish Mr. Bell, I wish the Vice President, I wish \nothers who have not made their same arguments on antipersonnel \nlandmines that they do on chemical weapons will reconsider. Because, \nlike chemical weapons, antipersonnel landmines are weapons we do not \nneed.\n  What we do need are defenses against them, because, like chemical \nweapons, they are easy and cheap to produce. They pose a grave threat \nto our troops. They are the Saturday night specials of civil wars. They \nkill or maim a man, woman or child every 22 minutes every day of the \nyear. They are aptly called weapons of mass destruction in slow motion. \nIn fact, they are the only weapon where the victim pulls the trigger. \nThey are a weapon where one Cambodian told me, in their country they \ncleared their landmines with an arm and a leg at a time.\n  I am proud to support the President, the Vice President, and the rest \nof the administration on the Chemical Weapons Convention. But I hope \nthat they will soon take the same position on antipersonnel landmines \nand say, let us bring together the like-minded states--and there are \nmany who are ready to join in a treaty to ban them, join with them, and \nthen put the pressure on the other countries like Russia and China and \nso on who will take longer to do it.\n  If American children were being torn to pieces every day on their way \nto school, or while playing in their backyards, we would have made it a \ncrime long ago. It is an outrage that should shock the conscience of \nevery one of us.\n  So I am going to vote to advise and consent to the Chemical Weapons \nConvention so the President can ratify it and to exert the leadership \nnecessary to help rid the world of the scourge of chemical weapons. I \nlook forward to ratification and to the implementation legislation to \nmake the treaty a reality.\n  And I will also continue to work to convince the administration this \nis the kind of leadership we need if we are to rid the world of \nantipersonnel landmines--a scourge every bit as horrifying as chemical \nweapons, frankly, Mr. President, a scourge that is killing more people \ntoday and tomorrow and last year and next year, and on and on, than \nchemical weapons. We should be leading the world's nations to end the \ndestruction and death caused each day by landmines, not sitting on the \nsidelines.\n  I will conclude, Mr. President, by quoting from a letter to President \nClinton signed by 15 of this country's most distinguished military \nofficers, including Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf; former Supreme Allied \nCommander John Galvin; former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, David \nJones, and others. They said:\n\n       We view such a ban [on antipersonnel landmines] as not only \n     humane, but also militarily responsible.\n\n  I quote further:\n\n       The rationale for opposing antipersonnel landmines is that \n     they are in a category similar to poison gas. . . . they are \n     insidious in that their indiscriminate effects . . . cause \n     casualties among innocent people. . . .\n\n  They said further:\n\n       Given the wide range of weaponry available to military \n     forces today, antipersonnel landmines are not essential. \n     Thus, banning them would not undermine the military \n     effectiveness or safety of our forces, nor those of other \n     nations.\n\n  Mr. President, every single argument the administration has made in \nfavor of us joining the Chemical Weapons Convention could be made to \nask us to go to Ottawa to sign a treaty banning antipersonnel \nlandmines. Because by doing that, we would have 90 percent of the \nnations of this world pressuring the remaining 10 percent, and that \npressure would be enormous.\n  I reserve the balance--\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. May I inquire, Mr. President, from the Senator from \nVermont, there are a couple of us here who have requested some time. In \nfact, I know my colleague from California has made a similar request. \nMy colleague from Maryland also has. I ask if our colleague from \nVermont would be willing to yield us some time off his time. We could \nmake some remarks and maybe expedite this process.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I intend to be speaking again further on \nthis. I have 27 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a correction of the time. You \nactually have 32 minutes left.\n  Mr. DODD. I needed 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could have 7 minutes, I would ask the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, 7 \nminutes to the Senator from California, and withhold the balance of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  I appreciate my friend from Connecticut allowing me to proceed. I may \nnot use the full 7 minutes. I will try to be very concise.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support for ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention. And I base my support on four main facts.\n  First, the Chemical Weapons Convention is in the national security \ninterests of the United States of America because it reduces the \nlikelihood that American soldiers or civilians will ever face a \nchemical weapons attack.\n  We should not lose sight of why this is so important. The effects of \nchemical weapons are so barbaric, so devastating, that we must do all \nwe can to ensure that they are never used again.\n  Chemical weapons are among the most horrible devices ever conceived. \nIf they do not kill their victims instantly, chemical weapons invade \nthe respiratory system making it unbearably painful to breathe. When \nchemical weapons were used in Iraq by Saddam Hussein, against the \nKurds, eyewitnesses reported that the pain was so great that many \nvictims submerged themselves in nearby rivers to escape the spreading \ngas.\n  Mr. President, we are a civilized Nation here. We must do all we can \nto prevent this torture. And approving the CWC is a major step. I know \nmany of my colleagues had questions. I know that Senator Biden and \nothers have worked tirelessly to address those problems. And I feel \nwhat we will have before us, if we defeat the killer amendments, the \nfive killer amendments, will lead us to a far more civilized world.\n  All signatory nations of the CWC agree never again to manufacture \nchemical weapons, nor to use them in war. They agree to destroy all \nexisting stockpiles of chemical weapons. They agree to allow \ninspections of chemical plants to verify that no weapons are being \nmanufactured illegally.\n  To those who say there are some nations who may not sign on, we know \nthat is so. I will say this: If we sign this treaty and we are a party \nto it, it will be far more difficult for nonsignatory nations to \ndevelop chemical weapons. This is the case because rogue states will \nfind it far more difficult to import the raw materials and \nmanufacturing equipment they need to develop chemical weapons.\n  Another reason, the second reason: If the United States fails to \nratify the convention, it will still go into effect, but it will be \nweaker. It will be weaker because many nations will stay off this \ntreaty and, therefore, there will be fewer who are actually bound by \nit. Also, our inspectors will not be on the team to go and search for \npossible CWC violations. Our inspectors are among the best in the \nworld, and they will give us confidence as to the true state of \nchemical weapons production. Why would we want to stay off a treaty \nthat will go forward that will not have our inspectors on those teams?\n  Third, failure to ratify will hurt American business. The CWC imposes \ntrade sanctions against nonsignatory nations that limit the ability of \ntheir chemical industries to export many of their products overseas. It \ncould cost our companies hundreds of millions of dollars every year. \nNow, opponents say that the CWC would impose additional regulations on \nan already heavily regulated industry, our chemical industry. They \nargue the convention will result in vast new compliance costs. But when \nyou take the compliance costs of $250,000 to $2 million for the entire \nindustry, that is a small price to pay compared to the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars that would be lost if sanctions were imposed.\n  The vast majority of the chemical industries strongly supports the \nCWC. U.S. chemical companies advised the\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\nReagan and Bush administrations throughout the original CWC \nnegotiations. Leading U.S. chemical trade associations support the CWC. \nThey know the costs of compliance are small and the risks to industry \nare great if we fail to ratify.\n  Fourth, failure to ratify will undermine our credibility, America's \ncredibility, in the world. Imagine a treaty that was brought forward by \nRonald Reagan, continued toward the goal line by George Bush, and now a \nDemocrat President, following a legacy of those two Republican \nPresidents, wanting to take this over the goal line, and suddenly we \nare going to back off. It seems to me our credibility is absolutely at \nstake here. I believe we should not back away from this treaty. We \nshould pass it and defeat the killer amendments.\n  Mr. President, to those who raise all sorts of flags about this \ntreaty, we should understand this: We could always exercise our right \nto withdraw from the convention on 90 days' notice. This right to \nwithdraw is guaranteed to all signatory nations by article XVI of the \nCWC.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ngenerosity, and my friend from Connecticut. I join with them. The CWC \nis in our national interests. It will enhance national security, \nprotect American jobs; it will help maintain our position of global \nleadership; and, my friends, most important of all, it really will \nprotect the world from the most horrible, horrible weapons of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Vermont \nfor his generosity in yielding time.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I included some extensive remarks in the \nRecord regarding the overall treaty. I let those remarks speak for \nthemselves today.\n  First, I begin by commending our colleagues, the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Helms; the ranking Democrat on the \ncommittee, Senator Biden; the majority leader, Senator Lott; and the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, for working out the arrangements of \nthis treaty so we can come up for a vote prior to the April 29 \ndeadline.\n  Let me also say, Mr. President, while there are disagreements--and \nthere will be over the ultimate decision of whether or not to support \nthe treaty--I think the debate and the process we have gone through has \nbeen healthy. I suspect those who are deeply involved in the workings \nof this treaty have improved it. So I commend all of our colleagues for \nthe work they have done on this particular effort. I think it is how \nthe Senate of the United States ought to conduct its business when it \ncomes to matters dealing with obligations to commit our country for \nmany years to come. It was no mistake that our Founding Fathers \nrequired supermajorities to commit this Nation to international \narrangements, and the fact that we require supermajorities for \ntreaties, I think, is worthwhile.\n  Mr. President, I want to focus my attention, if I can, on the first \namendment that will be raised here. The amendment will strike a \ncondition in the treaty that has been included by Senator Helms. I am \ngoing to oppose condition 30, which I believe will be the first vote we \nwill cast. This is the rogue states condition. I will explain what that \nmeans and express why I think it ought to be struck from this treaty in \nthe brief time I have available to me.\n  Mr. President, we must ask only one question today. We must ask: Is \nthis treaty in the best interests of our country? That is our \nobligation as Members of the U.S. Senate. That is the question which we \nmust address. This condition 30, the rogue states condition, I think, \nis not in the best interests of the United States. I think it would \nprohibit the United States from ratifying the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. It would prohibit us, of course, from ratifying the \nconvention until nations such as North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iraq \nratify the treaty.\n  More than any of the other conditions we will vote on, Mr. President, \nlater today, this condition would delay indefinitely, in my view, the \nratification of this treaty. The so-called rogue states condition would \nforce the United States of America to wait until all of the pariah \nstates of the world ratify before we, ourselves, would accept the \ntreaty that we, ourselves negotiated.\n  There is a reason, Mr. President, that we use the words rogue and \npariah to describe these countries such as North Korea, Libya, Iran. \nThese are the nations that are the loners in the international arena \nand who routinely disregard international opinion in pursuing their own \ninterests. These rogue nations, these renegade nations, have never \ngiven weight to world opinion. There is no reason to expect that they \nwill have a change of heart any time soon. Waiting for these rogue \nstates to accept this treaty is literally like waiting for Godot.\n  Let it be known, then, that a vote against striking this condition \nis, in my view, without any question whatever, a vote to prohibit U.S. \nparticipation in the Chemical Weapons Convention. If we include, Mr. \nPresident, this condition 30, the rogue states condition, we might as \nwell include a condition that requires ratification by every single \nnation on Earth before we ratify, for these are, indeed, the very last \nnations that would ever accept this treaty. That is because these \nnations, these rogue nations, fear this treaty and the international \ndetermination that it demonstrates.\n  Our country, Mr. President, has decided unilaterally to destroy its \naging chemical weapons stockpile by the year 2004. That is a decision \nwe have already made. Regardless of what other nations do, we have \ndecided to take ourselves out of the chemical weapons business \nunilaterally, and yet the assumption under this faulty condition is \nthat we must not disarm until other nations with chemical weapons or \nchemical weapons capability disarm as well.\n  We must be clear, Mr. President, that having agreed, ourselves, to \ndestroy our chemical weapons, this treaty deals with whether or not we \ncan act with the backing of the world to bring other nations to do the \nsame. As Secretary Albright has said very simply, ``This treaty is \nabout other nations' chemical weapons, not our own.'' We will destroy, \nMr. President, our weapons because they are no longer needed. So this \nidea that we must wait for other nations to ratify this treaty, I \nbelieve, is fatally flawed.\n  This convention would establish an international norm that will allow \nus to pressure rogue states who decide they would rather keep and \nenhance their chemical weapons stockpile. On the basis of what we now \nknow about the Persian Gulf war, that many thousands of this Nation's \ntroops may have been exposed to chemical agents, we must not pass up \nthe chance, in my view, to establish a norm that would have made it far \nmore difficult for Iraq to have the weapons in the first place. \nRemember, Mr. President, there is no law that bars a nation from \nbuilding, stockpiling, upgrading, or transferring their chemical \nweapons. In fact, when Iraq used chemical weapons against the Kurds, as \nheinous an act as it was, the Iraqis did not even violate the Geneva \nProtocol because they did not use the agents in an international \nconflict.\n  What we need today, Mr. President, is a new agreement. This \nconvention goes much farther in establishing a basis for international \naction against chemical weapons themselves.\n  I further object, Mr. President, to this rogue states condition \nbecause we should not allow our foreign policy decisions to be dictated \nby rogue states--by a Libya, a North Korea, and an Iraq. Let us \nremember that the negotiating teams of President Reagan and President \nBush anticipated the likelihood that rogue nations would not accept \nthis treaty. That is why President Reagan's and President Bush's teams \nincluded sanctions, when they wrote this treaty, against nations that \nremained outside of this treaty. This condition 30, the rogue states \ncondition, insults those negotiating teams that worked so hard and with \nsuch great foresight on this very treaty. It assumes that they were so \nshortsighted that they did not anticipate that rogue nations would \noppose it. That is not the case. The truth, again, is that the \nnegotiators knew very well that these rogue nations would look upon \nthis treaty as something that they would have to oppose, so we and \nother nations demanded that these renegade nations be penalized.\n  How ironic it is, Mr. President, that unless the United States \nstrikes this\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\nrogue states condition, we now will be penalized ourselves. Germany, I \npoint out, has already indicated its intent to impose the sanctions \nagainst nonparticipants that this treaty mandates.\n\n  Let us be aware, Mr. President, we live in a new world. Scholars use \nthe words ``multipolar'' and ``post-nationalist'' to describe today's \nworld. Other nations are increasingly capable of taking action without \nour leadership, regretfully I might add. Those who think this treaty \nwill not go into effect without our ratification are thinking of an \nolder world, of the days when the United States declined to participate \nin the League of Nations and it failed as a result. Mr. President, that \nwas over three-quarters of a century ago. Let me assure my colleagues \nthat to the extent we isolate ourselves today, our country will pay a \nprice tomorrow.\n  The question before us this hour with this condition that will come \nup shortly, is, will we allow a group of rogue, renegade nations to \ndisengage the United States from the international community on this \nissue of chemical weapons?\n  Mr. President, when this Nation allows itself to be held back by the \nshortsightedness, the evil of other nations, we make a huge mistake \nindeed. President Reagan did not wait for other nations when he took \nthe first step forward on the matter of chemical weapons by declaring \nthat the United States would unilaterally destroy its chemical weapons \nstockpile. President Reagan did not wait for other nations when he \ninitiated negotiations to ban chemical weapons from this Earth. \nPresident Bush did not wait for other nations to sign this treaty. \nPresidents Reagan and Bush did not follow others in making those \ncritical decisions. We led, as great nations must, and others have \nfallen in behind us. Our Nation set the example. Now it is time for us \nto set the example once again.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we must keep in mind that opponents of this \ntreaty argue both sides of the issue. On the one hand, they argue that \nrogue states will reap great benefits from the technology and \nintelligence available to them as participants in this treaty.\n  That argument assumes that these nations can't wait to participate in \nthis treaty. Yet, on the other hand, this condition that we will vote \non assumes that rogue states will avoid participating in this treaty.\n  If parties to this treaty pick up such a technological advantage, why \naren't these rogue nations crawling over themselves to ratify the \ntreaty? They should be the first in line if that is the case. Why then \ndo we need this condition?\n  The truth is, Mr. President, that rogue nations fear this convention \nand this treaty. Waiting for them to ratify is absurd. No one expects \nthem to ratify, so we should at least become a party to a treaty that \nwill severely restrict the flow of chemicals to those nations, rather \nthan assisting them by a reluctance to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment to strike, and I \nurge the adoption of the treaty itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico and asks, who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to my friend from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first let me say that I believe the \nSenate has done itself proud with reference to the debate and \nparticipation of our Members in this series of debates and discussions \nregarding this treaty. When you add to it the closed session we had \ntoday, I think every Senator has had an ample opportunity to thoroughly \nunderstand this situation. I believe when the day ends and you have \nheard all of that, the overwhelming majority of the U.S. Senators are \ngoing to vote to ratify this treaty. I believe they are going to do \nthat not because it is perfect, but because the world is better off and \nwe are better off if we have this treaty than if we don't.\n  Having said that, while the world has set about to perfect chemical \nweapons, there is nothing new about this. In fact, I can remember, as a \nvery small boy, a great uncle who was a totally disabled American \nveteran. He was an Italian immigrant taken into the First World War. He \nserved in the U.S. Army, and he was the victim of mustard gas. In that \nwar, the Germans used mustard gas, a chemical weapon on the front, on \nthe lines. Many Americans received toxic doses. In fact, this great \nuncle of mine, as I indicated, collected veteran benefits for his \nentire life for a total disability because of the mustard gas being \nused in World War I.\n  Science has perfected weapons beyond mustard gas, and the world lives \nunder three scourges today. One is the possible proliferation of \nnuclear weapons; another is the proliferation of chemical weapons, and \nthe third is the proliferation of biological weapons. Now, we have \nattempted in the past, starting with President Eisenhower, to do \nsomething about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. While we haven't \nsucceeded in totality, we have clearly succeeded beyond anything men of \nthat day thought. It was not perfect. There were those who wanted to \nargue about it because it was not perfect, but we could not have ended \nan entire era without Atoms for Peace and everything that came with it. \nHaving said that, let me suggest that we probably won't find a way to \nenter into an international treaty on biological weapons. They are \nprincipally weapons of terrorists.\n  Let me talk about this treaty and tell the Senate in my own way why I \nam for it. First of all, I think it is an imperative. Even though it \nwas said before, I say this one more time. Frankly, the reason this \ntreaty exists is because we are trying--the United States of America--\nto set in motion in the world a security and arms control treaty, and \nthe overreaching question is: Will we be better off or worse off if we \ncommit to its terms?\n  Now, this is not a treaty that is going to prevent terrorists from \nusing chemicals as weapons if they see fit. This is more of a treaty \nthat addresses itself to the military use of these kinds of drastic \nweapons. Now, it is not perfect, but let me suggest the second \nprinciple that everybody should know, including those Americans who \nworry about this treaty: America has already committed to totally \ndestroying all of its chemical weapons. President Ronald Reagan, many \nyears ago, said, let's get rid of one kind of weapon, leaving only one \nleft over. President Bush also agreed to get rid of them. America is \nnow on a path to get rid of them in 10 years. All of this discussion \nhas not changed that. So when we talk about the dangers to America, it \nshould be understood that we have already decided that on our own. We \nwant to get rid of them either because we think that is in our best \ninterest--I would assume that is the case--and/or we think it is better \nfor the world that we not have any because we think the world may \nfollow our example.\n\n  Having said that, it seems to me that, with the United States having \nagreed to destroy all of their weapons of this type, we ought to look \nat the treaty and ask, is it apt to work its will on the rest of the \nworld quicker and better than if we didn't have it? In everything I \nhear, everything I have read, in discussions with scientists that \nworked on it, including some of the top scientists who negotiated this \nagreement, they have all said that, even with its defects, the CWC is \nmore apt than not to bring the rest of the world to the same conclusion \nthat America has come to. They support that we might get to a point \nwhere there are none of these weapons around sooner rather than later \nif we have this treaty, as compared with no treaty.\n  There are all kinds of nuances that one can talk about as you look at \nsomething as complicated as this. But I think, fundamentally, the issue \nis: what is best for the United States after we have committed to \ndestroy our chemical weapons, is it better that we have the treaty or \nnot? From everything I can tell, the 28 conditions that have been \nagreed upon are good clarifying language and many contain protections \nto our private property rights that we may have assumed early on would \nnot be violated. But then we got concerned with the CWC and properly \nso. Now, there is going to be some judicial process to be required \nbefore inspections can occur. I believe we now will protect private \nfacilities as well as public facilities like our national laboratories \nthrough requirements for search warrants as part of the language that \nSenator Helms agreed on with our staff.\n  In summary, it seems to this Senator that if we join with other \ncountries and begin moving to implement this treaty,\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\nthat we are better off with it than without it. Will it be difficult to \nget everyone in the world to agree with our position--the civil \nposition of moral, decent leaders? I am not sure. But the question is, \nwill it be any easier, or are we apt to succeed better, without the \ntreaty? I am convinced that such is not the case.\n  Now, Mr. President, there are so many Senators to thank, but I say to \nJon Kyl, whose position I don't agree with, that I don't believe \nanybody has done a better job on something as complicated as this since \nI have been in the Senate, which is now 25 years. I compliment him for \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the able Senator from Delaware, and I commend \nhim for his extraordinary leadership with respect to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. I know personally of the time and effort he has \ndevoted to this cause. We are all in his debt.\n  Mr. President, it is now less than a week before a landmark treaty--\none which the United States led the world in negotiating--goes into \neffect internationally. The Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by \nPresident Bush on January 13, 1993, has now been ratified by 74 \ncountries. The eyes of the world are upon the United States as we \ndecide whether or not to join them.\n  It would be a major mistake if this treaty were to go into effect \nwithout us. Worse yet, if we fail to ratify, we could be jeopardizing \nour best chance to eliminate the chemical weapons that some day would \nbe used against us.\n\n  This is a treaty that was advanced, negotiated, and signed by \nRepublican Presidents, with the encouragement, in 1989, of some 75 U.S. \nSenators. What a mistake it would be if the Senate were to forfeit this \nopportunity to protect American security, promote American interests \nand preserve American leadership.\n  If we fail to ratify the CWC, we will have done just that. If the \nSenate does not approve this historic treaty, our economic and security \ninterests will suffer. Despite widespread and continuing bipartisan \nsupport for this treaty, despite support from some of our Nation's \noutstanding military leaders--such as General Shalikashvili and former \nChairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, Admiral Crowe, \nGeneral Vessey, and General Jones--some of my colleagues argue that \nthis convention does not serve our security interests.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is an unprecedented international \nagreement designed to eliminate an entire class of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Unlike earlier protocols that prohibit only the use of \nchemical weapons, this convention aims at stopping their production, \ntransfer, and storage by providing incentives for participation, \nverification of compliance, and penalties for violation. The United \nStates is the only major industrialized country not to have ratified it \nyet. Our participation is critical to its ultimate success.\n  This convention will not make the threat of chemical weapons \nautomatically disappear from the face of the Earth. But it will \nconstrain their proliferation and make it harder for rogue regimes and \nterrorists to gain access to them. By increasing the legal, moral, and \nfinancial costs of acquiring chemical weapons, it will deter covert \nchemical weapons programs and increase the likelihood they will be \ndiscovered.\n  There are three major reasons why this treaty will serve American \ninterests and why a failure to ratify it could have severe \nrepercussions.\n  First, the convention requires other nations to do something we \nalready plan to do--destroy chemical arsenals. Under a law first signed \nby President Reagan, the United States will eliminate our current \nstockpile of chemical weapons by the year 2004, independent of what \nhappens in this treaty. Our own military thinks that is a wise thing to \ndo, even on a unilateral basis. The convention will simply ensure that \nothers do the same.\n  In other words, this is not a debate over eliminating our own \nchemical weapons. We are already programmed to do so. This is a \nquestion of whether we can establish a regime that will require other \ncountries to destroy their chemical weapons and stop building new ones. \nThat is why Admiral Zumwalt had stated, militarily, this treaty will \nmake us stronger.\n  It is not enough, however, to ask other nations to ratify the treaty. \nWe must do so ourselves. Today, we have an opportunity to lead the \nworld in abolishing these terrible weapons, rather than providing \nothers with an excuse not to do so. If we do not adopt this treaty, or \nif we add crippling amendments, we will have single-handedly undermined \nthe hope of ridding the world of this deadly scourge and of reducing \nthe threat to our own citizens.\n  The second major reason to ratify this treaty is that it will provide \nus with better information about what other countries are doing in the \nrealm of chemical weapons. We know the verification regime is not \nperfect. The verification regime is never perfect in any treaty. There \nmay be states that try to cheat on this agreement and others that \nrefuse to sign it. But if we are party to the treaty, we will have an \nopportunity to investigate and sanction potential violations. We will \ntake part in the organization established to monitor implementation, \nand we will help enforce its rules and procedures. As former CIA \nDirector James Woolsey noted, ``We will know more about the state of \nchemical warfare preparations in the world with the treaty than we \nwould know without it.''\n  Moreover, once we ratify the treaty we will be in a better position \nto do something about noncompliance. The CWC throws the force of world \npublic opinion behind the identification and exposure of violators. Any \nviolations that are discovered will be made widely known and receive \nuniversal condemnation. We will be able to punish violators through \nmultilateral action, rather than going it alone, or trying to convince \nthe world that our suspicions are correct without revealing our \nintelligence sources. As former Secretary of State Christopher \nexplained, ``By ratifying the Convention, we will add the force and \nweight of the entire international community to our efforts.''\n  The third reason we must ratify this treaty is that a failure to do \nso will put U.S. chemical manufacturers at a serious competitive \ndisadvantage. Once the CWC enters into force--which will happen next \nTuesday, with or without U.S. participation--chemical manufacturers in \ncountries that have not ratified will find themselves faced with \ninternational economic sanctions. These companies will be required to \nobtain end-user certificates for the sale of certain chemicals abroad, \nand after 3 years, they will not be able to export those chemicals at \nall. The United States will be treated on a par with rogue states, who \nwill no longer be trusted to conduct normal, commercial trade in \nchemicals.\n  These dismal scenarios were certainly on the minds of the chief \nexecutives of 53 of the Nation's largest chemical firms last August, \nwhen they expressed their concern in a joint statement, warning: ``Our \nindustry's status as the world's preferred supplier of chemical \nproducts may be jeopardized if the United States does not ratify the \nConvention. If the Senate does not vote in favor of the CWC, we stand \nto lose hundreds of millions of dollars in overseas sales, putting at \nrisk thousands of good-paying American jobs.'' American chemical \ncompanies have indicated a willingness to comply with inspections under \nthe treaty because they are not conducting illegal activity, and \nbecause they helped to design the treaty's inspection regime so that it \nwould not threaten legitimate business secrets or compromise \nproprietary information.\n  Earlier this year, President Bush reaffirmed his support for \nratification, telling reporters the treaty should transcend \npartisanship. ``I think it is vitally important for the United States \nto be out front, not to be dragged, kicking, and screaming to the \nfinish line on that question. We do not need chemical weapons, and we \nought to get out front and make clear that we are opposed to others \nhaving them.''\n  The CWC has been before the Senate for consideration for nearly 4 \nyears now, providing ample opportunity for examination. Last year, \nafter exhaustive hearings and review, it was reported favorably by the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, but not brought to a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\n  Over the past few weeks a new series of hearings has been held, in \nopen and in closed session, and all perspectives have been thoroughly \naired. The administration has worked in good faith to negotiate a new \nresolution of ratification that addresses the earlier concerns and \nmore, including 28 agreed conditions, declarations, statements, and \nunderstandings. The remaining five conditions that have been proposed \nwill undercut and place in jeopardy the effectiveness of this treaty, \nand I urge my colleagues to reject them.\n  The conditions to which the administration has already agreed will \nresolve every legitimate concern that has been raised. I would urge my \ncolleagues not to vote for pending amendments that would require \nrenegotiation, delay, or abrogation of the CWC. If we don't take this \nopportunity to begin abolishing these terrible weapons, we will rue the \nday and have only ourselves to blame.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe it is very much \nin our national interests to ratify this treaty, after we strike five \nconditions in the resolution of ratification.\n  Let me first express my respect and appreciation for the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Biden. He and his staff have really done the heavy lifting in \ngetting this treaty to the floor, including many long hours of \nnegotiations on the package of 28 agreed conditions.\n  I also want to express my respect for the opponents of this treaty, \nincluding the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. I have worked well with \nSenator Kyl on many issues, including, at the moment, our strong effort \nto pass a Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution.\n  I know that in this debate these Senators are motivated by their \ngenuine and deeply felt concern for America's national security. \nHowever, I must disagree with the view that we would be better off \nwithout this treaty, or by passing a resolution of ratification that \nessentially renders the treaty meaningless.\n  Mr. President, the threat of chemical weapons falling into the hands \nof terrorists, or being used as a weapon of war by a rogue state, has \nincreased dramatically in recent years.\n  One need only reflect on the dangers faced by our military by Iraq's \nincipient chemical weapons program during the gulf war, or the \ntragedies our Nation has suffered with the bombing of the World Trade \nCenter, the Federal building in Oklahoma City, and the Olympic Park in \nAtlanta, to fully appreciate the dangers posed by the proliferation of \nchemical weapons. In each of these cases, the tragedy and loss of life \ncould have been magnified significantly had chemical weapons been used.\n  The people of Japan know this first-hand. The deadly sarin gas attack \ncarried out in the Tokyo subway system by the Aum Shunrikio cult was \ntestimony to the power of even a relatively small amount of chemical \nweapons.\n  Chemical weapons are among the most barbaric of mankind's inventions. \nThey are so awful, that the United States, by act of Congress, has \ndecided to eliminate our own stocks of these weapons by 2004. They are \ndesigned to kill and incapacitate by causing such effects as skin \nblistering, blindness, lung damage, choking, nervous system disruption, \nparalysis, or oxygen starvation. Because of the ease of their dispersal \nover a wide area, chemical weapons are especially useful for targeting \ncivilian populations.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is the most far-reaching attempt ever \nby the international community to control the spread of chemical \nweapons. It bans for the first time the development, production, and \npossession of chemical weapons and reinforces the international norm \nagainst their use. Since we are destroying our own chemical weapons, it \nonly makes sense that we should want other nations to do so as well.\n  The convention requires all signatory states to declare and destroy \nany chemical weapons and the facilities used to produce them. It \nrequires member states to submit annual reports on the production and \nuse of certain sensitive chemicals. This information, combined with our \nown intelligence resources, will significantly improve our ability to \nmonitor and prevent illegal transfers and uses of such chemicals.\n  Once the CWC takes effect, it will make it much harder and more \ncostly for proliferators and terrorists to acquire chemical weapons. An \nintrusive verification system will be set up to detect violations. \nSanctions will be imposed against nations that refuse to participate, \nmaking it more difficult for them to acquire precursor chemicals for \npoison gas and easier to monitor their efforts to do so.\n  The intelligence-sharing and global verification network that will \nresult from this treaty will increase the chances that terrorist \nattacks involving chemical weapons can be prevented before they ever \noccur--a net gain in the security of our troops and our citizens.\n  Now, a number of very serious concerns have been raised about the \nCWC. I myself have shared some of these concerns. I will not speak to \nevery criticism of the treaty, but I want to address some of these \nconcerns now, because I believe very solid answers have been provided \nto virtually all of them.\n\n  Verification: Critics of the CWC have complained that it is not \nverifiable, and that it will be easy for nations who sign up to the \ntreaty to cheat without getting caught.\n  We must start with the proposition that no arms control agreement is \n100-percent verifiable. But with the CWC, we will know far more about \nwho is trying to develop chemical weapons, where, and how than we would \nwithout the treaty. That is why the intelligence community has \nconsistently testified that, while the treaty is not completely \nverifiable, they regard it as a highly desirable tool that will enhance \nour knowledge of chemical weapons programs and our ability to stop \nthem.\n  The CWC's verification regime requires routine inspections of all \ndeclared facilities working with significant amounts of chemicals \nlisted by the treaty. In addition, any site, declared or not, may be \nsubject to short-notice challenge inspections if there are suspicions \nthat it is being used to produce or store banned chemicals.\n  The CWC also establishes significant trade restrictions on precursor \nchemicals. These restrictions will make it more difficult for nations \nwho are not parties to the treaty to acquire these chemicals, and will \nprovide us with much more information than we currently have about who \nis seeking to import such chemicals, and in what amounts.\n  So the concern about verification, while valid, I believe has been \nmore than adequately addressed. We must go into this treaty with our \neyes open, aware that it will not detect every violation. But why would \nwe deprive ourselves of the extremely useful tools and information this \ntreaty would provide on the grounds that they are not fool-proof? It \nwould be incredibly short-sighted to do so.\n  Sharing Defense Technologies: During one of the hearings in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, the concern was \nraised that Article X of the CWC would require the United States to \nshare advanced chemical defense technologies with rogue nations like \nIran, who may sign and ratify the treaty. If indeed the treaty required \nthat, there would be significant grounds for concern. But I believe the \nconcern is overstated.\n  In an April 22 letter to me, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger \nmakes it very clear that Article X of the CWC would impose no \nobligation on the United States to assist Iran with its chemical \nweapons defense capabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Berger's letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Berger makes clear that paragraph 7 of Article X, \nwhich spells out the obligations of States Parties to assist others \nthreatened by chemical weapons, would require the United States to \nprovide nothing more than medical antidotes and treatments to any state \nwe deemed unreliable. We have the option to provide more advanced \nassistance to those nations we trust, but no obligation.\n  The administration is so comfortable with this reading of the treaty, \nthat, in their negotiations with Senator Helms\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\nand with the Majority Leader's task force on the CWC, they have agreed \nto a binding condition (number 15) that would ensure that the United \nStates will not provide any assistance other than medical assistance to \nany rogue nation that becomes a party to the treaty.\n  Another concern about Article X is that paragraph 3, which calls for \nparties to ``facilitate . . . the fullest possible exchange'' of \ninformation and technology on protection against chemical weapons, \nwould require the United States to share such equipment with rogue \nnations who sign and ratify the treaty.\n  The administration has made clear that the use of the words \n``facilitate'' and ``possible'' in this paragraph mean that we will \ndetermine whether any specific exchange is appropriate, and we will not \npursue those we deem inappropriate. In making these decisions, we will \ndo nothing to undermine our national export controls.\n  With these assertions in hand, I am satisfied that the United States \nwill in no way be obligated to provide chemical weapons technology to \nany nation we deem to be untrustworthy.\n  Some have also raised the concern that Article X might induce other, \nless conscientious nations, to supply rogue states with defense \ntechnologies. But there is nothing that prevents those sales from \ntaking place today, with no CWC in effect.\n  With the CWC, the countries who make exchanges allowed in Article X \nare legally bound by the treaty's overriding principle, stated in \nArticle I, that they can do nothing to ``assist, encourage, or induce, \nin any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State \nParty under this Convention.''\n\n  In addition, the CWC would provide us with far more ability to \nscrutinize any exchanges than we have today. The result is a net \nincrease, not decrease, in our knowledge of defense exchanges with \nrogue nations, and our ability to address any compliance concerns that \nmay arise from these exchanges.\n  Cooperation on Chemical Technology: Another concern that has been \nraised involves Article XI. Some have suggested that Article XI, which \ndeals with cooperation in chemical activities not prohibited by the \ntreaty, would require the United States to provide other nations with \naccess to our dual-use technologies and manufacturing secrets. Here \nagain, the concern is unwarranted.\n  Article XI does aim to ensure that parties to the treaty can conduct \nlegitimate chemical commerce, which is reasonable. But in his April 22 \nletter, Mr. Berger explains that this article does not require the \nUnited States, or any U.S. company, to provide any confidential \nbusiness information to any foreign party.\n  As to the concern that Article XI will undercut export controls, \nindeed, the reverse is true. Mr. Berger makes clear that the all U.S. \nexport controls now in effect are fully consistent with the CWC. In \naddition, our allies in the Australia Group, all 28 of them, have \npledged to maintain all existing multilateral export controls, which \nthey agree are fully consistent with the CWC.\n  Here again, the problem identified by critics of the CWC would \nactually be worse without the treaty. The CWC will allow us to better \nmonitor chemical commerce that occurs today without our knowledge. It \nwill also provide the basis for further multilateral efforts to control \nexports, above and beyond our own existing export controls and those of \nthe Australia Group.\n  To address the concerns raised about Article XI, the Administration \nhas agreed to a binding condition (number 7) that the President must \ncertify now and on an annual basis that the Australia Group is \ncontinuing to effectively control chemical exports and remains a viable \nmechanism for doing so.\n  According to this condition, the President must also certify that \nnothing in the CWC obligates the United States to weaken our own export \ncontrols, and that each member of the Australia Group remains committed \nto maintaining current export controls.\n  With this condition added to the resolution of ratification, I \nbelieve concerns about Article XI can be laid aside.\n  In fact, the negotiations between the Administration and Senator \nBiden on the one hand, and Senator Helms and the Lott task force on the \nother, have been remarkably successful in addressing the concerns that \nhave been raised about the treaty.\n  In all, 28 conditions have been agreed to in these negotiations, on \nsubjects ranging from verification and Articles X and XI, to \nCongressional prerogatives in providing funding for the OPCW; the \nestablishment of an inspector general at the OPCW; safeguards on \nintelligence sharing; the Senate's role in reviewing future treaty \namendments; constitutional protections in the inspection of U.S. \nfacilities; our armed forces' continued ability to use non-lethal riot \ncontrol agents, such as tear gas; and maintaining robust U.S. chemical \ndefense capabilities.\n  With all of these conditions agreed to, there are only five areas \nremaining in dispute. One would think we were near the point of a \nvirtually unanimous vote to ratify the CWC.\n  And yet, we still hear charges that the administration is \n``stonewalling.'' That is simply not the case. Far from stonewalling, \nthe administration has worked very hard to address the Senate's \nconcerns. But it appears that some people simply do not to want to take \nyes for an answer.\n  And so, we have five conditions in this resolution of ratification \nwhich the Administration has identified as ``killer'' conditions. These \nconditions would make our ratification of this treaty meaningless, \nbecause they would either gut central provisions of the treaty, or set \nup unachievable goals that must be met for us to deposit our \ninstruments of ratification. They should all be defeated.\n  Let me briefly address each of these killer conditions:\n  Condition 29 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the CWC \nuntil Russia ratifies it and takes a series of other actions to comply \nwith past agreements.\n  Besides holding United States foreign policy hostage to a group of \nhardliners in the Russian Duma, this condition ignores the fact that \nthe CWC provides precisely the tools that would be helpful in detecting \nRussian violations of this and past treaties. It also gives Russia an \neasy excuse to delay ratification itself. On the grounds of self-\ninterest, this condition shoots ourselves in the foot.\n  Condition 30 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the CWC \nuntil rogue states such as North Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, and Iraq \nhave ratified it. By accepting this treaty, we allow these rogue \nregimes to set the standards of international conduct. It is the \nequivalent of saying that we should not outlaw drug smuggling because \nsome people will still smuggle drugs.\n  By ratifying the CWC, the United States will make it easier to forge \ninternational coalitions aimed at eliminating the chemical weapons \nprograms of these regimes, even through military force when necessary. \nIt will also set a standard for those nations to meet if and when their \ncurrent regimes are replaced by more responsible ones.\n  Condition 31 requires the United States to reject all CWC inspectors \nfrom countries like Iran and China. This condition is unnecessarily \nrigid. It would prevent us from allowing suspect states from seeing for \nthemselves that we are not violating the treaty. It would also \ncertainly result in American inspectors being excluded from inspections \nin these countries.\n  A better approach would be to strike this language and enact \nimplementing legislation that would allow Congress a role in \ndetermining which inspectors should be barred, which the CWC allows the \nUnited States to do on a case-by-case basis.\n  Condition 32 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the CWC \nuntil Article X is eliminated and Article XI is amended. This is \ncompletely unrealistic and completely unnecessary. Articles X and XI \nwere included to reassure countries who signed the treaty that they \nwould not be prevented from developing chemical weapons defenses or \nengaging in legitimate chemical commerce.\n  None of the 160 nations who have signed or 74 nations that have \nratified the treaty will agree to renegotiate these provisions at the \neleventh hour. It will simply result in our exclusion from the CWC--\nwhich is clearly the intent.\n  As Gen. Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser to President Bush,\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\ntestified before the Foreign Relations Committee on April 9, 1997: \n``Starting over. . .is pure fantasy. If we reject this treaty, we will \nincur the bitterness of all our friends and allies who followed us for \n10 years in putting this thing together. . . The idea that we can lead \nout again down a different path I think is just not in the cards. We \nhave got to deal with the situation we face now, not an ideal one out \nin the future.''\n  The concerns raised about Articles X and XI--which I shared--have \nbeen more than adequately addressed by the agreed conditions. This is \nwhat I mean about not wanting to take yes for an answer.\n  Condition 33 would prevent the U.S. from ratifying the treaty unless \nthe President can certify with ``high confidence'' that we would be \nable to detect the production or storage of a single metric ton of \nchemical agent.\n  This is an absurdly high standard. The intelligence community has \nconsistently said it could detect ``militarily significant'' cheating, \nbut the production of one ton of agent does not qualify.\n  But the tools created by the CWC will only enhance our abilities to \ndetect these violations. It would be foolish to kill the treaty with a \ncondition like this that makes the perfect the enemy of the good. This \ncondition is not about verification--it is about killing the treaty.\n  Tomorrow, each of these five amendments will be subject to a motion \nto strike. Failing to strike them would be tantamount to killing the \ntreaty. I urge my colleagues to vote for each motion to strike. Those \nwho do not are essentially voting against ratification of the entire \nCWC.\n  Mr. President, I think this debate really comes down to whether or \nnot one supports international arms control agreements. Many of the \ncriticisms of the CWC--such as that it would lull us to sleep, or that \nit is not verifiable--were levied against all previous successful arms \ncontrol treaties, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the \nSTART treaty.\n  Those who worry that the United States will weaken its vigilance in \nour efforts to guard against the threat of chemical weapons have \nactually done us a service. I believe the intensity of this debate has \nhelped to ensure that we will never allow ourselves to believe that the \ntreaty by itself is enough. We will follow the course that President \nReagan did--a strong national defense and arms control agreements with \nverification.\n  The CWC is not a panacea, and none of its proponents believes it is. \nIt will not by itself banish chemical weapons from the earth, but it \nwould result in the destruction of much of the world's chemical weapons \nstocks, and provide us with a valuable set of tools that would \nsignificantly strengthen our ability to monitor and defend against the \nthreat of chemical weapons.\n  Our failure to ratify this treaty would be a grave mistake. The \ntreaty will enter into force on April 29, with or without us. This is \nthe only treaty that there is, and it requires U.S. leadership to make \nit work. Only by being a party to this convention can we make it \nfunction to its fullest possible extent.\n  I believe every Member on this side of the aisle supports this \ntreaty. I urge my Republican colleagues to vote for ratification, after \nvoting to strike the five killer amendments.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am pleased that we were able to \n     talk last week about ratification of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, including the concerns which have been raised \n     about Articles X and XI of the treaty. I would like to take \n     the opportunity to elaborate further on these issues and set \n     the record straight.\n       Regarding Article X, concern has been expressed that this \n     provision might force us or other treaty parties to share \n     advanced chemical defense technologies and equipment with \n     rogue nations like Iran and to assist in the development of \n     CW defense capabilities. This simply is not the case.\n       First, only countries that have joined the CWC and \n     renounced CW can request assistance and only then if they are \n     threatened or attacked with CW. Indeed, the very purpose of \n     Article X is to encourage countries to join the CWC and \n     eliminate their CW programs by providing an assurance of \n     international assistance in the event that they are \n     threatened or attacked with CW by a non-party. For states in \n     good standing under the CWC that do qualify for Article X \n     aid, there is no requirement to provide high tech defenses or \n     even gas masks. The obligation to assist can be satisfied \n     with medical or humanitarian aid. Indeed, the President has \n     committed in an agreed condition on the Resolution of \n     Ratification (Condition #15) that the United States will only \n     give medical help to certain countries of concern, such as \n     Iran or Cuba, under Article X.\n       Second, with regard to the actions of other states, let me \n     point out that countries contemplating any exchanges under \n     Article X are legally bound by the fundamental obligation in \n     Article I of the treaty never ``to assist, encourage or \n     induce in any way anyone to engage in any activity \n     prohibited'' under the Convention. This means that all \n     relevant transfers must be subject to very close scrutiny, \n     especially with countries whose compliance may be in doubt. \n     We will use every instrument of U.S. diplomacy and leverage \n     at our disposal to ensure that transfers do not occur which \n     could undermine U.S. national security interests, including \n     the extensive verification and compliance provisions in the \n     Convention. As Secretary Cohen said on ``Meet the Press'' on \n     Sunday, we will be in a much better position to do this if we \n     are inside the treaty rather than outside. Frankly, other \n     countries will have little incentive to work with us to \n     ensure that inappropriate transfers do not occur if we have \n     not ratified ourselves.\n       Article XI encourages free trade in non-prohibited \n     chemicals among States that join the CWC and renounce any CW \n     capability. Some have charged that this provision might force \n     us or our chemical industry to share dual-use technologies \n     and manufacturing secrets with other countries. Such an \n     interpretation is totally at odds with the plain language of \n     the treaty. It also defies logic to suggest that a treaty \n     expressly devoted to eliminating chemical weapons somehow \n     requires its parties to facilitate the spread of chemical \n     weapons.\n       First, Article XI is explicitly subject to the fundamental \n     ban in Article I on assisting anyone in acquiring chemical \n     weapons. Moreover, in order to reinforce the treaty's \n     constraints against the transfer of dangerous technology, the \n     President has committed in agreed condition #7 in the \n     Resolution of Ratification to obtain official assurances from \n     our Australia Group partners at the highest diplomatic levels \n     that Article XI is fully consistent with maintaining strict \n     export controls on dangerous chemicals and that they are \n     committed to ensuring the Group remains an effective \n     mechanism for dealing with CW proliferation. I would note \n     that this condition also requires annual certification.\n       Second, with the CWC the countries undertaking exchanges \n     are legally bound by the fundamental obligations in Article \n     I. As Ron Lehman, former Arms Control Director under \n     President Bush, recently stated in testimony before the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee: ``We made it very clear \n     throughout the negotiations that all of this was subject to \n     Article I, which is the fundamental obligation not to assist. \n     . . . But the most important, I think, telling fact in \n     support of the U.S. interpretation is the fact that after the \n     Convention was done so many of the usual list of suspects \n     were so unhappy that they did not get what they wanted in \n     these provisions.''\n       I would note, in conclusion, that renegotiation of Articles \n     X and XI of the CWC, as the Helms condition (#32) in the \n     Resolution of Ratification would require, is not a realistic \n     option. This treaty was intensively negotiated for more than \n     10 years. It has been signed by 162 countries and ratified by \n     74. As Brent Scowcroft recently testified, ``Starting over . \n     . . is pure fantasy. If we reject this treaty, we will incur \n     the bitterness of all of our friends and allies who followed \n     us for 10 years in putting this together . . . the idea that \n     we can lead out again down a different path I think is just \n     not in the cards. We have got to deal with the situation we \n     face now, not an ideal one out in the future.'' This is why \n     the Senate must vote to strike this Helms Condition.\n       I hope this information facilitates the Senate's \n     consideration of the CWC and look forward to a successful \n     vote in the coming days.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                    Assistant to the President for\n                                        National Security Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The time will be \nequally divided.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 47\n\n (Purpose: To strike condition no. 30, relating to chemical weapons in \n                             other states)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 47.\n       On page 63, strike lines 8 through 20.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is condition No. 30. As was indicated \nat the outset of the unanimous-consent agreement, the Senate has now \nagreed to 28 of the 33 conditions that were attached to the treaty that \nis before us today.\n  As I indicated at that time that I would be moving to strike five of \nthe conditions, any one of which--at least four of which--if adopted, \nwould essentially vitiate the treaty; would make our ratification \nuseless.\n  They are killer amendments. This is one of those amendments. Mr. \nPresident, condition No. 30 would hold hostage our joining the Chemical \nWeapons Convention to the condition that rogue states--several rogue \nstates, such as Iraq, Libya and North Korea--would have to sign and \nratify the treaty before we became party to the treaty.\n  This has a very perverse impact. The first impact is we wouldn't be \nin the treaty. We would not have ratified the treaty, if we ratified \nthis condition. Second, it has a perverse impact. It would prevent the \nUnited States from participating in the convention until a band of 2-\nbit regimes that specialize in flaunting norms of civilized behavior \ndecide for us when we should be a member of this treaty. Seventy-four \nnations have already signed onto it.\n  This condition turns the present global arrangement on its head. \nInstead of the civilized nations of the world setting the rules, this \ncondition effectively let's the villains determine the rules of the \nroad and American policy. This condition ignores the critical fact that \nregardless of what the rogue states do, regardless of whether we join \nthe CWC, or not, we have decided unilaterally to destroy our chemical \nweapons stockpile.\n  We will not use chemical weapons to respond to a chemical weapons \nattack. That is a judgment our military and our last Commander in Chief \nand this one has made. Instead, we will rely on what General Schwarzkof \nsaid, and General Powell, General Shalikashvili, and others will rely \nupon our overwhelming nonchemical military capabilities to deter and \nretaliate against the use of chemical weapons.\n  The best way to affect the behavior of these rogue states is to bring \nto bear the combined weight of the civilized nations of the world to \nisolate, sanction, and target those nations who would continue to \nproduce chemical weapons in defiance of the creation of this \ninternational norm. But, Mr. President, first we have to establish the \nnorm. If the United States of America says we will not join unless the \nbad guys join, then there is no reasonable prospect that such a norm \nwill be established.\n  As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has noted, to say that we \nshould not have a CWC because there will be people out there who will \ncontinue to produce chemical weapons, or who will cheat, is a little \nbit like saying we should not have laws because people will break them. \nWe should not have laws against murder because we know people are going \nto murder people. So have no laws against murder.\n  The point is that today there is nothing illegal--let's get this \nstraight--under international law about producing chemical weapons, \ndeveloping chemical weapons, or stockpiling chemical weapons. The \npurported Libyan chemical weapons program is completely legal today. \nThe Iraqi chemical stockpile is completely legal today. In fact, there \nis nothing in international law that prohibits the use of chemical \nweapons internally. Like Saddam Hussein's poison gas attack against the \nKurds within Iraq, there is nothing illegal about having or using these \nweapons in your own country. That will change once the CWC is in force.\n  To quote Gen. Colin Powell, ``For us to reject this treaty now \nbecause there are rogue states outside that treaty is the equivalent of \nsaying that we should not have joined NATO because Russia wasn't part \nof NATO.'' That is former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell--\nnot me.\n  This treaty will establish standards by which to judge others. If it \nis violated--that is, if the treaty is violated --it will provide the \nbasis for harsh action to punish and bring violators into compliance. \nThe opponents will say that norms are meaningless unless there is a \nwill to enforce those norms. They are right. But on that point, I would \npoint out that without a norm there is nothing to enforce.\n  The bottom line is this: With the treaty we will have more tools and \ngreater flexibility to act against those countries that threaten us and \ntheir neighbors. Should we choose military action we would be able to \njustify it as a measure taken to enforce the terms of a treaty to which \nwe and 160 other nations who are signatories--only 74 ratified--are \nparties. North Korea is not. Libya is not. But 160 other nations have \nsigned, and we are going to say that we will not join unless North \nKorea joins. As Gen. Colin Powell said, I am glad these folks weren't \naround when NATO was starting up to say we are not going to have NATO \nbecause Russia can't be a part.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of misunderstanding about this treaty. \nIt has been advertised implicitly--not explicitly, of course--as a \ncure-all; as an end to the perils of chemical warfare. And a lot of \npeople think it will all be over, and we will not have any more danger. \nThe truth of the matter is that they will not do a thing in the world \nto help the situation because the Chemical Weapons treaty--Convention, \nas it has been called--is not a comprehensive ban. This treaty \ncontributes to the national security of the United States and the \nAmerican people, and that is what I am primarily interested in.\n  This treaty, it seems to me, must at a minimum affect those countries \npossessing chemical weapons which pose a threat to the United States. \nAccordingly, the United States should not become a party to this \ntreaty--many Senators feel--until those countries are also \nparticipants. And no effort has been made to encourage them to come in. \nWe are standing alone, and they are going to go about their little \ndeviltry unmolested. Rogue states--like Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and \nNorth Korea--clearly represent a threat to United States security and \nthe security of key United States allies. And not one of these \ncountries has ratified the CWC, and not one of them is likely to \nratify.\n  First, the intelligence people in our own country--we call it the \nintelligence community--reported that all of these governments have \nactive aggressive programs to develop and produce chemical weapons.\n  In March 1995, I believe it was, regarding the nonproliferation \ntreaty, the Central Intelligence Agency released an unclassified \nestimate that gave a troubling assessment of the likely impact that the \nCWC would have upon the proliferation of chemical weapons.\n  This report said:\n\n       A number of states continue to pursue the development or \n     enhancement of a chemical weapons capability. Some states \n     have chosen to pursue a chemical weapons capability because \n     of relatively low cost, and the low technology required for \n     chemical weapons production. Moreover, they believe that a \n     CWC ability can serve as both a deterrent to enemy attack and \n     as an enhancement of their offensive military capability.\n\n  I am quoting. The report says:\n\n       Currently, at least 15 countries have an offensive CWC \n     program in some level of development, and the most aggressive \n     chemical weapons programs are in Iran, Libya, and Syria. The \n     CWC will continue to be a serious threat for at least the \n     remainder of this decade despite a number of armaments \n     control efforts, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention. \n     Several countries have expressed concern, excluding Libya, \n     Syria and Iraq, which have so far refused to sign the CWC, \n     and some CW-capable countries that have signed the treaty \n     show no signs of ending their programs.\n\n  That was our intelligence community's assessment of the situation as \nof 1995.\n  Mr. President, while the intent of the CWC is good, what it proposes \nis to create a global chemical weapons ban, and it will not do any such \nthing. It simply will not achieve any other of the goals. Thirty \npercent of the countries with chemical weapons programs, including all \nof those with what is called aggressive programs, have not yet signed \nthe treaty, let alone ratified it. Yet, these\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\ncountries have been and will continue to be the paramount chemical \nweapons threat to the United States.\n  About 6 years ago, during Operation Desert Storm, the United States \nwas so concerned about Iraq's chemical weapons program that we focused \na huge percentage of long allied air attacks upon Saddam Hussein's \nchemical weaponry. A facility 65 miles north of Baghdad was the nucleus \nof Iraq's chemical weapons program, and a priority target during the \nearly days of the gulf war. I was amazed then that no one seemed to pay \nmuch attention. And I am amazed now that no one seems to remember \nGeneral Schwarzkopf's remarks during a press briefing at that time in \nSaudi Arabia. It was on February 27, 1991. Here is what he said:\n\n       The nightmare scenario for all of us would have been to go \n     through the Iraqi tank barrier, get hung up in this breach \n     right here and then have the enemy artillery rain chemical \n     weapons on the troops that were in the gaggle, in the breach \n     right here.\n\n  Pointing to specific points.\n  Well, the point is this. That nightmare scenario exists today since \nIraq has neither signed nor ratified this treaty.\n  Let us look at another rogue regime, North Korea. On March 18, 1996, \nthe Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Patrick \nHughes, forwarded to me a DIA assessment of North Korea's military \ncapabilities which underscored United States concern with the war-\nfighting uses to which chemical weapons can be put.\n  Now, according to that study, and I am quoting, ``In any attack on \nthe South, P'yongyang could use chemical weapons to attack forces \ndeployed near the DMZ, suppress allied air power and isolate the \npeninsula from strategic reinforcements.''\n  Now, in boasting that this treaty will make American soldiers free \nfrom the threat of chemical weapons, the administration either has \nforgotten or deliberately ignored the fact that North Korea has neither \nsigned nor ratified the CWC and the threat posed by North Korea and \nIraq and others here. Now over 30,000 United States troops face North \nKorean troops armed and extensively trained with chemical weapons. Key \nairfields and ports are within striking distance of North Korean \nmissiles, and with just a handful of chemical weapons North Korea could \nforce United States aircraft to withdraw from the Korean Peninsula to \nJapan, and in fact in the near future North Korea may be even able to \nstrike air bases in Japan with chemical munitions. Without air support \nand reinforcement, our ground forces and our South Korean allies would \nbe overwhelmed within days.\n  The threat to the United States forces in the Persian Gulf being \nrotated from Iran and Iraq is no less troubling, Mr. President. The \nbottom line, I guess, is that rogue states--if you will look at the \nchart--see chemical weapons as the best means to offset the superior \nconventional forces of the United States and its allies. These \ncountries continue to develop plans to use chemical weapons in the \nevent of war, and we must remember I think, Mr. President, that each of \nthese countries are state sponsors, Government sponsors, of terrorism \nand may supply chemical weapons to terrorist groups.\n  So when the CWC enters into force, our troops will be no safer from \nchemical attacks than they are today because the countries of greatest \nconcern have not acceded to this treaty. For the CWC to offer any \nimprovement, however modest, to the national security of the United \nStates, it must at a minimum, I think, affect those countries with \naggressive chemical weapons programs, those countries which have \nhostile intentions toward the United States and the American people.\n  I urge Senators, please, to oppose this motion to strike this key \nprovision.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there is a sufficient second?\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished minority \nmanager.\n  We have now finally arrived at the first of a series of real \nconfrontations on this treaty, and we will vote shortly on this \nstriking of the first reservation. It really is not possible to \noveremphasize the importance of each of these votes. There are four \nvotes, each of which would cripple this treaty. If there are 100 \nMembers of the Senate prepared to vote for this treaty--and we know \nthere are not--but if there were and we subsequently were to adopt one \nof these reservations, those 100 votes would be absolutely meaningless \nbecause we would have denied ourselves the capacity for this treaty to \ngo into effect if we do not strike these reservations.\n  The fact is that the United States would be simply unable to ratify \nnow or at any time in the immediate future, and quite possibly never, \nif the effort to strike any one of these four fails. That is the \ngravity of what we are going to be doing in this Chamber in the course \nof this afternoon.\n  The first of these conditions, condition 30, which the Senator from \nDelaware has ably discussed, has been called, somewhat antiseptically, \n``Chemical Weapons in Other States.'' The text is very short, and I \njust want to quote it verbatim. It says:\n\n       Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of \n     ratification, the President, in consultation with the \n     Director of Central Intelligence, shall certify to the \n     Congress that countries which have been determined to have \n     offensive chemical weapons programs, including Iran, Iraq, \n     Syria, Libya, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, \n     China, and all other countries determined to be state \n     sponsors of international terrorism have ratified or \n     otherwise acceded to the convention.\n\n  Let me translate that into simple English. Under the terms of that \ncondition, we will hold ourselves hostage to the very outlaw, rogue \nstates that we seek to control by passing this convention. Under the \nterms of that condition, we would in fact do nothing to change the \nstatus quo.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee said we have to hold on \nto this amendment and defeat the treaty essentially because Iraq, Iran, \nLibya, these countries have chemical weapons today. Well, if we do not \npass this treaty, nothing whatsoever will change with respect to the \nthreat versus the United States. Each and every one of those countries \nwill continue to produce and we will continue on the path that we have \nbeen on for some years which is destroy our chemical weapons stocks. \nWhy? Because we have decided, and appropriately I believe, that we do \nnot need and do not intend to fight a war with chemical weapons.\n  Now, this particular reservation has a noble objective. I do not \nthink any of us would argue, the real objective is to get those rogue \nstates to get rid of their chemical weapons. We are all in favor of \nthat, if that is the real objective. But I respectfully suggest the \nreal objective is to come around through the back door and do through \nthe back door what they may not be able to do through the front door. \nThere is no Senator in this Chamber who does not hope that Iran, Iraq, \nSyria, Libya, North Korea, China, Cuba, and Sudan, in fact, every \nnation on Earth, is going to someday ratify the CWC. If that was the \ncase or it was about to happen or had happened, there would be a lot \nless concern about how we are going to go about clarifying, inspecting, \nor challenging during the course of this treaty. But that is not the \ncase. There is not one of those Senators who has drafted this \nresolution who can look any other Senator in the eye in this Chamber \nand say today that they believe that any of those rogue states are \nabout to ratify tomorrow, the next day, or the next day. That is not \ngoing to come as any surprise to anybody here in the Chamber, Mr. \nPresident.\n  There is not one who would do that. In fact, during most of the 10 \nyears during which the Reagan administration and the Bush \nadministration negotiated over exhausting amounts of time and developed \nthis treaty, they developed it to structure sanctions that would apply \nto trade in chemicals conducted by nations that do not ratify the \ntreaty.\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\n  Let me be clear about that. The primary purpose of the strict \nrequirements for challenge inspection and the process of tracking \nprecursor chemicals is not necessarily to keep track of the people that \nwe know are going to live up to this treaty. It is precisely to keep \ntrack of the people that are most likely to break the treaty, and every \none of the experts has suggested that with respect to the rogue states \nyou are better off having that tracking process, the declarations of \nsales, the ability to be able to track the fingerprint of chemicals \nthrough the globe in order to be able to hold those countries \naccountable.\n  That is the purpose of this treaty. So we have sort of a double \nnegative here. If we allowed this particular reservation to stand, not \nonly would we hold ourselves hostage to the very countries that we want \nto have eliminate the weapons, but we also would eliminate the means \nthat we have created to be able to get them to eliminate those weapons.\n  So, Mr. President, I respectfully suggest this treaty was negotiated \nand crafted precisely to apply the pressure of world opinion, the \ndiplomatic pressure, the economic pressure on the recalcitrant nations \nwhose leadership flaunts the civilized norm.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is absolutely correct. These nations \ndo have these materials. These nations will, I am convinced, in a \nnumber of cases continue to produce them. But the issue is how you best \ntry to pressure them to reform their behavior. How do you make it as \ndifficult as possible for those nations to do that? How do you isolate \nthem in the greatest manner possible? Plainly speaking, the authors of \nthis amendment have to know the distinction between having those \nmechanisms in place, which the Defense Department and others have all \nsaid will help them more to be able to do the tracking, than not to \nhave them.\n  I want to emphasize also that there is an irony in this because some \nof the people who are advocating that we wait until the rogue nations \nturn around and change their mind are, frankly, the very same people \nwho usually say never give up any sovereignty of the United States to \nanother nation. Here we are turning over the entire sovereignty of the \nUnited States to make a decision in our best interests to the very \nrogue states that have indicated already no willingness to try to \nadhere to these standards.\n  Second, the condition either fails to recognize or ignores \npurposefully the reality that at midnight of next Tuesday, April 29, no \nmatter what the Senate does today, the Chemical Weapons Convention \ntakes effect with or without U.S. participation.\n  So the question of whether or not this convention is foolproof, is \nabsolutely the best convention in the world, really begs the issue. The \nreal question before the United States is are we better off with this \ntreaty in terms of protecting our security interests by being part of \nthe convention, within its organization able to change it, which has \nalready been ratified by 74 nations and signed by over 160? If we fail \nto ratify, or if we fail to ratify by not taking out this reservation, \nthen where are we? We have joined the outlaw nations. We will have \njoined the very nations that we want most to affect the behavior of.\n  I think it is important to note that some of our most respected \nvoices in this country with respect to military affairs and national \nsecurity affairs have all agreed that it is significant for the United \nStates to be able to not align itself with those nations. General \nSchwarzkopf said:\n\n       I am very, very much in favor of the ratification of the \n     treaty.\n\n  And he said:\n\n       We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future wars. \n     And frankly, by not ratifying that treaty, we align ourselves \n     with nations like Libya and North Korea and I would just as \n     soon not be associated with those thugs in this particular \n     measure.\n\n  I think that is a pretty strong statement about precisely what this \nreservation would have the effect of doing.\n  General Powell, who has already been quoted by my colleague, made it \nvery clear that we should not do this and made the analogy to NATO, to \nour not joining NATO simply because Russia was not a member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield my colleague another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Former Assistant to President Reagan and Secretary of \nState Jim Baker said:\n\n       Some have argued that we shouldn't commit to the treaty \n     because states like Libya, Iraq and North Korea, which have \n     not signed it, will still be able to continue their efforts \n     to acquire chemical weapons. This is obviously true, but the \n     convention, which will go into effect in April whether or not \n     we ratify it, will make it more difficult for those states to \n     do so by prohibiting the sale of materials to nonmembers that \n     can be used to make chemical weapons.\n\n  He said:\n\n       It makes no sense to argue that because of a few pariah \n     states refusing to join the convention, the United States \n     should line up with them rather than the rest of the world.\n\n  This is a bipartisan sentiment, Mr. President, and I hope the Senate \nwill recognize the gravity of the vote we are about to take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I have here, Mr. President, a group of editorial comments, \nmaking, as Sam Ervin used to say, uncommon good sense, in opposition to \nthis treaty. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5, 1997]\n\n                     No to the Chemical Arms Treaty\n\n     (By James Schlesinger, Caspar Weinberger, and Donald Rumsfeld)\n\n       The phrase ``damning with faint praise'' is given new \n     meaning by the op-ed by Brent Scowcroft and John Deutch on \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention [``End the Chemical Weapons \n     Business,'' Feb. 11]. In it, the authors concede virtually \n     every criticism made by those who oppose this controversial \n     treaty in its present form.\n       They acknowledge the legitimacy of key concerns about the \n     Convention: its essential unverifiability; its lack of global \n     coverage; the prospect that it will inhibit non-lethal use of \n     chemicals, including tear gas; and its mandating the transfer \n     of militarily relevant chemical offensive and defensive \n     technology to untrustworthy countries that become parties. It \n     is our view that these problems are inherent in the present \n     treaty.\n       Take, for example, Scowcroft and Deutch's warning against \n     cutting investment in chemical defensive measures. \n     Unfortunately, treaties such as the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention (CWC)--which promise to reduce the menace posed by \n     weapons of mass destruction but which cannot do so--\n     inevitably tend to diminish the perceived need and therefore \n     the support for defenses against such threats.\n       In fact, in December 1995, the then-vice chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended a reduction of more than \n     $800 million in investment on chemical defenses in \n     anticipation of the Convention's coming into force. If past \n     experience is a guide, there might also be a reduction in the \n     priority accorded to monitoring emerging chemical weapons \n     threats, notwithstanding Scowcroft and Deutch's call for \n     improvements in our ability to track chemical weapons \n     developments.\n       Scowcroft and Deutch correctly warn that the ``CWC [must] \n     not [be] exploited to facilitate the diffusion of CWC-\n     specific technology, equipment and material--even to \n     signatory states.'' The trouble is that the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention explicitly obligates member states to facilitate \n     such transfers, even though these items are readily \n     exploitable for military purposes. What is more, the treaty \n     commits member states not to observe any agreements, whether \n     multilateral or unilateral, that would restrict these \n     transfers.\n       In short, we believe that the problems with the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention in these and other areas that have been \n     identified by Brent Scowcroft and John Deutch clearly \n     demonstrate that this treaty would be contrary to U.S. \n     security interests. Moreover, in our view these serious \n     problems undercut the argument that the CWC's ``imperfect \n     constraints'' are better than no constraints at all.\n       The CWC would likely have the effect of leaving the United \n     States and its allies more, not less, vulnerable to chemical \n     attack. It could well serve to increase, not reduce, the \n     spread of chemical weapons manufacturing capabilities. Thus \n     we would be better off not to be party to it.\n       Notably, if the United States is not a CWC member state, \n     the danger is lessened that American intelligence about \n     ongoing foreign chemical weapons programs will be dumbed down \n     or otherwise compromised. This has happened in the past when \n     enforcement of a violated agreement was held to be a greater \n     threat to an arms control regime than was noncompliance by \n     another party. The United States and the international \n     community have been unwilling to enforce the far more easily \n     verified 1925 Geneva Convention banning the use of chemical \n     weapons--even in\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\n     the face of repeated and well-documented violations by Saddam \n     Hussein. What likelihood is there that we would be any more \n     insistent when it comes to far less verifiable bans on \n     production and stockpiling of such weapons?\n       As a non-party, the United States would also remain free to \n     oppose dangerous ideas such as providing state-of-the-art \n     chemical manufacturing facilities and defensive equipment to \n     international pariahs such as Iran and Cuba. And the United \n     States would be less likely to reduce investment in chemical \n     protective capabilities, out of a false sense of security \n     arising from participation in the CWC.\n       In addition, if the United States is not a CWC party, \n     American taxpayers will not be asked to bear the substantial \n     annual costs of our participating in a multilateral regime \n     that will not ``end the chemical weapons business'' in \n     countries of concern. (By some estimates, these costs would \n     be over $200 million per year.) Similarly, U.S. citizens and \n     companies will be spared the burdens associated with \n     reporting and inspection arrangements that might involve \n     unreasonable searches and seizures, could jeopardize \n     confidential business information and yet could not ensure \n     that other nations--and especially rogue states--no longer \n     have chemical weapons programs.\n       Against these advantages of nonparticipation, the purported \n     down-sides seem relatively inconsequential. First, whether \n     Russia actually eliminates its immense chemical arsenal is \n     unlikely to hinge upon our participating in the CWC. Indeed, \n     Moscow is now actively creating new chemical agents that \n     would circumvent and effectively defeat the treaty's \n     constraints.\n       Second, the preponderance of trade in chemicals would be \n     unaffected by the CWC's limitations, making the impact of \n     remaining outside the treaty regime, if any, fairly modest on \n     American manufacturers.\n       Finally, if the United States declines to join the present \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, it is academic whether \n     implementing arrangements are drawn up by others or not. In \n     the event the United States does decide to become a party at \n     a later date--perhaps after improvements are made to enhance \n     the treaty's effectiveness--it is hard to believe that its \n     preferences regarding implementing arrangements would not be \n     given considerable weight. This is particularly true since \n     the United States would then be asked to bear 25 percent of \n     the implementing organization's budget.\n       There is no way to ``end the chemical weapons business'' by \n     fiat. The price of attempting to do so with the present \n     treaty is unacceptably high, and the cost of the illusion it \n     creates might be higher still.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, Mar. 24, 1997]\n\n                      Just Say No to a Bad Treaty\n\n       The United States Senate must decide by April 28 whether to \n     ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. The press, the \n     pundits, and the Clinton administration have treated the \n     debate over the treaty as another in a series of battles \n     between ``internationalists'' and ``isolationists'' in the \n     new, post-Cold War era.\n       It isn't. What we really have here is the continuation of \n     one of this century's most enduring disputes. In the first \n     camp are the high priests of arms control theology, who have \n     never met an international agreement they didn't like. In the \n     second camp are those who take a more skeptical view of \n     relying on a piece of watermarked, signed parchment for \n     safety in a dangerous world.\n       The case for ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention is a \n     triumph of hope over experience. It is an attempt to reform \n     the world by collecting signatures. Some of the most \n     dangerous nations--Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea--have \n     not ratified the convention and, for all we know, never will. \n     Some of the nations that are signatories, like Russia, China, \n     Iran, and Cuba, are manifestly unreliable and are already \n     looking for ways to circumvent the convention's provisions.\n       The convention's most prominent American defenders admit \n     that the agreement is probably not verifiable. And it isn't. \n     Chemical weapons can be produced in small but deadly amounts \n     in tiny makeshift laboratories. The nerve gas used by \n     terrorists to poison subway riders in Japan in 1995, for \n     instance, was produced in a 14 ft.-by-8 ft. room. No one in \n     the American intelligence community believes we would be able \n     to monitor compliance with an international chemical weapons \n     regime with any reasonable degree of confidence.\n       The Washington Post opines that these failings in the \n     convention--the very fact ``that the coverage of this treaty \n     falls short and that enforcement is uncertain''--are actually \n     arguments for ratifying it. Presumably, signature of a flawed \n     treaty will make all of us work harder to perfect it.\n       Great.\n       At the end of the day, the strongest argument proponents of \n     ratification can offer is that, whatever a treaty's manifest \n     flaws, it is better to have one than not to have one. How \n     could it be bad to have a treaty outlawing production of \n     chemical weapons, no matter how full of holes it may be?\n       Well, actually, such a treaty could be worse than no treaty \n     at all. We have pretty good evidence from the bloody history \n     of this century that treaties like the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention--treaties that are more hortatory than \n     mandatory, that express good intentions more than they \n     require any actions to back up those intentions--can do \n     more harm than good. They are part of a psychological \n     process of evasion and avoidance of tough choices. The \n     truth is, the best way of controlling chemical weapons \n     proliferation could be for the United States to bomb a \n     Libyan chemical weapons factory.\n       But that is the kind of difficult decision for an American \n     president that the Chemical Weapons Convention does nothing \n     to facilitate. Indeed, the existence of a chemical weapons \n     treaty would make it less likely that a president would order \n     such strong unilateral action, since he would be bound to \n     turn over evidence of a violation to the international \n     lawyers and diplomats and wait for their investigation and \n     concurrence. And as Richard Perle has recently noted, even \n     after Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons in flagrant \n     violation of an existing prohibition against their use, the \n     international bureaucrats responsible for monitoring these \n     matters could not bring themselves to denounce Iraq by name. \n     In the end, it would be easier for a president to order an \n     air strike than to get scores of nations to agree on naming \n     one of their own an outlaw.\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention is what Peter Rodman calls \n     ``junk arms control,'' and not the least of its many \n     drawbacks is that it gives effective arms control a bad name. \n     Effective treaties codify decisions nations have already \n     made: to end a war on certain terms, for instance, or to \n     define fishing rights. Because they reflect the will of the \n     parties, moreover, the parties themselves don't raise \n     obstacles to verification.\n       But treaties whose purpose is to rope in rogue nations that \n     have not consented, or whose consent is widely understood to \n     be cynical and disingenuous, are something else again. They \n     are based on a worldview that is at best foolishly optimistic \n     and at worst patronizing and deluded.\n       One of the important things separating Reaganite \n     internationalism from the more starry-eyed Wilsonian version \n     is the understanding that treaties must reflect reality, not \n     hope. The Chemical Weapons Convention turns the clock back to \n     the kind of Wilsonian thinking characteristic of the Carter \n     administration. It is unfortunate that among its strongest \n     backers are some prominent Republicans who have served in key \n     foreign-policy positions. It is true that the origins of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention date back to the Reagan years, \n     and the convention was carried to fruition by the Bush \n     administration. But let's be candid. In the Reagan years, the \n     treaty was mostly a sop to liberals in Congress, an attempt \n     to pick up some points for an arms control measure at a time \n     when Reagan was trying to win on more important issues like \n     the defense buildup and the Strategic Defense Initiative. And \n     President Bush pushed the treaty in no small part because he \n     had disliked having to cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate \n     as vice president in favor of building chemical weapons. \n     Republicans today are under no obligation to carry out the \n     mistakes of their predecessors.\n       In one respect, the debate over the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention calls to mind the struggle for the party's soul \n     waged in the 1970s between Kissingerian detente-niks on one \n     side and the insurgent forces led by Ronald Reagan on the \n     other. Back then, conservative Republicans like Senate \n     majority leader Trent Lott knew without hesitation where they \n     stood. They should stand where they stood before, foursquare \n     with the ideas that helped win the Cold War, and against the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Mar. 9, 1997]\n\n                             Chemical Pact\n\n\n                         say no to this treaty\n\n       Make no mistake about it.\n       Those were the words of President Bill Clinton, referring \n     to the Chemical Weapons Convention in his State of the Union \n     address.\n       He said ratification of the CWC ``will make our troops \n     safer from chemical attack . . . we have no more important \n     obligations, especially in the wake of what we now know about \n     the Gulf War.''\n       Although all civilized nations can embrace the notion of \n     eliminating chemical weapons, it would, nevertheless, be a \n     mistake to ratify the CWC, signed by more than 160 nations--\n     including the United States during the Bush administration.\n       The treaty requires the destruction of chemical weapons \n     that signatories to the treaty own or possess, or weapons \n     anywhere under their jurisdiction; the destruction of \n     chemical weapons abandoned on the territory of another state; \n     the destruction of chemical-weapons production facilities; \n     the prohibition of riot-control agents as a method of \n     warfare--all reasonable and worthy goals.\n       Ever since 1675, when a French-German agreement not to use \n     poison bullets was concluded in Strasbourg, nations have \n     struggled with how to limit the terribly destructive nature \n     of chemical weapons, though none of the subsequent \n     international agreements prevented the use of chemical \n     weapons by warring factions.\n       In the 1980s, Iraq used chemical weapons, including nerve \n     gas, against Iran, clearly violating the 1925 Geneva \n     Protocol. But an international conference in Paris failed to \n     enforce or fortify the Geneva Protocol, proving the \n     difficulty is not a lack of law, but the failure to enforce \n     it.\n       Under terms of the CWC, for the first time in U.S. history, \n     private industry will be subject to foreign inspection, with \n     inspectors\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\n     being dispatched from an agency based in the Netherlands. In \n     addition, businesses must prove to the U.S. government and \n     international inspectors that they are not producing or \n     stockpiling chemical weapons, with non-compliance fines \n     reaching as high as $50,000 per incident.\n       Tucson's Sundt Corp. estimates that ``with five major \n     offices/warehouses/shops in two states, up to 35 job-site \n     offices utilizing subcontractors and suppliers in eight \n     states, the complete and final determination of what we have \n     in the way of compounds and their derivative, the interactive \n     relationships (with the list of chemicals) could involve the \n     cost of a chemist's or consultant's time amounting to \n     $50,000-$100,000 per annum, not including Sundt Corp.'s \n     administrative time.''\n       Under the terms of the treaty, inspections may be conducted \n     at any facility within a state party without probable cause, \n     without a warrant. Inspectors will be authorized under the \n     treaty to collect data and analyze samples. This could result \n     in the loss of proprietary information, or ``based upon the \n     depth of inspection, e.g. interviews with corporate \n     personnel, employees, vendors, subcontractors; review of \n     drawings, purchase orders, subcontracts; inspection and \n     review of internal and external correspondence; we feel that \n     it could be difficult to safeguard confidential business \n     information during this inspection,'' says the Sundt Corp.\n       The obligation to open on-site inspections raises clear \n     Fourth and Fifth Amendment concerns, inasmuch as no probable \n     cause need be shown while a foreign state will have the right \n     to a challenge inspection of a U.S. facility without the \n     grounds that are essential for a search warrant.\n       As Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., has pointed out, the CWC may \n     actually contribute to the proliferation of chemical \n     technology because of its requirement that the United States \n     share information with rogue nations, once they sign onto the \n     CWC.\n       Further, American technology that might actually enhance \n     the safety of U.S. troops--such as non-lethal immobilizing \n     agents--could be prohibited if the Senate ratifies the \n     convention in its present form.\n       The forces on both sides of this issue in Washington are \n     men and women of good will. But the CWC is not a good deal \n     for the United States. That is the message the Senate should \n     continue to send to Bill Clinton, in unmistakable terms.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 1, 1997]\n\n                             The Bum's Rush\n\n       The debate over the Chemical Weapons Convention looks like \n     it's about to turn into a slugfest, notwithstanding last \n     week's spectacle of Jesse Helms and Madeleine Albright \n     holding hands. Intimations of the battle to come were heard \n     the week before last, when Democrats threatened to stall all \n     Senate actions unless a ratification vote is scheduled. The \n     Administration, meanwhile, is hyping April 29 as the drop-\n     dead date for ratification in the hope of getting the Senate \n     to shortchange the ``advise'' part of its advise-and-consent \n     responsibilities and rush to a vote before it has a chance to \n     review it properly.\n       Majority Leader Trent Lott, who hasn't let on how he will \n     vote, is the point man here. How he handles the treaty's \n     passage through the Senate will be an important test of his \n     leadership. While he has pleased Democrats by promising to \n     bring the treaty up when the Senate returns from recess in a \n     few days, that doesn't mean that he's going to ram a vote \n     down the Senate's throat, as the Administration hopes. \n     Senator Lott is perfectly capable of spotting a bum's rush \n     when he sees one, and he expressly made no promise for a vote \n     before April 29, the date the treaty goes into effect with or \n     without U.S. ratification. Despite Chicken Little warnings \n     from the White House, there is no deadline for ratification; \n     the U.S. can join as a full member at any time.\n       Before a ratification vote, there is plenty of time for a \n     vigorous, public examination. The best place to start is with \n     hearings, which Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Helms \n     has scheduled to begin on April 9. Senators, especially the \n     15 new ones who missed last year's hearings, deserve a chance \n     to understand exactly what they are being asked to vote on. \n     At the moment the focus is on political maneuverings instead \n     of where it should be: the content of the treaty.\n       For starters, Senator Helms could call the four former \n     Defense Secretaries who adamantly oppose the CWC: James \n     Schlesinger, Donald Rumsfeld, Casper Weinberger and Dick \n     Cheney. Ask them about the treaty's verifiability, and \n     they'll tell you it's impossible. (So, for that matter, will \n     the treaty's supporters, whose best argument is that the \n     treaty is flawed, but we ought to sign it anyway.) Douglas \n     Feith, a Reagan Administration chemical weapons negotiator, \n     likens enforcement to a drunk searching for his keys under a \n     lamppost because that's where the light is. Under the CWC, \n     members could look for chemical weapons in New Zealand or the \n     Netherlands, but not in North Korea or Libya or Iraq, which \n     have no intention of joining.\n       The former Defense Secretaries could also talk about \n     Articles X and XI, which would require American chemical \n     manufacturers to share their latest technology with fellow \n     signatories--including the likes of Iran and Cuba. Legal \n     scholars could offer some thoughts on the treaty's \n     requirement that American companies open their doors to \n     surprise inspections as to whether that squares with the \n     Constitution's protection of property rights and its ban on \n     search and seizure. CEOs could testify on the treaty's \n     regulatory burdens, not to mention the threat of industrial \n     espionage as inspector-spies snoop around their factories and \n     troll through their files. Intelligence experts could discuss \n     the impact on national security.\n       All this and more should emerge in hearings. In recent \n     days, Republicans and Democrats have come to agreement on 21 \n     of 30 points of contention over the treaty. That progress \n     (which comes after weeks of Administration stonewalling, by \n     the way) is on relatively minor issues and doesn't extend to \n     the key concerns on verifiability, constitutionality or \n     national security. The Administration would like nothing \n     better than a perfunctory day or two of hearings on these \n     crucial matters followed by a quick transfer to the Senate \n     floor for a vote billed as ``for'' or ``against'' poison gas. \n     It should come as no surprise if it doesn't want Senators to \n     take too close a look: if they do, there's a good chance they \n     might not like what they see.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Arizona [Mr. \nKyl], such time as he may require. Does he have an estimate?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Take a shot at it. I want to be through along about 3:30, \nso we can vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nnumber of op-ed pieces.\n  There being not objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 4, 1997]\n\n                 Don't Rush the Chemical Weapons Treaty\n\n       George Bush, James Baker, Brent Scowcroft--this is not \n     exactly a lineup one would expect to find on the side of the \n     Clinton White House. However, in the past few weeks, the \n     administration has drawn upon all available resources in the \n     hope of prevailing upon Congress to ratify the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention--and to do it at once. A deadline of April \n     29 looms ominously on the horizon, so we are told, by which \n     time the treaty goes into effect, having already been \n     ratified by the necessary 65 countries. If the United States \n     does not ratify by then, we will be left out in the cold with \n     other non-signing ne'er-do-wells, and the world will laugh at \n     this failure of American leadership. For heavens' sake, this \n     is a treaty the United States itself negotiated! How can we \n     possibly not ratify it?\n       Hold the horses here. As critics of the treaty including \n     four past secretaries of defense have pointed out, it's not \n     at all clear that it is in the interest of the United States \n     to ratify the CWC, at least not until a number of problems \n     associated with it have been resolved. The famous deadline of \n     April 29 is basically of the administration's own making and \n     ought not intimidate anyone. Of the 65 countries needed to \n     trigger the treaty to take effect, the last one, Hungary, did \n     so in November, and only after consultation with the White \n     House, which told Budapest to go ahead.\n       In point of fact, as Michael Waller notes on today's Op-ed \n     page, Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin specifically \n     warned Vice President Gore in a letter against rushing the \n     process with other countries before ratification by the two \n     most important signatories, Russia and the United States. \n     Disregarding Mr. Chernomyrdin's warning, the Clinton \n     administration pressed ahead in order to try to force the \n     Senate's hand.\n       President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \n     argue that non-ratification by the United States by April 29 \n     will mean that we will be shut out from the regime's \n     executive board. This is highly unlikely to happen, \n     especially given that the United States is being asked to \n     pony up a full 25 percent of the budget for enforcement. \n     That's $52 million this year.\n       The fact of the matter is that the CWC may be in just as \n     much trouble in the Senate now as it was back in the fall, \n     when then-secretary of State Warren Christopher decided to \n     postpone the debate for lack of support. For one thing, this \n     Senate is more con- servative than the previous one, and for \n     another, numerous concerns have not been addressed. It \n     redounds to the credit of Republicans that they have \n     declared themselves willing to work with the \n     administration to iron out these difficulties, but there \n     is a very long way to go. Sen. John Kyl of Arizona tells \n     The Washington Times' editorial page, ``I believe we have \n     an obligation to try to get as close as possible to making \n     the treaty workable. And we'll see how far we can get.''\n       Mr. Kyl, however, points to some serious problems. For one \n     thing, it is not global. Iran and Libya, for instance, have \n     not signed, and China and Russia have not ratified it. Should \n     we be concerned about chemical weapons in Belgium and \n     Holland? Of course not. They are not the problem. For \n     another, the treaty is not adequately verifiable. Even the \n     Clinton administration admits as much. And third, much like \n     the Atoms for Peace program, it will spread the knowledge of \n     a potentially lethal technology to countries that could make \n     dangerous use of it. Add to these concerns the huge \n     regulatory burden the treaty will impose on American chemical \n     companies, in effect an\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\n     unfunded mandate, as well as the constitutional problems with \n     spot checks by international inspectors.\n       There may be ways out of these problems without sending the \n     treaty back to the drawing board. One would be for the Senate \n     ratification resolution (a document that accompanies all \n     international treaties ratified by the Senate) to posit a set \n     of conditions that must be fulfilled before the United States \n     formally joins the CWC regime. A creative solution might be, \n     for instance, to say that the CWC regulatory burden should \n     not be imposed on American companies at least until such a \n     time as the treaty has been ratified by countries that are \n     key to its effectiveness--say, Russia, China and Iran.\n       On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott informed \n     administration negotiators that they will have to deal \n     directly with the staff of Sen. Jesse Helms' Foreign \n     Relations Committee, which is indeed where the responsibility \n     belongs. Mr. Helms has some other issues outstanding with the \n     administration, including State Department reorganization. If \n     the CWC is truly as important as the White House claims it \n     is, there's little time to be lost in getting the White House \n     to work on the legitimate problems of this treaty.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 13, 1997\n\n                      The Chemical Weapons Coverup\n\n                         (By J. Michael Walker)\n\n       President Clinton had hardly completed his first year in \n     office when Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine) suspected that the \n     administration was covering up ominous Russian military \n     developments. Mr. Cohen introduced legislation requiring the \n     president ``to tell us and the American people what the \n     Russian military was doing and what the implications were for \n     American and Allied security.'' The Pentagon made the \n     information available to Congress--but withheld it from the \n     public. Mr. Cohen complained that the report ``was classified \n     from cover to cover, even though much of the report did not \n     warrant being restricted by a security classification.''\n       ``Perhaps,'' Mr. Cohen surmised in a speech on the Senate \n     floor, ``the administration was worried about being \n     embarrassed given its acquiescence to Russian military \n     adventures.'' Whatever the reason, he said, ``the decision to \n     classify the report from the cover to cover has prevented \n     Congress from conducting a complete public debate about \n     Russian actions and the administration's policy toward \n     Russia, and it has prevented the American people from \n     becoming fully informed on these matters.''\n\n\n                            Eerily Resonant\n\n       Mr. Cohen's criticisms of the administration to which he \n     now belongs seem eerily resonant. The issue today is the \n     administration's campaign to win Senate ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. Intended to abolish all chemical \n     weapons world-wide, the CWC contains many loopholes, legal \n     discrepancies and weak enforcement mechanisms that render it \n     ineffective. In particular, there is every reason to believe \n     that Russia has continued work to develop deadly new chemical \n     weapons that would skirt the treaty's requirements.\n       Hungary recently became the 65th country to ratify the CWC, \n     tripping a mechanism that puts the treaty into effect April \n     29 with or without the ratification of Russia, China and the \n     U.S. Thus the administration is pushing hard for ratification \n     by that date, though it had put the CWC on hold last \n     September over concerns that the CWC might unnecessarily \n     burden U.S. industry. American companies would be subject to \n     new regulations and would be compelled to open their records \n     to foreign inspectors. Firms having nothing to do with \n     chemical weapons--wineries, breweries, distilleries, food-\n     processing companies and manufacturers of electronics and \n     soaps--could be forced to reveal trade secrets to the \n     inspectors, to the benefit of foreign competitors.\n       In its zeal to ratify the CWC, the administration has been \n     distorting and even concealing vital information about the \n     treaty. Written exchanges between key senators and the \n     executive branch show grave inconsistencies and worse in the \n     selling of the CWC:\n\n                         Verification questions\n\n       Many senators are worried that the U.S. lacks the \n     capability to verify other countries' compliance with the \n     CWC. This disquiet is fueled in part by the rather vague \n     assessments by Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Director \n     John Holum and other officials, who repeatedly have reassured \n     the Senate that the CWC is ``effectively verifiable.'' \n     Indeed, proponents say CWC will provide an added tool for \n     intelligence collection.\n       But intelligence reports demonstrate it is insufficient, \n     even though intelligence chiefs have given the CWC their \n     obligatory endorsement. In 1994, then-CIA Director R. James \n     Woolsey told senators that ``the chemical-weapons problem is \n     so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot \n     state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect \n     noncompliance, especially on a small scale.'' And a May 1995 \n     National Intelligence Estimate stated that production of new \n     classes of chemical weapons ``would be difficult to detect \n     and confirm as a CWC-sponsored activity.''\n\n                         Clandestine production\n\n       Several countries--notably including Russia--maintain \n     clandestine chemical weapon programs designed to elude \n     detection. The administration virtually ignored reports of \n     Moscow's continuing covert development and production of \n     binary nerve agents, and made no visible attempt to induce \n     Moscow to terminate the programs--until last week, when the \n     Washington Times made public a classified Pentagon report. \n     The report described Foliant, the code name of a supersecret \n     program begun under the Soviets to develop nerve agents so \n     lethal that microscopic amounts can kill. One of those \n     substances is A-232 of the Novichok class of binary weapons, \n     which were designed to circumvent future bans on such agents.\n       The Pentagon report says the chemical formulas are not \n     defined in the CWC lists. Therefore, Novichok weapons \n     technically are not banned under the treaty. The \n     administration counters that they are banned ``in spirit,'' \n     but as with all its arms control agreements, Moscow has been \n     banking on the technicality and the camouflage.\n       Russian military scientists and journalists revealed the \n     program, but Russian officials were not alone in trying to \n     cover it up. The leaked Pentagon report's low level of \n     classification--secret as opposed to top secret--suggests \n     that protecting intelligence sources and methods was not the \n     objective of the secrecy. Rather, it appears the facts were \n     simply too inconvenient for the administration's purposes.\n       Nearly all the leaked information had appeared in the press \n     long before. In September 1992, Vil Mirzayanov, a dissident \n     Russian scientist who worked for 26 years on the clandestine \n     programs, wrote an article in Moscow News describing the \n     existence and nature of Novichok, and the specific intent to \n     circumvent the CWC. More details emerged over the next two \n     years as authorities persecuted--but never disputed--Mr. \n     Mirzayanov. One of Russia's top binary weapons scientists, \n     Vladimir Ugiev, revealed the existence of A-232--which he \n     personally developed--in an interview with the magazine \n     Novoye Vremya in early 1994. And in May 1994 Mr. Mirzayanov \n     wrote about A-232 and other substances in an article for this \n     page. Along with these first-person accounts came additional \n     revelations of both programs in the Baltimore Sun and other \n     publications.\n       Backed by letters from Sens. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) and \n     Jesse Helms (R. N.C.), U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering held \n     a Moscow news conference in January 1994 defending Mr. \n     Mirzayanov for ``telling the truth about an activity which is \n     contrary to treaty obligations.'' Yet in Washington, \n     officials kept silent. Only the embarrassment of last week's \n     Washington Times report has spurred the administration to ask \n     Russia to stop.\n\n                          Weapons destruction\n\n       The U.S. and other nations have repeatedly offered to help \n     Moscow destroy the tens of thousands of tons of declared \n     chemical agents in its arsenals. A legal base toward this \n     goal in the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement. Visiting \n     Bonn last spring, Mr. Holum of the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency learned that Moscow was planning to \n     withdraw from the BDA, and wrote a May 21 cable to Washington \n     with the news. Lawmakers who asked to see the cable were told \n     for weeks that it did not exist. Senate sources say. Sen. Jon \n     Kyl (R., Ariz.), a member of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, wasn't allowed to read the cable until the eve \n     of the expected September ratification vote, when he was \n     shown only a redacted version.\n\n                      Chernomyrdin letter to Gore\n\n       Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin sent a letter to \n     Vice President Al Gore on July 8, 1996, warning that if the \n     CWC went into effect before Russia's ratification, Moscow \n     probably wouldn't ratify it. The letter was faxed all around \n     Washington, but when Sen. Helms, chairman of the Foreign \n     Relations Committee, asked the administration for a copy, the \n     administration classified it.\n\n\n                           strategy backfired\n\n       The Clinton administration had hoped to present the Senate \n     with a fait accompli: that's why it encouraged Hungary and \n     other nations to ratify the treaty and automatically trigger \n     its implementation. Yet the White House strategy seems to \n     have backfired. After Hungary set the CWC in motion, the \n     upper house of the Russian Parliament voted down a long-\n     awaited law that would establish the legal basis for \n     chemical-weapons destruction. Just as the administration \n     began its new CWC sales pitch, the Pentagon was forced to \n     explain why it had done nothing for four years to convince \n     Moscow to terminate its clandestine binary weapons program. \n     And with former Sen. Cohen settling in at the Pentagon, \n     others in the administration still hide behind their paper \n     shield of secrecy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 19, 1997]\n\n                           A Dangerous Treaty\n\n       Among the many good reasons why the Senate should not \n     ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention is a substance known \n     as A-232. This highly lethal nerve agent was concocted by a \n     Russian scientific team precisely for the purpose of \n     circumventing the terms of the CWC, which both the U.S. and \n     Russia have signed but not yet ratified. A-232 would escape \n     scrutiny under the treaty because it is made from \n     agricultural and industrial chemicals that aren't deadly \n     until they are mixed and therefore don't appear on the CWC's \n     schedule of banned chemicals.\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\n       The world has known about A-232 since the May 1994 \n     publication on this page of an article by a Russian \n     scientist, who warned how his colleagues were attempting to \n     camouflage their true mission. It is now the subject of a \n     classified Pentagon paper, reported in the Washington Times \n     earlier this month, on the eve of what is shaping up to be an \n     escalation of the battle joined in September over \n     ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       The Administration was forced to sound the retreat then, \n     pulling the treaty from consideration when it became clear \n     that the Senate was preparing to vote it down. Now it's \n     trying again, this time in full cry about the urgency for \n     U.S. ratification before April 29, the date it goes into \n     effect. For now, Senator Jesse Helms has kept the treaty tied \n     up in the Foreign Relations Committee, making the sensible \n     argument that the new Senate ought first to focus on matters \n     of higher priority than ramrodding through a controversial \n     treaty that merits careful deliberation.\n       The Administration, meanwhile, is mounting a full-court \n     press, with the president offering a plea for ratification in \n     his State of the Union address ``so that at last we can begin \n     to outlaw poison gas from the earth.'' This is an admirable \n     sentiment--who isn't against making the world safe from the \n     horrors of poison gas?--but it's far from the reality. In \n     fact, ratification would more likely bring the opposite \n     result.\n       Article XI is one of the key danger areas. It would \n     obligate U.S. companies to provide fellow signatories with \n     full access to their latest chemical technologies, \n     notwithstanding American trade or foreign policy. One country \n     delighted at the prospect of upgrading its chemical industry \n     is China, which, upon signing the CWC, issued a declaration \n     saying, ``All export controls inconsistent with the \n     Convention should be abolished.'' No doubt Cuba and Iran, to \n     name two other signatories, share the same sentiment. The \n     Russian team that came up with A-232 no doubt could \n     accomplish much more with the help of the most up-to-date \n     technology from the U.S.\n       Verification is an insurmountable problem, and no one--not \n     even the treaty's most ardent supporters--will promise that \n     the treaty can be enforced. In the administration's \n     obfuscating phrase, the CWC can be ``effectively verified.'' \n     Yet if chemical weapons are easy to hide, as A-232 proves, \n     they are also easy to make. The sarin used in the poison-gas \n     attack on the Tokyo subway was created not in a fancy lab but \n     in a small, ordinary room used by Aum Shinri Kyo's amateur \n     chemists. The treaty provides for snap inspections of \n     companies that make chemicals, not of religious cults that \n     decide to cook up some sarin in the back office. The CWC \n     wouldn't make a whit of difference.\n       Those snap inspections, by the way, could turn into a huge \n     burden on American businesses, which would have to fork out \n     millions of dollars in compliance costs (though the biggest \n     companies no doubt would watch the heaviest burden fall on \n     their smaller competitors).\n       More than 65 countries have already ratified the CWC, \n     including most U.S. allies. But somehow we don't think the \n     world is more secure with Australia and Hungary committed to \n     ridding the world of chemical weapons when such real threats \n     as Libya, Iraq, Syria and North Korea won't have anything to \n     do with the CWC. How can a treaty that professes to address \n     the problem of chemical weapons be credible unless it \n     addresses the threat from the very countries, such as Syria \n     and Iraq, that have actually deployed these weapons?\n       With or without the CWC, the U.S. is already committed to \n     destroying its chemical weapons by 2004. That doesn't mean \n     the rest of the world shares any such commitment; what \n     possible peaceful purpose does Russia have in the clandestine \n     production of A-232? Instead of pushing a treaty that can't \n     accomplish its impossible goals, the Administration would be \n     better advised to use its clout, rather than that of some \n     planned U.N.-style bureaucracy, in getting the Russians to \n     stop making nerve gas.\n       It's hard to find a wholehearted advocate of the treaty. \n     The gist of the messages from most of its so-called champions \n     is that it's a poor deal, but it's the best on offer. But \n     their cases have acknowledged so many caveats that it's hard \n     to see how they've reached such optimistic conclusions. The \n     biggest danger of ratification is that it would similarly \n     lull the U.S. and other responsible nations into the false \n     belief that they are taking effective action against the \n     threat of chemical weapons. The case for this treaty strains \n     belief too far.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the condition we have before us right now is \nwhether or not the United States will be a party to a meaningful \ntreaty, that is to say a treaty that covers nations that it needs to \ncover. It will not do us any good if we are a party to a treaty, paying \n25 percent of the costs, to inspect ourselves. Right now, the countries \nthat have ratified this treaty are not the countries that are of \nconcern to us. They do not have weapons. As a matter of fact, right now \nthe countries that are parties have nothing to inspect. The United \nStates, if it believes this treaty is ultimately going to have any \npositive effect, that is to say if it has significant verification \nfeatures, and if it is global in the sense that most of the countries \nof the world that have chemical weapons are parties to it, and if it is \nenforceable--at that point in time the United States presumably could \nget something out of this treaty. In the meantime, the only thing we \nget out of it is the opportunity to pay a lot of money, as I say, to \ninspect ourselves. Because the countries that need to be inspected are \nnot yet in it.\n  Specifically, 74 countries have ratified the treaty and they are the \ncountries of least concern to the United States. The three countries \nthat have the largest amount of chemical weapons in the world--Russia \nand China and the United States--are not parties, nor are any of the \nso-called rogue countries of the world.\n  Many of these countries have no intention of signing onto the treaty. \nNorth Korea, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Sudan have all refused to sign the \ntreaty. Others, such as Cuba and Iran, have signed the treaty but have \nnot yet ratified it. In the meantime, some of these countries, such as \nIraq, continue to stockpile and develop chemical weapons.\n  So, the question is, will the United States enter this treaty at a \ntime when it is meaningless, or will we, instead, use our entry as a \nprod to cause other countries of the world that need to be parties to \nbe parties. For the treaty to offer any potential improvement, however \nmodest, to the national security interests of the United States, I \nthink at a minimum it must affect those countries with aggressive \nchemical weapons programs and which have hostile intentions toward the \nUnited States. Let me just outline briefly who these--who some of these \ncountries are.\n  North Korea--North Korea's program involves the stockpiling of a \nlarge amount of nerve gas, blood agents, and mustard gas. And it is \ncapable of producing much more, according to our intelligence sources. \nIts armed forces have the ability to launch large-scale chemical \nattacks using mortars, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and Scud \nmissiles. And it is presently developing a new generation of medium-\nrange ballistic missiles that will be able to carry chemical warheads. \nNorth Korea has neither signed nor ratified the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  Iraq--despite the most intrusive inspection and monitoring regime in \nthe history of the world, Iraq has retained a chemical weapons \nproduction capability and continues to hide details and documents \nrelated to its chemical weapons program. The U.N. Special Commission \nbelieves that Iraq continues to hide chemical agents, precursors, and \nweapons. Iraq admitted in 1995 that it had produced over 500 tons of a \nlethal nerve gas agent before the Gulf war. The U.N. inspectors had \npreviously been unable to uncover evidence of this, despite a more \nrigorous inspection regime than even those mandated by the Chemical \nWeapons Convention verification regime. As noted, Iraq has neither \nsigned nor ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Iran--Iran has been producing chemical weapons at a steadily \nincreasing rate since 1984 and now has a stockpile of choking, blister \nand blood agents of over 2,000 tons. It also may have a small stockpile \nof nerve agent. It has the ability to produce an additional 1,000 tons \nof chemical agents per year.\n  It has signed but not ratified the CWC. Even so, and this is \ncritical, Iran's chemical weapons program is among the largest in the \nThird World. It has continued to expand, even since Tehran signed the \nCWC. And the Central Intelligence Agency believes that Iran has no \nintention of abiding by the terms of the CWC.\n\n  Iran is making improvements to its chemical capabilities that suggest \nit has made a long-term commitment to its chemical program. I repeat, \nthe CIA believes that Iran has no intention of abiding by the terms of \nthe CWC. It is the most active state sponsor of international \nterrorism. It is directly involved in planning and directing terrorist \nattacks. And it could supply chemical weapons to a number of terrorist \ngroups. Iran has not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Syria has produced chemical weapons since the mid-1980's. The CIA \nbelieves that it is likely that Syria's chemical weapons program will \ncontinue to expand. Syria can indigenously produce\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\nnerve agents and mustard gas, and is stockpiling both agents. It may \nhave produced chemical warheads for its Frog and Scud missiles for use \nagainst Israeli cities. Syria has not signed nor ratified the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  Libya--Libya has produced at least 100 tons of chemical agents, \nincluding mustard and nerve gas. Libya is capable of delivering its \nchemical weapons with aerial bombs, and may be working to develop a \nchemical warhead for ballistic missiles. It also possesses cruise \nmissiles. Libya has neither signed nor ratified the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  Mr. President, the point is, unless these countries are party to this \ntreaty, whatever benefits the treaty has are essentially meaningless. \nThis is one of the reasons why former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney \nsaid this, in a letter he wrote about a week ago. He said:\n\n       Those nations most likely to comply with the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention are not likely to ever constitute a \n     military threat to the United States. The governments we \n     should be concerned about are likely to cheat on the CWC, \n     even if they do participate.\n       In effect, [he wrote] the Senate is being asked to ratify \n     the CWC even though it is likely to be ineffective, \n     unverifiable, and unenforceable. Having ratified the \n     convention, we will then be told we have ``dealt with the \n     problem of chemical weapons'' when in fact we will have not. \n     But, ratification of the CWC will lead to a sense of \n     complacency, totally unjustified given the flaws in the \n     convention.\n\n  Finally, to the point. The Senator from Massachusetts said that we \nare somehow holding ourselves hostage to the rogue states. Precisely \nthe opposite is the case. We decide when to join this convention, not \nbecause the administration says there is an automatic deadline under \nwhich we have to do so, but when we say it will matter. When we are not \nhaving to pay 25 percent of the costs of a meaningless convention, in \neffect 25 percent of the costs to inspect ourselves. Mr. President, \n$200 million a year to help this U.N.-style bureaucracy, in addition to \nputting the businesses of the United States through all the hoops they \nare going to have to go through in order to comply with this \nconvention.\n  I have written to my constituents the names of companies on the list \nsupplied to us by the Government as potentially required to comply with \nthe reporting requirements of the convention. They write back to me \nsaying it would cost them $50,000, $70,000, or more than $100,000 a \nyear, just to fill out the forms.\n  What we are saying is, instead of putting our businesses through the \nexpense and hassle of having to comply with this when nobody in the \nUnited States has any intention of violating this treaty--these \ncompanies back in Arizona have no intention of producing chemical \nweapons--instead of submitting ourselves to that intrusive bureaucratic \nregulation and expense, not to mention the expense to the U.S. \ntaxpayer, let us be involved in this when it means something; that is \nto say, when the countries we really care about are involved in it.\n  Finally, to the point that we are somehow associating ourselves with \nthugs by not joining, I find that really an argument that is, really--\n  Mr. HELMS. Insulting?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I don't want to use the word insulting, but \nit has no persuasive force, let's put it that way.\n  Does this mean if a country like Iran or Cuba, for example, signs up, \nthat we would be associating with lesser thugs? Actually, don't the \nproponents of the treaty want us to associate with thug nations, if \nthis is going to mean anything? Don't we want all of those countries in \nthe treaty with us?\n  Somehow, under their logic, we don't want to associate with these \nthugs. Yet, they want to pass a treaty that, presumably, if it is going \nto mean anything, has these thugs in it, in which case we are \nassociating with them.\n  Obviously, the point is not whether we are associating with thugs. I \ndon't think that any of us can fail to make appropriate distinctions \nhere. The fact of the matter is, those thug nations, if this treaty is \nto mean anything, ought to be part of the organization and, at that \ntime, the United States then could participate in a meaningful way. \nUntil those thugs are a part of this treaty, we are just wasting our \ntime and money and putting a lot of our citizens to an awful lot of \nunnecessary hassle.\n  The point of this condition is to make a point, to make the point \nthat the countries that really matter are not even going to be governed \nby this treaty. It is one of the reasons why this treaty, in the end, \ncannot be supported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, allow me to inquire of the distinguished \ncolleague, does he have somebody ready to go now? I do, if he does not.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Why don't you go ahead?\n  Mr. HELMS. I believe I have an hour and 6 minutes that I saved a \nwhile ago. I yield 10 minutes of that to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee for his leadership on this issue, for \ntalking about this treaty so that all of America is beginning to see \nwhat the issues are.\n  I hope to be able to support the Chemical Weapons Convention as \nstrengthened by the resolution of ratification introduced by the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Before I address this resolution, I want to draw our attention to the \nremarkable events in Lima, Peru. The Peruvian Armed Forces and police \nconducted a bold, daytime raid and rescued 71 of the 72 hostages being \nheld by a terrorist group for 4 months. As part of the operation, the \nPeruvian Army used riot control agents to stun the terrorists and \nrescue the hostages.\n  I would caution my colleagues, regardless of where they come out on \nthis treaty, that the actions of the Peruvian Armed Forces that \nresulted in minimal loss of life among the hostages were quite possibly \na violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which expressly forbids \nthe use of riot control agents as a method of warfare.\n  I make this point because this treaty has many things in it that we \nmust think about very carefully. I believe the proposals the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina has offered in the resolution \nbefore us will turn a flawed treaty into an effective, verifiable tool \nof American foreign policy. We are talking about safeguards that ensure \nthe treaty will be something that America can support, knowing that we \nare protected, both in our constitutional rights and in the security of \nour country.\n  One of the amendments before us today would take away one of the very \nimportant elements of protection about which I speak. The amendment I \nam referring to does not require that the Director of the CIA certify \nthat the countries which have been determined to have offensive \nchemical weapons, like Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea, China--\nhave ratified the convention. We want to make sure that those countries \nare going to come under the auspices of this convention. I think it is \nimportant that we have those safeguards.\n  So, I hope my colleagues will support the resolution, the underlying \nresolution, rather than the amendments that are being put forward.\n  I am glad the Senate is taking the opportunity to improve this \ntreaty. Our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on \ntreaties is one of the most important that we have. Unfortunately, we \nhave gotten into the bad habit of all consent and no advice. When it \ncomes to that, we cannot let that happen. That is why we are here. That \nis why the Constitution requires two-thirds of our body to ratify any \ntreaty that America would participate in.\n  Mr. President, international treaties extend the full faith and \ncredit of the United States, and they become the law of our land when \nthey are ratified. So the United States cedes a little sovereignty with \nevery treaty the Senate ratifies. That is why the framers of our \nConstitution wanted to be very careful that two-thirds of the Senate \nwould be needed to ratify any treaty that would become the law of our \nland.\n  Like no other treaty before it, the Chemical Weapons Convention will \nmake this loss of sovereignty apparent to thousands of Americans at \nthousands of companies who will be faced with new Government \nregulations or be subject to searches and seizures of\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\ntheir property by teams of international inspectors. These are the \npractical effects this treaty will have on ordinary Americans.\n  As many as 670 companies in my home State of Texas will be directly \naffected by this treaty. Only a handful of these companies are actually \nin the chemical industry. Many others use small amounts of chemicals \nfor legal, nonmilitary purposes. But according to this treaty, they \nwill be required to submit business information to a new United \nNations-style international organization that will monitor this treaty, \nor they will have to open their property to inspections by teams of \ninternational inspectors.\n  Because of the way this treaty will affect ordinary Americans, it is \na profound departure from previous arms control treaties which were \nreally limited to military contractors and installations. That is why \nwe must look so carefully at this treaty. If we are going to impose \nthis burden on ordinary Americans, then we must make sure that the \nbenefits outweigh the costs.\n  First, let me say, without qualification, that chemical warfare is \nreprehensible and it deserves uniform condemnation. I am proud that the \nUnited States has already decided to destroy any chemical weapons that \nwe might have with or without this treaty. But, Mr. President, it is \nalso our responsibility to make sure that we have defenses against any \ncountry that might use chemical weapons in order to be sure that we are \nnot unilaterally disarming ourselves.\n  I support the 1989 and 1990 agreements between the United States and \nRussia that ban the production of chemical weapons and require both \ncountries to destroy their stockpiles. Those two agreements were backed \nup by tough onsite inspections in which each side can watch the other \ndestroy the weapons.\n  Unfortunately, neither the Geneva Protocol against chemical weapons \nuse nor the two agreements that we have signed with Russia are actually \nbeing enforced.\n  When the Government of Iraq used chemical weapons against its own \ncitizens in the 1980's, the United Nations could not even agree upon a \nresolution condemning Iraq.\n  The two Russian agreements are dead, too. The Russian Prime Minister \ntold Vice President Gore in July 1996 that both agreements have \noutlived their usefulness. It appears that the Russians do not intend \nto honor these agreements. I remind my colleagues that Russia has the \nworld's largest stockpile of chemical weapons, and this is not a \ntrivial matter.\n  So, Mr. President, we have three good, tough, supposedly enforceable \ninternational agreements to restrict the use of and destroy chemical \nweapons. But those agreements have failed. So now we are here today to \nconsider another agreement, even tougher, that involves more countries, \nand we hope it will work where others have failed.\n  Mr. President, I think we have to address three key questions when we \nare talking about not only destroying our chemical weapons but sharing \nthe technology that we have for defending against them.\n\n  My first question: Will this treaty achieve the desired objective, an \nobjective we all want, and that is to rid the world of chemical \nweapons?\n  I do not think so. Even the most ardent supporter of the treaty knows \nthat this is not going to rid the world of chemical weapons. We know \nthat there are outlaw regimes producing chemical weapons as we speak \nthat have no intention of signing or ratifying this treaty.\n  Iraq is one example. Iraq makes a mockery of international \nagreements. The Government of Iraq has used chemical weapons against \nits own people, for Heaven's sake. Who among us believes that a \ngovernment that would do this would honor an agreement when it has \nalready used these weapons on its own people?\n  Even worse, this treaty as written actually encourages the spread of \nchemical weapons technology among the countries that are parties to it \nbecause articles X and XI require treaty participants to share their \nchemical weapons defense technologies and prohibits countries from \nplacing restrictions on commerce in chemicals that can be used for \nweapons purposes.\n  Mr. President, I think what we see here is good-intentioned, but we \nare talking about restricting ourselves from producing chemical \nweapons, which we want to do, and we are talking about sharing our \ndefenses against chemical weapons with countries that may be \nrepresented in international inspection groups that would come into our \nbusinesses and could easily give this information back to the countries \nwho are not signatories.\n  That is why these amendments are so important, so that every one of \nthese countries that has chemical weapons will be a party to this \nagreement, so that at least we would know that we have some ability to \nsanction these countries when they are not able to show us that they \nare complying.\n  Mr. President, my second question is: Can we determine with \nreasonable accuracy that the other countries that have signed the \ntreaty will honor it, as we certainly will? We all remember President \nReagan's words, ``trust but verify.'' We need the ability to verify.\n  This is a treaty that I am afraid there is no way we could really \nverify. In fact, even the supporters admit that you cannot really \nverify it. We are trying to strengthen it so that we will have at least \nsome ability. But then it comes into question, are we going to exercise \nthose abilities?\n  I think one of the concerns that I have is that we know that \ncountries with whom we trade, countries with whom we have good \nrelations, are actually selling the equipment to make nuclear weapons \nto these countries that are rogue nations, that are terrorist states, \nright now as we speak. Germany is. Russia is. China is.\n  What are we doing about it? What are we doing? We are not standing up \nand saying, there are consequences to that action, because we do not \nwant to rock the boat in some other area of foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, if we are not going to stand up when countries with \nwhom we are trading and with whom we have friendly relations are this \nvery day selling nuclear weapons or nuclear capabilities to rogue \nnations, like Iran and Iraq, how could we ever say that this treaty \nwould be verifiable and that all of the signatories would comply with \nthis treaty and that we would in fact do anything if they were not?\n  Mr. President, my third question is: Can we protect the \nconstitutional rights of ordinary Americans affected by the treaty who \nare engaged in activities that have nothing to do with the production \nof chemical weapons? I think this is one of the most important issues--\nthe constitutional right against an unreasonable search or seizure.\n  The protections offered by the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Mr. Helms, is a first step. But we are going to have to hold \non to the protections that have been put in the bill by the committee \nbecause the fourth amendment to the Constitution is a pillar of the \nBill of Rights. It protects the rights of our people against \nunreasonable searches and seizures. Yet this agreement, the chemical \nweapons treaty, would allow people to come in, international groups, to \ninspect our companies, not companies that are making chemical weapons--\nwe do not do that--but companies that use chemicals for any other \nmyriad of purposes, to get their trade secrets or our defense \nmechanisms against the chemical weapons that we may have to face one \nday.\n\n  Mr. President, I am just very worried that we would disarm ourselves \nand lose the ability to protect ourselves against a rogue nation that \nwill not sign and ratify this treaty.\n  The amendments offered today would take away the protections that are \nnow in the resolution against that happening because the resolution \nsays all of these rogue nations must be a party to the agreement so \nthat at least we would have the mechanisms to go in and try to find \nthese chemical weapons. Yet, you know even the best effort that we have \nbeen able to make in finding chemical weapons in Iraq have failed. \nRight now our international agreements allow us to look in Iraq for \nchemical weapons. We have not found any. And yet all of the inspectors \nin the international group that are trying to find those weapons have \nnot been able to do it, but they say they know they are there. They are \nsure that they are there. So the verifiability becomes a real issue.\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\n  Mr. President, I think that the committee has done an excellent job \nof protecting the interests of Americans in this treaty. I hope that we \ncan keep the safeguards so that all of us can vote for this treaty. I \nwould like to because I respect the people who are for the treaty.\n  I have the greatest regard for President Bush. I think he is a \nwonderful man. He would never leave the United States of America \ndefenseless. But you know, if Senator Kyl and Senator Helms had not \nstood up, one of the safeguards that President Bush put in the treaty \nwould have been taken out, and that is the use of tear gas by our \nforces in wartime, because President Bush made sure that we said right \nup front, yes, we will use tear gas because we would rather use tear \ngas than bullets.\n  President Clinton disagreed with that. He said, no, we would not use \ntear gas. But because of the efforts of Senator Helms and Senator Kyl, \nwe have been able to agree on that issue.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope to be able to support this treaty. I thank \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee for allowing me to speak \nand for his leadership. I would like to be able to support it, but I \nwill not support this treaty without the safeguards to the security of \nAmerica. That is my first responsibility.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, the objective of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the \ndebate that we are involved in now, is leadership, a question of \nleadership by our country.\n  We can take a look at all the exceptions and the negative views, but \nthe very positive force I think we want to stress in framing this issue \nis, the United States of America, our statesmen, President Ronald \nReagan, George Bush, now President Bill Clinton, and many who have \nworked with them in the Armed Forces and in statecraft, recognize that \nour country has a very substantial problem in the world; namely, that \nof chemical weapons.\n  We came to a determination on our part that these weapons were \nunreliable, unstable, dangerous, and so dangerous, as a matter of fact, \nthat we did not wish to employ them--we wished to destroy them. We have \nbeen doing that as a nation.\n\n  Our dilemma is that other nations, primarily Russia, with substantial \nstores much greater than our own, but a variety of other nations, \npurportedly have these weapons. Our problem is to convince other \nnations in the world that we all ought to be about the task of ending \nproduction of these weapons, ending possession, storage, ending any \nvestige of them.\n  Now, in order to do that, we have to bring other nations into this \nwith us. Therefore, we have offered leadership now for many years. We \nhave convinced 74 other nations that have already ratified the Chemical \nWeapons Convention that they ought to be with us in this quest. I make \nthat point at the outset, Mr. President, because the motion before the \nSenate is to strike a condition added, at least to this treaty, that \nwould say we ought to forgo our leadership, we ought to really forget \nwhat our objective has been for years. I presume we ought to forget we \nare in the process of destroying all of our own chemical weapons and \nsimply hope that others might proceed.\n  As a matter of fact, if we do not ratify this convention this \nevening, others will proceed, but they will proceed without us. Our \ndiplomacy with Russia will be severely impaired. As a result, even \nthough we are working with Russia now--as a matter of fact, to help \nthem destroy chemical weapons--through reasons the world will find hard \nto understand, we will have denied the very treaty we have asked others \nto join us in. It makes no sense.\n  Let me say with all due respect to those who formulated the idea that \nwe should not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention unless the so-\ncalled rogue states--named as North Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, and \nIraq--join, must have really stayed up nights trying to think of some \nway to throw us off course. I presume they felt that our antipathy to \nsome of these states would be such that we would say if they are not \ngoing to be a part of it, we ought not to be a part of it, we ought to \nsimply go after them in a unilateral way. Let me examine that for a \nmoment, Mr. President.\n  The Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Massachusetts have \ntalked about law, about legitimacy. As a matter of fact, our Nation \ndoes have the mobility to be an enforcer. In the event we feel our \nsecurity is threatened, our President might, in fact, consider a \nmilitary action against a nation that offered a security threat to us. \nBut let us examine the implications if our President decides to do \nthis. If he is going to act unilaterally without benefit of \ninternational law--and international law does count because other \nnations understand the implications of that cooperation and the binding \nthat brings--if we are going to contemplate solo strikes without \nbenefit of international law, then we will have to think about \noverflight rights, about the problems of our pilots if our aircraft are \ndown, about a number of implications in which we count upon cooperation \nof nation-states. International law does count. It makes a difference \nthat there is a law against this, and that the United States acts with \nother nations and with their backing to enforce that, and that we shall \nhave to do.\n  Much has been said about lack of military will or lack of political \nwill, but, Mr. President, I have seen very little of that in this \nChamber during this debate. We are serious about this.\n  Mr. President, let me add just as a topical matter, because the \nMembers of the Senate who have been watching local television at least \nin the last half-hour appreciate that in northwest Washington, in the \ndowntown area near the B'nai B'rith headquarters, a vial of chemical \nmaterial or biological material is present that authorities of the \npolice and fire department and special persons in the Washington, DC, \narea have now picked up this material, and people in the B'nai B'rith \nheadquarters are being decontaminated. A suggestion is that it may be \nanthrax, a very deadly biological weapon.\n  It was not long ago on this floor, Mr. President, that the Nunn-\nLugar-Domenici Act was debated and we talked then in terms of \nattempting to bring Department of Defense resources into play with the \ncities of this country--Washington, DC, being prominent among them, \nAtlanta, GA, Denver, CO, and 23 other cities have been named--so that \nin the event there should be anthrax, which was specifically mentioned \nin the debate, we were prepared to move. That is leadership, Mr. \nPresident. We saw the threat and we prepared to move upon it. We have \ndone so.\n\n  Now, we will do so with regard to the international scene. But the \ntreaty gives us the basis of international law. To suggest for a \nmoment, Mr. President, we ought to be deterred from our leadership by \nwhether Iraq joins, whether Iran is involved, whether North Korea \nshould ever be involved, is to stretch credibility really to the \nbreaking point. These nations are irrelevant to our membership and our \nleadership. They are irrelevant to our standing for international law \nand our ability to act, and to act decisively. That must be our \nstandard, Mr. President. With imagination, one will think of all sorts \nof hobgoblins that can be thrown up to make an interesting debate, but \ndebate is leadership, and debate is decisive political will, and the \ndebate is our ability to convince other nations of the world they \nshould come with us, that we are reliable, that we stay the course, \nthat our word is good, administration after administration.\n  Mr. President, this is the reason we should vote to strike this \namendment, this condition, from the convention immediately, decisively. \nIt has been a point, clearly, a parliamentary procedure, and that our \nfailure to do so, as a matter of fact, jeopardizes the entire treaty. \nIt is improbable, if not impossible, our Nation would ever join, would \never follow through on our leadership, if we were to wait upon states\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\nthat are irrelevant to the whole proposition.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, by saying obviously, threats in those \nstates are not relevant. We must be decisive. We need going for us \ninternational law, enhancement of our intelligence that the intrusive \ninspections and all of the trade accounts will give to us, so that when \nwe strike, we will strike accurately and completely and bring the \nsecurity to the world that this treaty attempts to promote.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield such time as the Senator from Arizona may consume.\n  Mr. KYL. I will be very brief to a matter of news interest here in \nthe Washington, DC, area. People might be watching this on a different \nchannel of their television, viewing the ambulances and people \nattempting to assist, and at least two people who appear to have been \nexposed to some kind of chemical agent. My understanding is that \nSenator Lugar has just discussed this matter briefly, as well. This \noccurred at or near a B'nai B'rith facility here in Washington, DC.\n  I think that while neither side in this debate would want to use an \nunfortunate incident to bolster their case, and while our first concern \nought to be for the people who may have been exposed to some agent \nhere--and we all certainly hope there is no harm done and that if, in \nfact, it was not accidental that the perpetrators are dealt with in the \nappropriate fashion--I think it is also an inappropriate place to make \nthe point that contrary to those who assert that the Chemical Weapons \nConvention deals with this problem, it does not. We should be very, \nvery clear about that.\n  There are reasons for proponents to suggest that this Chemical \nWeapons Convention should be supported. There are arguments of \nopponents as to why that should not be the case. But I hope that we do \nnot have people arguing on the floor of the Senate here that the \nChemical Weapons Convention will deter terrorists, that somehow this \nwill make us safer from terrorist attack, because it cannot fulfill \nthat noble goal. We will literally be buying on to something that \ncannot come to pass if the treaty proponents try to sell it on that \nbasis.\n  As a matter of fact, there is specific declassified intelligence \ninformation directly on this point. I will quote that before the \nchairman resumes his time. A declassified section of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency document of February 1996, with specific reference \nto the Tokyo subway attack by terrorists at that time said:\n\n       Irrespective of whether the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     enters into force, terrorists will likely look upon CW as a \n     means to gain greater publicity and instill widespread fear. \n     The March 1995 Tokyo subway attack by Aum Shinrikyo would not \n     have been prevented by the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  In May of 1996, another CIA report, a portion of which has been \ndeclassified, contains this statement:\n\n       In the case of Aum Shinrikyo the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention would not have hindered the cult from procuring \n     the needed chemical compounds used in the production of \n     sarin. Further, the Aum Shinrikyo would have escaped CWC \n     requirement for an end use certification because it purchased \n     the chemicals within Japan.\n\n  There are some additional things we can quote. The point I am making \nis that reasonable people can differ about the pros and cons of this \ntreaty. That will be reflected in the vote on the treaty here. I hope \nthat Americans do not get the idea that we will be safe from terrorist \nattack or even significantly safer by the adoption of this Chemical \nWeapons Convention. Terrorist attacks are not what it was designed to \ndeal with. I hope that point is crystal clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator for that explanation. I think it was \nvery timely.\n  I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. \nInhofe], following which I suggest we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \namendment.\n  Does the Senator wish to yield from your resolution time?\n  Mr. HELMS. In that case, I misunderstood the statement of the \nParliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina, do you yield \nthe remaining time of the amendment or from the resolution time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. I will probably not take the 12 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Arizona is exactly right. I think even the strongest \nopponents of the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention have \nsaid this is not going to affect terrorist activities. Obviously, by \nthe very title ``terrorists'' they are not going to be complying with \nthis.\n  I have to say I feel the same way about these countries that we are \ndiscussing right now. The condition which is under debate at this time \nis whether or not to strike that portion with regard to Iran, Syria, \nLibya, North Korea, and China. It would be, if we were only concerned \nabout those countries that have signed or have ratified or have an \nexpressed intention to ratify, that would be very nice, because we \nwould be talking about Canada, the Fiji Islands, Costa Rica, and \nSingapore, Iceland. That is not where the threat is. The threat is the \nrogue nations. That is what we are talking about right now.\n  I will for a moment bring this up to date by quoting a couple of \nthings. General Schwarzkopf, during a press conference in Riyadh said:\n\n       ,The nightmare scenario for all of us would have been to go \n     through this [the Iraqi tank barrier], get hung up in this \n     breach right here, and then have the enemy artillery rain \n     chemical weapons down on the troops that were in the gaggle \n     in the breach right here.\n\n  General Hughes said:\n\n       In any attack in the south, Pyongyang could use chemical \n     weapons to attack forces deployed near the DMZ, suppress \n     allied air power, and isolate the peninsula from strategic \n     reinforcement.\n\n  Four days ago in a Seoul, North Korea, newspaper there was an article \nquoting very high North Korean officials as saying they now have \nadequate chemical weapons to annihilate South Korea. This is going on \nas we speak. So we are talking about nations that are not going to be \nour friends. These are the ones that, whether they are signatories, or \nwhether they ratify or not, it doesn't make too much difference. It \ntickles me when they talk about, ``Russia is going to do that.'' Last \nnight, I was on a talk show and we finally agreed that on the 1990 \nBilateral Destruction Agreement, they have been found in noncompliance \nof that, and of the START I, of the Conventional Forces in Europe. Even \nthough my opponent denied it was the INF, in fact, they were. In the \n1995 Arms Control Disarmament Agency report, it says they were not in \ncompliance with that; the ABM Treaty, they have not been in compliance \nwith that.\n\n  But let's assume if a country like Russia doesn't comply when they \nratify, what about these rogue nations? I can tell you for sure that \nthose proponents of the ratification have gone to every extent possible \nto make it look like--or to make us believe that the Reagan \nadministration, if they were here today, would be in support of this \nChemical Weapons Convention. I can assure you that they would not. \nCoincidentally, I happened to be on a talk show--``Crossfire''--with a \nvery fine gentlemen, Ken Adelman. He had been in the Reagan \nadministration. We found out, after he gave his testimonial as to why \nwe should ratify--and he admitted it was not verifiable nor is it \nglobal, but he still thought we should do it--that Mr. Adelman might be \nprejudiced by his membership on two boards of directors, the \nInternational Planning and Analysis Center and on Newmeyer and \nAssociates. These companies, which he directs, have clients in many \nforeign countries, including China and Japan, and they represent \ncompanies that deal in chemicals such as those from the UpJohn Co. \nPeople say this is just chemicals. It is not just chemical companies we \nare talking about. In this chemical association that gets so much \nattention, it represents 192 chemical companies. These are the large \nones, the giants. There are some 4,000 other companies, and you can \nexpand it beyond purely chemical companies to some 8,000 other \ncompanies, most of whom are opposed to this, because they would be shut \nout in the competition.\n  I think the whole thing on this particular amendment is whether or \nnot this would have any positive effect on the rogue nations if we \nshould ratify\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. I don't think there is anybody here \nwho is so naive to think that, voluntarily, if they are a part of it, \nthey would reduce their chemical behavior. I think those of us in this \nroom can argue and debate that.\n  So I go back to the people who are the real authorities. You have \nheard Dick Cheney quoted several times on the floor, in his letter that \nwe have quoted several times. He said, ``Indeed some aspects of the \npresent convention--notably, its obligation to share with potential \nadversaries, like Iran, chemical manufacturing technology that can be \nused for military purposes in chemical defense equipment--threaten to \nmake this accord worse than having no treaty at all.'' That is Dick \nCheney, not some guy that read a couple of articles and determined it \nwas wrong. What is he talking about? He is talking about something that \nwill be debated here shortly, and we will get into that in more detail. \nPart of article X says, ``The technical secretariat shall establish not \nlater than 180 days after entry into force of this contract, and \nmaintain for the use of any requesting state party, a data bank \ncontaining freely available information concerning various means of \nprotection against chemical weapons, as well as such information as may \nbe provided by states' parties.''\n  Well, I can remember in the Armed Services Committee when Schwarzkopf \nwas here. I said:\n\n       General, you are in support of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n\n  I read that, and then I will read a transcript, because I think \neverybody who might be basing their vote on what General Schwarzkopf \nsaid, here is a transcript from that meeting:\n\n       Senator Inhofe. Do you think it wise to share with \n     countries like Iran our most advanced chemical defensive \n     equipment and technology?\n       General Schwarzkopf. Our defensive capabilities?\n       Senator Inhofe. Yes.\n       General Schwarzkopf. Absolutely not.\n       Senator Inhofe. Well, I'm talking about sharing our \n     advanced chemical defensive equipment and technologies, which \n     I believe under article X (they) would be allowed to (get). \n     Do you disagree?\n       General Schwarzkopf. As I said, Senator, I'm not familiar \n     with all the details--you know--you know, a country, \n     particularly like Iran, I think we should share as little as \n     possible with them in the way of our military capabilities.\n\n  I am not critical of General Schwarzkopf. It is a very complicated \nthing. I don't know how many people read the whole thing. I haven't, \nbut I read enough to know, as far as our treatment with rogue nations, \nI would not want to be ratifying this contract unless they ratified it. \nThen I would not trust them any more than we would trust Russia, and if \nthey do ratify, I question if they will honor it.\n  One of the other conditions we are going to talk about is, should we \ndo it, should we put in a requirement that they would have to ratify \nbefore we will. Well, we had that requirement 2 years ago when I voted \nagainst the START II treaty. They said we have to do it before Russia \nbecause they won't ratify unless we do. Guess what, Mr. President, they \nstill haven't ratified.\n  Lastly, to kind of express the urgency of this, former Secretary of \nDefense, James Schlesinger, said, ``To the extent that others learn \nfrom international sharing of information on chemical warfare defenses, \nour vulnerability is enhanced rather than diminished. Finally, this \ntreaty in no way helps shield our soldiers from one of battlefield's \ndeadliest killers. As indicated earlier, only the threat of effective \nretaliation provides such protection.''\n  What he is saying there is not that we would use chemical weapons, \nbut by the fact that we are not a party to this treaty is one that \nwould at least offer some type of a deterrent. So I think, Mr. \nPresident, when you look and read of the hostility that is over there--\nJames Woolsey said, in 1993:\n\n       More than two dozen countries have programs to research or \n     develop chemical weapons, and a number have stockpiled such \n     weapons, including Libya, Iran, and Iraq--\n\n  Three of the countries we are talking about:\n\n       The military competition in the always volatile Middle East \n     has spurred others in the region to develop chemical weapons. \n     We have also noted a disturbing pattern of biological weapons \n     development following closely on the heels of the development \n     of chemical weapons.\n\n  Mr. President, the threat is there, and we know that other countries \ncan sell their technology, as well as their systems, to rogue nations. \nWe know Russia has done this, to specifically Iran and other nations, \nnot when they sold their technology, but also their equipment. So it is \na very scary thing to think that we might be putting ourselves in a \nposition that would increase our exposure to the threat of chemical \nwarfare and would increase the proliferation of chemical weapons in the \nMiddle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I believe time has expired. Parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Chair will refresh my memory, a motion to table is \nnot in order, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time would have to be yielded back on the \namendment in order for a motion to table to be in order. The unanimous-\nconsent agreement does not appear to preclude a motion to table.\n  Mr. HELMS. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Currently, the Senator from North Carolina \nwould have 4 minutes 27 seconds on the amendment. The Senator from \nDelaware would have 2 minutes 37 seconds.\n\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains for me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 2 minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself the remaining time. I will speak to a \ncouple of points. With regard to Ken Adelman, I am sure our colleague \nfrom Oklahoma didn't mean to impugn his motivation by suggesting for \nwhom he worked. I would not suggest that of Mr. Rumsfeld because of \nwhere he works now, that it caused him to have that view. Ken Adelman--\nalthough I disagree with him most of the time, he was an able member of \nthe administration. He was viewed as a hawk at the time he was here. \nFor the record, I am sure there was no intention to do that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, I made it very clear before my \nremarks that I hold him in the highest of esteem. However, the fact \nremains that he does work for those companies that have an interest, \nand that could be a conflict of interest. I think that could be drawn \nby anyone.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for making clear what he meant. I \ndidn't think that's what he meant. I was hoping that is not what he \nmeant, but it is what he meant. That could be said about almost \neverybody who testified before our committee, for and against this \ntreaty, and I really, quite frankly, think that the leaders for and \nagainst this treaty in the last two administrations are men and women \nof integrity who would have no conflict. They are consistent with what \nthey did within those administrations.\n  Let me point out a few things. It seems interesting to me that here \nwe are, the very people--our very colleagues who want to have a \nprovision saying that we want all these rogue nations in the treaty \nbefore we get into the treaty, argue in the alternative, that these \nnations in the treaty mean the treaty is worthless. Translated, very \nsimply, they are not for this treaty under any circumstance, whether or \nnot these nations are in the treaty or out of the treaty. I also point \nout that--in the interest of time, I will not be able to point it out \nin detail--every argument against this treaty made thus far on the \nfloor today, I respectfully suggest, is made worse by not being in the \ntreaty, by not having the treaty. I find it, quite frankly, \ninteresting.\n  My time is up. I hope my colleague will not move to table. We agree \nnot to attempt to amend any of these conditions. I hope we will have a \nvote up or down. Apparently, it is not in the agreement. If he chooses \nto do it, I guess he has the right.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I shall not move to table. I will yield \nback such time as I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 47.\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 71, nays 29, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 46 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--71\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith Gordon H\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--29\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith Bob\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n  The amendment (No. 47) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, can I get time off the manager's time from \nthe bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do still have my leader time. If I need that, we can use \nthat also.\n  Mr. President, I had planned on and had hoped to be able to speak \nafter all of the votes on the motions to strike because I did not in \nany way want to distract from those motions to strike. I have hopes \nthat at least some of them might actually be defeated, particularly the \none with regard to inspectors coming into the United States from some \nof the so-called rogue countries, but I think it is important we go \nahead and state our positions at this point. Everybody has made their \ncase. It is time to make decisions and to move on. I want to start by \nthanking Senator Helms for his cooperation. Without his cooperation, we \nwould not be here today. His cooperation guaranteed that we were able \nto develop a process that was fair, that allowed us to get S. 495 up \nand voted on last week, that all of the remaining issues in \ndisagreement would have an opportunity to be debated, considered and \nvoted upon.\n  He really has done an excellent job. There is no question that he \ncontinues to have great reservations about this legislation. But his \nefforts and the efforts of Senator Kyl from Arizona have been nothing \nshort of heroic. They have been tenacious. They have done their \nhomework. They have made excellent statements both here and in our \nclosed session earlier today. I think they should be commended for what \nthey have done. In fact, their work and their success has contributed \ngreatly to the likelihood that this treaty actually will pass. That had \nnot necessarily been their intent, but they wanted to make sure, if it \ndid pass, they wanted it to pass in the best possible form.\n  I also thank the Democratic leader for his courtesies as we worked \nthrough a very complicated unanimous-consent agreement. We were watched \nover very carefully by the Senator from West Virginia. I thank the \nSenator from Delaware, [Mr. Biden] for his cooperation and his \npatience, and I think the fact that we have all sort of kept cool heads \nand been careful how we proceeded has served us well.\n  Mr. President, our Constitution is unique in the power it grants the \nSenate in treaty making. Article II, section 2 states the President \n``shall have the power, by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.''\n  The Senate's coequal treaty making power is one of our most important \nconstitutional duties. All 100 Senators have approached this duty very \nseriously in examining the Chemical Weapons Convention, as we should. \nWe have participated in and we have listened to hearings laying out the \narguments for and against the convention. We have looked closely at \nmany provisions of the convention and have sought the advice and \ncounsel of experts and former policymakers. We read many articles and \nwe have heard the arguments making the case for and against it.\n  Before addressing my views on the convention itself, I should like to \nshare with my colleagues a brief history of the Senate's action on this \nconvention, how we got to where we are today.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed by the United States as an \noriginal signatory on January 13, 1993, in the last days of President \nBush's administration. For reasons that remain unclear, it was 10 \nmonths before President Clinton sent the convention to the Senate. In \nhis transmittal letter, dated November 23, 1993, President Clinton \nwrote:\n\n       I urge the Senate to give early and favorable consideration \n     to the convention and to give advice and consent to its \n     ratification as soon as possible in 1994.\n\n  Let me remind my colleagues that for the next 11 months, until the \n103d Congress adjourned on December 1, 1994, the Senate majority leader \nwas George Mitchell and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nwas Claiborne Pell.\n  Despite Democratic control of the White House and the Senate, the \nSenate did not consider the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1994.\n  In late 1995, Senate Democrats began a filibuster on the State \nDepartment authorization bill to force action on the CWC. On December \n7, 1995, an agreement was reached providing for the convention to be \nreported out of the Foreign Relations Committee by April 30, 1996. The \ncommittee honored that agreement, and the convention was placed on the \nExecutive Calendar.\n  That is where matters stood when I became majority leader on June 12, \n1996. Only 6 days later, before I had a chance to get my sea legs at \nall, there began a filibuster once again by the Senate Democrats to \nforce Senate action on the convention.\n  To allow critical national defense legislation to proceed, we worked \nwith Senators on both sides of the aisle, and again we reached an \nagreement guaranteeing a vote by September 13, 1996.\n  In the weeks preceding the vote, opponents and proponents of the \nconvention made their case to Senators. On September 6, 1996, I \nrequested the declassification of certain key judgments of the \nintelligence community relating to key aspects of the convention. On \nSeptember 10, the administration partially complied with that request, \nand certain intelligence judgments were made public. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the exchange of letters on the intelligence judgments be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Government Printing Office estimates \nit will cost $1,288 to print these letters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 6, 1996.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to ask your cooperation \n     and support for Senate efforts to obtain information and \n     documents directly relevant to our consideration of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       As you know, the Senate is currently scheduled to consider \n     the Convention on or before September 14, 1996 under a \n     unanimous consent agreement reached on June 28, 1996. \n     Immediately prior to the Senate agreement on the Convention, \n     I stated, ``With respect to the Chemical Weapons Convention, \n     the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\n     will make every effort to obtain from the administration such \n     facts and documents as requested by the Chairman and ranking \n     member of the Foreign Relations Committee, in order to pursue \n     its work and hearings needed to develop a complete record for \n     the Senate . . .''\n       I regret to inform you that your administration has not \n     been fully cooperative in Senate efforts to obtain critical \n     information. Chairman Helms wrote to you on June 21, 1996--\n     prior to the Senate setting a date for a vote on the \n     Convention--and asked eight specific questions. Chairman \n     Helms also requested the provision and declassification of \n     documents and a cable relating to critical issues of Russian \n     compliance with existing chemical weapons arms control \n     agreements and with the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       On July 26, 1996, having received no response to his \n     earlier letter, Chairman Helms reiterated his earlier request \n     and asked additional questions concerning the apparent \n     Russian decision to unilaterally end implementation of the \n     1990 U.S.-Russian Bilateral Destruction Agreement on chemical \n     weapons. Chairman Helms also asked for specific information \n     and documents concerning Russian conditions for ratification \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention, as well as other \n     information important to our consideration of the Convention. \n     While Chairman Helms did receive responses to his letters on \n     July 31 and on August 13, his request for declassification of \n     documents was refused and the answers to many of his \n     questions were incomplete.\n       During a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on \n     June 17, 1996, Senator Kyl asked for a specific document--a \n     cable written in Bonn, Germany by Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency (ACDA) Director Holum concerning current \n     Russian government positions on the Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement, ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     and on U.S. assistance for the destruction of Russian \n     chemical weapons. On numerous occasions, Senator Kyl was told \n     the document did not exist. Finally, on July 26, Senator Kyl \n     was able to see a redacted version of the document under \n     tightly controlled circumstances but the document has not \n     been made available to Chairman Helms or other Senators.\n       Mr. President, the unanimous consent agreement of June 28, \n     1996, was entered into in good faith, and based on our \n     understanding that the administration could and would be \n     fully forthcoming in the provision of information and \n     documents to enable the Senate to fulfill its constitutional \n     responsibilities. Numerous judgements of the United States \n     intelligence community deserve as wide a circulation as \n     possible--particularly since they are distinctly different \n     than some public statements made by officials of your \n     Administration concerning the Convention.\n       Accordingly, I respectfully request that you reconsider \n     your refusal to declassify critical documents and consider \n     the declassification of important intelligence community \n     judgements--consistent with the need to protect intelligence \n     sources and methods. Specifically, I request that you act \n     immediately to declassify the May 21, 1996, cable written by \n     ACDA Director Holum and the July 8, 1996, letter from Russian \n     Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to Vice-President Gore, and \n     consider immediately declassification of the paragraphs from \n     which the attached statements are excerpted--all drawn from \n     documents produced by the Central Intelligence Agency and the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency on the Russian chemical weapons \n     program, the verifiability of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, the effect of the Convention on the chemical \n     weapons arsenals of rogue states, and the relevance of the \n     Convention to acts of terrorism committed with chemical \n     weapons.\n       I make these requests to enable the Senate to fully prepare \n     for its consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention. I \n     am certain you would agree it is necessary for the Senate to \n     have complete and usable information in order fulfill our \n     constitutional obligations and to responsibly meet the terms \n     of the current unanimous consent agreement. Because the \n     unanimous consent agreement calls for the Senate to vote on \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention by September 14, 1996, I \n     respectfully request that you respond to my declassification \n     requests no later than the close of business on Tuesday, \n     September 10, 1996. With best wishes, I am\n           Sincerely,\n     Trent Lott.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, September 10, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The President has asked that I respond to \n     your letter regarding Senate consideration of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention (CWC).\n       On behalf of the President, I would like to thank you for \n     your cooperation and leadership in scheduling a Senate vote \n     on this vital treaty which, as you know, has been before the \n     Senate since November 1993. The CWC, which was negotiated \n     under President Reagan and concluded and signed under \n     President Bush, is an important element of our bipartisan \n     efforts over the years to address two of the most important \n     threats facing us in the post Cold War era: the proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.\n       I was concerned by your letter and regret that you believe \n     that the Administration has not been fully cooperative with \n     Senate efforts to obtain critical information. I want to \n     assure you that the Administration remains eager and \n     committed to continuing to assist the Senate in developing a \n     complete record for its consideration prior to floor action \n     on the CWC, as stated in the June 28, 1996, unanimous consent \n     agreement.\n       During the almost three years the Convention has been \n     before the Senate, the Administration has worked very hard to \n     ensure that the Senate has been fully informed on the \n     Convention and that all its questions have been answered. Our \n     efforts to inform the Senate have included testimony at 13 \n     hearings, including testimony by many Cabinet officials. We \n     have conducted dozens of briefings for members and staff by \n     representatives of key agencies, including yesterday's \n     productive session with the Arms Control Observer Group. The \n     President has appointed two Special Advisors on the CWC, to \n     address Senate questions and concerns as part of the \n     ratification process. Former Representative Martin Lancaster \n     served in this capacity in 1995 and Dr. Lori Esposito Murray \n     currently holds this position. On behalf of the President, \n     they have personally briefed every Senate office, offered \n     individual briefings to every member of the Senate and \n     personally briefed over 40 Senators.\n       In addition, we have answered over 300 questions for the \n     record. Senator Helms has asked many of these questions and \n     we have always responded to his concerns. For example, we \n     have not only provided Senator Helms our database of \n     companies likely to be affected by the CWC, but we have also \n     provided him a list of chemical companies we have determined \n     unlikely to be affected by the CWC. Overall, the \n     Administration has provided the Senate with over 1500 pages \n     of information on the CWC--over 300 pages of testimony, over \n     500 pages of answers to Senate letters and reports, over 400 \n     pages of answers to Senate questions for the treaty record \n     and over 300 pages of other documentation.\n       With regard to Senator Helms' most recent letters, the \n     President and I both personally responded to Senator Helms, \n     first on July 31 and then again on August 13; these responses \n     included detailed attachments that answered a series of \n     specific questions asked by Senator Helms.\n       The Administration has repeatedly offered to make relevant \n     classified information available to the Senate through \n     classified briefings and reports. I explained to Senator \n     Helms in my response to his most recent letters that, while I \n     regretted we could not declassify the documents he requested, \n     we remained eager to brief the Senator and any of his \n     colleagues, as well as cleared staff, at the earliest \n     possible time, both on those documents as well as on other \n     concerns. Such a briefing was provided to Senator Kyl but, to \n     date, Senator Helms has not responded to these offers.\n       We have carefully reviewed your request for \n     declassification of the May 21, 1996 cable written by ACDA \n     Director Holum, the July 8, 1996 letter from Russian Prime \n     Minister Chernomyrdin and selected paragraphs from various \n     intelligence community documents. I regret that we cannot \n     declassify the May 21, 1996 Holum Cable or the letter from \n     Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to Vice President Gore \n     because these documents have been properly classified \n     pursuant to E.O. 12958; they contain sensitive diplomatic \n     information regarding high-level, ongoing negotiations, the \n     disclosure of which may affect our ability to negotiate in \n     confidence. In addition, the correspondence you requested is \n     between the highest levels of the United States and Russian \n     governments, and was exchanged with the expectation that it \n     would be kept in the strictest confidence. As you know, an \n     essential element of the Executive Branch's conduct of \n     foreign relations is the protection of the confidentiality of \n     high level, sensitive diplomatic discussions and \n     correspondence.\n       After a careful review of the paragraphs of the \n     intelligence documents that you requested be declassified, we \n     have determined they were properly classified. However, we \n     have been able to declassify a portion of the material \n     without risk to sources and methods and it is attached. \n     The sentences and paragraphs that are still classified \n     remain so because they contain information which could \n     place sources and methods at risk. In several cases, \n     declassification of requested materials also would reveal \n     information about U.S. force vulnerabilities. The \n     paragraphs from which most of the judgments were extracted \n     remain classified because it is difficult to identify \n     clearly the source paragraphs. Therefore, granting \n     paragraph release authority could inadvertently permit \n     release of intelligence which would be damaging to \n     declassify.\n       I would like to reaffirm personally the Administration's \n     commitment to brief you or any other Senator and cleared \n     staff on the documents discussed above under appropriate \n     classification at any time before the Senate debate on the \n     CWC. As you know, a high-level Administration team briefed \n     Senators and staff on the CWC, including many of the issues \n     raised in your letter, on Monday, September 9, 1996. We \n     remain committed to continuing to assist the Senate as it \n     prepares to vote on advice and consent to ratification on \n     this vital Convention.\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\n       As part of this continuing effort, I have attached a \n     detailed response which includes the declassified material.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Anthony Lake,\n         Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n\n           Responses to Issues Raised by Majority Leader Lott\n\n       The issues addressed in the attachment to your letter \n     concern chemical weapons proliferation challenges we must \n     address, with or without the CWC. The CWC provides concrete \n     measures that will raise the costs and risks of engaging in \n     CW-related activities. The CWC also will improve our \n     knowledge about CW activities worldwide. This is why the CWC \n     has been strongly supported by both President Bush and \n     President Clinton.\n       Since the CWC was submitted to the Senate in 1993, the \n     Intelligence Community has kept the Senate fully informed of \n     its judgments regarding the Convention. During the past three \n     years, the Intelligence Community has produced two NIEs and \n     numerous other reports, testified in numerous public and \n     executive session hearings, answered dozens of intelligence \n     questions for the record and provided a number of briefings \n     on precisely the issues you raise in the attachment to your \n     letter, as well as many others.\n       Intelligence Community judgments on the CWC are not at odds \n     with Administration policy. In fact, Intelligence Community \n     judgments play an integral role in the formation of policy \n     regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention. The following \n     responses regarding the issues raised in the attachment to \n     your letter may help clarify this.\n\n\n                            1. novel agents\n\n       New chemicals of concern and novel agents are covered under \n     the CWC; it is incorrect to assert that because an agent is \n     not on the Schedules it is not subject to the CWC. The CWC \n     captures new chemicals of concern and novel agents under the \n     definition of a ``chemical weapon'' and prohibits the \n     development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, \n     use and direct or indirect transfer to anyone of chemical \n     weapons. Concerns that new chemicals of concern and novel \n     agents were being used to violate the CWC would provide a \n     basis for bilateral consultation and challenge inspection \n     under Article X of the Convention. It would not be necessary \n     to show that such chemicals are listed in the Schedules of \n     the Convention to exercise this option.\n       Furthermore, the CWC explicitly provides for expanding the \n     lists of chemicals subject to declaration and verification as \n     new CW agents are identified and to improve verification \n     procedures and equipment as new technology emerges and \n     experience is gained.\n       As regards our chemical defense capabilities, the \n     Department of Defense Counterproliferation Program is, with \n     Congress' support, already aggressively pursuing an effective \n     response to ensure that our troops are the best protected and \n     best equipped fighting force for operations in a nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical environment. The National Defense \n     Authorization Act for FY 94 led to the formation of the Joint \n     Nuclear Biological and Chemical (NBC) Defense Board, the \n     Joint Services Integration Group and the Joint Services \n     Material Group. These boards, which have representatives from \n     the Services, Joint Staff and OSD, are working to identify \n     the needs of the military for chemical/biological defense and \n     are providing input to the Defense Acquisition Board process \n     through the Secretary of Defense.\n       The U.S. military is well aware that it may be called upon \n     to operate in a hostile environment in which chemical weapons \n     may be used or threatened to be used. Though U.S. chemical \n     equipment is second to none, we understand the need to \n     continually improve our capabilities. Through the Defense \n     Acquisition Board process, the military is taking steps to \n     ensure these improvements continue. The Administration's \n     budget request for FY 97 for our chemical defense programs is \n     $505 million.\n       In this context, the following paragraph from NIE 95-9/I of \n     May 1995 is hereby declassified: ``Production of new binary \n     agents would be difficult to detect and confirm as a CWC-\n     prohibited activity.''\n\n\n            2. Russian Intentions Regarding Chemical Weapons\n\n       It is important to keep in mind, when discussing Russian \n     intentions regarding chemical weapons, that there is not yet \n     in force a treaty obligation prohibiting the possession of \n     chemical weapons against which we can measure compliance. The \n     CWC will establish such a prohibition and, most importantly, \n     the new tools to pursue any concerns we may have about \n     suspected CW activities, whether in Russia or any other State \n     Party. As the Intelligence Community has testified, the CWC \n     will provide us with access to information not otherwise \n     available which will help us in our efforts to detect, deter \n     and, if necessary, punish violations of the CWC.\n       Regarding the views of the Russian leadership, President \n     Yeltsin and other senior government officials have repeatedly \n     expressed support for the CWC. We will expect Russia and all \n     other Parties to adhere to all the Convention's provisions \n     including those concerning CW development and production. The \n     Russian Government has recently reaffirmed its commitment to \n     become an original Party to the CWC and announced it is \n     seeking speedy submission of the Convention to the Parliament \n     for ratification.\n       In this context, the following paragraph from NIE 95-9/I of \n     May 1995 is hereby declassified:\n       ``President Yeltsin has publicly endorsed CW disarmament \n     and supported ratification and implementation of CW arms \n     control agreements to which Russia is a signatory. The extent \n     to which Yeltsin has attempted to enforce his will on the \n     bureaucracy is not clear. He may not be aware of the scope of \n     ongoing CW activities, or if he is aware, he may be unable to \n     control them. We cannot exclude the possibility that Yeltsin \n     approves of an offensive CW capability and will support a \n     covert program once the CWC enters into force. He may accept \n     the military's argument about the need to retain a CW \n     capability. Moreover, being subjected to far more \n     bureaucratic pressure to sustain the program than to do away \n     with it, he may find it easier to give way to military \n     arguments.''\n       It should be noted, however, that detailed information on \n     the views of key individuals is limited and insufficient to \n     document with confidence their current personal and \n     professional positions for maintaining CW programs.\n\n\n                            3. Verification\n\n       No treaty is 100 percent verifiable. While the Intelligence \n     Community has indicated that CW development and production is \n     and will remain difficult to distinguish from legitimate \n     commercial activities, they have simultaneously noted the \n     importance of acquiring the CWC as a new collection tool to \n     aid their efforts to monitor CW proliferation, which we must \n     do, with or without the CWC.\n       The CWC's verification provisions constitute the most \n     comprehensive and intrusive verification regime every \n     negotiated, covering virtually every aspect of a CW program, \n     from development through production and stockpiling.\n       The CWC's declaration provisions will improve the U.S. \n     ability to obtain information about other countries' CW \n     efforts. These provisions will facilitate detection and \n     monitoring of prohibited activities by providing the U.S. \n     access to certain information about declarations of CW \n     production facilities and storage sites as well as relevant \n     chemical industry facilities and activities.\n       The CWC's inspection provisions permit access to both \n     declared and undeclared facilities and locations, thus making \n     clandestine CW production and stockpiling more difficult, \n     risky and expensive. Routine inspections will enhance \n     deterrence and detection of clandestine product by monitoring \n     activities and relevant chemical industry facilities. These \n     inspections will increase the cost and the risk of carrying \n     out illicit chemical weapons activities.\n       Challenge inspections will further enhance deterrence and \n     detection of prohibited activities by providing States \n     Parties with the right to request an international inspection \n     at any facility or location in another State Party in order \n     to clarify and resolve a potential compliance concern. As the \n     scope and size of a program increases, it is more likely that \n     illicit activities will be detected. Challenge inspections \n     are but one part of the CWC's comprehensive verification \n     regime which, in its totality, complements our ongoing \n     intelligence monitoring effort in this area. As former DCI \n     Woolsey testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee on June 23, 1994:\n       ``The CWC will, however, strengthen our ability to deal \n     with the problem that we confront with or without the \n     Convention: the requirement to discover what states are \n     developing and producing chemical weapons when these \n     activities are difficult to distinguish from legitimate \n     commercial endeavors. The isolation and adverse attention \n     that nonsignatories will draw upon themselves may spur \n     greater multinational cooperation in attempting to halt \n     offensive CW programs.\n       ``In sum, what the Chemical Weapons Convention provides the \n     Intelligence Community is a new tool to add to our collection \n     tool kit. It is an instrument with broad applicability, which \n     can help resolve a wide variety of problems. Moreover, it is \n     an universal tool which can be used by diplomats and \n     politicians, as well as intelligence specialists, to further \n     a common goal: elimination of the threat of chemical \n     weapons.''\n       In this context, the following paragraphs from NIE 93-32J/I \n     of August 1993 are hereby declassified:\n       ``The capability of the Intelligence Community to monitor \n     compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention is severely \n     limited and likely to remain so for the rest of the decade.''\n       ``The key provisions of the monitoring regime--challenge \n     inspections at undeclared sites--can be thwarted by a nation \n     determined to preserve a small, secret program using the \n     delays and managed access rules allowed by the convention.''\n\n\n                              4. Terrorism\n\n       The CWC will increase the difficulty for terrorists and \n     proliferators of acquiring chemical weapons and significantly \n     improve our law enforcement ability to investigate and \n     prosecute chemical terrorists even before chemical weapons \n     are used. Japan serves as an example of the importance of \n     this treaty and its implementing legislation in combating the \n     terrorist threat. Within 10 days of the poison gas attacks in \n     the Tokyo subways, the Japanese enacted the CWC implementing \n     legislation. The Japanese completed ratification of the CWC a \n     month later.\n       No treaty is foolproof. However, the CWC and its \n     implementing legislation will provide\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\n     significant benefits in dealing with the threat of chemical \n     terrorism. Implementing legislation will strengthen our legal \n     authority to investigate and prosecute persons who commit \n     acts prohibited by the treaty. It will also make the public \n     more aware of the threat of chemical weapons and of the fact \n     that the acquisition of such weapons is illegal .\n       The following are among it significant benefits:\n       Investigation. The proposed U.S. implementing legislation \n     contains the clearest, most comprehensive and internationally \n     recognized definition of a chemical weapon available. The \n     definition contained in the implementing legislation will \n     enable an investigator to request a search warrant on the \n     basis of reasonable suspicion of illegal chemical weapons \n     activity (such as production of chemical weapons agent), \n     rather than suspicion of an attempt or conspiracy to use a \n     weapon of mass destruction, as under current U.S. law. By \n     providing law enforcement officials and prosecutors an \n     actionable legal basis for investigating the development, \n     production, transfer of acquisition of chemical weapons, CWC \n     implementing legislation improves prospects for detection, \n     early prosecution and possibly even prevention of chemical \n     terrorism in the United States.\n       Prosecution. The proposed U.S. implementing legislation \n     will also aid prosecution. Because possession of a chemical \n     weapon (whether or not it is intended to be used) would be \n     prohibited under the Convention, it would also be illegal \n     under the CWC implementing legislation and thus would provide \n     a sufficient basis for prosecution. Currently, prosecutors \n     must rely on legislation intended for other purposes, such as \n     a law against conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.\n       Penalties. Under the proposed U.S. implementing \n     legislation, any person who knowingly engages in prohibited \n     CW-related activities far short of actual use of a chemical \n     weapon could be subject to the maximum punishment of life in \n     prison or any term of years. In contrast, under existing U.S. \n     legislation, equivalent penalties require proof of use or an \n     attempt or conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. \n     Thus, it would be difficult under current law for prosecutors \n     to prove that a violation of the law has occurred unless a \n     scheme to use chemical weapons is well advanced.\n       Trade Controls. The proposed U.S. implementing legislation \n     would also supplement existing export/import control laws and \n     regulations by strictly controlling the import and export of \n     those chemicals posing the greatest risk (listed in Schedule \n     1 of the CWC) and also regulating the production, \n     acquisition, retention, transfer or use of such chemicals \n     within the U.S. Fines of up to $50,000 could be imposed for \n     unlawful production, acquisition, transfer, etc. of such \n     chemicals.\n       Emergency Authority. The proposed U.S. implementing \n     legislation contains authority to seize, forfeit and destroy \n     chemical weapons. This important provision protects the \n     constitutional rights of property owners while allowing law \n     enforcement officials to seize and destroy a chemical weapon \n     under exigent circumstances (i.e. where harm is imminent or \n     likely). This provides additional authority to prevent a \n     potential catastrophe and save lives.\n       Public Awareness. Tips by concerned private citizens are \n     the lifeblood of successful police investigations. \n     Ratification of the CWC and enactment of its implementing \n     legislation will ensure, due to reporting and inspection \n     requirements and penalties for violations, that private \n     companies and concerned citizens are more alert to and more \n     likely to report any suspected chemical weapons-related \n     activities.\n       The nonproliferation provisions of the CWC will deny \n     terrorists easy access to chemical weapons by requiring \n     Parties to eliminate national stockpiles and by controlling \n     international transfers of certain chemicals than can be used \n     to make chemical weapons. In particular, the CWC requires \n     Parties to cease transfers of certain CW agents and CW \n     precursor chemicals to non-Parties and restrict such \n     transfers to Parties. In addition, reporting is required on \n     anticipated production levels of Schedule 1, 2 and 3 \n     chemicals and anticipated imports and exports of Schedule 1 \n     and 2 chemicals. These measures will help restrict access to \n     key chemicals, while also helping to alert law enforcement \n     and other government officials to suspicious activities.\n       Finally, one of the key tools in combating terrorism is \n     early intelligence. The CWC will provide access to \n     international declaration and inspection information and will \n     strengthen the intelligence links between the United States \n     and the international community that will help us detect and \n     prevent chemical attacks. By tying the United States into a \n     global verification network and strengthening our \n     intelligence sharing with the international community this \n     treaty can be an early warning that is essential for \n     combating terrorism.\n       In this context, the following paragraph from DIA PC-1563-\n     4-96 of February 1996 is hereby declassified:\n       ``Irrespective of whether the CWC enters into force, \n     terrorists will likely look upon CW as a means to gain \n     greater publicity and instill widespread fear. The March 1995 \n     Tokyo subway attack by the Aum Shinrikyo would not have been \n     prevented by the CWC.''\n       I would also invite your attention to the following \n     conclusions concerning the impact of the CWC contained in the \n     May 1996 report issued by the Director of Central \n     Intelligence Interagency Committee on Terrorism entitled \n     ``Aum Shinrikyo: Insights to the Chemical and Biological \n     Terrorist Threat'':\n       ``The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is designed to \n     regulate and monitor the procurement, production, and use of \n     some chemicals used in CW production with varying degrees of \n     intrusiveness, depending on which of the three Schedules of \n     Chemicals a compound is listed. Within five years of the \n     CWC's entry into force, transfer of all Schedule 1 and 2 \n     chemicals to non-States Party will be banned, and transfer of \n     Schedule 3 chemicals to non-States Party will require end-use \n     certificates. In addition, all sites within a State Party are \n     subject to challenge inspections initiated by another State \n     Party with substantive information that illegal activities \n     are taking place by the government or any other group. The \n     Convention's provisions probably would make it more difficult \n     and costly for terrorists to acquire CW by increasing the \n     risk of detection, but a determined group could circumvent \n     the provisions.\n       ``The CWC mandates that each State Party establish national \n     laws to prohibit anyone on its territory or any citizen \n     abroad from developing, producing, stockpiling, acquiring or \n     using CW. Each State Party must develop and pass national \n     legislation to ensure the implementation of all CWC \n     obligations and provisions. Depending on the quality of the \n     legislation and its enforcement, the institution of \n     these laws would help establish a political and legal \n     basis for the prosecution of a terrorist group.\n       ``In the case of Aum Shinrikyo, the CWC would not have \n     hindered the cult from procuring the needed chemical \n     compounds used in its production of sarin. Further, the Aum \n     would have escaped the CWC requirement for an end-use \n     certification because it purchased the chemical within \n     Japan.''\n\n\n                            5. Rogue States\n\n       The Administration recognizes the possibility that not all \n     States Parties may comply with their CWC obligations \n     immediately upon the Convention's entry into force. However, \n     information acquired through the CWC's declaration and \n     inspection provisions will supplement our national \n     intelligence resources and place us in a better position than \n     we are now to deter and detect clandestine chemical weapons \n     programs. Moreover, unlike any previous arms control \n     agreement, the CWC provides a range of punitive measures \n     including trade sanctions that can be imposed against a Party \n     to the treaty who fails to meet its treaty obligations.\n       In short, as former DCI Woolsey and other intelligence \n     officials have pointed out, the CWC will provide a useful \n     tool in our inventory of means to stem the worldwide \n     expansion of chemical weapons capabilities and to assist in \n     monitoring CW programs worldwide, whether inside or outside \n     the CWC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 1997.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Following our phone conversation, I \n     arranged a meeting later today with your Acting National \n     Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, to discuss the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention. Before that meeting however, I wanted to \n     inform you personally of how your Administration's actions on \n     critical arms control issues have complicated efforts to work \n     cooperatively.\n       As you know, many Members of the 104th Congress have \n     expressed concern over the security implications of certain \n     arms control positions taken by your Administration. The \n     security concerns are aggravated by your Administration's \n     unwillingness to seriously consider our views on the \n     appropriate Constitutional role of the Senate in providing \n     advice and consent on treaties. I would point to three \n     important issues: demarcation limits to the Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile Treaty of 1972 (ABM Treaty); multilateralization of \n     the ABM Treaty; and flank limits to the Conventional Armed \n     Forces in Europe Treaty of 1990 (CFE Treaty). In each of \n     these cases, your Administration has negotiated substantive \n     modifications of the treaties, and then taken questionable \n     legal positions that render Senate advice and consent an \n     option that can be ignored rather than a constitutional \n     obligation that must be fulfilled.\n       Congress has legislated on the proposed demarcation limits \n     and the proposed multilaterization of the ABM Treaty. Section \n     232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     1995 (P.L. 103-337) addresses both issues. It states ``the \n     United States shall not be bound by any international \n     agreement entered into by the President of the United States \n     that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the \n     agreement is entered into pursaunt to the treaty making power \n     of the President under the Constitution.''\n       Section 235 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1996 (P.L. 104-106) addresses demarcation and \n     states ``any international agreement that would limit the \n     research, testing, or deployment of missile defense systems, \n     system upgrades, or system components that are designed to \n     counter modern theater ballistic missiles in a manner that \n     would be more restrictive than the compliance criteria \n     specified in paragraph 1 should be entered into only pursuant \n     to the treaty making powers of the President under the \n     constitution.''\n       The position of Congress concerning the substantive \n     modifications your Administration has sought to the ABM \n     Treaty is clear:\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\n     Senate advice and consent is needed for their entry into \n     force. Despite this clear position, your Administration \n     continues to argue that Senate advice and consent is not \n     necessary in the case of multilateralization, and is but one \n     among several options you might choose in the case of \n     demarcation. This is unacceptable.\n       With specific reference to the Agreed Statement on \n     Demarcation reached last summer, section 406 of the \n     Department of State and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1997 (P.L. 104-208) prohibits expending funds on the Standing \n     Consultative Commission ``unless the President provides to \n     the Congress a report containing a detailed analysis of \n     whether * * * the Agreed Statement regarding Demarcation \n     agreed to by the Standing Consultative Commission on June 24, \n     1996 * * * will require the advice and consent of the Senate \n     of the United States.'' The report submitted on your behalf \n     did not answer this question.\n       Finally, the May 31, 1996 Conventional Forces in Europe \n     flank agreement contains negotiated amendments and \n     significant changes to the 1990 CFE Treaty. Yet, again your \n     Administration has taken the legal position that Senate \n     advice and consent is not necessary.\n       Mr. President, I have pledged to work with you in a \n     bipartisan fashion on a wide range of challenges facing our \n     country. Nowhere is such cooperation more important than in \n     foreign policy and national security. But bipartisanship must \n     be a two-way street. Your Administration has now re-started a \n     public campaign to gain Senate advice and consent for the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. As you seek bipartisan \n     cooperation, you must understand our expectation for such \n     cooperation on ABM multilateralization, ABM demarcation, and \n     CFE flank limits.\n       Senate advice and consent arms control treaties after their \n     negotiation and after their substantive modification is not \n     an option--it is a requirement of our Constitution. I am sure \n     you understand that it will be very difficult to explore the \n     possibility of Senate action on the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention without first addressing legitimate security and \n     Constitutional concerns on other important arms control \n     issues. I stand ready to work with you and your national \n     security team in a comprehensive manner to address arms \n     control issues in the 105th Congress. With best wishes, I am,\n           Sincerely,\n     Trent Lott.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1997.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you know, we have been working in \n     good faith to try to establish a process under which the \n     Senate might consider a resolution of ratification for the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\n       As we consider the next steps in this process, I want to \n     remind you of two problems that remain unresolved. First, on \n     January 8, 1997, I wrote to you expressing concerns about \n     your administration's approach to a number of critical arms \n     control issues, including demarcation limits and \n     multilateralization of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of \n     1972 (ABM Treaty) and about the flank limits to the \n     Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty of 1990 (CFE \n     Treaty). To date, I have not received a response. Each of \n     these significant treaty modifications are subject to the \n     constitution's shared treaty making power and, accordingly, \n     cannot enter into force until receiving the advice and \n     consent of the United States Senate.\n       Second, I have repeatedly pointed out that the CWC is \n     currently under consideration by the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations. Accordingly, it is essential that you and your \n     administration honor the publicly-stated commitments to work \n     closely and expeditiously with Chairman Helms on issues \n     before the Committee, including the presentation of a plan to \n     reorganize U.S. foreign affairs agencies. Until that occurs, \n     Chairman Helms has made it clear to me that he is unlikely to \n     consider next steps in the CWC process.\n       As I have said privately and publicly, bipartisanship must \n     be a two-way street. I look forward to hearing from you soon \n     on these important issues. With best wishes, I am,\n           Sincerely,\n     Trent Lott.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The President has asked me to reply to \n     your letter concerning the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) \n     and the role of the Senate under the Constitution in giving \n     its advice and consent to treaties. Our staffs have held some \n     discussions on this matter, but I want to address in more \n     detail each of the three treaty issues you raise in the \n     letter: the CFE flank agreement, ABM multilateralization and \n     ABM/TMD demarcation.\n\n\n                          CFE Flank Agreement\n\n       On May 31, 1996, the United States, our NATO allies, Russia \n     and the 13 other States Party to the CFE Treaty approved a \n     document in Vienna culminating more than two years of \n     intensive negotiations on the CFE flank issue. The \n     centerpiece of this agreement was a realignment of the CFE \n     map (depicting the territory of the former USSR in the CFE \n     area), which has the effect of reducing the size of the flank \n     zone. The CFE parties had deliberately not included this map \n     as part of the Treaty when it was signed in 1990, and the \n     Bush Administration did not submit the map to the Senate in \n     1991 as part of the formal documents for advice and consent. \n     Accordingly, legal counsels in the Clinton Administration's \n     national security agencies determined last year that a change \n     to the map does not constitute a formal amendment to the \n     Treaty.\n       At the same time, we determined that a realignment of the \n     map did constitute a change in a ``shared understanding'' \n     formed with the Senate at the time the Senate gave its advice \n     and consent to the Treaty. That ``shared understanding'' \n     established that the Treaty would be applied and interpreted \n     on the basis of the original map. According to the 1988 \n     ``Biden Condition'' on treaty interpretation (which was \n     attached by the Senate to its resolution of ratification for \n     the INF Treaty), Senate consent or congressional approval is \n     required to change a shared understanding.\n       When the Administration submitted the CFE flank document \n     for legislative approval last August, we were faced with a \n     time-urgent situation: by its own terms, the document \n     required all States parties to confirm their approval by \n     December 15; yet very little time remained before the \n     adjournment sine die of the 104th Congress. In this \n     circumstance we chose to seek statutory approval by both \n     houses, as is explicitly permitted under the Biden Condition.\n       We now face a complex situation. At the Lisbon OSCE Summit \n     in December, the 30 States party to the CFE Treaty agreed to \n     extend the deadline for confirmation of approval to May 15, \n     1997. In recent months, it has become evident that the flank \n     agreement underpins the new negotiations in Vienna on ``CFE \n     adaptation,'' which in turn underpins NATO's efforts to \n     define the new security environment in Europe as NATO \n     enlarges. In addition, both adaptation of the CFE Treaty and \n     the admission of new states to NATO will be effected through \n     agreements that will be submitted for the advice and consent \n     of the Senate. The situation and timing is therefore \n     different from when the Administration submitted the CFE \n     flank agreement for legislative approval last August. \n     Accordingly, the Administration is prepared, without \n     prejudice to its legal position vis-a-vis the approval \n     options we believe are available to us, to seek Senate advice \n     and consent to the flank Document provided the Senate will \n     act on this crucial matter before May 15.\n\n\n                         MOU on ABM Succession\n\n       As noted in the President's November 25, 1996 report to \n     Congress submitted in accordance with Section 406 of the FY \n     1997 State Appropriations Act (the ``Livingston Report''--\n     hereafter referred to as ``the Report''), executive \n     agreements recognizing the succession of new States to the \n     treaty rights and obligations of their predecessors have \n     traditionally not been treated as treaty amendments or new \n     treaties requiring Senate advice and consent. Rather, they \n     have been treated as the implementation of existing treaties, \n     which is recognized as an exclusively Presidential function \n     under the Constitution. The Report elaborates the specific \n     reasons why this conclusion applies in the case of the June \n     24, 1996 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on ABM Succession \n     reached ad ref between the United States, Russia, Ukraine, \n     Belarus and Kasakstan in the Standing Consultative Commission \n     (SCC). It also explains why the MOU does not constitute a \n     substantive modification of the ABM Treaty.\n       In dealing with matters of succession, a key U.S. objective \n     has been to reconstitute the original treaty arrangement as \n     closely as possible. This was true with respect to the \n     elaboration of the ad ref MOU as well and, accordingly, the \n     MOU works to preserve the original object and purpose of the \n     ABM Treaty. We hope that the breakthrough on ABM/TMD \n     demarcation achieved at the Helsinki Summit will set the \n     stage for a meeting at which all parties would sign this MOU. \n     The Administration continues to believe that the agreement \n     does not require the advice and consent of the Senate, or any \n     other form of congressional approval, to enter it into force.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: During Senate ratification proceedings on \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), concerns have been \n     raised over Article X, which provides for certain types of \n     defensive assistance in the event that a State that has \n     joined the treaty and renounced any chemical weapons (CW) \n     capability is threatened with or suffers a chemical weapons \n     attack, and Article XI, which encourages free trade in non-\n     prohibited chemicals among states that adhere to the CWC. \n     Some have suggested that these Articles could result in the \n     CWC promoting, rather than stemming, CW proliferation despite \n     States Parties' general obligation under Article I ``never \n     under any circumstances . . . to assist, encourage or induce, \n     in any way, anyone to engage in any\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\n     activity prohibited to a State Party under this Convention.''\n       To respond to these concerns, the Administration has worked \n     closely with the Senate to develop conditions relating to \n     both Articles that have now been incorporated in the \n     resolution of ratification (Agreed Conditions #7 and 15). \n     These two conditions would substantially reinforce and \n     strengthen the treaty by: prohibiting the United States under \n     Article X from (a) providing the CWC organization with funds \n     that could be used for chemical weapons defense assistance to \n     other States Parties; and (b) giving certain states that \n     might join the treaty any assistance other than medical \n     antidotes and treatment; and requiring the President to (a) \n     certify that the CWC will not weaken the export controls \n     established by the Australia Group and that each member of \n     the Group intends to maintain such controls; (b) block any \n     attempt within the Group to adopt a contrary position; and \n     (c) report annually as to whether Australia Group controls \n     remain effective.\n       With respect to the latter condition, I am pleased to \n     inform you that we have now received official confirmations \n     from the highest diplomatic levels in each of the 30 \n     Australia Group nations that they agree that the Group's \n     export control and nonproliferation measures are compatible \n     with the CWC and that they are committed to maintain such \n     controls in the future.\n       While supporting these guarantees and safeguards, you \n     expressed the concern on Sunday that nations might still try \n     to use Article X or XI to take proscribed actions that could \n     undercut U.S. national security interests, notwithstanding \n     the best efforts of U.S. diplomacy to prevent such actions. I \n     am, therefore, prepared to provide the following specific \n     assurance related to these two Articles:\n       In the event that a State Party or States Parties to the \n     Convention act contrary to the obligations under Article I \n     by:\n       (A) using Article X to justify providing defensive CW \n     equipment, material or information to another State Party \n     that could result in U.S. chemical protective equipment being \n     compromised so that U.S. warfighting capabilities in a CW \n     environment are significantly degraded;\n       (B) using Article XI to justify chemical transfers that \n     would make it impossible for me to make the annual \n     certification that the Australia Group remains a viable and \n     effective mechanism for controlling CW proliferation; or\n       (C) carrying out transfers or exchanges under either \n     Article X or XI which jeopardize U.S. national security by \n     promoting CW proliferation:\n       I would, consistent with Article XVI of the CWC, regard \n     such actions as extraordinary events that have jeopardized \n     the supreme interests of the United States and therefore, in \n     consultation with the Congress, be prepared to withdraw from \n     the treaty.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. On September 12, the day the Senate was scheduled to begin \ndebate on the convention, Secretary of State Christopher called me and \nasked that the vote be canceled. I quizzed him. I wanted to make sure \nthat was what the administration was asking and that I would be able to \ncome out to the floor of the Senate and explain that is why it was \nbeing done. It was canceled because it was clear, in my opinion, the \nconvention was likely to be rejected at that time by the Senate.\n  I acceded to the Secretary's request. We canceled the vote, and it \nwent back to the Foreign Relations Committee calendar at the end of the \n104th Congress.\n  In January of this year, the President and his national security \nadvisers made it clear that the Chemical Weapons Convention remained a \ntop priority. On January 8, 1997, I wrote to the President explaining \nsome of our arms control priorities, including the submission of three \nsignificant treaty modifications for advice and consent: The ABM \nDemarcation Agreement, the ABM Multilateralization Agreement and the \nflank agreement to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. The \nadministration had previously refused to submit these treaties for \nSenate ratification.\n  I wrote at that time.\n\n       Bipartisanship is a two-way street. Your administration has \n     now restarted a public campaign to gain Senate advice and \n     consent for the Chemical Weapons Convention. As you seek \n     bipartisan cooperation, you must understand our expectation \n     for such cooperation on ABM multilateralization, ABM \n     demarcation and CFE flank limits.\n\n  On March 18, I again wrote the President reminding him that I had not \nreceived a response to that January 8 letter. I also pointed out that \n``it is essential that you and your administration honor the publicly \nstated commitments to work closely and expeditiously with Chairman \nHelms on issues before the committee, including the presentation of a \nplan to reorganize the U.S. foreign affairs agencies.\n  From the beginning of the 105th Congress, I made clear as best I \ncould to all who would listen in the administration that bipartisanship \ncould not mean forcing the Senate into acting on administration-chosen \npriorities if we did not likewise have an opportunity to consider \nissues that are important to the Senate, in fact, issues we think have \nlong since been sent to us for action with regard to arms control \ntreaties.\n  We stated that we thought it was vital that we get State Department \nreorganization and real reform at the United Nations. This was not a \nquid pro quo but a simple statement of reality. Working in a \ncooperative fashion, as we must, means that both sides have to be \nforthcoming on issues in these foreign policy very important, critical \nareas.\n  Let me briefly review the status of each of these three related \nissues. On the arms control treaties, the administration did reconsider \ntheir positions very carefully and they came back and agreed to send \nthe Conventional Forces in Europe Flank Agreement to the Senate for \nadvice and consent. Hearings have already been scheduled on this \ntreaty, and I expect a resolution of ratification to be before the full \nSenate in the near future. President Clinton agreed to submit the \nagreed statement on demarcation to the Senate for advice and consent. \nThis treaty, agreed to in principle between Presidents Clinton and \nYeltsin at the Helsinki summit, will provide the Senate an opportunity \nto consider the administration's approach toward negotiating \nconstraints on our defensive systems pursuant to the administration's \ninterpretation of the ABM Treaty. I am sure we will have quite an \ninteresting and lively debate on that, but certainly we should take \nadvantage of our responsibilities to do just that. Along with many of \nmy colleagues, I have expressed grave doubts about the wisdom of this \nadministration's approach in that area. Now, however, we have a full \nopportunity to debate the policy and this treaty in the ratification \nprocess.\n  The President still does not agree that they should send forward the \ntreaty dealing with multilateralization. We think the Constitution \nrequires it; his lawyers disagree. We will continue to press the \nadministration to accept our position in this area, and they understand \nwe should keep talking about it.\n  If this provision is contained in the final agreement that is \nsubmitted to the Senate for advice and consent in connection with \ndemarcation, it will give us an opportunity to debate it.\n  On U.N. reform, our now Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked \nthat we begin to actually meet and talk about U.N. reform; that we meet \nwith a U.N. presiding officer; that he come and visit with us. He did. \nWe have started a process between the House and Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats, our chairmen and ranking members, to take a look at what \nshould be done with regard to the arrearages we may or may not owe, how \ncan we deal with the U.S. assessment at the United Nations that could \nbe fairer, and we are working from a comprehensive Republican document \nas a basis for the discussions. I think we see some action already \noccurring. The Secretary General has been working at it, and I think he \nunderstands we are very serious about U.N. reform.\n  On State Department reorganization, I am very pleased that the \nadministration has proposed, I think, some major changes. Chairman \nHelms, and many others, have worked to streamline our foreign policy \nbureaucracy, and now it looks like we are going to have a chance to do \nthat.\n  The Agency for International Development, the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency were started and \norganized during the cold war. Barely more than a year ago, President \nClinton vetoed a bill which would have mandated the dismantling of only \none foreign affairs agency. Last week, however, thanks to the efforts \nof Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the involvement of the \nPresident, the President agreed to abolish both the USIA and ACDA and \nto fold many of AID's functions into the State Department. This will \nmake our scarce resources go farther, increase coordination and help \nensure American interests, not bureaucratic interests, are behind our \nforeign policy decisionmaking.\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\n  On each of these parallel issues--and I call them parallel, that is \nthe way they have always been discussed--we have made progress. I think \nit is important that we realize that. Thanks to the persistence of the \nchairman and thanks to a Secretary of State that is working with us \nnow, we have made progress with U.N. reform, with State Department \nreorganization, and the fact we will be able to consider these \ntreaties. No serious observer can claim that we have not moved forward \nin these areas.\n  There have been important changes in the Chemical Weapons Convention \nover the past few months. Last September, I worked closely with \nSenators Helms, Kyl and others in opposition to the treaty. Had we not \ncanceled the vote, I would have voted against it, and I believe that it \nwould have failed.\n  In the aftermath of that debate, some in the White House blamed \npolitical motivations. The President said it was partisan politics \ninvolving America's security. But, fortunately, calmer heads have \nprevailed this year. The administration did come to the table and they \nhave negotiated with us. They recognize the legitimate concerns that \nwere ignored last year. So we have engaged in a process of member-and-\nstaff-level discussions that have had a major impact on this \nconvention.\n  There are 28 agreed items in this resolution of ratification that \nwere not there last September. Senator Kyl, Senator Helms, and Senator \nBiden have been working together on this. They reached agreements. Some \nof them Senator Biden said, ``Yes, we should do this,'' and the \nadministration didn't particularly agree. Others in the administration \nsaid, ``Yes, we should do it,'' and some of our colleagues did not \nagree with it. There has been a give and take, but real progress has \nbeen made.\n  Many of these items have addressed the concerns that have been cited \nby opponents as reasons to oppose the CWC last year. I have gone over \nsome of the letters, some of the memos I have received--and I have \nreceived a lot of them--and point by point has been addressed, maybe \nnot 100 percent, maybe not to their total satisfaction, but progress \nhas been made. I will not go down the whole list of 28, but I want to \nlist some of the more critical ones where real progress has been made.\n  First, on search and seizure, condition 28 requires search warrants \nfor all involuntary searches of American facilities. We were worried \nabout a constitutional problem here. Now it has been addressed.\n  Second, on our ability to use riot control agents, condition 26 \nensures that the U.S. policy since 1975 remains in effect. Our military \ncan use nonlethal agents, such as tear gas, to rescue downed pilots. \nCertainly, that should have been in there all along. I don't know why \nthere was resistance to it, but it has been addressed.\n  Third, on intelligence sharing, condition 5 places strict limits on \nall U.S. intelligence shared with the international organization \nestablished under the CWC.\n\n  Fourth, on maintaining robust chemical defenses, condition 11 \nmandates a series of steps including negotiations with our allies, \nplanning for chemical weapons in war game scenarios and high-level \nleadership of the U.S. Army's Chemical School.\n  Fifth, on information sharing, an area that has worried me the most \nand right up until this very moment, progress has been made in two \nways. First, with regard to these articles X and XI, condition 7 makes \ncrystal clear that nothing in the CWC undermines U.S. export control \nlaws, and that the informal Australia Group export controls will \ncontinue. Condition 15 helps to ensure that defensive assistance under \nthe convention will be strictly limited. So I invite my colleagues who \nmay still have some doubts to look at these conditions--conditions 7 \nand 15--dealing with information sharing and how we have restrictions \non the defensive assistance.\n  Sixth, on financing Russian implementation, which I think is a \nridiculous idea personally on its face, but condition 14 precludes the \nUnited States from making any commitment to finance Russia's chemical \nweapons destruction program in an effort to secure Russian ratification \nof CWC.\n  Seventh, conditions 1, 17, 6, and 20 preserve Senate prerogatives in \nthis and in future treaties. They preserve our right to pass \nreservations to treaties, to ratify future amendments to the CWC and to \nmake clear the executive branch cannot commit to appropriations in \nadvance of congressional action.\n  Eighth, on noncompliance, condition 13 requires a series of steps to \nbe taken by the United States in the event of noncompliance by a party \nto the convention. Condition 13 mandates unilateral actions and \nrequires the United States to seek a series of multilateral actions to \ndeal with CWC violations.\n  Ninth, conditions 3 and 22 address financial concerns about the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons set up under this \nconvention. One sets a binding limit on the U.S. assessment to ensure \nwe are not creating another international entitlement program, and the \nother requires an independent inspector general be created to increase \naccountability of the OPCW.\n  Finally, condition 10 requires an annual report of condition that, \nfor the first time in arms control, shifts the burden of proof to \nmaking the administration certify compliance. As previous experience \nhas demonstrated, the arms control bureaucracy has refused to find \nclear evidence of noncompliance. This condition will change and will \nensure our vigilance on monitoring issues.\n  Each of these conditions makes the resolution before us today a \nbetter document, there is no doubt about it, certainly better than the \ndocument we were considering last fall. Each of these changes addresses \nconcerns raised by treaty opponents last year and addresses my own \nconcerns. In addition, the Senate is considering this convention in a \nmanner agreed to by all 100 Senators. We first considered, and passed, \nas I said earlier, S. 495, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat \nReduction Act of 1997 sponsored by Senator Kyl. We are considering the \nresolution of ratification drafted by Senator Helms. Think about that. \nWe are considering that resolution that he drafted and that he had in \nthe committee. That is what we brought to the floor, and the process \nrequires that motions to strike be offered to take provisions out. Much \nprogress has been made, and many Senators have been cooperative.\n  But there should be no mistake, serious problems remain with this \nconvention. Unfortunately, key protections in the resolution of \nratification may be stricken out in our debate today, and we will have \nsome more votes in a few minutes.\n  Condition 33 on verification requires the President to certify the \nsame standard of verification developed under the Reagan-Bush \nadministrations--high confidence in detecting militarily significant \nviolations in a timely manner. Detecting the production and stockpiling \nof chemical weapons may be more difficult than detecting the existence, \nobviously, of nuclear-armed warheads.\n  But I will vote to retain the verification standard that has served \nour country well in previous arms control agreements. I understand why \nmy colleagues might not agree with that and they might vote in a way \nthat would lower this verification standard, but it is a serious \nproblem.\n  Condition 30, which we just voted on, I think should have been kept \nin the document.\n  Condition 29 conditions U.S. participation in the convention upon \ndemonstrated actions by the country with the largest chemical weapons \narsenal on Earth--Russia. Russia has not implemented the Bilateral \nDestruction Agreement signed in 1990. Russia has not submitted accurate \ndata on chemical weapons. That is a real concern, and we have reason to \nbelieve they are devoting resources now to develop new chemical agents \nwhich are outside the scope of CWC. I support retaining this condition \nbecause I believe it makes sense to expect Russia to live up to past \nagreements before entering into new ones.\n  I strongly support condition 31 which would require the President to \nexercise the power given in the verification annex to the convention to \nbar inspectors from terrorist states and from states which have \nviolated U.S. proliferation law, particularly, I hope and think that we \ncan defeat the motion to strike here. It is not a killer amendment and \nwe ought to retain the right to bar those inspectors.\n\n  Finally, there is the most serious question of articles X and XI, \nwhether\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nthese provisions on information sharing will increase the likelihood \nof, in fact, chemical weapons proliferation. Over the past few weeks, I \nmade it clear to the administration as best I could the legitimate \nconcerns about the impact of articles X and XI had to be addressed more \nthan what was in the condition. I support delaying our ratification \nuntil the CWC is renegotiated to deal with these articles. For obvious \nreasons, the administration does not want to do that, and probably the \nmajority of the Senate would not want to do that.\n  But this very morning, I received a letter from President Clinton \nwhich I think is significant. The President made specific assurances \nthat the United States would exercise its right to withdraw from the \nconvention if any one of three things occurred: If countries used \n``article X to justify providing defensive chemical weapons equipment, \nmaterial, or information to another state party that could result in \nU.S. chemical protective equipment being compromised. . .'';\n  If countries use article XI to justify chemical transfers which \nundermine the Australia Group.\n  If countries carried ``out transfers or exchanges under either \narticle X and XI which jeopardize U.S. national security by promoting \nchemical weapons proliferation;\n  These are specific and probably unprecedented. Yes, it is a letter. \nIt is not in the document, but it is signed by the President of the \nUnited States in very strong language that, frankly, I was pleased but \nsomewhat surprised that he agreed to say, I will withdraw after \nconsultation with the Senate. If any one of these things happen, he is \nthe President and his assurances in foreign policy must make a \ndifference. They address countries even justifying transfers where \nthere is concern. They address transfers which promote chemical weapons \nproliferation.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a very important document. I have made \nthat letter available to our colleagues. I have more copies.\n  Every Member has struggled with one fundamental question: Are we \nbetter off with or without this convention? In my mind, there is no \neasy answer. I want to know that my children and our country will be \nbetter off, and that we will be better able to deal with chemical \nweapons with it, but I have my doubts.\n  Experts, whose opinions I respect deeply, are divided on the \nquestion. Over the last 2 weeks, I have had many conversations to \ndiscuss this convention. I spoke with Presidents Bush and Ford. I \ntalked with my good friend, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, \nformer Secretary of Defense Cap Weinberger, Steve Forbes, former \nSecretary of State James Baker, Jim Schlesinger, Colin Powell, \nuniformed military officers--a great variety of people. I met with \nleaders of groups that are deeply opposed and well informed about the \ntreaty's flaws. I talked with President Clinton, Secretary Albright, \nand Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Shalikashvili.\n  Republican Senators, with long experience in national security \nmatters, are divided. On this issue, reasonable people can and do \ndisagree, and reasonable people will vote on opposite sides.\n  After our negotiations, hearings, and discussions, it is time to make \ndecisions--decisions that will be important to the future of our men \nand women in uniform, and the future security of our country.\n  I have decided to vote in support of the Senate giving its advice and \nconsent to the Chemical Weapons Convention. I will do so not because I \nbelieve it will end the threat posed by chemical weapons or rid the \nworld of poison gas. I will do so not because I believe this treaty is \nverifiable enough or even enforceable enough. And I will not do so \nbecause I believe there are no additional proliferations concerns \nrelated to articles X and XI.\n  I will vote for the convention because I believe there will be real \nand lasting consequences to the United States if we do not ratify the \nconvention. In a very real sense, the credibility of commitments made \nby two Presidents of our country--one Republican and one Democrat--is \nat stake.\n  I will vote for the convention because the judgment of the most \nsenior former and current military commanders believe it will make our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines more safe in potential \nbattlefields and less likely to face the horrible prospect of chemical \nweapons.\n  I will vote for the convention because I believe the United States is \nmarginally better off with it than without it. It will provide new \ntools to press signatories for compliance. It will enable us to gain \naccess to sites and information we are currently unable to examine.\n  Through the important and enlightening debate we have had over the \npast few months, I am convinced the convention will bring new focus and \nenergy to this administration's nonproliferation efforts. We have \ncertainly heightened the awareness and knowledge of the concerns we \nhave. One year ago, few of us even knew about the Australia Group. Now \nwe have committed ourselves and the administration to keeping the \nAustralia Group as a viable tool to limit access to chemicals and \ntechnology.\n  Yes, the CWC may give legal cover to proliferators in Teheran or in \nBeijing. But they have undertaken such efforts in the past and no doubt \nwill do it again in the future.\n  I believe our allies in Europe are more likely to join with us in \nisolating Iran if we are a party to this convention than if we reject \nit tonight. They have made it clear that they hope we will ratify it, \nwhether it is Canada or whether it is Britain or our European allies or \nJapan.\n  I believe this convention will increase the cost of covert chemical \nweapons programs, and it will increase our chances of detecting such \nprograms.\n  I think there is a long list of good reasons why we should do this \ntoday. I have struggled with it. I would like to take just a minute, if \nI can, to talk on a personal note.\n  Many people in the media have tended to say, well, you know, this is \ngoing to determine the fate of various and sundry Senators and tell a \nlot about leadership. It has been exaggerated.\n  I have talked to a lot of Senators one on one. Not one of them--not \none of them--has said that they would vote on it on any basis other \nthan what is best for our country.\n  The way the Senate works, we debate these issues--we read, we study, \nwe argue, we go back and forth. We set up a fair process, and then we \ncome to a conclusion. We make a decision. We vote on it. And I do not \nthink it is fair to exaggerate any one Senator's role in this whole \neffort.\n  I think the Senate should be complimented today for the way it has \nhandled this. I think that Madison, and others, placed their faith in \nthis institution. And I think it has worked well.\n  The efforts of Senator Helms and Senator Kyl have been heroic. They \nhave done a magnificent job. Others that have supported the convention \nhave done their part, too.\n  I think that this process has helped the Senate as an institution to \nexercise the leadership assigned to it by the Constitution. And that, I \nsubmit, is the only real test of leadership that truly matters.\n  I urge the adoption and ratification of this treaty.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. We have a small difficulty which can be remedied in short \norder. Without going into a great deal of detail, we are trying to \nadjust the time back to have accommodated the majority leader and his \nremarks.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that--how much time did we agree to?\n  Mr. BIDEN. That the remaining time that the chairman have be 35 \nminutes, the remaining time under the control for the Senator from \nDelaware be 15 minutes, and I believe Senator Leahy has 14 minutes \nanyway, and that be the remaining time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. How many minutes?\n  Mr. BURNS. Ten or less.\n  Mr. HELMS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Or less.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Helms, the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  History has to be recorded that this has probably been the most ever-\nchanging and cloudy situation that we have faced here in the U.S. \nSenate. Some in this body have changed their minds as they have tried \nto read the public opinion polls, and even some of those who have \nserved in the administration have done the same--the history, as it was \narticulated here by the majority leader, of getting caught up in \nPresidential politics in 1996.\n  But basically what it was, it was most of us sitting down and reading \nthe words and trying to make a decision based on what we think is best \nfor our country. No matter the winds that blow in politics or in public \nopinion, this issue must be considered and decided on its merits. There \nis just too much at stake. The President has written a letter to the \nmajority leader. If you will read the words real carefully, you could \neven say you could argue both sides of the issue on that letter alone.\n  But I rise today to express my opposition to this Chemical Weapons \nConvention treaty.\n  There are several reasons why I have chosen to oppose the treaty. \nSome would say that it is verifiable. I am not fully convinced of that, \nyet. Some would say that it does not hinder or break the Constitution. \nI think I would question that. When it comes to sovereignty of the \nUnited States, I would say that very much was in jeopardy. However, I \nwill focus my concerns with article XI and my fears that this article \nwill compromise both the United States and the citizens that live here.\n  Article XI of the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty prohibits \ncountries from denying others access to dual-use chemicals--that means \nchemicals that can be used in any manner--processes, and technology. In \neffect, mandating access to and sharing of materials and the methods of \nmaking chemical weapons. By legitimizing commerce in dangerous, dual-\nuse chemicals and processes the CWC will increase, not reduce, the \nability of countries to acquire chemical weapons.\n  Second, Mr. President, article XI gives states the treaty right to:\n\n       Facilitate and have the right to participate in, the \n     fullest possible exchange of chemicals, equipment, and \n     scientific and technical information relating to the \n     development and the application of chemistry for [peaceful] \n     purposes . . .\n\n  Have we not had enough experience over nuclear problems of this \nworld, just with one country that is on this planet?\n  Third, transferring chemical-related technologies and material to \nmembers of the CWC such as Cuba, Iran, India, Pakistan, and China will \nhelp them establish and/or improve their chemical weapons programs. \nThis is because there is very little difference between the legitimate \ncommercial chemical processes and those processes used to make chemical \nweapons.\n  Article XI also legitimizes trade in dangerous dual-use chemicals. \nThe treaty right will be used by countries such as China, India, and \nRussia to override Western objections to their provision of sensitive \nchemicals and production technologies to countries such as Iran. China \nand India already supply Iran with such chemicals, but the CWC will \nlegitimize this trade and allow these countries to expand the volume of \ncommerce conducted in dual-use chemicals.\n  Mr. President, I take a moment to focus on the fact that by ratifying \nthis treaty, Iran will be permitted to have access to our chemical \nsecrets, to have the ability to obtain chemical information from other \nrogue nations. If ratified, we are allowing a nation that we have \nconfirmed, we have confirmed as a terrorist nation, one that is the \nprimary suspect in numerous terrorist attacks against the United \nStates, and one that calls for the destruction of this country to get \nmore information, not less, on deadly chemicals.\n  How many in this body think that if allowed this information, Iran \nwill, of its own accord, destroy these potentially deadly weapons and \nnot use them against United States citizens around the world? I think \nthat is a legitimate question. How many in this body really think that \nthe United States will be in a more secure position? Finally, how can \nwe in clear conscience give them this information when American men and \nwomen have been murdered by their actions?\n  Mr. President, for this reason, I cannot vote for the passage of this \ntreaty.\n  I have heard all the reasons why we would be just a tiny bit better \noff being part of the convention. Well, this Senator thinks you have to \nbe a bigger part. It falsely promises security to our Nation, and would \nbetray those U.S. citizens who have died by the hand of terrorists. I \nurge my fellow colleagues to contemplate what I have stated here. I \nurge a ``no'' vote on ratification of this treaty. This is not an easy \ndecision but is a decision where the majority of people who serve in \nthis body have read and have made their decision on what is actually in \nit and not the emotion of the times. I urge them to read it and vote \naccordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jeff Severs \nbe permitted privileges of the floor for the duration of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 48\n\n (Purpose: To strike condition no. 29, relating to Russian elimination \n                          of chemical weapons)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 48.\n       Beginning on page 61, strike line 21 and all that follows \n     through line 7 of page 63.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this amendment strikes condition 29. I will \nspeak to this in a moment, but I yield as much time of the half-hour \nthat I control as my friend from Indiana desires to discuss this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware. The condition that we move to \nstrike, condition 29, would prohibit the United States from ratifying \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention until the President certifies that \nRussia has done the following:\n\n       Ratified the CWC, complied with the 1990 bilateral \n     destruction agreement, fulfilled its obligations under the \n     1989 Wyoming memorandum of understanding, and ceased all \n     chemical weapons activities.\n\n  Mr. President, two arguments against this condition prevailed, at \nleast on the last vote that we had. I cite the first important argument \nis simply that this is a killer amendment. Senators need to know that a \nvote to leave this in the convention effectively terminates the \nconvention. Senators cannot have it both ways.\n  I simply indicate, in his very important statement, the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, referencing a particular condition that he found \nappealing, indicated it was not a killer amendment. But, in fact, this \none is a killer amendment. Therefore, there is a crucial reason to vote \nto strike it.\n  Second, Mr. President, once again we are talking about American \nleadership. It is in our interest, clearly, to get Russia's attention \nto the chemical weapons problem. We have decided unilaterally in this \ncountry that chemical weapons are not useful to us in our defense, \nlargely because we cannot necessarily guard our own troops against the \nfallout and against the problems they create. So we are destroying \nthem.\n  Russia always had greater stocks than we have. They still do. It has \nbeen in our interest to work with the Russians. In the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Act, so-called Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act, we have worked \nwith the\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\nRussians in a first instance to assist them in the techniques of \ndestroying chemical weapons in Russia. There are seven very large sites \nthat need to be dealt with. We are dealing now with the Russians at the \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, I speak today from a personal experience of last \nOctober when it was my privilege to accompany the then Secretary of \nDefense, William Perry, and my colleagues Senator Sam Nunn and Senator \nJoe Lieberman, in a visit to Russia, specifically to the Defense \nDepartment of Russia and to military persons involved in weapons of \nmass destruction. Perhaps equally importantly, Mr. President, it was my \nprivilege to go with my colleagues from America to the Russian Duma. On \nthat particular day, our first attempt was to attempt to gain some \nunderstanding by members of the Duma about the importance of the START \nII treaty and its ratification. While we were there, we visited with \nthe relevant committees comparable to our Foreign Relations and our \nArmed Services Committee about the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The Russians--in what we characterize as the Russian administration, \nthe executive branch, and the legislative branch, the Duma--made \nidentical points to us, that the START II treaty was coupled in \nconsideration with the expansion of NATO. They said this is a political \nissue. These two are joined together.\n\n  With regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention, they made the clear \ndistinction that it was not political, it was not involved with either \nNATO or START II or other arrangements. As a matter of fact, they \nperceived it was in the interests of Russia to ratify the treaty. They \nalso pointed out that Russia has very little money, that at this \nparticular point in history Russian taxes are not being paid with \nregularity. The soldiers are not being paid, or at least their \npaychecks are often delayed. As a result, they pointed out that arms \ncontrol expenses were a very great problem for them. I think we \nunderstand that. That is not a sufficient reason for Russia to dodge \nits responsibilities. But it was a reason offered as to why they had \npostponed consideration.\n  In addition, Mr. President, they have postponed consideration because \ndespite our leadership from the very beginning, our leadership to \ndestroy our own chemical weapons, then to try to sign up all the \nnations of the world to destroy theirs, and to make this an \ninternational law project, the Russians read our press and they \nunderstood that we had had difficulty last December in ratifying this \nconvention. So they simply were curious as to whether we were serious \nnow. Well, we are, Mr. President. I simply say that the question that \nis before the Senate should not be delay or perhaps failure to ratify \nthe treaty, because we are waiting on Russia. Our leadership is \nimperative. We are the country that is leading the world. We are the \ncountry that is leading Chemical Weapons Convention matters. Our \ncitizens of the United States take that seriously. Mr. President, a \nlarge majority of Americans want us to act. They believe the U.S. \nGovernment ought to do everything possible, and they recognize, as do \nmost Senators, that this convention is unlikely to get that job done \nvery swiftly but they do recognize it is an advance, it is a \nconstructive step. To offer as a reason why we would not proceed that \nwe are waiting for Russia, or hoping that two agreements that are \nspecified in the condition might somehow come to fulfillment is to miss \nthe entire point of the leadership that is involved and the persuasion \nwe must have.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important, as soon as we ratify this \nconvention, for the President of the United States to press on \nPresident Yeltsin his responsibility to gain ratification. At the \nHelsinki summit meeting recently, President Yeltsin assured our \nPresident he would offer that leadership. He assured our President he \nunderstood the responsibility of the Russians. He also asked our \nPresident to do his duty to help get the job done here. In fairness, \nour President has been fulfilling that responsibility, as did Senator \nDole yesterday, as have President Bush and President Ford, as they have \ncome forward as Presidents who understand, and as the majority leader \nunderstands. In his statement today, he mentioned one reason for voting \nfor this treaty is the fact that two Republican administrations have \nmade a commitment. An American word means something. Our leadership has \ncontinuity and staying power. It does not flip one way or another, \ndepending upon Iraq or Russia.\n  Mr. President, I simply say, once again, American leadership is at \nstake. We are looking at a killer amendment. This condition must be \nstruck. I ask Senators to vote aye when the roll is called.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before I plead on this amendment, I have \nbeen around this place for quite a while. Before I came to the Senate \nas a Senator, I had the honor of serving with two Senators as \nadministrative assistant. Time after time, at the conclusion of long \narduous debate and votes on various issues, a parting ``thank you'' is \nmade to the staff people who did most of the work. I talked to Senator \nBiden and told him I want to do it now before we begin to sign off. He \nsuggested that I go first.\n  Admiral Nance, sitting back there, with the white hair, that young \nman, he and I were boyhood friends back in Monroe. Adm. James W. Nance, \nthe chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee; Tom Klein; Mark \nTheissen; Steve Biegun; Marshall Billingslea--particularly Marshall \nBillingslea--Colleen Noonan; Beth Wilson, and the rest of the Foreign \nRelations Committee staff.\n  Senator Kyl has three remarkable young people: David Stephens, John \nRood, and Jeanine Esperne. Senator Craig has Yvonne Bartoli and Jim \nJatras.\n  I want to thank, in particular, some people from the outside who \nhelped enormously in our trying to build a case to protect the American \npeople from the extravagances of this treaty. But that is neither here \nnor there, but I want to thank those four great former Secretaries of \nDefense who came up--Dick Cheney; Cap Weinberger; Don Rumsfeld; James \nSchlesinger; the marvelous Jeane Kirkpatrick; Steve Forbes, who came \ndown from New York; Richard Perle; Frank Gaffney; Doug Feith, and Fred \nClay. I also want to include the retired flag and general officers.\n  I know that when I am driving home in a few hours from now, I will \nthink of others. Just speaking for all of us, I want to thank them all. \nI know Senator Biden wants to do the same thing on his side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I apologize because I \nmay have to augment this. Although it is a very good idea to do it now, \nI was preparing to do it later, so I may leave somebody out, and I may \namend this.\n  Let me begin by thanking a young man, who came over from my personal \nstaff to the Foreign Relations Committee and I think maybe Mr. \nBillingslea may have thought he was his cousin, they spent so much time \ntogether in the last couple of months, and that is Puneet Talwar. He \nhas done a great deal of the heavy lifting for me on this, along with \nEd Levine, from the Intelligence Committee, who is now working with me. \nEd Hall, the minority staff director; John Lis; the young man--well, he \nhas been with me so long that he is getting old--Brian McKeon, who is \ncounsel for the minority; Frank Januzzi; Dawn Ratliff; Kathi Taylor; \nUrsula McManus, who we kept up late at night writing memos and other \nthings on our behalf; Casey Adams; Bill Ashworth, a former long-time \nstaff member of the Foreign Relations Committee and Senator Pell's \nstaff; David Schanzer, who worked with me on the Judiciary Committee; \nMary Santos; Kimberly Burns; Jennette Murphy; Larry Stein; Randy \nDeValk; Sheila Murphy, all leadership staff persons who have worked \nwith me.\n  I have left out some, but I will augment this with the staff members \nof the Intelligence Committee, the Appropriations Committee, the \nJudiciary Committee, and the Armed Services Committee. They all played \nmajor rolls.\n  The hearings that the distinguished chairman had on this treaty this \ntime around were, I think, among the best hearings--even though I \ndidn't always agree with the witnesses--that I have participated in in \nmy 25 years. The cast of characters were the luminaries of previous \nadministrations, as well as\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\nthis administration. We had the who's who of the foreign policy \nestablishment, literally. These people were particularly helpful to me, \nwhich is going to sound strange. He was up in the gallery, but I am \nreferring to General and former Ambassador Rowny, a close friend and, I \nthink, neighbor of the chairman. I know he is much more philosophically \ncompatible with the chairman than with me, but we found ourselves on \nthe same side of this issue. Everybody wondered why Bob Dole changed \nhis mind--not changed his mind, but why Bob Dole concluded that the \nconditions that were added to the treaty sufficiently corrected its \ndefects. It is my understanding that General Rowny bumped into Bob Dole \nin a coffee shop at the Watergate Hotel. I can see the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona wishing he had been at that coffee shop. But there \nwas Gen. Brent Scowcroft, one of the most respected people in this \ntown, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt; John Deutch; Fred Webber and his staff at the \nChemical Manufacturers Association; Gen. Colin Powell; Amy Smithson of \nthe Stimson Center; John Isaacs; Brad Roberts, Institute for Defense \nAnalysis; Barry Kellman, DePaul Law School; Ron Lehman of the Reagan \nand Bush administrations. I am leaving a number of people out who I \nwill add later.\n\n  I thank them all for contributing to this debate. I want to make a \npersonal thanks, if I may, Mr. Chairman and Mr. President, to one of \nthe most competent staff people I have ever dealt with in the \nadministration, Bob Bell, who works for Sandy Berger and who also, I \nthink, did an incredibly good job here, and Lori Murray, also of that \nstaff. Bob Bell is a walking encyclopedia, who negotiated with the Lott \ncommittee. He is a man who has the ability to understand very complex \nnotions and put them into language everybody can understand. He has \ndone an admirable job. There are other people to thank.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would like to ask if he would include Kenneth Myers and \nKenny Myers, on my staff and the staff of the Intelligence Committee, \nwho have been invaluable.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The answer is I would absolutely like to do that. The \nstatement I was going to introduce has a paragraph about that.\n  I express my deep appreciation to Senator Lugar, with whom I have \ntalked every day for the past few months as we have tried to move the \nball forward in this treaty. He was very committed. He is truly the \nSenate's leading expert on the treaty and, I think, one of the leading \nexperts in this country on foreign policy. We would not have gotten \nthis far without his efforts. Perhaps the reason he is as good as he is \nthat he has a father and son team working for him, Kenneth and Kenny \nMyers. I envy Ken Myers, Senator Lugar's long-time staff aide, because \nhe gets to work with his son, Kenny Myers, every day. The only thing I \nfound, Mr. Chairman, in my meetings with them is that, like with my \nsons, I occasionally observe that the son knew more than the father. So \nmy compliments to both of them.\n  The bottom line of all this--and I assume this was one of the \nintentions of the Senator from North Carolina, the chairman--is that \nregardless of the final outcome of each of these remaining amendments \nand the treaty, this has been done fairly and honorably. Everyone has \nkept their word. We said we would negotiate in good faith; we both did. \nAll of the staff members involved acted in the same way.\n  Lastly--and I hope this doesn't come out the wrong way--I want to \nthank the chairman of the full committee for the honorable way in which \nhe has dealt with this entire matter. I mean that sincerely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator. I will add two things. One, I hope \nBob Dole stays out of those coffee shops from now on. I am going to see \nif the distinguished ranking member would mention probably the most \nprominent player in this game. He didn't, but I will, because I had the \nhonor of escorting her to North Carolina--the new Secretary of State, \nMadeleine Albright. I don't always agree with her, nor she with me. But \nshe is a great lady and she is doing a good job for this country. I \nthank her.\n  Mr. President, one of the many fine people who contributed to the \nChemical Weapons Convention is no longer among us. Mrs. Sherry Stetson \nMannix, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, joined the U.S. \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1984 and became its top expert \non chemical weapons. She helped negotiate the treaty, and then she \nbecame a resource person for Members and staff of the Senate as we \nbegan to consider whether to give our advice and consent to \nratification.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Mannix was dying of cancer in 1994, when the \nForeign Relations and Intelligence Committees first held hearings on \nthe CWC. Despite being in terrible pain, Lieutenant Colonel Mannix \nfaithfully and effectively managed the process of responding to our \ncommittees' questions for the Record.\n  Sherry Mannix was only 44 years old when she died in early 1995. She \nhad hoped to live long enough to see this convention ratified. We were \nunable, Mr. President, to grant that last wish. But Sherry Mannix kept \nfaith with us, with her comrades in the U.S. Armed Forces, and with her \ncountry. Now we have the opportunity to keep faith with her, and with \nall our military personnel who long for ratification of this convention \nas a step toward curbing the menace of chemical weapons.\n  Mr. HELMS. What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment offered by the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. HELMS. Which is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. 48.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Arizona [Mr. \nKyl] for whatever time he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will, at a later time, join in thanking the \nvarious staff and other people who have been so useful in ensuring a \ngood debate. I think the Senate has gotten very serious about this \nmatter. As the majority leader said earlier, as a result of the \napplication of various Members of the Senate, a great deal of progress \nhas been made in trying to bring the sides closer together in getting a \ntreaty that, if it is entered into, will be more in the interest of the \nUnited States than as originally submitted.\n  There are a couple of conditions, however, in the resolution of \nratification which we believe ought to be a part of this treaty before \nthe President submits those articles for ratification, signifying the \nU.S. entry into the treaty. One of the most important is the one before \nus at this moment. There is a motion to strike this condition from the \nresolution of ratification. We believe that this condition should \nremain. As the majority leader earlier said, he believes this condition \nshould remain. Here is what it provides: Prior to depositing the U.S. \ninstrument of ratification, the President must certify four things: \nFirst, that Russia is making reasonable progress on implementing the \n1990 bilateral destruction agreement entered into between the United \nStates and Russia. Second, that outstanding compliance related to the \n1989 Wyoming memorandum of understanding have been resolved to U.S. \nsatisfaction. Third, that Russia has deposited its articles of \nratification of the conventional weapons agreement. Fourth, that it is \ncommitted to foregoing any weapons development.\n  Those are four important conditions, if our partner, Russia, and the \nUnited States are to effectively utilize the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. The reason is, first of all, because Russia is the world's \nlargest possessor of chemical weapons. It has anywhere from 60 to 70 \npercent of the world's chemical stocks. For the Chemical Weapons \nConvention to be global, in the sense that it covers the weapons, and \nto be effective, it should involve the country with the largest \ninventory of chemical weapons.\n  Now, Russia has signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, but has \nindicated that it will not ratify, at least at this time and, as a \nmatter of fact, in a communication to the Vice President of the United \nStates, one of the Russian leaders, Chernomyrdin, said, in effect, that \nRussia would prefer that the two parties, if they are going to come \ninto the treaty, come in at the same time rather than one preceding the \nother, \n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\nand, therefore, said that it would be integral to Russian entry that \nthe United States entered first, which is what we are about to do.\n\n  I think these four commitments by Russia are integral to the success \nof the Chemical Weapons Convention if we are to have a truly global \nban. That is why this condition 29 should remain a part of the \nresolution of ratification.\n  Quickly, to the four points: First, reasonable progress in \nimplementing the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement. Reasonable \nprogress simply means that we are continuing to work on complying with \nit. That is what the Russians agreed to do when they entered into this \nagreement in June 1990. This is an agreement between President Bush and \nPresident Gorbachev.\n  By the way, when proponents of this treaty speak of it as a Reagan-\nBush-Clinton treaty, I point out the fact that the treaty was different \nin the Reagan and early Bush years than it is now. One of the \nunderpinnings of the treaty was that this bilateral destruction \nagreement between Russia and the United States would be in place and \nwould be enforced and would be complied with by the two parties. This \nagreement was designed specifically to ban the production of chemical \nweapons, their agents, the destruction of chemical weapons agents, to \nprovide for onsite inspections of CW facilities, and require data \ndeclarations.\n  The Bilateral Destruction Agreement is central to the CWC before us \ntoday. Without it the Chemical Weapons Convention is a much weaker \ntreaty than it would otherwise be. The CWC was negotiated with the \nassumption that the United States and Russia would both destroy and \nverify destruction of their stockpiles under the Bilateral Destruction \nAgreement. But Russia has not implemented the Bilateral Destruction \nAgreement, and it appears that it has no intention of doing so.\n  Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, in this letter to Vice President \nGore that I mentioned before, essentially stated that the Bilateral \nDestruction Agreement and the 1989 Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding \nhave outlived their usefulness insofar as Russia is concerned.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention before us today is no substitute for \nthe Bilateral Destruction Agreement. Under the Bilateral Destruction \nAgreement, the inspectors of Russian facilities would not be \ninternational inspectors. They would be U.S. professional inspectors, \nand there would be more frequent inspections. The United States would \nhave guaranteed access to data declarations, none of which would be the \ncase under the CWC.\n  So it is important that Russia at least indicate to us that it is \nmaking reasonable progress to implement the BDA before we enter into \nforce CWC.\n  Second, the resolution says there should be compliance with the 1989 \nWyoming Memorandum of Understanding. Without getting into a lot of \ndetail, I will simply note that this memorandum of understanding was \nessentially an agreement between the two states that we would exchange \ndata on how much chemical weapons we had and to provide the information \non the status for binary weapons programs.\n  To comply with this declaration, the United States has given \ninformation to the Russians. Russia declared a 40,000 metric ton agent \nstockpile. However, present reports and other information allege that \nthe Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that the former Soviet--now \nRussian--stockpile could be as large as 75,000 tons. Russia has refused \nto provide information on the status of its binary weapons program. \nAnd, according to the former Director of Central Intelligence Jim \nWoolsey, ``The data we have received from Russia makes no reference to \nbinary chemical weapons or agents. That is contrary to our \nunderstanding of the program that was initiated in the former Soviet \nUnion.''\n  There are additional indications of activity on the part of the \nRussians, all of which suggest that they are not in compliance with \nthis 1989 memorandum of understanding.\n  Our second point in this condition is getting compliance with that.\n  Third, we want the Russians to ratify this treaty at the same time \nthat we do. That is what they want to do. We believe that will be a \npreferable course of action to the United States entering into the \ntreaty causing the Russians to be concerned that we would set up the \nrules of the treaty, in effect, in a way that would be amicable to \ntheir interests, thus perhaps causing them never to enter into the \ntreaty.\n  A CWC without Russia, furthermore, means that over 50 percent of the \nworld's known chemical weapons stockpile will be outside of the treaty \nregime. Should the United States ratify the CWC absent Russian \nparticipation or the involvement of other states that have weapons, the \ntreaty's intrusive verification schemes would, for all intents and \npurposes, be focused solely on the United States, the only nation \nlikely to declare integral weapons inventory. In effect, we would be \npaying 25 percent of the cost of the treaty to verify our own \ncompliance.\n  Finally, Russian commitment to forego a chemical weapons capability. \nThis is central to the meaning of the CWC. If Russia is not willing to \ndo this, obviously their intentions are not to comply with CWC.\n\n  We have evidence of the so-called Novichok class of nerve agents that \nis more lethal than any other known chemical agent in the world.\n  According to Jane's Land-Based Air Defense 1997-98, Russia is \ndeveloping three new nerve agents, two of which are eight times as \ndeadly as the VX nerve agent stockpiled by Iraq.\n  Mr. President, Russia's new chemical agents do not depend on \nstockpiles that are on the CWC list of scheduled chemicals, according \nto sources. Thus, inspectors will neither be prepared nor allowed to \nlook for them, nor will Russia be precluded from importing these \ncomponents. A declassified portion of a May 1995 national intelligence \nestimate states ``Production of new binary agents would be difficult to \ndetect and confirm as a CWC-prohibited activity.''\n  In conclusion, in light of these ongoing activities and related \nUnited States intelligence estimates, it is reasonable to condition \nUnited States ratification of the CWC to the President certifying that \nRussia is committed to foregoing chemical weapons capability or other \nactivity contrary to the purpose of the convention weapons treaty.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I join the distinguished majority \nleader and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in urging \nthat we not strike this condition from the resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \nunder the control of the Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan. Next, I will let people know that I understand Senator Inhofe \nis going to speak in opposition to this motion to strike. Then I would \nlike to yield, just to let people know, 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  That is for informational purposes. I am not asking UC.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it isn't always that our top military \nofficials so strongly and jointly agree that an arms control treaty is \nin our national security interest. But in the case of the chemical \nweapons treaty before the Senate today, that strong support has been \nexpressed over and over and over again.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shalikashvili, speaking on \nbehalf of the Chiefs of each of the services and the combatant \ncommanders, urged the Senate to ratify this treaty because it would \nmake it less likely that our troops will face chemical weapons. Their \nposition is not based on politics or public opinion polls; it is based \non their military judgment.\n  The acting head of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, has said that \nthis treaty will give us additional tools to inspect for chemical \nweapons that we otherwise would not have.\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\n  The United States, under former President Bush, led the way to the \nnegotiation of this treaty. It would represent a tragic blow to \nAmerican leadership were the Senate to reject a treaty negotiated and \nsupported by three Presidents. If we don't lead the way, if and when \nthe day comes that we must act militarily to eliminate a country's \nchemical weapons, the credibility of and support for, that effort will \nbe undermined by our lack of clean hands and our refusal to ratify a \ntreaty that makes it less likely those weapons will be created to begin \nwith.\n  The CWC destroys stockpiles that could threaten our troops; it \nsignificantly improves our intelligence capabilities, and it creates \nnew international sanctions to punish those states that remain outside \nof the treaty. If we fail to ratify the convention, we will imperil our \nleadership in the entire area of nonproliferation, perhaps the most \nvital security issue of the post-cold-war era.\n  Relative to condition 29 that is before us, there is a motion to \nstrike this condition that has been made by the Senator from Indiana. \nIt is based on many grounds. But the first ground that he points out, \nwhich seems to me is the foremost ground even before we get to the \ndetails of this condition, is that this condition is a killer \ncondition. If this condition stays in this resolution, it kills this \nratification resolution because it makes it conditional on somebody \nelse ratifying.\n  Do we want to make our ratification conditional upon these other \nevents? Do we want to give Russia the power to decide our participation \nin the leadership of this crucial treaty? The President has said--I am \nhere quoting him--``This is precisely backwards. The best way to secure \nRussian ratification is to ratify the treaty ourselves. Failure to do \nso will not only give hard-liners in Russia an excuse to hold out but \nalso to hold onto their chemical weapons.''\n  Do we want Russia to ratify? Clearly we do. General Shalikashvili, \nwho has so strongly supported the ratification of this treaty, has \ntestified before us in the Armed Services Committee as follows: ``The \nmost significant advantage derived from the convention is the potential \nelimination of chemical weapons by state parties.'' He went on to say, \n``Eventual destruction of approximately 40,000 tons of declared Russian \nchemical weapons will significantly reduce the global chemical \nthreat.''\n  That is why General Shalikashvili has said, among other reasons, that \nthe ratification of this treaty will make it less likely that our \ntroops would ever face chemical weapons because the largest declared \nstockpile by Russia must be destroyed under this treaty. General \nShalikashvili, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, speaking for each of the \nchiefs and our combatant commanders, says that destruction of 40,000 \ntons of declared chemical weapons by Russia is the most significant \nadvantage to this treaty.\n  What does our ratification have to do with Russian ratification? I \nwould suggest here that we listen to a number of voices. But one of \nthem is a Russian voice--a Russian scientist who blew the whistle \nactually on the Soviet Union chemical weapons program. His name is Vil \nMyrzyanov. He is a high-level Russian scientist. This is what he said \nabout the relationship in a letter that he wrote to Senator Lugar. \n``Senate ratification of the convention is crucial to securing action \non the treaty in Moscow.''\n  Our ratification, he is telling us--this is an inside voice--is \ncritical to getting the Duma to ratify this treaty. And getting the \nDuma to ratify this treaty is, in the eyes of General Shalikashvili, \nthe single most important advantage of the treaty because then 40,000 \ndeclared tons of chemical agents, the largest stockpile in the world, \nwill be destroyed and less available for leakage, less available to any \npotential sale or disposition to others adversely or inadvertently.\n  So our leadership is important to a safer world. This is a treaty \nthat we helped to draft, negotiated, and now it is before us to ratify. \nBut our leadership is also important to ratification of this treaty \ninside of Russia.\n  The decision of whether the United States ratifies this convention is \nfor this body, the United States Senate to decide--not the Russian \nDuma. We should strike this killer condition.\n  The purpose of both the Bilateral Destruction Agreement and the \nWyoming MOU was to help make progress towards achieving a CWC.\n  Now that we have the CWC complete, the BDA and the Wyoming MOU are \nless relevant. We can enter the CWC without the BDA being implemented.\n  The BDA does not go as far as the CWC. BDA would permit both sides to \nkeep 5,000 tons of chemical agent. The BDA does not permit challenge \ninspections.\n  The CWC requires complete destruction of all chemical weapons, and \nprovides for challenge inspections to any facility suspected of a \nviolating suspected of violating the CWC.\n  If the CWC is ratified by the United States--which this killer \ncondition would prohibit--and by Russia--it is entirely possible that \nthe United States and Russia can finish negotiations on the BDA and let \nit enter into force.\n  If the United States does not ratify this convention, there is little \nchance Russia will ratify it and there is no chance for this BDA ever \nentering into force.\n  If we want Russia to ratify the CWC--and surely we must--then we \nshould ratify the CWC--which, in turn requires us to strike this \ncondition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to abbreviate my statement in the interest \nof time, hoping that we can help Senators get out a little bit earlier, \nincluding the distinguished occupant of the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this condition is very important. It forbids the \ndeposit of the United States instrument of ratification until Russia \nhas made significant progress in implementing the 1990 Bilateral \nDestruction Agreement and has resolved concerns over its incomplete \ndata declarations under the Wyoming memorandum of understanding, \nratified the convention and has committed to forgo the clandestine \nmaintenance of chemical weapons production capability.\n  That sounds like a lot but more than anything else it is a \nmeasurement of how Russia is playing games in terms of not doing things \nto live up to its agreement.\n  I have the highest hope that Russia one day will have a free \nenterprise economy and all the rest of it, but such commitments by \nRussia are absolutely imperative and essential to the success of this \nCWC, this treaty, in securing a truly global ban on possession and use \nof chemical weapons. If Russia continues to drag its feet, this \nconvention will be worth almost nothing. And for my part, as one \nSenator, I am extremely concerned that Russia, the country that \npossesses the largest and the most sophisticated chemical weapons \narsenal in the world, has refused consistently to agree to implement \nits commitments to eliminate its chemical weapons stockpile despite the \n1990 United States-Russian Bilateral Destruction Agreement.\n  Now, put any face on it you want, but if Russia fails to do that, \nthen Russia is telling this Senate, this Government, the American \npeople, we don't care what you want; we are going our way. And that is \na pretty dangerous position for Russia to take in terms of world peace.\n  This coupled with the Russian withdrawal from the BDA and the Russian \nParliament rejection of the chemical weapons destruction plan portend \nominous things to come in terms of Russia's ratification of this \ntreaty.\n  Now, I hope Senators are aware, and if they are not aware, that they \nwill become aware, that Russia is by far and away the world's largest \npossessor of chemical weapons. If the United States in eliminating its \nown chemical stockpile could assure that Russia also destroyed its \nstockpile through the Bilateral Destruction Agreement, 99 percent of \nthe world's chemical arsenal would be eliminated independently of this \ntreaty. So that gives you some idea of the enormity of this situation \nwhich has been passed over and over and over. I think enough is enough.\n  Now, of course, Russia has signed the CWC but it has not ratified \nthis treaty. Evidence has come to light recently, by the way, \nsuggesting that Russia may not pursue ratification of this treaty in \nthe near term and does not intend to abide by the CWC even if it \nratifies it.\n  I just want Senators to understand what they are doing. It is all \nvery well\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\nand good to succumb to the imaginative suggestion that we are doing \nsomething about chemical weapons when we pass this treaty. We are not. \nIt is not going to do one bit of good until the United States is able \nto persuade some other people to do things that they have already \nagreed to do. So the danger is how the American people are being misled \nby those who have endorsed this treaty into believing that something is \nbeing done about chemical weaponry.\n  I hope, if we do nothing else in our opposition to this treaty, we \ncan make the American people aware that nothing is being done for their \nsafety by this treaty. I wish it were different. I wish I did not have \nto stand here and say this. But those are the facts. This treaty is \nabsolutely useless in terms of giving the American people any security \nat all.\n  According to a May 6, 1996, letter from the DIA, the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, to the chairman of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence:\n\n       There are several factors affecting Russia's actions \n     regarding its CW programs and arms control commitments. \n     Russian officials probably believe they need a CW capability \n     to deter other nations from chemical warfare. They cite a \n     potential threat from purported CW programs in the United \n     States, other Western nations, and several countries on or \n     near Russia's borders.\n\n  Now, the DIA continued:\n\n       In addition, Russian officials believe that dismantling the \n     CW program would waste resources and rob them of valuable \n     production assets. They maintain that the CW production \n     facilities should not be destroyed but be used to produce \n     commercial products.\n\n  Well, la-de-da. Every nation that has some ulterior motives with \nchemical weapons can say the same thing.\n\n       Moreover, these officials do not want to see their life's \n     work destroyed, their jobs eliminated, and their influence \n     diminished.\n\n  And here we are probably going to ratify this treaty in spite of the \ngreat concern about the views of Russia's senior military leadership on \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and on the elimination of Russia's \nchemical warfare capability in general.\n  On numerous instances, the United States has received indications \nthat key elements within the Russian Government staunchly oppose the \nCWC. Back in 1994, October 25, Dr. Lev Fyodorov--I never met him, do \nnot know how to pronounce his name--head of the Union for Chemical \nSecurity, told Interfax news service that key officers from the Russian \nMinistry of Defense had spoken against the treaty during the Russian \nDuma defense committee's closed hearings on October 11 1994.\n  Now, my concerns about the two Russian generals responsible for \nRussia's chemical warfare elimination program have been well documented \nin a series of letters to President Clinton, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Mr. President: I take no offense at your declaration \n     to the effect that I am irresponsibly delaying consideration \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Both of us know that this \n     is not so. Moreover, the CWC is a treaty which in my view \n     must not be seriously considered by Congress unless and until \n     the issue of verification can be resolved.\n       There is no disagreement that the production stockpiling \n     and use of chemical and biological weapons is inherently \n     abhorrent, and especially by rogue regimes. Yours is the \n     second Administration with which I have raised compelling \n     questions about verification, Russian compliance, Russian \n     binary weapons programs--and the cost of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n       If and when we receive satisfactory answers to these \n     concerns, there would be a substantial increase in the \n     probability of this treaty's being reported out of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee for formal consideration by the \n     Senate.\n       I was astounded to learn, as surely you were, that the \n     former Chairman of the [Russian] President's Committee on \n     Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons, \n     Lieutenant General Anatoliy Kuntsevich, is now under the \n     house arrest for his having delivered 1,800 pounds of \n     military chemicals to terrorists in the Middle East in 1993. \n     What's more, the Russian intelligence service asserts that \n     General Kuntsevich attempted to sell 5 tons of military \n     chemicals to the same buyers a year later, in 1994. He was \n     caught in the act.\n       Needless to say, the arrest of this key Russian negotiator \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention on trafficking charges--\n     for dealing in the very same chemical agents he was \n     supposedly trying to control--calls into question the \n     integrity of every provision of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. It certainly lends credibility to concerns about \n     he trustworthiness of Russian declarations regarding its own \n     current chemical and biological programs, its stockpiles, and \n     the sincerity of the Russians' willingness, and ability, to \n     abide by the CWC and other agreements.\n       General Kuntsevich's role in chemical weapons dates to the \n     1980s. As Deputy Commander of Soviet Chemical Forces, he was \n     honored as a hero of Socialist Labor in 1981. In 1988, he \n     became a member of the Soviet delegation to the United \n     Nations Conference on Disarmament, which negotiated the CWC. \n     In 1991, he received the Lenin Prize for his work on binary \n     chemical weapons. Through his many years as a negotiator for \n     the Soviet/Russian governments, Kuntsevich won a number of \n     concessions on the Chemical Weapons Convention and follow-on \n     provisions to the Bilateral Destruction Agreement. Moreover, \n     he was responsible for Russia's dubious declarations under \n     the Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding.\n       While General Kuntsevich is said to have been removed by \n     President Yeltsin in April 1994, concern remains that the \n     General may have conspired to negotiate significant loopholes \n     in the agreements with the obvious intent of enabling him and \n     others to engage in chemical trafficking with impunity--and \n     possibly to permit Russia to evade its obligations.\n       I respectfully request a thorough analysis of the \n     negotiating record of the CWC and the Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement in order to review the role of General Kuntsevich \n     in securing various provisions and concessions. I regard this \n     analysis to be essential to any credible review.\n       Furthermore, I need to know General Kuntsevich's role in \n     the provision of questionable data declarations under the \n     Wyoming Memorandum. Has he been allowed to retain contacts \n     with the Yeltsin government since his removal?\n       There are three other questions, Mr. President, that simply \n     must be answered:\n       (1) When did the U.S. government learn of General \n     Kuntsevich's role in trafficking chemical weapons and other \n     corrupt practices?\n       (2) Were you aware of his activities, and his arrest, while \n     you were urging the Congress to move forward on the \n     ratification of the CWC?\n       (3) If General Kuntsevich has been under house arrest since \n     April 1994, what could explain the timing of the Russian \n     government's revelations regarding his activities?\n       The Russian government should be urged to accelerate and \n     complete its investigation of General Kuntsevich. I do hope \n     you will obtain from the Russian government a full accounting \n     of precisely what was sold and to whom, and how Russian \n     export controls were circumvented. Additionally, what \n     precautions, if any, have been taken to prevent such future \n     incidents from occurring?\n       Obviously, unless and until these concerns and those raised \n     previously have been addressed, it would not be fair to the \n     security and safety of the American people even to consider \n     moving the Chemical Weapons Convention out of Committee.\n           Respectfully,\n     Jesse Helms.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: I am confident that you were astonished, as \n     I was, that Russia's former chief negotiator for the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention is now under house arrest for trafficking \n     in the very military chemicals he purportedly was seeking to \n     control. Apparently, General Kuntsevich in 1993 sold 1,800 \n     pounds of chemical agents to terrorists in the Middle East. \n     He was caught attempting to sell another 5 tons a year later.\n       Many of us have consistently raised concerns regarding the \n     verifiability and enforceability of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. This most recent incident makes it demonstrable \n     that the CWC, even had it been in effect, would have been \n     helpless to interdict illicit trade in chemicals. (General \n     Kuntsevich is alleged to have transferred chemicals not \n     listed in the chemicals annex of the CWC, and those chemicals \n     went to a country that was not even a signatory to the \n     Convention. He was caught red-handed by traditional, national \n     law enforcement means, not by some global policing \n     mechanism.)\n       Furthermore, had General Kuntsevich not been caught, it is \n     conceivable that he and/or his cronies may have worked their \n     way into\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\n     the administrative body of the CWC, and would then have \n     access to a plethora of information regarding the chemical \n     programs of all signatories, and forewarning of all short-\n     notice inspections to be conducted under the Convention.\n       The attached letter that I sent to President Clinton \n     underscores my concerns arising from the arrest of General \n     Kuntsevich. Given Kuntsevich's influence over the negotiating \n     process of the CWC, and his responsibility for overseeing the \n     destruction of his own personal empire under the U.S.-Russian \n     Bilateral Destruction Agreement, I have requested a thorough \n     review of the negotiating record of both agreements.\n       I bring this new incident to your attention as the Senate \n     continues its discussion of issues surrounding the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention. General Kuntsevich's activities and \n     arrest highlight the many legitimate concerns we all share \n     regarding how best to guard against the threat that chemical \n     weapons pose to our nation's security.\n           Respectfully,\n     Jesse Helms.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I was gratified to note your \n     Administration's decision to impose sanctions against \n     Lieutenant General Anatoliy Kuntsevich, former Chairman of \n     the [Russian] President's Committee on Conventional Problems \n     of Chemical and Biological Weapons. (I had written to you on \n     October 25, 1995 regarding his having been arrested on \n     charges of selling military chemicals to Middle East \n     terrorists.)\n       Disturbing information about General Kuntsevich's \n     activities prompted my concerns about whether the U.S. can \n     believe Russian declarations regarding: (1) its current \n     chemical and biological programs and stockpiles; (2) its \n     willingness to abide by the 1990 U.S.-Russian Bilateral \n     Destruction Agreement (BDA); and (3) its intent to ratify the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       General Kuntsevich was, after all, one of the most senior \n     officers in Russia's chemical weapons program. Indeed, in \n     1994 it was he who signed, in conjunction with Colonel \n     General S.V. Petrov, the U.S.-Russian work plan for the \n     destruction of Russia's chemical weapons.\n       At that time, your National Security Advisor assured me \n     that General Kuntsevich was acting independently of the \n     Russian government. I was also told that his actions in no \n     way called into question the willingness of Russia to abide \n     by its commitments to eliminate its stockpile of chemical \n     weapons. However, it subsequently came to my attention that \n     yet another high-ranking Russian general, General Petrov, has \n     openly alluded to the desirability of maintaining a chemical \n     weapons capability. General Petrov, the other signatory to \n     the 1994 Work Plan, expressed his views in the November-\n     December 1994 edition of the official Russian Military \n     Journal, Military Thought. Such a belief, stated publicly by \n     a key Russian officer, prompts concern that key elements \n     within the Russian government may not even intend to \n     implement the BDA, ratify the CWC--or abide by either \n     agreement.\n       Most troubling to me, however, are rumors that have begun \n     to circulate that Russia no longer favors implementation of \n     the six-year old Bilateral Destruction Agreement. I further \n     understand that Russia will not seek to ratify the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention in the near future, and that the United \n     States has been told to delay its own ratification \n     indefinitely--or risk the possibility that Russia will never \n     ratify the CWC.\n       I am concerned that nearly a month has elapsed and the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee has yet to be notified of \n     such an ominous change in Russian policy towards the \n     destruction of its chemical arsenal.\n       Accordingly, I respectfully request immediate \n     declassification of any documents or cables pertaining to the \n     aforementioned issues, including cable number 607329 \n     dispatched from Bonn on May 21, 1996, and their being \n     provided to the Committee. I also respectfully request \n     detailed, and unclassified responses to the following \n     questions:\n       (1) Has the intelligence community conducted any assessment \n     identifying Russian officials believed to oppose \n     dismantlement of Russia's chemical weapons stockpile, or who \n     oppose Russian ratification of the CWC? Please declassify \n     these reports provide them to the Committee.\n       (2) The Central Intelligence Agency stated in a report in \n     March, 1995, that ``some CW-capable countries that have \n     signed the CWC show no signs of ending their programs.'' Does \n     the intelligence community believe that Russia intends to \n     forgo all aspects of its chemical weapons program?\n       (3) Is it the case that Russia has not yet constructed even \n     a pilot chemical weapons destruction facility? Is it also \n     true that the Shchuch'ye Implementation Plan exists only on \n     paper, and that the plan does not yet even include such \n     rudimentary components as baseline data, engineering survey \n     data, or a site feasibility study? How many years will \n     finalization of these critical elements of the Russian \n     destruction program take?\n       (4) On June 23, 1994, the then-Director of Central \n     Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, stated that the U.S. had \n     ``serious concerns over apparent incompleteness, \n     inconsistency and contradictory aspects of the data'' \n     provided to the United States by Russia regarding its \n     chemical weapons program. How will Russian withdrawal from \n     the BDA affect U.S. efforts to resolve questions regarding \n     ``contradictions'' in Russia's declarations about its \n     chemical weapons stockpile? Is the Administration prepared to \n     challenge immediately the veracity of Russian reporting under \n     the CWC if Russia provides data which mirrors that provided \n     to the United States under the 1989 Wyoming Memorandum of \n     Understanding?\n       (5) Dr. Vil Mirzayanov, former chief of counterintelligence \n     at the State Union Scientific Research Institute for Organic \n     Chemistry and Technology, has alleged that Russia has \n     produced a new class of binary nerve agents five to eight \n     times more lethal than any other known chemical agent, and \n     that work may be continuing on these chemical weapons. Is the \n     Administration satisfied that the Russian Federation has \n     indeed ceased the development and/or production of all \n     offensive chemical weapons agents?\n       I will appreciate your assistance in resolving these \n     questions which concern issues which so directly impact on \n     the national security of the United States.\n           Respectfully,\n     Jesse Helms.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: When I wrote to you on June 21 \n     regarding perhaps the most significant, ominous shift in \n     Russian arms control policy since the end of the Cold War, I \n     respectfully requested, among other things, information from \n     the Administration concerning reports that Russia will not \n     implement the six-year old U.S.-Russian Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement (BDA) or pursue ratification of the CWC in the near \n     future.\n       Mr. President, since writing to you, my concerns as to \n     whether Russia intends to implement the BDA and ratify the \n     CWC have been confirmed beyond peradventure. To be specific: \n     Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin wrote to Vice President \n     Gore on July 8, stating officially that both the BDA and the \n     Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) have outlived their \n     usefulness to Russia. Moreover, it has been established that \n     Prime Minister Chernomyrdin (1) linked Russian ratification \n     of the CWC to U.S. agreement to a Joint Statement linking \n     ratification by the United States to Russian ratification, \n     (2) stated that the American taxpayers must pay the cost of \n     the Russian destruction program, and (3) linked ratification \n     to U.S. acquiescence to Russia's position on conversion of \n     its chemical weapons facilities.\n       Even more disturbing is the report that the Prime Minister \n     declared that if the CWC enters into force without Russia, it \n     will be impossible for Russia ever to ratify the treaty.\n       Mr. President, the Russian Federation appears to anticipate \n     that due to intense U.S. diplomatic lobbying the CWC may \n     enter into force this summer. I am concerned that U.S. \n     efforts at inducing nations to ratify the treaty, and bring \n     it into force before the views of the United States Senate \n     have been expressed on the CWC, have virtually ensured that \n     neither the United States nor Russia will have a hand in \n     finalizing the 37 uncompleted implementation procedures of \n     the treaty. Once 65 countries have ratified, all manner of \n     detailed guidelines affecting the CWC's verification regime, \n     ranging from the conduct of inspections to the safeguarding \n     of samples transferred for analysis off-site, will be \n     finalized rapidly.\n       Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's letter was clear: ``Speaking \n     candidly,'' he wrote ``I shall say that the Convention's \n     entry into force without Russia would hamper its ratification \n     with us.'' On July 22, 1996, the Russian delegation in The \n     Hague repeated this position, stating that ``the entry into \n     force of the Convention without Russia, to be perfectly \n     candid, would hamper its ratification in our country.''\n       Since Russia is bound to know that the treaty will enter \n     into force without Russia's participation, is it not evident \n     that Russia is preparing a diplomatic exit strategy from the \n     CWC?\n       The Senate needs to be informed by the Administration \n     precisely how Russian withdrawal from the BDA and the Wyoming \n     MOU will affect U.S. efforts to resolve questions concerning \n     Russia's various declarations about its chemical weapons \n     stockpile.\n       The Director of Central Intelligence, James Woolsey, \n     testified on June 23, 1994, that the U.S. had ``serious \n     concerns over apparent incompleteness, inconsistency and \n     contradictory aspects of the data'' submitted by Russia under \n     the Wyoming MOU.\n       So, Mr. President, if Russia is now refusing to answer any \n     more questions about the size of its chemical weapons \n     stockpile or its binary weapons program (which it has failed \n     to mention at all), does this not cast doubt as to whether \n     Russia will ever fully disclose its chemical weapons \n     activities? Is the Administration prepared to challenge \n     immediately the veracity of Russian reporting under the CWC \n     if Russia provides data which mirrors that provided to the \n     United States under the Wyoming MOU?\n       Additionally, given that the bilateral inspection regime \n     (under the BDA) was to have substituted for multilateral \n     inspections under the CWC, does Russian withdrawal\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\n     from the BDA lower the intelligence community's already poor \n     level of confidence in its ability to monitor Russian treaty \n     compliance?\n       Mr. President, I respectfully reiterate my request for \n     detailed, and unclassified responses to the questions I asked \n     of you on June 21, 1996. I also will appreciate your \n     providing to the Committee:\n       (1) the Chernomyrdin letter of July 8, 1996, which I \n     understand must be unclassified since it was transmitted by \n     facsimile around Washington on unsecured lines;\n       (2) all assessments by the intelligence community \n     discussing the views of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin towards \n     the BDA, the CWC, and any assessments as to whether he favors \n     complete elimination of Russia's chemical weapons arsenal;\n       (3) the draft Joint Statement and all relevant documents \n     supplied by Russia to Vice President Gore prior to the \n     President's Moscow Summit;\n       (4) a detailed assessment of discrepancies in Russia's \n     Wyoming MOU data and the results of any bilateral discussions \n     regarding those discrepancies;\n       (5) a detailed assessment by the intelligence community of \n     the impact that non-implementation of the BDA and Wyoming MOU \n     will have upon the U.S. ability to monitor Russian compliance \n     with the CWC;\n       (6) a detailed estimate of the additional cost to the \n     United States of implementing the CWC without the BDA in \n     place;\n       (7) an estimate of the total cost of destroying Russia's \n     chemical weapons stockpile; and\n       (8) all documents relating to any discussions with or \n     assurances made to Russia by the Administration regarding \n     U.S. assistance to the Russian destruction program.\n       In closing, Mr. President, I should note for the record \n     that the unanimous consent agreement in the Senate (to \n     proceed to consideration of the CWC on or before September \n     14, 1996) is predicated entirely upon the administration's \n     providing ``such facts and documents as requested by the \n     Chairman and ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee.''\n       I hope we can work together on this matter. I will \n     appreciate your assistance in resolving these questions \n     concerning issues which so directly impact on the national \n     security of the United States and the American people.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      Jesse Helms.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we are all aware of how the administration \nhas refused, refused to provide the Senate, despite my repeated \nrequests, my repeated entreaties to them, to give us an updated \nassessment of the Russian position regarding the BDA and the CWC.\n  Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin wrote to Vice President Gore on \nJuly 8, 1996 stating that both the BDA and the 1989 Wyoming memorandum \nof understanding have outlived their usefulness to Russia, don't you \nsee. Moreover, the Prime Minister, one, tied Russian ratification of \nthis treaty, the CWC, to United States agreement to a joint statement \nlinking ratification by the United States to Russian ratification; two, \nstated that the American taxpayers--get this--the American taxpayers \nmust pay the cost of the Russian destruction program; and three, he \nlinked ratification to United States acquiescence to Russia's position \non conversion of its chemical weapons facilities. The shift in Russian \narms control policy, you see, will have important ramifications.\n  First, the minimalist approaches taken by Russia in its data \ndeclaration on the Wyoming memorandum of understanding will go \nunresolved. Russia has stated that the total size of its stockpiled \nchemical weapons is equivalent to 40,000 tons of agent. This \ndeclaration is absolutely untrue. The Director of Central Intelligence, \nJames Woolsey, testified before the Foreign Relations Committee on June \n23, 1994, that the United States had ``serious concerns over apparent \nincompleteness, inconsistency and contradictory aspects of the data'' \nsubmitted by Russia under the Wyoming MOU. On August 27, 1993, Adm. \nWilliam Studeman, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, wrote to \nSenator Glenn stating:\n\n       We cannot confirm that the Russian declaration of 40,000 mt \n     is accurate. In addition, we cannot confirm that the total \n     stockpile is stored only at the seven sites declared by the \n     Soviets...\n\nArticles in both the Washington Post and the Washington Times alleged \nthat the Defense Intelligence Agency has estimated the Soviet stockpile \ncould be as large as 75,000 metric tons.\n  Omissions in Russia's MOU data declarations have clear implications \nfor how Russia will interpret the various provisions of the CWC. \nBecause the BDA mandates annual updates to the Wyoming MOU, Russian \nwithdrawal from the BDA may also signal that Russia will henceforth \nrefuse to entertain any additional United States questions about the \nsize of its chemical weapons stockpile or its binary weapons program. \nSenators should be concerned that Russia may intend to provide to the \nOPCW data which mirrors that provided under the Wyoming MOU. This \nwould, in this Senator's view, serve as a clear indicator that Russia \nintends to violate the CWC.\n  Second, Russia has consistently refused to provide information on the \nstatus of its binary chemical weapons program. On June 23, 1994, then-\nDirector of Central Intelligence James Woolsey declared that ``the data \nwe have received from Russia makes no reference to binary chemical \nweapons or agents. That is contrary to our understanding of the program \nthat was initiated by the former Soviet Union.''\n  Dr. Vil Mirzayanov, former chief of counterintelligence at the State \nUnion Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and \nTechnology, has stated that the Russian Federation may continue work on \nnovel nerve agents far more lethal than any other known chemical \nagents--substance A-230, substance 33, and substance A-232. In an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal on May 25, 1994, Dr. Mirzayanov \nwrote:\n\n       It is very easy to produce binary weapons without detection \n     under the guise of agricultural petrochemicals. The products \n     easily pass all safety tests and become registered with the \n     government as legitimate commercial products. The plant \n     receives a license for production and goes into operation. \n     Neither the firm's leaders, its staff, nor international \n     inspectors know that the chemicals are a component of a new \n     binary weapon.\n       As the public talks toward banning chemical weapons \n     progressed, the more intense became Russia's secret \n     development and testing of binary weapons... our laboratories \n     created Substance A-230, a weapon about which I can only say \n     that its killing efficiency surpassed any known military \n     toxin by a factor of five to eight.\n       ...Two more major achievements took place in 1990 and 1991. \n     First, a binary weapon based on a compound code-named \n     Substance 33 passed site tests and was put into production \n     for the Soviet army.\n       ...The second development was the synthesis of a binary \n     weapon based on Substance A-232, a toxin similar to A-230. \n     This new weapon, part of the ultra-lethal ``Novichok'' class, \n     provides an opportunity for the military establishment to \n     disguise production of components of binary weapons as common \n     agricultural chemicals; because the West does not know the \n     formula, and its inspectors cannot identify the compounds.\n       ...Fifteen thousand tons of Substance 33 have been produced \n     in the city of Novocheborksarsk... But our generals have told \n     the U.S. that Novocheborksarsk is turning out another \n     substance known as VX.\n\n  Dr. Mirzayanov and other dissident Russian scientists have claimed \nthat Russia's binary weapons program has been specifically crafted to \nevade detection under the verification regime of the CWC. They allege \nthat components for the binary agents have been given legitimate \ncommercial applications, that they are not covered under the CWC's \nschedules, and that OPCW inspectors will not know what they are \nexamining when they come across such chemicals. The United States \nshould not ratify the CWC until Russia agrees to forgo this abhorrent \nprogram.\n  Third, the BDA provides for United States on-site inspections of \nRussian storage, destruction and production facilities, combined with \ndata declarations. The United States can expect to gain real monitoring \nbenefits from the CWC only if the Bilateral Destruction Agreement [BDA] \nis implemented. This agreement provides for United States on-site \ninspections of Russian storage, destruction and production facilities. \nWithout the BDA, the United States will be forced to verify Russian CWC \ncompliance based upon a smaller number of inspections than anticipated \nunder the bilateral arrangement, with inspections of Russian sites by \nthe OPCW rather than by United States personnel, and with no guaranteed \nUnited States access to detailed inspection data. In other words, the \nintelligence community's already poor confidence level in its ability \nto monitor Russian treaty compliance will fall even lower.\n  Fourth, Russian insistence on excluding several of its chemical \nweapons-related facilities from the BDA's definition of ``chemical \nweapons production facility,'' and hence from the CWC's definition, \nrelates directly to its desire to maintain a clandestine chemical \nweapons production capability. The\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\nUnited States refusal to accede to the Russian position, which would \nhave--in turn--strengthened the Russian case for facility conversions \nunder the CWC, may be a primary reason that Russia has refused to \nimplement the BDA. We should not, under any circumstance, allow Russia \nto exclude its chemical weapons facilities from inspection.\n  Moreover, without the bilateral agreement the OPCW will increase the \nsize of its international inspectorate and purchase of additional \nequipment. This will drive up vastly the expected costs of the regime. \nFurther, the CWC requires States Parties to pay for monitoring of their \nchemical weapons production, storage, and disposal facilities.\n  Mr. President, I guess we ought to respond once more--it is an \nexercise in futility, but we ought to keep responding to that old \nlitany that we have heard this day about making the United States \nratification of the CWC contingent upon Russia's acting first.\n  Let us look at a little bit of history. This Senate approved the \nSTART II treaty amidst a clamor of claims by the administration that a \nfailure to act was preventing Russian approval of that treaty. Does \nanybody hear anything familiar about that? More than 15 months have \npassed and the Russian Duma still has not approved START II. Instead, \nthe Russian leadership rendered ratification of the START II treaty \ncontingent upon United States acquiescence to Russian interpretation \nof, get this, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and now the \nChemical Weapons Convention is being tied to NATO enlargement and other \nissues.\n  Mr. President, surely, surely, Senators will not fail to refuse such \nlinkages, and the best way to do it is to require, to stipulate \nunmistakably that Russia must act in good faith and ratify the Chemical \nWeapons Convention first. Indeed, in his letter to Vice President Gore, \nthe Prime Minister of Russia stated that the United States should wait \nfor Russia.\n  I urge Senators to reject that motion to strike.\n  I yield the floor. I do not know who has been waiting the longest.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. President, has \nbeen waiting longer than I. I will follow him.\n  Mr. HELMS. I did not see anybody over here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Warner is going to get part of our time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think Senator Warner should go ahead since we are going \nback and forth across the aisle.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan yields to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was asked by a reporter my view of the \ndistinguished majority leader's role in this very important debate, and \nI replied, without hesitation, that the tougher the issue, the closer \nthe division within the ranks of the Senate and most particularly \nwithin our party, the tougher the leadership challenge. I am proud to \njoin others in saying our leader has met that challenge.\n  Likewise, my distinguished colleague and friend from day one in the \nSenate, the senior Senator from North Carolina, together with Senators \nKyl and Smith and Inhofe, have met the challenge. They have ensured \nthat the Senate has conducted a full and thorough debate on this \ntreaty, and they have been instrumental in achieving the 28 conditions \nwhich have been adopted by the Senate. Those conditions have improved \nthe document which the President submitted to the Senate in 1993.\n  There is a clear division within the ranks of Republicans on this \nissue, and it has been a conscientious and thoughtful process by which \neach has reached his or her position.\n  Now, Mr. President, to go to the subject itself. I will not go into \nthe details of this treaty. I would like to speak to the broader issue.\n  I first learned of chemical weapons at the knee of my father who was \na surgeon in the trenches in World War I. He described to me in vivid \ndetail how he cared for the helpless victims of that weapon.\n  On through my years on the Armed Services Committee, where I was the \npoint man in the 1980's to drive through the legislation for binary \nchemical weapons because I wanted this country to be prepared to deter \nthe use of those weapons. And, then, through the Reagan-Bush era, our \nNation has come full circle, and decided to lead in the effort to \neliminate these weapons. Whether that can be done I know not, nor does \nanyone. But we cannot turn back now from that leadership role.\n\n  This treaty does not meet my full expectations. But I think we can \nfight better in the arena, in the ring, to improve this treaty than \nwere we to stay outside and peer over the ropes. It is for that reason \nthat I shall cast my final vote in support of this convention.\n  I recall the ABM Treaty. I was in Moscow as a part of President \nNixon's team, as Secretary of the Navy. The drafters of that treaty put \ntheir minds to dealing with the threat at that period of time. They \nnever envisioned, nor could they envision, a decade or two decades \nhence, what the scientific community might produce. Therein we have \nmade a mistake as a nation by not adapting that treaty over time to \ndeal with technological developments. I shall continue to fight very \nvigorously to see that that treaty does not become written in stone so \nas to block the efforts of our Nation to properly defend itself against \nattack from short-range missiles.\n  I cite that as an example, because technology is outpacing what the \nbest minds in this Nation can draft--whether it is a treaty or a law. \nWe have to look upon this treaty--as we should look upon all treaties--\nas a living document, a document that must be changed by the \nconscientious efforts of the signatories to this treaty. It must be \nchanged to meet the advancements of technology in the area of chemical \nweapons; it must be changed to address the concerns that have been \nraised during this debate.\n  Like our Constitution--a document that has lived and survived so that \nwe, the United States, are the oldest continuously functioning form of \ndemocratic republic on Earth--this convention must be a living \ndocument. Our Constitution has been amended. It shall be amended, \nperhaps, in the future. Because it is a living document. It has adapted \nto the many changes we have witnessed as a nation.\n  This treaty must be regarded as a living document and it is incumbent \nupon this President and his successors thereafter to work \nconscientiously, within the arena, to see that it is strengthened.\n  The work in this debate has gone far to show that it is a living \ndocument. Under the leadership of Senator Helms and Senator Lott we \nhave already brought about a number of changes. The Senate may effect \nfurther changes as the evening progresses. But the important thing we \nmust keep in mind is that this document must be regarded as one that \nhas to be improved. And it is the leadership of the United States that \nmust step forward to achieve that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. May I ask the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma how much \ntime he believes he will need?\n  Mr. INHOFE. May I have 6 minutes?\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 5 minutes \nremaining on the amendment.\n  The Senator is recognized for the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I inquire of the Senator from North Carolina if he has \nother Senators requesting time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes. I think I have some time over in one corner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has time on the resolution, if he \nwishes. There are 5 minutes remaining on the motion.\n  Mr. HELMS. I understand that. I have 5 minutes. Then he would like 2 \nminutes. So take it out of the other pot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for up \nto 2--up to 7 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Are you sure that's right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from North Carolina. I do want to \naddress this particular amendment. Before I do, I have three articles, \nand I ask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. The first one is a Wall Street Journal editorial of \nSeptember 9, 1996. I will just read the last paragraph.\n\n       Ultimately the treaty's most pernicious effect is that it \n     would lull most responsible nations into the false belief \n     that they'd ``done something'' about the chemical weapons \n     problem and that it now was behind them. Yes, the world would \n     be a better place without chemical weapons. But this treaty's \n     attempt to wave them away isn't going to make that happen.\n\n  The other two, one by Frank Gaffney, Jr. and the other by Douglas \nFeith, address the regulation problems that would come from this to \nliterally thousands of companies throughout America. In fact, the \nCommerce Department guidance on recordkeeping for affected businesses \nruns more than 50 pages.\n  Mr. President, you have run companies. You know one of the major \nreasons we are not globally competitive here in the United States is \nthat we are overregulated. There is a tremendous cost to these \nregulations. If the requirements exceed 50 pages, imagine what the \ncompanies would have to do.\n  Mr. President, in a way I think the other side of this has perhaps \nused the wrong argument. There is an argument they are overlooking, and \nthat is it does not seem to make a lot of difference whether Russia \nratifies this or not because, as we have said several times during the \ncourse of this debate, they ratified a lot of treaties, including the \n1990 Biological Weapons Destruction treaty, the ABM Treaty--that goes \nall the way back to the 1970's--the START I, CFE, INF. And while they \nhave ratified these, they have not complied.\n  There are three steps you go through. One is you have to sign them. \nSecond, you ratify them. But, third, you have to comply. And they have \nbeen found out of compliance. I cannot imagine why we would expect that \nthey would comply with this one if they ratified it if they have not \ncomplied with the previous ones.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan quoted, somewhat extensively, \nGen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as \nsaying that this would have the effect of reducing the proliferation of \nchemical weapons.\n  I would only say, trying not to be redundant, if that is the case, \nthen you are taking his word over four previous Secretaries of Defense: \nDick Cheney, James Schlesinger, Don Rumsfeld, and Cap Weinberger, all \nfour of whom said this would have the effect of increasing the \nproliferation of chemical weapons and their use in the Middle East.\n  But, one of the statements that was made by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan I thought was interesting. He said, if I got it right, \nand correct me if I am wrong: ``The single most important reason to \nratify the treaty is to encourage Russia to ratify it.'' Again, if they \ndo, it really does not seem to make that much difference because of \ntheir past history on what they have done.\n  I would like to clear up something because I think we have gone \nthrough a lot of debate on this issue. It has been clearly implied by \nboth Republicans who are supporting the ratification of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention as well as Democrats who are supporting it that this \nwas started in the Reagan administration and that Ronald Reagan was in \nsupport of a chemical weapons treaty.\n  I happened to run across something here that I am going to read. \nThese are the conditions--I am going to save the best one until last--\nthe conditions under which Ronald Reagan said he would agree to the \nratification of a chemical weapons convention.\n  First, the condition was that strategic defense initiative and \ntheater missile defense systems would be deployed and operational as \none safeguard against cheating.\n\n  As we know, currently we do not have those in place.\n  No. 2, that the Chemical Weapon Convention's international executive \ncouncil would consist of 15 members, including the United States as one \nof the five permanent members, just like the U.N. Security Council. The \ncurrent treaty gives us a 41-member executive council, each with 2-year \nterms, and no permanent members; hence, no veto.\n  Third, that the United States would have absolute veto power over all \nCWC decisions. Obviously, in this one there is no veto power. \nObviously, the President would not have supported this.\n  President Reagan also, even though it is not on my list, verbally \nindicated on more than one occasion that one of his conditions would be \nthat we would not have to incur the financial responsibility, in the \nUnited States, of other countries complying with it. In fact, right now \nour compliance costs on this convention appear to be, according to the \nForeign Relations Committee report, $13.6 billion and the cost of \nRussia complying with this would exceed that.\n  It has been stated on this floor many times that Russia has somewhere \nbetween 60 and 70 percent of all the chemical weapons in the world, so, \nobviously it would be more than that. What is Russia going to do? Are \nthey going to comply? Let us say they go ahead and ratify. If they \nratify it, you know, everyone in this Chamber knows, that they are \ngoing to look to the United States to pay for their obligation under \nthe treaty. That is what they are doing on START II. In fact, I have to \ngo back and make that statement also, that we are hearing this same \nargument all over again right now that we heard 2 years ago. Mr. \nPresident, 2 years ago we stood in this Chamber and they said: If we \ndon't ratify this, Russia won't ratify it. Here it is 2 years later and \nRussia has not ratified it.\n  So I think this is a very significant requirement, the fact that \nRonald Reagan said--and this is a direct quote, coming out of his \ncommittee at the time--for ratification, ``All Soviet obligations of \nprevious arms control agreements would have to be corrected.'' And we \nhave five such agreements that have not been corrected to date.\n  So, I hope no one stands on the floor the rest of the evening and \ntalks about how Ronald Reagan would have ratified this Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n\n                               Exhibit 7\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 9, 1996]\n\n                           Poisons for Peace\n\n       The greatest misperception about the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, which comes before the Senate this week for \n     ratification, is that it can't do any harm and might do some \n     good. Former Reagan defense official Fred Ekle aptly calls \n     this mind-set ``poisons for peace.'' Who could possibly be \n     against making the world safe from the horrors of poison gas? \n     In fact, this treaty would make the horrors of poison gas an \n     even greater possibility.\n       The first problem is that many of the nations we have cause \n     to worry about most aren't about to sign. What good is a \n     treaty that doesn't include Iraq or Libya or Syria or North \n     Korea? Somehow knowing that New Zealand and the Netherlands \n     have both ratified it doesn't help us sleep more soundly.\n       Worse, the treaty would give all signatories access to our \n     latest chemical technology, since Article XI enjoins \n     signatories from keeping chemicals, information or equipment \n     from one another. This means not only countries such as China \n     and Russia, but also Cuba and Iran, which have both signed. \n     In other words, forget about the trade embargoes and forget \n     about foreign policy. The treaty would require the U.S. to \n     facilitate the modernization of the chemical-weapons industry \n     in a host of countries that just might use them.\n       The second problem is verification. No one, not even its \n     most ardent supporters in the Administration, is naive enough \n     to claim that the treaty is verifiable. Chemical weapons are \n     easy to make and easy to hide. The sarin that was used in the \n     attack in the Tokyo subway last year was concocted in an 812 \n     room. Instituting snap inspections of companies that make or \n     use chemicals isn't going to stop a future Aum Shinri Kyo. \n     Nor is it going to stop a determined government.\n       In addition, the inspection and reporting procedures \n     required under the treaty would be a huge burden on American \n     business, which of course would become even more nervous \n     about industrial espionage. Senator  Jon Kyl estimates that \n     up to 10,000 American companies would be affected at a \n     cost approaching $1 billion a year. Every company that \n     uses or produces chemicals would fall under the long arm \n     of the treaty--companies like Pfizer and Quaker Oats and \n     Strohs Brewery and Maxwell House Coffee and Goodyear Tire. \n     Dial Corp., which uses 5,000 different chemicals to \n     produce an array of household products, estimates that it \n     will have to spend $70,000 a year to meet the treaty's \n     reporting requirements.\n       The small number of chemical companies that make the lethal \n     stuff would of course be covered, too, and much has been made \n     of the\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\n     treaty's endorsement by the Chemical Manufacturers \n     Association, which represents just 190 member companies and \n     had a hand in formulating the treaty's verification \n     procedures. The industry is already very heavily regulated, \n     and the treaty's inspection and reporting requirements \n     wouldn't be much of an additional burden. It also can't hurt \n     that the treaty would increase its members' trading and sales \n     opportunities thanks to Article XI.\n       The list of problems with the treaty goes on and on. \n     Constitutional scholar Robert Bork raises the possibility \n     that the verification requirements might violate the \n     Constitution's ban on search and seizure, and its property \n     rights guarantees. The Pentagon isn't happy with it since, \n     under the Clinton Administration's interpretation, it would \n     prohibit the military from using non-lethal chemical agents. \n     It's not hard to imagine a scenario in which the Army is \n     forced to shoot people because it's not permitted to use tear \n     gas.\n       Ultimately the treaty's most pernicious effect is that it \n     would lull responsible nations into a false belief that \n     they'd ``done something'' about the chemical weapons problem \n     and that it now was behind them. Yes, the world would be a \n     better place without chemical weapons. But this treaty's \n     attempt to wave them away isn't going to make that happen.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Sept. 4, 1996]\n\n                          Impending CWC Debate\n\n                        (By Frank Gaffney, Jr.)\n\n       There is a certain irony to the timing of the looming \n     Senate debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention. After all, \n     in a sense this treaty was the direct result of one of Saddam \n     Hussein's earlier genocidal operations against the Kurds of \n     Northern Iraq. It came about after the abysmal 1989 \n     conference in Paris where scores of nations could not being \n     themselves even to cite--let along condemn or sanction--the \n     Iraqi government for its use of chemical weapons against its \n     own people, let alone the Iranian military. Such attacks \n     directly violated the existing ``international norm'' on \n     chemical warfare: the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of \n     chemical weapons.\n       In a bid to deflect criticism for the international \n     community's failure to enforce one relatively verifiable arms \n     control treaty, the politicians and diplomats decided to \n     negotiate a new, utterly unverifiable agreement. After four \n     years of further negotiations in Geneva, a brand new \n     ``international norm'' against chemical warfare was minted: \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\n       Now, readers of this column learned last week that, quite \n     apart from the problems with this treaty from the standpoint \n     of its verifiability and enforceability, there are a number \n     of questions that have been posed about how the CWC has been \n     affected by Russian bad faith and other changed circumstances \n     since the United States signed up in 1993. Such questions \n     were supposed to have been answered before the Senate \n     considered this accord on or before Sept. 14. As the answers \n     are inconvenient (for instance, confirmation that Moscow is \n     welching on a 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement and \n     demanding that the West pay the estimated $3.3 billion it \n     will take Russia to dismantle its vast chemical arsenal), it \n     has employed its favorite tactic with regard to congressional \n     information requests: Stonewall.\n       Since that column was written, however, the \n     administration's machinations on behalf of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention have, as Alice said of Wonderland, become \n     ``curiouser and curiouser.'' This is particularly evident in \n     the Clinton teams's efforts to dissemble about what the CWC \n     won't do--and what it will.\n       For example, the administration convened a series of \n     briefings for Senate staffers over the August recess. In \n     these lopsided sessions, a gaggle of 15 or more executive \n     branch officials harangued three of four folks from Capitol \n     Hill, in some cases for hours on end. Unfortunately, the \n     briefers repeatedly misled the staffers--notably with respect \n     to the costs of the CWC to American taxpayers and to \n     thousands of American companies. Among other things, the \n     administration is significantly low-balling the U.S. portion \n     of the expenses associated the new U.N.-style international \n     bureaucracy created to gather data and conduct inspections. \n     Clinton officials have also minimized the likely loss of \n     proprietary data when a company's sensitive facility is \n     gone over for up to 84 hours by inspectors who will be, \n     likely as not, detailed from foreign commercial espionage \n     organizations.\n       Incredibly, even some of the companies at greatest risk \n     appear to be susceptible to the administration's \n     disinformation on this score. Take, for example, an Aug. 7 \n     letter to Sen. Richard Lugar from the Pharmaceutical Research \n     and Manufacturers of America (PhARMA), a trade association \n     for some of the nation's most cutting-edge biotech firms. \n     Clinton officials reportedly induced PhARMA's president to \n     tell the treaty's top Senate cheerleader that it supported \n     the CWC with the promise that the administration would not \n     allow the CWC's verification protocol to be extended to the \n     existing (and similarly unmonitorable) Biological Weapons \n     Convention.\n       PhARMA's members clearly understand an important reality: \n     If, under the biological weapons treaty, America's \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers were subjected to a reporting \n     and inspection regime similar to that of the CWC, they could \n     lose their shirts. After all, on average these companies \n     invest 12 years and some $350 million to produce a new \n     breakthrough drug. Trial inspections suggest that a single \n     on-site, inspection by a trained intelligence operative could \n     greatly reduce, if not wipe out, the competitive advantage \n     acquired at such a high price.\n       The only problem with PhARMA's stance is, that many of its \n     member companies will find themselves subjected to precisely \n     that danger under the terms of CWC. So might a great many \n     other companies having nothing to do with chemical weapons \n     and in industries as diverse as automotive, food processing, \n     electronics, alcohol distilling and brewing, oil refining, \n     soap and detergents, cosmetics, textiles and paint and tire \n     manufacturers. Among the companies listed on a recent Arms \n     Control and Disarmament Agency list of businesses ``likely'' \n     to be affected by the CWC's various requirements are: Eli \n     Lilly, Sherwin-Williams, Nutrasweet, Jim Beam, Archer Daniels \n     Midland, Lever Brothers, Kaiser Aluminum, Goodyear Tire and \n     Rubber, Xerox Raythoen and Conoco. If the trade associations \n     representing these major American businesses are operating \n     under illusions similar to PhARMA's their member companies \n     may wish to join the call for a ``time-out'' on Senate action \n     on the CWC.\n       Some senators may be tempted to ignore the administration's \n     stonewalling of legitimate and troubling questions relevant \n     to the CWC that have been posed by their own leadership. Some \n     may consider the administration's understanding of the \n     treaty's associated costs and its inflating of the claims \n     benefits to be business as usual for the Clinton team. It is, \n     however, very much to be hoped that at least 34 members of \n     the U.S. Senate will refuse to tolerate such behavior and, \n     insist that consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     be postponed until corrective action can be taken and, \n     failing that, that the convention be defeated outright.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the San Diego Union-Tribune, Sept. 8, 1996]\n\n``Open up in the Name of the . . . Organization for the Prohibition of \n                          Chemical Weapons?''\n\n                         (By Douglas J. Feith)\n\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention would be the first arms \n     control agreement to reach into the lives of non-military \n     U.S. businesses and impose costs and regulatory burdens.\n       It would oblige the government to adopt implementing \n     legislation to compel a wide range of American businesses--\n     including tire, paint, pharmaceutical, fertilizer and \n     electronics manufacturers, distillers, food processors and \n     oil refiners--to keep special records. (The Commerce \n     Department guidance on record-keeping for affected businesses \n     runs more than 50 pages.)\n       Affected businesses would be forced to submit to routine \n     and possibly ``challenge'' inspections by officials of an \n     international organization--the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The warrantless inspections, \n     which may run afoul of U.S. constitutional rights under the \n     Fourth and Fifth Amendments, could jeopardize important \n     private proprietary information.\n       The regulatory cost is just one of a number of flaws. In \n     the final analysis, what the CWC amounts to is a general \n     declaration, a statement of disapproval of chemical weapons \n     that would be made sincerely only by the world's law-abiding \n     nations. The treaty would accomplish little more than the \n     typical United Nations General Assembly resolution. Such \n     rhetorical exercises are not necessarily bad or useless, but \n     they do not amount to a whole lot.\n       We would favor paying a substantial price for a ban on \n     chemical weapon possession if such a ban covered the relevant \n     countries and it could be made effective through reliable \n     detection of illegal production and stockpiling. But such \n     results hardly seem likely. We tend to think of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention this way: Even a price you may be willing \n     to pay for a new car will appear ridiculously high if you \n     learn that the car cannot be made to drive.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this treaty, and I \nstrongly urge the Senate to ratify it.\n  In a sense, this debate is as old as America. Two centuries ago, with \nour independence newly won, the Founding Fathers urged us to beware of \n``entangling foreign alliances.'' They wrote into the Constitution a \nrequirement that any treaty with foreign nations must be confirmed by a \ntwo-thirds vote of the Senate.\n  By any rational standard, this treaty meets that test.\n  Nevertheless, the treaty is being opposed by an entrenched band of \nforeign policy ideologues and isolationists who think the United \nNations is the enemy and who say the arms race should be escalated, not \nrestricted. History proved their ilk wrong once before, when they sank \nthe League of Nations in the 1920's. And it will prove them wrong again \nwith far more drastic consequences than World War II, if they prevail \ntoday.\n  We cannot let that happen. The Senate should reject the remaining \nkiller\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\namendments, and give this treaty the two-thirds vote it needs and \ndeserves.\n  The 29-year-old pursuit of a chemical weapons treaty has finally \nreached its moment of truth in the U.S. Senate. Few votes cast in this \nCongress or any Congress are likely to be more important.\n  The effort to achieve this treaty was launched in 1968, and its \nhistory is genuinely bipartisan. It has moved forward under Republican \nand Democratic Presidents alike. In 1968, the final year of the Johnson \nadministration, international negotiations began in Geneva to build on \nthe 1925 Geneva Protocol and try to reduce the production of chemical \nweapons.\n  In the 1970's, President Gerald Ford had the vision to take that \ninitiative a major step forward during intense international \nnegotiations.\n  President Ronald Reagan advanced it to the next stage with his \nefforts on arms control in the 1980's. And President Bush deserves high \npraise for embracing the ideal of eliminating chemical weapons, for \nmaking it a serious worldwide effort, and at long last bringing it to \nthe stage where it was ready to be signed. In one of his last acts in \noffice, George Bush signed the treaty, on January 13, 1993.\n  President Clinton formally submitted the Chemical Weapons Convention \nto the Senate for its advice and consent later that year. Now, it's our \nturn. Today, the Senate can and should join in this historic endeavor \nto rid the world of chemical weapons. We can bestow a precious gift on \ngenerations to come by freeing the world of an entire class of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  The chemical weapons treaty bans the development, production, \nstockpiling, and use of toxic chemicals as weapons. Previous agreements \nhave merely limited weapons of mass destruction. But the Chemical \nWeapons Convention sets out to eliminate them from the face of the \nearth.\n  The United States has already taken many steps unilaterally to \nimplement a ban of our own. As long ago as 1968, this country ordered a \nmoratorium on chemical weapons production.\n  When President Bush signed the treaty on behalf of the United States, \nhe also ordered the unilateral destruction of the U.S. stockpile of \nthese weapons. Regardless of the treaty, the United States is \ndestroying its chemical weapon stockpile.\n  Today culminates many years of work and compromise. The Senate has \nheld 17 hearings on the convention. Every issue has been exhaustively \nanalyzed. The result is the shoot-out that the leadership has arranged \ntoday on this series of killer amendments.\n  Bipartisan negotiations have achieved agreement on 28 amendments to \nthe treaty, none of which go to the heart of the treaty and many of \nwhich help to clarify it.\n  But five major issues have not yet been settled. The five amendments, \non which we are voting today, seek to settle differences of opinion the \nwrong way. They are killer amendments. I hope the Senate will note \n``no'' on all of them. If any of them passes, it will doom our \nparticipation in the treaty, and relegate us to the company of outlaw \nregimes like North Korea and Libya, who also reject the treaty.\n  Two of the killer amendments condition our participation on whether \nother nations--Russia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and China--have already \nbecome participants. Essentially, they would hand over U.S. security \ndecisions to those nations.\n  A third killer amendment arbitrarily excludes all representatives \nfrom certain other countries from participating in verification \ninspections. This amendment ignores the ability that the treaty already \ngives us to reject any inspectors we believe are not trustworthy.\n  A fourth killer amendment omits and alters other key parts of the \ntreaty that deal with the export of certain materials. Its proponents \nfear that rogue nations may gain valuable technology from us.\n  Nothing in the convention requires the United States to weaken its \nexport controls. Experts in the chemical industry, trade organizations, \nand government officials have worked to ensure that nothing in the \ntreaty threatens our technology and industrial power.\n  The fifth killer amendment places an unrealistically high standard of \nverification on the treaty. It requires the treaty verification \nprocedures to accomplish the impossible, by being able to detect small, \nnot militarily significant, amounts of dangerous chemical meterials.\n  No international agreement can effectively police small amounts of \nraw materials that might possibly be used in chemical weapons \nproduction. Every effort is being made and will be made to make the \ndetection procedures as effective as possible. It is hypocritical for \nopponents to attempt to scuttle this treaty because they feel it does \nnot go far enough.\n  The overwhelming majority of past and present foreign policy \nofficials, military leaders, large and small businesses, Fortune 500 \ncompanies, Nobel laureates, veterans organizations, religious groups, \nenvironmentalists and public interest groups are united in their strong \nsupport of the convention. It is a practical international agreement \nwith practical benefits for the United States, and the United States \nshould be a part of it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 5 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, unless there is someone in opposition, I \nyield as much time of the remaining time that my colleague from \nPennsylvania would like to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to reserve 30 seconds of \nwhatever my time is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding the \ntime.\n  Mr. President, on the pending issue, having studied the conditions as \nto what is sought here by way of preliminary action by Russia before \nratification should occur by the United States, it is my strong view \nthat we really ought not to play Gaston and Alphonse with the Russians \nto require them, as article C does, for Russia to deposit their \nratification before the United States ratifies.\n  I think that that sets up a condition which is just not reasonable. \nIf they took the same position, as Alphonse and Gaston, no one would \never enter the door.\n  With respect to the other conditions which are set forth here, all of \nthe substantive matters would be superseded by the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, that the requirements set forth in this treaty would impose \nmore obligations on Russia than are contained in these instruments.\n  And under instrument A, where it is talked about, an agreement \nbetween the United States and Russia, that was never formalized into an \nagreement because all terms were never agreed to by the parties, so \nthat this is not a condition which adds any measure of safety to the \nUnited States since all of the requirements imposed on Russia in these \ncollateral arrangements would be superseded and more stringent \nrequirements would be added by the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues on both sides for what I \nbelieve has been a very, very constructive debate in the highest \ntradition of the U.S. Senate. I compliment the distinguished chairman \nof this committee, Senator Helms, for his determination.\n  And it is noted that some 28 of the 33 conditions have been agreed \nto. Even beyond those conditions, the President today, in writing to \nthe distinguished majority leader, has articulated further safeguards \nwhich would be present so that in sum total we have an agreement which, \nwhile not perfect, advances the interest of arms control.\n  In my capacity as the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, I \nhave chaired hearings on the issue of the gulf war syndrome where there \nis evidence that our veterans in the gulf were damaged by chemical \nsubstances, not conclusively, but that is the indication, and that had \nsuch a treaty been in effect, again, not conclusive, but a strong \nindication, that our troops might have been saved to some extent.\n  And certainly if we intend to take a firm stand on a moral plane, the \nUnited States has to be a part of this covenant to try to reduce \nchemical weapons. And this treaty goes a substantial way.\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\n  And the search and seizure provisions are adequate to protect \nconstitutional rights, a field I have had substantial experience with \nas a district attorney, so that there will have to be a criminal \nstandard of probable cause.\n  Taken as a whole, with the additions by the President today--even \nthough it had been made a part of the Record, I ask unanimous consent \nthat, following my comments, the President's letter to Senator Lott be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. All factors considered, this is a treaty which ought to \nreceive Senate ratification.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: During Senate ratification proceedings on \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), concerns have been \n     raised over Article X, which provides for certain types of \n     defensive assistance in the event that a State that has \n     joined the treaty and renounced any chemical weapons (CW) \n     capability is threatened with or suffers a chemical weapons \n     attack, and Article XI, which encourages free trade in non-\n     prohibited chemicals among states that adhere to the CWC. \n     Some have suggested that these Articles could result in the \n     CWC promoting, rather than stemming, CW proliferation despite \n     States Parties' general obligation under Article I ``never \n     under any circumstances . . . to assist, encourage or induce, \n     in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a \n     State Party under this Convention.''\n       To respond to these concerns, the Administration has worked \n     closely with the Senate to develop conditions relating to \n     both Articles that have now been incorporated in the \n     resolution of ratification (Agreed Conditions #7 and 15). \n     These two conditions would substantially reinforce and \n     strengthen the treaty by:\n       Prohibiting the United States under Article X from (a) \n     providing the CWC organization with funds that could be used \n     for chemical weapons defense assistance to other States \n     Parties; and (b) giving certain states that might join the \n     treaty any assistance other than medical antidotes and \n     treatment.\n       Requiring the President to (a) certify that the CWC will \n     not weaken the export controls established by the Australia \n     Group and that each member of the Group intends to maintain \n     such controls; (b) block any attempt within the Group to \n     adopt a contrary position; and (c) report annually as to \n     whether Australia Group controls remain effective.\n       With respect to the latter condition, I am pleased to \n     inform you that we have now received official confirmations \n     from the highest diplomatic levels in each of the 30 \n     Australia Group nations that they agree that the Group's \n     export control and nonproliferation measures are compatible \n     with the CWC and that they are committed to maintain such \n     controls in the future.\n       While supporting these guarantees and safeguards, you \n     expressed the concern on Sunday that nations might still try \n     to use Article X or XI to take proscribed actions that could \n     undercut U.S. national security interests, notwithstanding \n     the best efforts of U.S. diplomacy to prevent such actions. I \n     am, therefore, prepared to provide the following specific \n     assurance related to these two Articles:\n       In the event that a State Party or States Parties to the \n     Convention act contrary to the obligations under Article I \n     by:\n       (A) using Article X to justify providing defensive CW \n     equipment, material or information to another State Party \n     that could result in U.S. chemical protective equipment being \n     compromised so that U.S. warfighting capabilities in a CW \n     environment are significantly degraded;\n       (B) using Article XI to justify chemical transfers that \n     would make it impossible for me to make the annual \n     certification that the Australia Group remains a viable and \n     effective mechanism for controlling CW proliferation; or\n       (C) carrying out transfers or exchanges under either \n     Article X or XI which jeopardize U.S. national security by \n     promoting CW proliferation:\n       I would, consistent with Article XVI of the CWC, regard \n     such actions as extraordinary events that have jeopardized \n     the supreme interests of the United States and therefore, in \n     consultation with the Congress, be prepared to withdraw from \n     the treaty.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me just take the minute to say the \nfollowing: If you do not like this treaty and you are not for it, vote \nagainst it. If you think this treaty makes sense, vote for my \namendment, because if this treaty contains this provision, it is dead. \nThis is a so-called killer amendment.\n  So those of you who have concluded you are not going to vote in the \nfinal analysis for this treaty, vote no. Those of you who have decided \nyou want to vote for this treaty--to cut through it all--vote yes. I \nmean, it really is that basic, because if my motion fails to strike, \nthis treaty is dead.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, if my colleague from North \nCarolina is prepared to yield back his time. I am prepared to vote.\n  Mr. HELMS. The yeas and nays have been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. All time \nhas expired.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 48 offered by the \nSenator from Delaware. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 66, nays 34, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 47 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--66\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith Gordon H\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith Bob\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 48) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is reserved for the Senator \nfrom Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes remaining on the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I will be \nvery brief. Mr. President, I appreciate efforts of the Senator from \nUtah to get order, and that is no more than I could expect for somebody \nthat bears certain similarities to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Earlier, the distinguished Senator from Delaware read a long list of \nstaff and Senators and others who deserve praise for getting us as far \nas we are. The name of the distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nnotably absent, and I think that those who support the CWC owe a debt \nof gratitude to the Senator from Delaware. In the customary practice, \nhe left his own name off, but if I might add his name to the record and \nput it in.\n  Mr. President, I am, as you know, a supporter of the CWC. Again, I \ncompliment what we have done. As in the test ban treaty, when countries \nwere not coming forward, the United States unilaterally banned their \nown tests and then other countries joined us--not every country that \nhas nuclear capability, but other countries did join us--and we brought \nthe pressure forward for a test ban treaty.\n  The United States took an initiative with chemical weapons. We banned \nour own use, unilaterally. When we did that, other countries joined us. \nNot all countries, but other countries, most countries, joined us.\n  Now if we vote to advise and consent on this treaty we will have \npressure, the pressure of the most powerful Nation on Earth, joined by \nall these other countries, pressure on the few rogue countries who have \nnot done that. I say that, Mr. President, because there is one other \nweapon, a weapon that kills\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\nand maims far more people than chemical weapons. That is the weapon of \nantipersonnel landmines. There are 100 million landmines in over 65 \ncountries today. As one person told me, in their country, they clear \nthese landmines an arm and a leg at a time. Every 22 minutes an \ninnocent civilian--almost always a civilian--is killed or injured by an \nantipersonnel landmine. The United States should now do the same thing \nthey did.\n  The United States should do the same thing we did with chemical \nweapons. We should move unilaterally, ban our own use, ban our own \nexport, ban our own production of antipersonnel landmines, expand on \nthe Leahy legislation already passed by the House and Senate. Do that \nand then join with like-minded nations. There are tens of like-minded \nnations that have already done that.\n  Join with them, agree, together, that this is what we will do. It \nwill not be every nation. It will not be some of the nations most \nneeding to do this like Russia and China, but we will have the same \nmoral suasion that we have with the chemical weapons convention. We can \ndo it with chemical weapons and should. Now let us follow exactly the \nsame step, join with the Canadians and others and do it with \nantipersonnel landmines. This country is capable of it. It would be a \nmoral step. It would be a dramatic step that would help the innocent \ncivilians who die from that.\n  I withhold the balance of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we all know full well that this \nadministration has already testified that the CWC is ``effectively \nverifiable.'' The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, \nJohn Holum, testified on March 22, 1994, that ``the treaty is \neffectively verifiable'' and that the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense \nfor Policy, Walter Slocombe, made similar claims on May 13, 1994. \nHowever, just because administration officials have declared the CWC to \nbe ``effectively verifiable'' does not make it so.\n  Indeed, by making such claims the Clinton administration has done \ngreat violence to the standard of ``effective verification'' developed \nand refined by the Reagan and Bush administrations as a key criteria \nfor arms control treaties. The definition of ``effective verification'' \nwas first offered to the Foreign Relations Committee by Ambassador Paul \nNitze during hearings on the INF Treaty in 1988 and subsequently \nfurther refined on January 24, 1989, by ACDA's Director, Maj. Gen. \nWilliam Burns, and again in January 1992 by Secretary of State James \nBaker. The components of effective verification, as defined during \ntestimony, are: (1) a ``high level of assurance'' in the intelligence \ncommunity's ability to detect (2) a ``militarily significant'' \nviolation in (3) a ``timely fashion.'' That definition is the one used \nin this condition.\n  This yardstick of ``effective verification'' has been the standard \nagainst which every arms control treaty for the last decade has been \nmeasured. It should be the standard against which the CWC is measured \nas well.\n  For any arms control treaty to be effective it must be verifiable. \nWhen Vice President George Bush put forward the first U.S.-sponsored \ntext for the CWC, he told negotiators in Geneva on April 18, 1984, \nthat:\n\n       For a chemical weapons ban to work, each party must have \n     confidence that the other parties are abiding by it. . . . No \n     sensible government enters into those international contracts \n     known as treaties unless it can ascertain--or verify--that it \n     is getting what it contracted for.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  In my view, this standard cannot be met by the CWC. On March 1, 1989, \nthen-Director of Central Intelligence [DCI] William Webster stated that \nmonitoring the CWC ``is going to be costly and difficult, and, \npresently, the level of confidence is quite low.'' On January 24, 1989, \nDirector Burns noted that ``verification of any chemical ban is going \nto be extremely difficult.'' ACDA's section 37 report on the CWC, \nsubmitted on March 18, 1994, states that the CWC's verification \nprovisions, together with National Technical Means [NTM], ``are \ninsufficient to detect, with a high degree of confidence, all \nactivities prohibited under the Convention.'' Then-DCI Woolsey \ntestified on June 23, 1994 that ``I cannot state that we have high \nconfidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a \nsmall scale.''\n\n  Most significantly, declassified portions from the August 1993 NIE \nnote:\n\n       The capability of the intelligence community to monitor \n     compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention is severely \n     limited and likely to remain so for the rest of the decade. \n     They key provision of the monitoring regime--challenge \n     inspections at undeclared sites--can be thwarted by a nation \n     determined to preserve a small, secret program using the \n     delays and managed access rules allowed by the Convention.\n\n  With respect to military significance, General Shalikashvilli \ntestified on August 11, 1994 that:\n\n       In certain limited circumstances, even one ton of chemical \n     agent may have a military impact . . . With such variables in \n     scale of target and impact of chemical weapons, the United \n     States should be resolute that the 1 ton limit set by the \n     Convention will be our guide.\n\n  The bottom line is that a stockpile of 1 ton of chemical agent can \nprove of military significance. Unclassified portions of the NIE on \nU.S. monitoring capabilities indicate that it is unlikely that the \nUnited States will be able to detect or address violations in a timely \nfashion, if at all, when they occur on a small scale. And yet, even \nsmall-scale diversions of chemicals to chemical weapons production are \ncapable, over time, of yielding a stockpile far in excess of a single \nton. Moreover, few countries, if any, are engaging in much more than \nsmall-scale production of chemical agent. For example, according to \ntoday's Washington Times, Russia may produce its new nerve agents at a \npilot plant in quantities of only 55 to 110 tons annually.\n  In other words, the intelligence community has low confidence in its \nability to detect in a timely fashion the covert production of chemical \nweapons which could produce militarily significant quantities. We \nshould not cheapen the norm of effective verifiability by claiming that \nthe CWC meets this standard--for it patently does not.\n  In conclusion, verification of the CWC is plagued by the fact that \ntoo many chemicals are dual-use in nature. Chemicals used to make pen \nink can be used to make deadly agent. It is impossible to monitor every \nsoap, detergent, cosmetic, electronics, varnish, paint, pharmaceutical, \nand chemical plant around the world to ensure that they are not \nproducing chemical weapons, or that toxic chemicals are not being \ndiverted to the production of weapons elsewhere. Countries such as \nRussia are well aware that if they ratify the CWC, they can cheat with \nimpunity. Indeed, on May 6, 1996 the Defense Intelligence Agency \ninformed the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nthat Russia intends to maintain the capability to produce chemical \nweapons, regardless of whether or not it ratifies the CWC.\n\n  The Senate, therefore, should not agree to this treaty until U.S. \nintelligence capabilities have caught up with President Clinton's \nWilsonian idealism.\n  Finally, I will say a word or two about the counter-arguments we have \nheard on this condition. Patently ignoring the conclusions of the Joint \nChiefs, the administration has claimed that the right standard for \ndetecting violations is not 1 metric ton, but a ``large-scale, \nsystematic effort by a potential adversary to equip its armed forces \nwith a militarily significant chemical warfare capability * * *'' It is \nabsurd to say that if the intelligence community has high confidence in \nits ability to detect ``any large-scale, systematic effort by a \npotential adversary to equip its armed forces with a military \nsignificant chemical warfare capability * * *'' the CWC is effectively \nverifiable.\n  I have no doubt that it would be difficult to conceal the existence \nof a program the scope and size of the former Soviet Union's for \nexample. But not one of the countries that currently envisions a need \nfor chemical weapons intends to wage World War III and conquer Western \nEurope. Not one.\n  Again, let me reiterate just how ridiculous this argument is. \nNobody--not Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, India, Pakistan, \nEgypt, or North Korea--is engaged in a large scale effort.\n  Indeed, such a certification is inherently contradictory since a \ncountry desirous of developing a militarily significant stockpile of \nchemical agent\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\nneed not engage in a large-scale, systematic effort. The Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvilli, testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee on August 11, 1994, that:\n\n       Even one ton of chemical agent may have a military impact . \n     . . With such variables in scale of target and impact of \n     chemical weapons, the United States should be resolute that \n     the 1 ton limit set by the Convention will be our guide.\n\n  In other words, the production of 1 militarily significant ton of \nagent does not require a large-scale program. To knock-out every key \nlogistical node in Saudi Arabia, Saddam Hussein needs only a handful of \nSCUD's with chemical warheads. He does not need an elite force of \ninfantry trained in chemical-environment combat.\n  Accordingly, the intelligence community's confidence in its ability \nto detect the annual production of 1 metric ton in a timely fashion is \nthe benchmark question by which the Senate should assess the \nverifiability of the CWC. I urge the Senate to reject this motion to \nstrike and to uphold President Reagan's standard of effective \nverifiability.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Senator Shelby of Alabama be recognized \nnext for 10 minutes. Does the Senator have somebody?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I could ask a parliamentary inquiry. A \nlot of our colleagues are looking to determine when the final vote will \ntake place. It is my understanding that the Senator from Delaware has \nthe option to move to strike three more conditions--one relating to \nintelligence verification, one relating to inspectors, and one relating \nto articles X and XI. On each of those motions of the Senator from \nDelaware, there is an hour reserved, equally divided, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The attempt is being made, as we speak, to reduce the time \non those amendments. I respectfully suggest that on the next amendment \nthat I am going to move--my intention was to move to strike the \nintelligence provision--or verification, I should say, No. 33, and that \ninstead of an hour equally divided on that amendment, I respectfully \nsuggest we have 20 minutes equally divided on that amendment. Is that \nall right with the Senator?\n  Mr. HELMS. That will be fine, from this point. I will consume a few \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. In other words, the Senator has already spoken on the \nintelligence issue. The time he has spoken on it would be taken out of \nthe 10 minutes that we are about to agree to on the amendment I have \nnot yet sent to the desk. The Senator was under the impression I \nalready sent the amendment to strike.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 49\n\n      (Purpose: To strike condition No. 33, relating to effective \n                             verification)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 49.\n       Beginning on page 65, strike line 25 and all that follows \n     through line 3 of page 67.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nconsumed by the Senator from North Carolina in his previous speech be \ndeducted from the 10 minutes of time allotted to his side, and that 10 \nminutes remain on the side of the Senator from Delaware on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HELMS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 20 \nminutes on this amendment equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on this amendment, of my 10 minutes, I will \nyield 7 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island. But prior to doing \nthat, let me say briefly what this amendment does.\n  This amendment strikes a condition in the treaty that sets a \nverification standard that, if it were in the treaty, would not be able \nto be met; therefore, it would kill the treaty. I will not speak more \nat this time.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, just a moment. I must leave the Chamber for \na few minutes. After the Senator from Rhode Island has concluded, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Alabama be recognized to \nconsume our 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I strongly support the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, a treaty which serves our national security interests in a \nnumber of ways. U.S. ratification would help set an international \nstandard that would put political pressure on outlaw nations to rid \nthemselves of chemical arsenals. This treaty will also give our \nintelligence community valuable new tools to combat illicit production \nof deadly chemicals, even among nations that do not ratify the \nconvention.\n  Mr. President, ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention by the \nSenate this evening would continue our Nation's proud tradition of \nleadership in the field of international security. We took the lead in \nthe formation of NATO, on the containment of communism, and on the \ndefeat of Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf. This evening, we can \nagain assert our irreplaceable leadership by participating in an effort \nto ban chemical weapons around the world.\n  Mr. President, condition No. 33, which we are now debating, must be \nstricken in order for the United States to participate in the CWC. \nCondition No. 33 requires that the President--these are the conditions \nof condition No. 33--the President of the United States must certify \nwith ``a high degree of confidence'' that our intelligence community \ncan detect ``militarily significant'' violations of the convention.\n  Now, Mr. President, what does ``militarily significant'' mean? It is \ndefined as 1 metric ton or more of these chemical weapons.\n  Mr. President, this condition is simply impossible to achieve. This \ncondition would bar the U.S. participation in the CWC forever. We must \nunderstand that the convention seeks to ban chemical weapons. These \nweapons, by their very inherent composition, are extremely difficult to \ndetect in relatively small quantities, such as a ton. This truth has \nbeen known from the beginning, and no one, Mr. President, has alleged \nthat the CWC will eliminate chemical weapons from the face of the \nEarth.\n  If an individual wants to build a chemical weapon somewhere in a \nsmall shack or a cave in some remote area of the world, he or she will \nalways be able to do so, regardless of the outcome of this vote. No \ntreaty, no matter how it is written, will ever be able to stop such an \noccurrence. Our inability to verify fully the CWC is not a result of \nany flaws in the convention. It is due to the innate difficulty in \nmonitoring chemical weapons and their components.\n  Mr. President, I also question the definition of ``militarily \nsignificant quantity,'' as being 1 metric ton or more of chemical \nweapons agent. Although 1 metric ton can certainly do a lot of damage, \nparticularly in a terrorist attack, I will defer to military experts to \nconsider what is military significant. In testimony to the Senate, Gen. \nJohn Shalikashvili stated that tonnage is not the only factor to \nconsider in assessing the military capacity of these weapons. To \ntransform an illicit chemical stockpile into something militarily \nuseful, an adversary must have vast supplies of these weapons, and he \nmust have an infrastructure for handling them and must have troops \ntrained in the use of these weapons.\n  It is these more complex activities--the training of the troops, for \nexample--that the Chemical Weapons Convention, together with our \nintelligence resources, will be able to verify. As Gen. Brent Scowcroft \nhas testified to the Foreign Relations Committee, under the CWC, it \nwill no longer be possible for a country to buy a few pounds of these   \nchemicals from \n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\nvarious sources around the world to amass an abnormal supply of \nchemicals. Our intelligence community has, in fact, indicated on a \nnumber of occasions that this convention will provide another tool to \nthe U.S. inventory of ways to stem worldwide expansion of chemical \nweapons capabilities. In brief, the Chemical Weapons Convention will \nsupplement--it will not replace, but it will add to--ongoing efforts to \nmonitor chemical weapons production worldwide.\n  Now, critics of this treaty claim it is unverifiable, that we will \nnot be able to catch adversaries abroad who cheat. But they also allege \nthat the CWC's verification regime, while too weak to catch those \ncheaters abroad, is too intrusive for American industry. In other \nwords, it won't let us find anything abroad, but it is too intrusive \nfor other nations as far as inspection in the United States. They can't \nhave it both ways.\n  The fact is that the Chemical Weapons Convention's verification \ntools--in other words, how to determine whether there are weapons in \nother countries--go beyond those of other arms control treaties that we \nhave approved in the Senate in the past. No treaty will ever be able to \nverify totally a ban on chemical weapons. Condition No. 33 is \nimpossible to meet. The condition that is in this, which we are seeking \nto strike, is an impossible condition to meet. It serves no purpose \nother than to prevent U.S. participation in the Chemical Weapons \nConvention treaty. So I urge my colleagues to support the motion to \nstrike this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of \nverification, and in opposition to the motion to strike condition No. \n33 contained in the resolution of ratification, relating to effective \nverification.\n  I have a number of serious concerns with respect to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, however, I have a \nparticular responsibility to ensure that any treaty ratified by this \nbody can be effectively verified by the intelligence community.\n  If it cannot be verified, the CWC could become the means by which CWC \nmember states, such as China and Iran, expand and enhance--rather than \nrenounce--their CW capabilities.\n  In negotiating the INF Treaty, ratified in 1988, President Reagan set \nforth an eminently reasonable standard to guide the negotiation and \nimplementation of arms control agreements. ``Trust,'' he said, ``but \nverify.''\n  But I am afraid that the critical, second part of President Reagan's \nformula seems to have been forgotten with respect to this treaty. The \nCWC, and especially the verification regime, is based on the triumph of \nhope and trust over experience and history.\n  In its efforts to obtain ratification, the administration has--if I \nmay borrow a phrase from a former vice-chairman of the committee, \nSenator Moynihan--``defined verification down.''\n  Condition No. 33 to the resolution of ratification seeks to correct \nthat problem.\n  It conditions deposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification on a \nPresidential certification to Congress that the treaty is effectively \nverifiable.\n  This term, as used in the resolution, contains the following \nelements, based on the traditional definition of ``effective \nverification'':\n  A ``high degree of confidence'' in our ability to detect,\n  ``Militarily significant violations''--meaning one metric ton or more \nof chemical agent--\n  ``In a timely fashion,''--meaning detection within 1 year--and\n  Detection of ``patterns of marginal violation over time.''\n  Effective verification is ultimately a political judgment that must \nbe made by the President and his national security advisors. However, a \nkey input to this decision is the judgement of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  It is currently impossible to reconcile the above definition of \n``effective verification'' with the intelligence community's own \nstatements over the past 4 years, which is why condition 33 calls for a \nnew Presidential certification.,\n  I would like to briefly restate the intelligence community's key \nconclusions as to the verifiability of the CWC, as set forth in \nrecently declassified material from the National Intelligence Estimate \nof August 1993:\n\n       The capability of the Intelligence Community to monitor \n     compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is \n     severely limited and is likely to remain so for the rest of \n     the decade.\n\n  Our intelligence community is the most capable in the world today. It \nenjoys extensive resources, and employs an impressive variety of assets \nto collect information affecting our national security.\n  Yet with all of the sophisticated assets at our disposal, we cannot \nbe confident of verifying this treaty.\n  And some of the most promising new intelligence methods which might \nhave improved this score over the last 4 years, have been significantly \nunderfunded by this administration.\n  We should look to the certification required by condition 33 as an \nopportunity for the President to tell us of his plans to invest in \nimprovements to our technical collection capabilities to enable \neffective verification.\n  Therefore I strongly support condition 33 of the resolution of \nratification, and oppose the motion to strike.\n  While most will acknowledge that we do not have the technical \nintelligence capabilities currently in place to provide effective \nverification, the proponents of the treaty place great stock in the \ncontribution of the verification mechanisms contained in the treaty.\n  For example, the creation of the Organization for the Prohibition of \nChemical Weapons [OPCW], and the ability of OPCW inspectors to carry \nout challenge inspections of suspected violations, are cited as \nevidence for a mechanism of effective verification.\n  Yet in an unclassified excerpt from the 1993 NIE on verification, the \nintelligence community states that:\n\n       The key provision of the monitoring regime--challenge \n     inspections at undeclared sites--can be thwarted by a nation \n     determined to preserve a small, secret program by using the \n     delays and managed access rules allowed by the convention.\n\n  Those, Mr. President, are not my words. Those are the words of the \nintelligence community describing its ability to monitor compliance \nwith the treaty before us.\n  I should point out to my colleagues, in light of the fact that the \nNational Intelligence Estimate from which I have quoted is dated August \n1993, that the Acting Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, \nand other intelligence officials have confirmed on numerous occasions \nthat the key judgments cited above are unchanged.\n  In an open hearing on February 5 of this year, I asked George Tenet, \nthe acting Director of Central Intelligence, about the verifiability of \nthe CWC. Our discussion went, in part, as follows:\n  Acting Director Tenet said: ``We can never guarantee that a power \nthat signs up to this agreement won't cheat. These . . . chemical and \nbiological developments are small, they are easily hidden. They are not \nlike big nuclear developments that have big signatures that everybody \nunderstands.''\n  I replied: ``In other words, it will be fairly easy to cheat some, \nwouldn't it?''\n  Acting Director Tenet responded: ``It will be easy to cheat, Mr. \nChairman.''\n  Mr. President, the treaty before us today is deficient in many \nrespects: both in what it does, and in what it fails to do.\n  As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I must therefore \nconclude that the greatest flaw with the CWC is that, absent a \ncertification of effective verification, we cannot even know if it is \ndoing what it is supposed to be doing, and we cannot know the extent to \nwhich it is failing to do what it should do: This treaty is \nunverifiable.\n  Therefore, I support condition No. 33, and oppose the motion to \nstrike.\n  If I have any time left, I yield it to the distinguished Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to strike condition \n33, relating to effective verification.\n  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I believe \nI have a responsibility to ensure that this treaty can be effectively \nverified by the intelligence community.\n\n[[Page S3620]]\n\n  If the CWC cannot be verified to ensure that it will, in fact, \neliminate the scourge of chemical weapons, then what is the point of \nratifying it?\n  In fact, the CWC may well make things worse, not better, Some \nsignatory countries like China and Iran will use the technology-sharing \nprovisions of titles X and XI, combined with the cloak of international \nrespectability they gain by joining the CWC, to advance their CW \nprograms and exports.\n  Condition 33 of the resolution of ratification seeks to address the \nverifiability problem, by requiring the President to certify to the \nCongress that the CWC is effectively verifiable before submitting the \nU.S. instrument of ratification.\n  Mr. President, we have all heard what the intelligence community said \nabout the verifiability of the CWC in its National Intelligence \nEstimate of August 1993, but I think this judgment is worth repeating:\n\n       The capability of the Intelligence Community to monitor \n     compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is \n     severely limited and likely to remain so for the rest of this \n     decade.\n\n  If that judgment has changed, the President should be able to provide \nthe necessary certification. But as we well know, and as the Acting \nDirector of the CIA George Tenet has confirmed on several occasions, \nthat judgment has not changed. With all the assets at our disposal, the \nintelligence community still cannot verify compliance with this treaty.\n  The Senate has already discussed the classified aspects of our \nintelligence and verification capabilities in considerable detail in \nclosed session, and I cannot add anything to that debate now.\n  What I would like to do, is provide an example of the way in which a \ndetermined proliferator can evade, and deflect, what is perhaps the \nmost extensive scrutiny ever imposed on an unoccupied nation in \npeacetime. I am referring, of course, to Iraq.\n  Iraq is exhibit A for a number of propositions. First, Iraq is the \nvery model of a rogue state. It is a country that has not only \ndeveloped chemical and biological weapons [CBW], and come within a \nhair's breadth of producing a nuclear device, but has actually used \nchemical weapons against Iran, and against its own citizens.\n  Second, as a nonsignatory to the CWC, Iraq is an example of those \ncountries that will not be constrained by the CWC, and will proceed \napace with the production of chemical weapons.\n  Third, and this is the point I wish to focus on, Iraq is the most \ncurrent example of the effectiveness--or the lack thereof--of even the \nmost intrusive international monitoring.\n  Treaty supporters point to the Organization for the Prohibition of \nChemical Weapons [OPCW]--and especially the ability of OPCW inspectors \nto carry out challenger inspections of suspected violations--as a means \nof effective verification.\n  Yet the intelligence community concludes, in an unclassified excerpt \nfrom the 1993 NIE, that:\n\n       The key provision of the monitoring regime--challenge \n     inspections at undeclared sites--can be thwarted by a nation \n     determined to preserve a small, secret program by using the \n     delays and managed access rules allowed by the convention.\n\n  Acting CIA Director Tenet reiterated that judgment in a letter to \nSenator Kyl, dated March 26, 1997.\n  In the 6 years since the end of the Persian Gulf war, weapons \ninspectors from the U.N. Special Commission [UNSCOM] have combed Iraq \nin search of nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile production and \nstorage sites--inspectors armed with powers far greater than those of \nOPCW inspectors, I might add.\n  Despite this extraordinary level of scrutiny, Iraq is believed to \nretain: chemical weapon precursors and production equipment, and \npossibly large quantities of deadly VX agent and munitions; BW \ncultures, production equipment, agent and weapons. These stocks can be \nused to create a large stockpile in a matter of days; and an \noperational SCUD missile capability, including support vehicles, \nlaunchers, fuel, operational missiles, and, most alarming of all, \npossible chemical or biological warheads.\n  Last, Iraq retains nuclear weapons blueprints, machine-tools, and \nknow-how; is believed to be continuing its nuclear weapons design work; \nand probably has the ability to create a nuclear weapon--if it obtains \nfissile materials--with very little warning.\n  Mr. President, I am not reciting this information in order to \ncriticize UNSCOM. I commend Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, and the dedicated \nUNSCOM inspectors, for their persistence in the face of determined \nIraqi resistance and intimidation.\n  But if these are the results of 6 years of international monitoring \nof Iraq--a pariah country, defeated in war, and subjected to massive \ninvasions of its national sovereignty--then I wonder what the OPCW \ninspectors, with their far more limited powers, can realistically hope \nto accomplish in other countries?\n  As a final note, I should remind my colleagues that before the gulf \nwar, Iraq was a member in good standing of the International Atomic \nEnergy Commission, or IAEA, subject to all the usual IAEA inspections \nand safeguards.\n  Yet Saddam Hussein was within months of having a nuclear weapons \ncapability on August 2, 1990, when he invaded Kuwait. Had Saddam waited \nuntil he had a nuclear device, Kuwait might yet be the 19th province of \nIraq--and tens of thousands of people, including thousands of American \nsoldiers, might have died.\n  Mr. President, I believe that our experience with Iraq demonstrates \nthe intractable problems posed by the verification of the CWC. \nSupporters of the treaty say, ``But we have learned from our experience \nwith Iraq, and we will do better next time.'' I cannot join them in \nthat optimistic conclusion.\n  If the President of the United States cannot certify that this treaty \ncan be effectively verified, as defined in condition 33, then the \nSenate should not ratify this treaty.\n  I oppose the motion to strike condition 33.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of striking \ncondition 33 from the resolution of ratification of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. Condition 33 would bar the United States from \nratifying the convention until the President can certify with high \nconfidence that we have the capability to detect, within 1 year of a \nviolation, the illicit production or storage of a single metric ton of \nchemical agent. As the authors of this condition fully realize, this \nstandard is unattainable and would effectively bar the United States \nfrom participation in the CWC forever.\n  Mr. President, I do not come to the floor as the vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee to say to my colleagues that this treaty is \nabsolutely verifiable. The distinguished chairman of the committee \nindicated that Mr. Tenet, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, said \nit will be difficult to verify and quoted him as saying it would be \neasy to cheat. What he did not do, regrettably, is go on with the \nfollow-on quote. The next sentence in his answer was, ``But, in the \nabsence of the tools the convention gives us, it will be much harder \nfor us to apprise you''--meaning the committee--``and apprise the \nmilitary and policymakers of where we think we are in the world with \nregard to these developments.''\n  Let me be clear. The United States has made a decision that we are \ngoing to destroy our chemical weapons and try to lead the world in the \nelimination of chemical weapons. That is what this policy is all about. \nWe didn't have this treaty presented to us. We made a conscious \ndecision to eliminate our own chemical weapons and then try to develop \na regimen that enables us to identify and detect as much as possible. \nOur Director of Central Intelligence, as well as our military, has \nindicated to us that this treaty will increase the identification that \nwe are able to do and increase the likelihood that we will be able to \nend up with the result being that we have no chemical weapons in any \nmilitary arsenal on this planet.\n  No treaty is absolutely verifiable. Condition 33 make verification \nmore difficult by setting a level of identification, we do not need to \nbenefit from the convention. Far more important to our security are the \nimprovements to our identification efforts we stand to gain under the \nCWC.\n  Verification is a political decision made by policymakers. To make \nthis\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\ndecision, our intelligence agencies will need to provide evidence to \nsupport a conclusion made by policymakers. The benefits we will receive \nunder the CWC come from our increased ability to identify whether a \nnation is developing, producing, and storing chemical weapons. Under \nthe CWC's routine and challenge inspections, we will be better able to \nidentify the storage and destruction of declared chemical weapon \nstocks. We will also be better able to identify a nation's attempt to \ndevelop the infrastructure to handle chemical weapons and any military \ntraining in the use of these weapons.\n  U.S. intelligence officials have stated that the CWC will add to \ntheir monitoring tools to counter the chemical weapons threat. Data \ndeclarations will provide evidence of compliance or non-compliance, \nroutine inspections make it more difficult and costly to use legitimate \nfacilities to produce chemical weapons, and challenge inspections will \ngive the United States the opportunity to seek further indications and \nevidence under the CWC.\n  In addition, the CWC will help stymie chemical weapons development by \nnon-signatory, rogue nations by restricting trade in key precursor \nchemicals to non-parties. Acquisition efforts for chemicals, \ntechnology, and equipment by non-signatories will provide tip-offs to \npursue compliance concerns with parties who may be the source of the \nmaterials.\n  These are real benefits to our identification efforts that will help \nensure the safety of our troops and citizens. However, if we impose an \nimpossible standard of verification and fail to ratify the CWC, we will \nlose these benefits.\n  Further, condition 33 creates an arbitrary definition of what is a \n``militarily significant'' amount of chemical weapons. This condition \ndeems one metric ton of chemical weapons to be a threat to our \nmilitary. But General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, has testified that ``a militarily significant quantity of \nchemical weapons is situationally dependent.'' It depends on the \nterrain, the weather, the number of troops, the type of chemicals used, \nhow the chemicals are delivered, and the chemical weapons defensive \nsystem of the targeted forces. He stated that, ``The quantity is \ntotally scenario dependent, and it would be difficult to cite a \nspecific amount as militarily significant.''\n  During the Iran-Iraq war, both sides used tens of tons against each \nother without altering the course of the war. The Defense Department \nfound that it would take several hundred to a thousand tons to \nseriously disrupt U.S. logistics in a war; and the United States's own \nstockpile of chemical weapons, which we are committed to destroy with \nor without the CWC, is about 30 thousand tons. One metric ton of \nchemical weapons, while still posing a horrible threat under some \nconditions, in no way is a militarily significant threat to our \nnational security.\n  Without the CWC, chemical weapons production and stockpile on a small \nor grant scale will still be an acceptable practice. Under the CWC, not \nonly will this no longer be acceptable, but we will have additional \ntools in our arsenal to identify chemical weapons programs. Since we \nwill have to monitor this threat whether or not we join the CWC, our \nsecurity interests are improved under the treaty rather than without \nit.\n  This condition must be removed from the resolution if the United \nStates is to participate in the Chemical Weapons Convention. Therefore, \nMr. President, I support striking condition 33 from Executive \nResolution 75.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, I believe strongly that this \nparticular condition, regardless of how you feel about the treaty, sets \nan unrealistic level of requirement for verification, and under no \ncircumstances are we going to be able to verify a ton of chemical \nweapons under the evaluations of the military. We do not need to accept \nthis kind of arbitrary standard.\n  Mr. President, regardless of whether or not you are going to vote for \nor against this treaty in the end, I urge my colleagues to vote to \nstrike condition 33.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 1 minute on the time left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let's get this straight. Verification is \nabout whether or not we can know whether or not our security interests \nare going to be put in jeopardy. A useful chemical weapons capacity \nrequires a lot more than just whether or not you can produce illicit \nchemical weapons. It requires a delivery system, infrastructure, \nstorage, and use of chemical weapons. It includes defense preparations, \nextra security around the storage areas, and training and exercising of \ntroops who will use those weapons. It goes on and on.\n  The ability to put together a chemical weapons capability to go \nundetected that will diminish our security is not real.\n  I yield back the time and ask unanimous consent that we defer a vote \non this amendment at this moment, that we turn to my next motion to \nstrike, which will relate to inspectors, condition 31, that there be 10 \nminutes equally divided on condition 31, that vote on condition 33 and \non condition 31 be stacked after the conclusion of the debate on \ncondition 31, with 15 minutes on the first vote, 10 minutes on the \nsecond vote, and with 1 minute intervening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 50\n\n(Purpose: To strike condition no. 31, relating to the exercise of right \n                       to bar certain inspectors)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 50.\n       Beginning on page 63, strike line 21 and all that follows \n     through line 4 of page 65.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me also say for the benefit of my \ncolleagues that we are trying to accommodate schedules. I thank the \nSenators from Arizona and Georgia, who were running around trying to \nget their agreement. At the completion of the two rollcall votes--we \nare trying to get additional time on one amendment relating to articles \nX and XI, and we have an hour set aside for it now and we hope to \nreduce that time. At the conclusion of that vote we would then go to \nfinal passage, although there probably may be a few minutes intervening \nbecause each has some time left. That is the objective. Some are trying \nto catch planes and trains and the like.\n  Mr. President, let me suggest quickly what this does. The amendment \nthat I sent to the desk strikes a condition which unilaterally says at \nthe front end we will not allow any inspector from such states as \nChina, Iran, and Iraq, et cetera, if they are signatories to the \ntreaty. If they have deposited their instruments of ratification, now \nthey are in the deal. We are saying, if they are in, we will not allow \nany inspector from their countries to be any part of a team that would \ninspect U.S. facilities.\n  The intention is obvious, and it is laudable. The intention is to \nkeep the bad-guy inspectors out because we are worried that what they \nwould do is send over an intelligence officer as part of that \ninspection team, learn all secrets from us and take them back home. It \nis not likely that can happen anyway. But let's assume it did.\n  The intelligence community says this is a very bad idea. The reason \nit is a bad idea if we do that, Mr. President, is every other country \nwill issue a blanket rejection of any U.S. inspectors. We are the class \nof the field. You have heard all day--and in the closed session--my \ncolleagues expressing their concern about verification. The more we \nhave American inspectors involved, the more likely we are to be able to \ndetect wrongdoing because we are the class of the field. We don't want \nto be excluded across the board from being on any inspection team. So, \ntherefore, this is intended to do something good but is extremely \ncounterproductive. It is counterproductive, and the intelligence \ncommunity says so as well.\n  But beyond that, it is unnecessary. There is a provision. In the \ninterest of time--we were going to have an hour of debate; I was going \nto put all of this out to you--but in this treaty there is a provision \nnow that says the United States, or any other country, can at any time \nstrike an inspector. The way this works, as most of our colleagues\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\nknow, is when there is going to be a challenge inspection, or a routine \ninspection, there is a list of inspectors. They give the names. As few \nas 3 and as many as 15 inspectors are going to show up on the doorsteps \nof X, Y, Z company, and they list their names and their country. Guess \nwhat? Our intelligence community from the time those names are given--\nit is like a jury pool. The Presiding Officer was a Federal prosecutor. \nIt is like a grand jury. Every country submits inspectors that they \nwant participating. Their committee picks inspectors from each of the \ncountries. They sit in one town and one city. When an inspection comes \nup, they say ``You, you, you, and you, go and inspect.'' They have to \nsubmit those names. Our intelligence community, when that pool is \npicked, will do a background check on every one of those guys and \nwomen. They know their names. So they can, in fact, go out there and \nsay--we can say, or the intelligence community can say--``Look, he is \non that inspection group. Strike him. We don't want him.'' You can do \nthat. The only time we can't strike is when--I have a smart staff here. \nIn the late hours they think they are humorous.\n  You are fired.\n  [Laughter.]\n  I am only kidding. That is a joke; a little levity at this time.\n  As my distinguished friend on the Intelligence Committee, formerly of \nmy staff, wrote, ``They can't strike when they are on the plane.'' You \nhave to give 24 hours notice you don't want So and So in there.\n  So the point is you can already strike anybody. We do this in a \nblanket way. We knock the class of the field out of the inspection \nprocess. We don't want to do that. With all due respect, this is not a \nthoughtful amendment. This is counterproductive.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on the \nprevious amendment? If not, I would ask for the yeas and nays on the \nprevious amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I have any time left on this, I reserve \nit, and I will yield the floor now for my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, Senator Helms had intended to present these remarks, \nand he cannot be here right at this moment. Therefore, I am going to \nproceed to deliver his remarks and then also yield to the majority \nleader should he wish to make a remark or two about this condition.\n  If ratified, Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention would \nprovide inspectors from foreign countries unprecedented access to U.S. \nfacilities, both commercial and Government-related. Inspectors would be \npermitted to interview site personnel, inspect records, photograph \nonsite apparatus, take samples, record readings of plant equipment, and \nuse instruments to monitor processes. The risk that trade secrets or \nnational security secrets could be stolen during inspection is very \nhigh.\n  First, proprietary information is often the basis for a chemical \ncompany's competitive edge. Industrial espionage can enable a \ncompetitor to obtain at a minimal cost information that its originator \nacquired only through an enormous investment of time and money, thereby \nerasing the company's competitive advantage. For this reason, the theft \nof trade secrets can cripple even a giant company and can be fatal to a \nsmaller enterprise.\n  Second, because chemicals covered by the CWC are used in a variety of \naerospace activities, from the manufacture of advanced composites and \nceramics to additives for paints and fuels, dozens of defense \ncontractors are targeted for routine inspections under the CWC. That \nmeans that when we are talking about proprietary information, we may \nalso be talking about national security information.\n  A company such as Lockheed Martin, Courtalds Aerospace, Hercules, \nRaytheon, and the Hexcel Corp. will be forced to allow foreign \nnationals access to their facilities, employees, and records. Our \nnational laboratories further could be inspected under this treaty, as \nwill Government facilities.\n  Previous national trial inspections conducted in the United States in \npreparation for the CWC revealed that inspections under the treaty are \nan extremely dangerous threat to sensitive information. Soil and water \nsamples were collected in the vicinity of rocket propellant production \nfacilities on one such inspection. They were analyzed at the Lawrence \nLivermore National Laboratory. Using modern techniques, analysts were \nable to discern classified information about the formulation of the \nrocket propellant and the process used to make it.\n  Finally, Mr. President, China and others likely intend to use CWC \ninspections for espionage purposes. They should not be allowed to do \nthat. The officials of the preparatory commission for the Organization \nof the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the OPCW, have stated that all \nof the Chinese inspectors were directed to volunteer for the \norganization and that these inspectors have direct ties to China's \ndefense chemical warfare program. Accordingly, and the point of this \ncondition, the Senate should uphold this provision which would direct \nthe administration to exercise a United States treaty right--as the \nSenator from Delaware pointed out, we have this right under the \ntreaty--we are simply directing the President to exercise this right to \nbar inspectors from China, which has an active industrial espionage \nprogram and has violated United States nonproliferation laws, from \nentering the United States to engage in these inspections. In addition, \nit would prevent inspectors from countries which are hostile to the \nUnited States and are state sponsors of terrorism--Iran, Iraq, Syria, \nLibya, Sudan, North Korea, and Cuba--from participating in these \ninspections.\n  Mr. President, I do not think this is an unreasonable provision. \nThere is no downside to the provision, only the positive potential that \nfewer trade and national security secrets would be handed over to \ncountries that are openly hostile to the United States.\n  Therefore, I urge the Senate to reject the motion to strike.\n  At this time I yield the remaining time to the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire about how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have already stated my position. I do \nthink we should vote to ratify this convention, but I think we should \ndefeat this motion to strike. This is not a killer amendment. This is \nvery serious, where we are just saying that we should have the ability, \nthe President should have the ability, to bar these inspectors from \nthese countries that have violated U.S. nonproliferation laws. You are \ntalking about inspectors from so-called, as the Secretary of State has \ncalled them, ``rogue nations'' that want to come in here and get into \nfinding information that could help them to further contribute to \nproliferation.\n\n  So I urge the Senate on this motion to vote to defeat the motion to \nstrike. We should have the ability, we should as a matter of fact I \nthink require that we bar these inspectors from coming into this \ncountry when they are contributing to the problem all over the world. \nSo I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 30 seconds off my time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, two very quick points. The companies named \nby my distinguished friend, including Hercules, which is headquartered \nin my State, that are supposedly worried, they support this treaty. \nHercules supports this treaty. They are not worried about this being \ntrouble.\n  Second, this is not a killer, but it rips the heart out of our \ninspection regime, and I would not be objecting, I say to the majority \nleader, I would not be seeking to take it out if it gave the President \nthe option. It gives the President no option. It requires him--it\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\nrequires him--to ban. And what it does again, I say to my colleagues, \nit then says they will ban us. We have the class of the field doing the \ninspection. It is not a smart thing to do, in my humble opinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 49\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 49. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Under the previous order--the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry to interrupt the Chair. You were going to say 1 \nminute for explanation, is that correct, equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment is to strike a \nprovision in the bill that requires the President to disallow an \ninspector from any of a number of countries, from Russia to Iran.\n  There is in the treaty already the ability of the United States to \nstrike any inspector. The inspectors must be named before an inspection \ntakes place. The reason why we do not want a blanket exemption is, if \nwe blanket exempt all those folks, they will blanket exempt any U.S. \ninspector.\n  We want inspectors in the bad guy's country. We do not want to do \nthis. It is counterproductive.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let met summarize the argument the majority \nleader and I made in opposition to the motion to strike this condition.\n  The treaty currently provides for the President to say that he does \nnot want inspectors from certain countries coming into the United \nStates. There is a reason for that. What we are doing is directing him \nonly in two cases to, in advance, say, these are the countries covered: \nThose countries that sponsor state terrorism, pursuant to our \ndefinition of that, and China because of its violation of another law.\n  So it is only those countries that have violated American law and who \nare the state-sponsored terrorists who can be denied inspectors in the \nUnited States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the question now occurs on agreeing to the Biden amendment No. \n50. They yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 49 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith Bob\n     Smith Gordon H\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 50) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As I understand, there is 1 hour remaining on the last \namendment of the Senator from Delaware to strike condition 32, is that \ncorrect?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is my understanding the Senator from Delaware has \ncontrol of an additional 8 minutes on the bill?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have spoken to the majority on this. The \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia has been waiting around patiently \nall day and I keep bumping him. I want to yield up to 5 minutes of my \ntime on the bill to him at this moment, and then I will move, with \npermission of the chairman, to the last condition.\n  I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank my friend and colleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, there's not much left to say about ratification of the \nCWC--even here in the Senate. We've had seventeen formal hearings on \nthe topic over the last two years--both open and closed--and as a \nmember of all three national security committees, I have participated \nin most of them. In addition, the salient features have been discussed \nin countless meetings and fora that have that have been widely reported \nin both print and broadcast media. Finally, for everyone involved, the \nmoment of truth has arrived and we will cast what will certainly be one \nof the most important votes of the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I have been committed to ratification for some time, \nbut I know some of our colleagues have had reservations. There is no \nquestion that respected opponents of ratification have raised important \nand legitimate questions. But those questions have been thoroughly and \npainstakingly answered by the proponents, including and I believe that \nour failure to ratify this chemical weapons convention today would \nrepresent a serious setback for the United States and the entire \ninternational community and unquestionably would be viewed as a failure \nof leadership by the world's indispensable nation.\n  I will not repeat all of the arguments that have been made. In his \nnews conference earlier today the majority leader framed the essential \nquestion. And he repeated it here on the Senate floor earlier this \nafternoon. And I certainly commend him for the way he responded. He \nasked will we be better off with or without the treaty--for me that is \nnot a close call.\n  I believe we will be much better off, by any measure I can think of, \nif we ratify the convention.\n  I hope that the 28 conditions that we agreed to yesterday, and the \nadditional reassurances provided by the President today, will insure \nthat at least two-thirds of our colleagues reach the same conclusion.\n  The United States is getting out of the chemical weapons business \nwith or without an international agreement--and because over 70 other \nnations have already ratified the convention, it goes into effect on \nApril 29th, regardless of\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nwhat we do. The only matter we'll decide tonight is whether we'll be \nable to participate and shape banning the use, development, production, \nand stockpiling of chemical agents, or be cast with the pariah states \nthat will face increasing difficulty due to permanent trade \nrestrictions on non-CWC members.\n  If we want to play a leading role in at least reducing the likelihood \nthat poison gas will be used against us or the rest of the \ninternational community, we have no choice but to ratify this \nconvention.\n  Of course, there are no absolutes when it comes to arms control \nverification, but through the most far-reaching, extensive, and \nintrusive inspection procedures ever agreed to, the CWC represents a \nclear step in the right direction.\n  I do not question the patriotism of any of our colleagues who oppose \nratification, but I belive we owe a special debt of gratitude to those \nstatesmen who might find some partisan or ideological advantage in \nopposing ratification, but who put our country's interest first in \nsupporting it.\n  In that regard, I'd like to single out our former colleague and \nMajority Leader, Bob Dole, who now joins the Presidents of both parties \nwho negotiated, signed, and submitted the convention for ratification, \nas well as a distinguished galaxy of present and past top-level \nnational security leaders.\n  And, I would like to conclude by commending Senator Biden, the \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Lugar, a \nlongstanding expert in the area of arms control, for their leadership \nand tenacity these last few weeks. Due to their tireless efforts, I \nhope we will have the votes to ratify the CWC and signal to the world \nour continuing leadership, by example, to eliminate these weapons of \nmass destruction from the face of the earth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 51\n\n    (Purpose: To strike condition no. 32, relating to stemming the \n                   proliferation of chemical weapons)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     number 51.\n       On page 65, strike lines 5 through 24.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we now turn to the last condition that I am \nseeking to strike which will require the President, before he deposits \nthe instrument of ratification, to certify that the Chemical Weapons \nConvention has been amended by striking article X and article XI in \nseveral respects.\n  Mr. President, I apologize for the shorthand, because it does not do \njustice to the arguments of my friends who oppose this, but this is \nwhat we call in the trade a killer amendment. Were this to pass, there \nis no treaty. I will speak to that later.\n  With permission of the chairman of the committee, I yield to the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, who, as the old saying goes, has \nforgotten more about this treaty than most people know. I yield such \ntime as he consumes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, failure to approve the amendment proposed \nby the Senator from Delaware would require the United States to delay \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention until we obtain the \nagreement of other CWC parties to delete one of the treaty's articles \nand significantly alter another.\n  I believe the issue of technology transfer is a serious one because \nit is the one argument that seeks to demonstrate that ratifying the CWC \nwill actually harm the United States national security.\n  The critics argue because of article XI of the CWC we will have to \neliminate our national controls on chemical technologies and disband \nthe Australia Group, a multilateral framework for restraining transfers \nof sensitive chemical technology. This interpretation of the treaty is \ncontradicted not only by the text of the treaty which subordinates \nArticle XI on the basic undertakings in Article I for parties not to \nacquire chemical weapons or to assist another state in doing so, but \nalso by our experience with other nonproliferation treaties and the \nagreed consensus conditions included in the resolution of ratification \nbefore us.\n  First of all, Mr. President, our experience with essentially similar \nlanguage in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty shows that we need not \nweaken our national or multilateral export controls. The Nuclear \nSuppliers Group, the counterpart of the Australia Group, was actually \nfounded after the NPT went into force. Nor has the NPT obliged us to \ncurtail our national controls on the transfer of nuclear technology, \neven to other NPT parties. The United States enacted the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Act of 1978, 10 years after the NPT was signed.\n\n  Moreover, beyond the text of the CWC itself we have condition 7 of \nthe resolution of ratification before us. This requires the President \nto certify not only that the United States believes that the CWC does \nnot require us to weaken our export controls but also that all members \nof the Australia Group have communicated at the highest diplomatic \nlevels their agreement that multilateral and multinational controls on \nsensitive chemical technology are compatible with the treaty and will \nbe maintained under the CWC.\n  We also have condition 15 obliging the United States to share only \nmedical antidotes and treatment to countries of concern if they are \nattacked with chemical weapons.\n  Finally, we have received today from the majority leader a letter \nwhich President Clinton has sent to him committing the administration \nto withdraw from the CWC if other parties misuse articles X and XI of \nthe treaty. In the words of the majority leader, this commitment is \nunprecedented and ironclad.\n  Let me just remind my colleagues, Mr. President, that the President \nof the United States in this letter states:\n\n       In the event that a State Party or States Parties to the \n     Convention act contrary to the obligations under Article I \n     by:\n       (A) using Article X to justify providing defensive CW \n     equipment, material or information to another State Party \n     that could result in U.S. chemical protective equipment being \n     compromised so that U.S. warfighting capabilities in a CW \n     environment are significantly degraded;\n       (B) using Article XI to justify chemical transfers that \n     would make it impossible for me to make the annual \n     certification that the Australia Group remains a viable and \n     effective mechanism for controlling CW proliferation; or\n       (C) carrying out transfers or exchanges under either \n     Article X or XI which jeopardizes U.S. national security by \n     promoting CW proliferation:\n       I would, [the President of the United States] consistent \n     with Article XVI of the CWC, regard such actions as \n     extraordinary events that have jeopardized the supreme \n     interests of the United States and therefore, in consultation \n     with the Congress, be prepared to withdraw from the treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not know how we could be any clearer than that \nletter from the President of the United States.\n  Conversely, if the United States rejects ratification, I doubt that \nwe will be able to play our traditional leadership role in attempting \nto persuade other chemical suppliers to exercise restraint.\n  The world will blame the United States for undermining a chemical \nweapons ban that the vast majority of other countries were willing to \nsign. If we reject ratification, where will we get the moral and \npolitical authority to persuade other Australian Group participants to \nblock exports to countries of concern?\n  Mr. President, the supporters of this condition portray renegotiating \nthe CWC to change these two articles as a feasible undertaking. We are \ntalking about a new treaty with more than 160 other signatories, more \nthan 70 of which already ratified. In this context, retired Gen. Brent \nScowcroft, former National Security Adviser, recently testified:\n\n       Starting over, as was suggested this afternoon, I think it \n     is pure fantasy. If we reject this treaty, we will incur the \n     bitterness of all our friends and allies who followed us for \n     ten years in putting this together. The idea that we can lead \n     out again down a different path I think is just not in the \n     cards. We have got to deal with the situation we face now, \n     not an ideal one out in the future.\n\n  I think that the CWC, as we have it now and as strengthened by the 28 \nagreed conditions, is good enough. I urge my colleagues to adopt the \namendment of the Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\n  Mr. President, I don't--to the relief of most--intend to speak again. \nI want to congratulate Senator Helms for his leadership on this issue, \nfor his willingness to bring this treaty, which he opposed, to the \nfloor. I congratulate Senator Biden for his consistent leadership. He \njust said that I knew more about the treaty. I know of nobody who knows \nmore details of the treaty than the Senator from Delaware, unless it is \nthe Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, who has consistently led on \nthis and is also responsible in the Senate for ratification of this \nissue along with Senator Biden.\n  I congratulate my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, who fought \nlong and hard in this cause. He has done a masterful and admirable job \nin articulating his position on this issue. Our majority leader, \nSenator Lott, has been through hundreds of hours of meetings and has \nhad tough negotiations with the administration. Senator Lott got from \nthe President of the United States a letter which he calls \nunprecedented. I agree. I believe that it is something that can assure \nall of our citizens that if there are violations of this treaty, the \nUnited States of America will leave, and leave immediately. Senator \nLott has done a job unequaled by any in his leadership on this issue. I \nam grateful for it.\n  Finally, I also want to express my appreciation to the former \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, who, of course, decided that this issue \nwas important enough for him to inform our colleagues.\n  Finally, Mr. President, sometimes the Senate doesn't have great days, \nand sometimes the Senate has moments of which we can all be proud. I \nbelieve, watching carefully this debate for the last 2 days and what \nhas transpired here on the floor of the Senate, I think the opponents \nand proponents of the treaty can be proud of the level of debate, both \nin its comity and also in its content. I congratulate my colleagues on \na hard-fought debate, one of which I think every Member, whether we are \non the winning or losing side, can be proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the charges made consistently during \nthe weeks of debate over this treaty is the charge that supporters of \nthis treaty desired to see chemical weapons abolished from the earth, \nwhile opponents have no such interest. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. Opponents of the treaty also desire to see these heinous \nweapons abolished. We have simply contended that a poorly drafted \ntreaty will not only fail to achieve that worthy end, but could even \nlead to their increased proliferation.\n  I am pleased to report that, as of this morning, opponents of the \noriginal treaty draft have prevailed in our efforts to add teeth and \nadditional safeguards to what was heretofore an unacceptable document. \nTo begin with, the Senate yesterday voted to add twenty-eight \nadditional provisions to the CWC. These provisions tighten our \nintelligence sharing procedures to keep classified information out of \nthe wrong hands, would maintain the stricter exporting restrictions as \noutlined in the ``Australia Group'' protocol, would enhance monitoring \nand verification of compliance, and would greatly beef up our \nmilitary's chemical warfare defense capabilities. In addition, the \nSenate leadership this morning received a letter from the President \ncommitting him to withdrawing from the convention if it leads to the \ndegradation of our chemical weapons defenses, or leads to chemical \nweapons proliferation.\n  I believe this treaty is now worthy of ratification and will vote \naccordingly. Rest assured, however, that a treaty is only as reliable \nas the offices administering it. Consequently I have every intention of \ncontinuously evaluating the performance of the administration and the \nUnited Nations relative to their implementation of these treaty \nprovisions. Should any party come up short in their verification and \nenforcement duties, we will be right there to set them straight.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suppose, at this point, it would be an \nexercise in futility to go into great detail about why the Senate \nshould reject this chemical weapons treaty. But let me touch on it. I \nask the Chair to notify me when I have talked for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this treaty won't touch--won't touch--terrorist states \nlike Libya, Iraq, Syria and North Korea. The administration admits this \nitself. The administration also admits that this treaty is \nunverifiable. The fact that Russia is already cheating, even before \nthis treaty goes into effect, and the rather incredible refusal by the \nadministration to bar inspectors from hostile nations, such as Iran and \nChina, to come and ``inspect'' the businesses of the United States of \nAmerica. It seems to me that each of these defects, in and of \nthemselves, are reason enough to oppose the treaty.\n  But one in the Senate often has to face reality. Let me say this. \nThere is one issue that has raised the greatest concern among Senators, \nI believe--the issue on which the ratification vote should hinge--and \nthat is the administration's refusal to modify Articles X and XI of \nthis treaty.\n  Now, these controversial provisions require the transfer of dangerous \nchemical agents, defensive gear and know-how to any nation that joins \nthe CWC, including--get this--terrorist states like Iran and Cuba, and \nknown proliferators, such as Russia and China. Now, think of the \nimplications of that. If anybody is out there in televisionland, I hope \nyou will contemplate what is going on here on the Senate floor and \nwatch who votes how when the roll is called up yonder in just a little \nwhile.\n  Former Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, during the previous public \nadministration, the Bush administration, by the way, told the Foreign \nRelations Committee earlier this month that Articles X and XI amount to \nwhat he said are ``a formula for greatly accelerating the proliferation \nof chemical warfare capabilities around the world.''\n  Now, this condition is an essential protection in the Senate's \nresolution of ratification. It would make approval of this treaty \nabsolutely contingent upon the administration's agreement to seek \nmodifications of Articles X and XI. You have heard me say that over and \nover again for the past several weeks and months. Now, I have urged \nSenators to oppose efforts to strip out that key protection. But here \nwe go again. If this motion to strike prevails, it will be an \ninvitation to the Senate to reject the treaty entirely. But I don't \nthink the Senate is going to accept that invitation.\n  In any case, why should we modify Articles X and XI? The \nadministration argues that, in spite of all its flaws, the CWC is \nbetter than nothing. Well, to the contrary. With Articles X and XI \nunmodified, this treaty is far worse than nothing. Instead of halting \nthe spread of poison gas, this treaty will be aiding in its \nproliferation by helping countries like Iran modernize their chemical \narsenals, giving them access to our secrets for defending against \npoison gas attack, and giving a United States imprimatur to third \ncountry transfers of dangerous chemicals and defensive technology to \nrogue states.\n  Anybody who needs a road map or wants one for how this will work \ndoesn't have to go to a lot of trouble. Just examine how Russia has \ntaken advantage of similar provisions in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty. Russia is, at this very moment, using that treaty to justify \nits sale of nuclear reactors to Iran, under a provision known as \n``Atoms for Peace,'' if you can believe that. Under this CWC treaty's \nArticles X and XI--again, I have to chuckle when I say it--dubbed \n``Poisons for Peace''--if Russia or China decide, for example, to build \na chemical manufacturing facility in Iran, giving that terrorist regime \nthe chemical agents and high technology it needs to modernize its \nchemical weapons program, Russia and China not only could argue that \nthey are allowed to give Iran this technology, but that they are \nobliged to do so under a treaty, mind you, ratified by the Senate of \nthe United States.\n\n  In short, ratifying the chemical weapons treaty sends a signal to the \nworld that something has been done about the proliferation of chemical \nweapons when, in fact, we would not have done anything at all except \nmake bad matters worse, because Articles X and XI of this treaty--this \ndangerous, dangerous treaty--assure that the Chemical Weapons \nConvention will increase the spread of chemical weapons rather than \nstop it.\n  So in this next to the last vote of the evening, Senators have a \nchoice. In\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\nmaking that choice, I for one cannot imagine that the U.S. Senate would \nreject the advice of four former distinguished Secretaries of Defense, \nwho testified that unless Articles X and XI are modified, the Senate \nshould refuse to ratify this treaty.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I note that the ranking member is not present on the \nfloor at the moment, Mr. President. I will yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support \nfor the motion to strike condition 32 from the resolution of \nratification.\n  I strongly support the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe it is \nvery much in our national interests to ratify this treaty.\n  The pending motion is to strike condition 32 from resolution of \nratification of the CWC. It is essential that this motion pass, because \nif it does not, our decision to ratify the treaty will be meaningless.\n  During the debate over this treaty, a number of serious concerns have \nbeen raised over Articles X and XI. I myself have shared some of these \nconcerns. But I want to address these criticisms of the CWC now, \nbecause I believe that very solid answers have been provided to \nvirtually all of them.\n  I met at the White House last Friday with National Security Adviser \nSandy Berger and Special Assistant to the President for Defense Policy \nand Arms Control Robert Bell, who explained these answers to me in \ndetail, and I found their explanations persuasive.\n  Sharing Defense Technologies: During the April 9, 1997 hearing in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, the concern was raised by several \nwitnesses that Article X of the CWC would require the United States to \nshare advanced chemical defense technologies with rogue nations like \nIran, who may sign and ratify the treaty.\n  If indeed the treaty required that, there would be significant \ngrounds for concern. But I believe the concern is unwarranted and \nunfounded.\n  In an April 22 letter to me, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger \nmakes it very clear that Article X of the CWC would impose no \nobligation on the United States to assist Iran with its chemical \nweapons defense capabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Berger's letter be included in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. Berger makes clear that paragraph 7 of Article X, which spells \nout the obligations of States Parties to assist others threatened by \nchemical weapons, would require the United States to provide nothing \nmore than medical antidotes and treatments to any state we deemed \nunreliable. We have the option to provide more advanced assistance to \nthose nations we trust, but no obligation.\n  The Administration is so comfortable with this reading of the treaty, \nthat, in their negotiations with Senator Helms and with the Majority \nLeader's task force on the CWC, they have agreed to a binding condition \n(number 15) that would ensure that the United States will not provide \nany assistance other than medical assistance to any rogue nation that \nbecomes a party to the treaty.\n  Another concern about Article X is that paragraph 3, which calls for \nparties to ``facilitate * * * the fullest possible exchange'' of \ninformation and technology on protection against chemical weapons, \nwhich some here have said would require the United States to share such \nequipment with rogue nations who sign and ratify the treaty.\n\n  The Administration has made clear that the use of the words \n``facilitate'' and ``possible'' in this paragraph mean that the United \nStates will determine whether any specific exchange is appropriate, and \nwe will not pursue those we deem inappropriate. In making these \ndecisions, we will do nothing to undermine our national export \ncontrols.\n  With these assertions in hand, I am satisfied that the United States \nwill in no way be obligated to provide chemical weapons technology to \nany nation we deem to be untrustworthy.\n  Some have also raised the concern that Article X might induce other, \nless conscientious nations, to supply rogue states with defense \ntechnologies. But there is nothing that prevents those sales from \ntaking place today, with no CWC in effect.\n  Within the CWC, the countries who make exchanges allowed in Article X \nare legally bound by the treaty's overriding principle, stated in \nArticle I, that they can do nothing to ``assist, encourage, or induce, \nin any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State \nParty under this Convention.'' Any country's failure to uphold this \nobligation would enable the full force of over 160 nations to coalesce \nin support of sanctions, and possibly military action.\n  In addition, the CWC would provide us with far more ability to \nscrutinize any exchanges of chemical defense equipment than we have \ntoday. The result is a net increase, not decrease, in our knowledge of \ndefense exchanges with rogue nations, and our ability to address any \ncompliance concerns that may arise from these exchanges.\n  Cooperation on Chemical Technology: Another concern that has been \nraised involves Article XI. Some have suggested that Article XI, which \ndeals with cooperation in chemical activities not prohibited by the \ntreaty, would require the United States to provide other nations with \naccess to our dual-use technologies and manufacturing secrets. Here \nagain, the concern is unwarranted.\n  Article XI does aim to ensure that parties to the treaty can conduct \nlegitimate chemical commerce, which is reasonable. But in his April 22 \nletter, Mr. Berger explains that this Article does not require the \nUnited States, or any U.S. company, to provide confidential business \ninformation to any foreign party.\n  As to the concern that Article XI will undercut export controls, \nindeed, the reverse is true. Mr. Berger makes clear that all U.S. \nexport controls now in effect are fully consistent with the CWC. In \naddition, our allies in the Australia Group, all 28 of them, have \npledged to maintain all existing multilateral export controls, which \nthey agree are fully consistent with the CWC.\n  Here again, the problem identified by critics of the CWC would \nactually be worse without the treaty. The CWC will allow us to better \nmonitor chemical commerce that occurs today without our knowledge. It \nwill also provide the basis for further multilateral efforts to control \nexports, above and beyond our own existing export controls and those of \nthe Australia Group.\n  Furthermore, with the CWC, the countries undertaking exchanges are \nlegally bound by the fundamental obligations in Article I--the \noverriding Article of the treaty--never ``to assist, encourage or \ninduce in any way anyone to engage in any activity prohibited'' under \nthe convention. It must be remembered that Article I supersedes all \nsubsequent articles of the Convention. It is disingenuous to suggest \nthat the treaty would undercut its central prohibition so blatantly.\n\n  To address the concerns raised about Article XI, the Administration \nhas agreed to a binding condition (number 7) that the President must \ncertify now and on an annual basis that the Australia Group of 30 \nnations is continuing to control chemical exports effectively and \nremains a viable mechanism for doing so.\n  According to this condition, the President must also certify that \nnothing in the CWC obligates the United States to weaken our own export \ncontrols, and that each member of the Australia Group remains committed \nto maintaining current export controls.\n  With this condition added to the resolution of ratification, I \nbelieve concerns about Article XI can be laid aside.\n  In fact, the negotiations between the Administration and Sen. Biden \non the one hand, and Sen. Helms and Sen. Lott's task force on the \nother, have been remarkably successful in addressing the concerns that \nhave been raised about the treaty.\n  If the Administration is willing to meet the concerns of the critics \nof Articles X and XI, as it has, and those critics still insist on the \nremoval of those articles as their price for ratifying the treaty, it \nis clear that the intent is to kill the treaty altogether.\n  It is completely unrealistic to suggest that we try to drop Article X \nand amend Article XI of the CWC at this point. These two articles were \nincluded\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\nto reassure countries who signed the treaty that they would not be \nprevented from developing chemical weapons defenses or engaging in \nlegitimate chemical commerce.\n  None of the 160 nations who have signed or 74 nations that have \nratified the treaty will agree to renegotiate these provisions at the \neleventh hour. It will simply result in our exclusion from the CWC--\nwhich is clearly the intent.\n  As Gen. Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser to President Bush, \ntestified before the Foreign Relations Committee on April 9, 1997:\n\n       Starting over * * * is pure fantasy. If we reject this \n     treaty, we will incur the bitterness of all our friends and \n     allies who followed us for 10 years in putting this thing \n     together * * *. The idea that we can lead out again down a \n     different path I think is just not in the cards. We have got \n     to deal with the situation we face now, not an ideal one out \n     in the future.\n\n  The concerns raised about Articles X and XI--which I shared--have \nbeen more than adequately addressed by the agreed conditions.\n  Failing to strike this condition would be tantamount to killing the \ntreaty. I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to strike. Those \nwho do not are essentially voting against ratification of the entire \nCWC.\n  The CWC is not a panacea, and none of its proponents believes it is. \nIt will not by itself banish chemical weapons from the earth, but it \nwould result in the destruction of much of the world's chemical weapons \nstocks, and provide us with a valuable set of tools that would \nsignificantly strengthen our ability to monitor and defend against the \nthreat of chemical weapons.\n  So, reiterating, Mr. President, during the April 9 hearing in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, the concern was raised by several \nwitnesses that Article X would require the United States to share \nadvanced chemical defense technologies with rogue nations like Iran, \nwho may sign and ratify the treaty. If indeed the treaty required that, \nthere would be significant grounds for concern. But I believe the \nconcern is unwarranted.\n  In an April 22 letter to me, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger \nmakes it very clear that Article X of the CWC would impose no \nobligation on the United States to assist Iran with its chemical \nweapons defense capabilities.\n  Mr. Berger makes clear that paragraph 7 of Article X, which spells \nout the obligations of States Parties to assist others threatened by \nchemical weapons would require the United States to provide nothing \nmore than medical antidotes and treatments to any state we deem \nunreliable. We have the option to provide more advanced assistance to \nthose states we trust, but no obligation.\n  Another concern about Article X is that paragraph 3, which calls for \nparties to * * * ``facilitate * * * the fullest possible exchange'' of \ninformation and technology on protection against chemical weapons.\n  Now, I understand the concern there. But the administration has made \nit clear that the use of the words ``facilitate'' and ``possible'' in \nthis paragraph mean that the United States will determine whether any \nspecific exchange is appropriate, and we will not pursue those we deem \ninappropriate. In making these decisions we will do nothing to \nundermine our national export controls.\n  With these assertions in hand, I am satisfied that the United States \nwill in no way be obligated to provide chemical weapons defense \ntechnology to any nation we deem untrustworthy. And the President's \npoint A in his letter to the majority leader points this out as one of \nthe three conditions under which the United States would withdraw from \nthe treaty if it turns out any other way.\n  Some have also raised the concern that Article X might induce other, \nless conscientious, nations to supply rogue states with defense \ntechnologies. But there is nothing that prevents these sales from \ntaking place today, with no CWC in effect.\n  With the CWC, the countries who make exchanges allowed in Article X \nare legally bound, as Senator McCain pointed out, to the treaty's \noverriding and superseding principle, stated in Article I, that they \ncan do nothing to ``assist, encourage, or induce, in any way, anyone to \nengage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under this \nConvention.'' Any country's failure to uphold this obligation would \nenable the full force of 160 nations to coalesce in support of \nsanctions, and possibly military action.\n\n  In addition, the CWC would provide us with far more ability to \nscrutinize any exchanges of chemical defense equipment than we have \ntoday. So the result is a net increase, not a decrease, in our \nknowledge of defense exchanges with rogue nations and our ability to \naddress any compliance concerns that may arise from these exchanges. \nFor me, it was very helpful to be present in the closed session of this \nSenate. I very much appreciate the information shared. But I think the \nbottom line is really this point.\n  Let me turn to article XI, which deals with cooperation in chemical \ntechnology.\n  Another concern that has been raised involves the article XI \nprovisions on cooperation in chemical activity not prohibited by the \ntreaty. Some fear that these provisions would require the United States \nto provide other nations with access to our dual-use technologies and \nmanufacturing secrets. Here again, I truly believe the concern is \nunwarranted. Article XI aims to ensure that parties to the treaty can \nconduct legitimate chemical commerce. It is reasonable.\n  In his April 22 letter to me, Mr. Berger explains that this article \ndoes not require the United States nor any U.S. company to provide \nconfidential business information to any foreign party. As to the \nconcern that article XI will undercut export controls, indeed, the \nreverse is true. Mr. Berger makes clear that all U.S. export controls \nnow in effect are fully consistent with the CWC.\n  In addition, our allies in the Australia Group--all 29 of them--have \npledged to maintain all existing multilateral export controls, which \nthey agree are fully consistent with the CWC. Here again the problem \nidentified by critics, I think, would be worse without the treaty. The \nCWC allows us to better monitor chemical commerce that occurs today \nwithout our knowledge. It will also provide the basis for further \nmultilateral efforts to control exports, above and beyond our own \nexisting export controls and those of the Australia Group. And, once \nagain, Article I supersedes this article with the overriding obligation \nnever ``to assist, encourage or induce in any way anyone to engage in \nany activity prohibited'' under the convention.\n  To address the concerns raised about article XI, the administration \nhas agreed to a binding condition No. 7 that the President must certify \nnow and on an annual basis that the Australia Group of nations is \ncontinuing to control chemical exports effectively and remains a viable \nmechanism for doing so. The President must also certify that nothing in \nthe CWC obligates the United States to weaken its own export controls. \nThe President, in his point B on page 2 in his letter to the majority \nleader, clearly points out that, if that happens, we would withdraw \nfrom the treaty.\n  The negotiations between the administration and Senator Biden on the \none hand, and Senator Helms and Senator Lott's task force on the other, \nI think have been remarkably successful in addressing concerns raised \nby the treaty.\n  So we see here that the administration has been willing to meet the \nconcerns of critics of articles X and XI, and it has. It seems to me \ncompletely unrealistic to suggest that we try to drop articles X and XI \nat this late stage. These two articles were included to reassure \ncountries who sign the treaty that they would not be prevented from \ndeveloping chemical weapons defenses or engaging in legitimate chemical \ncommerce.\n  None of the 160 nations who have signed, nor the 74 nations who have \nratified this treaty will agree to renegotiate these provisions at the \neleventh hour. It will simply result in our exclusion from the CWC. And \nthat would truly be too high a price to pay. I urge all my colleagues \nto support this motion to strike condition 32 from the resolution of \nratification.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield as much time as I may have to \nSenator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I do not like \nto disagree with my friend and colleague\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\nfrom California, Senator Feinstein. And I find that I rarely disagree \nwith my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. This is a treaty which \nhas caused division among reasonable people. I respect their views \nimmensely. We find that even former members of the same administration, \nthe Bush and Reagan administrations, now find themselves on opposite \nsides of this issue. So it is a matter upon which reasonable people can \ndiffer. As I said, I respect the views of those who have disagreed with \nme, and they have certainly shown a respect for my views, which I \nappreciate.\n  These two articles are among the most important in the treaty, and I \nthink a little bit of background is important for us to understand the \nreason we believe that it is important that they not be included in the \ntreaty when we enter into force.\n  We have said initially that this treaty is not global. It doesn't \ncover countries that it should. It is not verifiable. It is fairly well \nacknowledged there are no sanctions. But supporters have said it is \nbetter than nothing. There are some advantages to it. Our response is \nthat in some respects it is not better than nothing.\n  In particular, these two sections, articles X and XI, make it worse \nthan nothing, and we ought to get rid of them. It is true that to get \nrid of them, the states parties to the convention have to agree. That \nwill take some time. But we believe it is better, before the United \nStates enters, when we have the leverage to cause that renegotiation to \noccur, to have it occur at that time. Therefore, the resolution of \nratification is passed, but prior to the President actually depositing \nthose articles, the President certify to us that articles X and XI have \nbeen removed, or fixed.\n  Why is this so important? Secretary of Defense Cheney was quoted by \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee, and I think he succinctly \nsaid it. Therefore, I will summarize these thoughts by quoting \nSecretary Cheney in his letter of April of this year.\n  He said:\n\n       Indeed, some aspects of the present Convention--notably, \n     its obligation to share with potential adversaries like Iran \n     chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for \n     military purposes and chemical defensive equipment--threaten \n     to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all. In my \n     judgment, the treaty's Articles X and XI amount to a formula \n     for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical \n     warfare capabilities around the globe.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Cheney's letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Dallas, TX, April 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter inviting me to \n     join several other former Secretaries of Defense in \n     testifying in early April when the Foreign Relations \n     Committee holds hearings on the Chemical Weapons Convention. \n     Regrettably, other commitments will preclude me from \n     participation. I hope that this correspondence will be \n     sufficient to convey my views on this Convention.\n       During the years I served as Secretary of Defense, I was \n     deeply concerned about the inherent unverifiability, lack of \n     global coverage, and unenforceability of a convention that \n     sought to ban production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. \n     My misgivings on these scores have only intensified during \n     the four years since I left the Pentagon.\n       The technology to manufacture chemical weapons is simply \n     too ubiquitous, covert chemical warfare programs too easily \n     concealed, and the international community's record of \n     responding effectively to violations of arms control treaties \n     too unsatisfactory to permit confidence that such a regime \n     would actually reduce the chemical threat.\n       Indeed, some aspects of the present Convention--notably, \n     its obligation to share with potential adversaries like Iran \n     chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for \n     military purposes and chemical defensive equipment--threaten \n     to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all. In my \n     judgment, the treaty's Articles X and XI amount to a formula \n     for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical \n     warfare capabilities around the globe.\n       Those nations most likely to comply with the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention are not likely to ever constitute a \n     military threat to the United States. The governments we \n     should be concerned about are likely to cheat on the CWC, \n     even if they do participate.\n       In effect, the Senate is being asked to ratify the CWC even \n     though it is likely to be ineffective, unverifiable and \n     unenforceable. Having ratified the Convention, we will then \n     be told we have ``dealt with the problem of chemical \n     weapons'' when in fact we have not. But, ratification of the \n     CWC will lead to a sense of complacency, totally unjustified \n     given the flaws in the convention.\n       I would urge the Senate to reject the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dick Cheney.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what is it about articles X and XI that cause \nSecretary Cheney and so many others to conclude that they should be \nremoved? I will quote to you the language of both. They are on the \nchart behind me.\n  Article X provides that `` * * * each state party undertake to \nfacilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, the fullest \npossible exchange of equipment, material, and scientific and \ntechnological information concerning means of protection against \nchemical weapons.''\n  In other words, in plain English, those parties which have defensive \ncapability will undertake to facilitate the fullest possible exchange \nof that technology, equipment, and so on, to the countries that don't \nhave them. They shall have the right to participate in the fullest \npossible exchange of that equipment.\n  Article XI is the article that says that the states parties shall: \n``(b) undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, \nthe fullest possible exchange of chemical equipment, and scientific and \ntechnical information relating to the development and application of \nchemistry for purposes not prohibited under the convention.''\n  That is to say, peaceful purposes. And, second, that the state \nparties ``shall not maintain among themselves any restrictions, \nincluding those in any international agreements, incompatible with the \nobligations undertaken under this convention, which would restrict or \nimpede trade and the development and promotion of scientific and \ntechnological knowledge in the field of chemistry for industrial and \nagricultural research, medical, pharmaceutical, and other peaceful \npurposes.''\n  These two provisions were inserted in the treaty essentially as \ninducements to get the parties to join the treaty, in effect, saying, \n``If you will join the CWC, those of us who have this technology and \nthese chemicals will provide them to you. We will sell you the \nchemicals for peaceful purposes--not for chemical weapons. And we will \nprovide you the defense technology so that you can defend against any \npossible use against you.'' Of course, the price for having that right \nis not developing chemical weapons.\n  In this respect, the treaty was compared to the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, and the so-called ``Atoms for Peace,'' which said \nthat if the countries would forswear the development of nuclear weapons \nbuilding that the developed countries of the world would provide them \npeaceful nuclear technology. For some countries this worked. But sadly \nwe know that a couple of other countries used the peaceful technology \nto build their nuclear weapon capability.\n  So, Secretary Cheney, and many others, fear that these sections, \nthese articles, would permit countries--since they have been induced to \ncome into the treaty with these commitments--to then call upon those \ncommitments from the countries that have this equipment.\n  Is this an unreasonable assumption? Today, we are basically hearing \nstatements that suggest that that is not the way it was intended at \nall.\n  That is a very recent phenomenon. As a matter of fact, right after \nthe CWC was signed, it was very clear to all states parties that they \nbegin to dismantle the trade restrictions they had in place on \nchemicals in order to come into compliance with the CWC.\n  According to the administration in testimony before the Senate, and I \nam quoting now, ``Australia Group members''--these are the countries \nthat have agreed not to sell chemicals to terrorist states--``in August \n1992 committed to review their export control measures with a view of \nremoving them for CWC states parties in full compliance with their \nobligations under the convention.''\n  They knew that those trade restrictions were incompatible with the \nnew commitments they had undertaken in articles X and XI of the \nconvention, and the Australia Group itself issued a\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\nformal statement which concluded again that states parties were \nreviewing this, and I am quoting, ``with the aim of removing such \nmeasures for the benefit of states parties to the convention acting in \nfull compliance with the obligations under the convention.''\n  The point being that when the treaty went into effect the parties \nknew full well that trade restrictions they had were no longer \ncompatible with the convention, with articles X and XI, and that they \nwere going to have to review limiting those trade restrictions, and the \nAustralia Group is a very successful group of countries that has trade \nrestrictions against trade in chemicals to these terrorist states.\n  Well, we then began raising the questions about articles X and XI. \nThe administration position changed 180 degrees, Mr. President. The \nadministration began to say, well, actually, we could continue our \nrestrictions under these two articles. And we said, well, it will not \ndo any good unless everybody else does it. They said, we could even \npersuade the Australia Group countries to do that. In other words, to \ndo exactly the opposite of what they had originally decided they had to \ndo to be in compliance.\n  So the administration has made much of and my colleagues have spoken \nof the fact that the United States will now interpret the Chemical \nWeapons Convention as not requiring us to provide this equipment and as \nenabling us to maintain trade restrictions even despite articles X and \nXI. Moreover, that we have even tried to get our fellow Australia Group \ncountries to maintain their restrictions in place.\n  That is laudable. We have at least pushed the rock that far up the \nmountain. We have got them to agree these two sections should not \noperate the way they plainly say they will. I think it is a little \nunseemly to be signaling before we have entered the convention that we \nare going to violate it up front and convince many of our friends to \nviolate it, because, frankly, it is the right thing to do because \narticles X and XI ought to be violated by us. They have no place in \nthis treaty.\n  The problem is the administration has also glossed over the fact that \nwhile we may interpret the treaty this way, there are others who do \nnot. For example, China does not. Iran does not. And there are other \ncountries that we heard about in our classified session this morning \nthat do not. They explicitly understand that the treaty means what it \nsays. And therefore two parties that have signed, not yet ratified but \nsigned the agreement have indicated that they intend to continue their \ntrade. And this is China selling chemicals to Iran, for Iran's chemical \nweapons program. That is the problem. And it is true that nothing \nprevents that trade from occurring today, Mr. President, but the \nproblem is that the Chemical Weapons Convention gives them the color of \nlaw, the legal authority to be able to say: Look, we are parties to the \ntreaty. The treaty says we can do it, so stop complaining and, by the \nway, don't impose any restrictions on us because of what we are doing.\n  I do not know how long it will be before chemical companies in other \ncountries are going to say wait a minute, why should the Chinese have \nall the action here; we would like to have a piece of that action, too, \nand therefore when one country breaks an embargo it begins to fall \napart. That is why I submit that just focusing on United States action \nunder the treaty is not going to solve the problem.\n  There is also the idea--and this is really not a proper legal \nargument, but some have said that article I supersedes the specific \narticles of the convention. Now, for those who are lawyers, they \nrecognize this is not true. The specific always governs over the \ngeneral. Article I is a general prohibition. The very specific articles \nsuch as articles X and XI will control. They are the specific \nimplementation of the treaty.\n  But to conclude now, Mr. President, the President of the United \nStates has said given the fact that there are concerns, continuing \nconcerns about articles X and XI, I am going to write a letter which \nmaybe will put your mind at ease, and that letter has been referred to \nhere by some of my colleagues. I do not doubt the sincerity of the \nPresident in sending the letter and certainly do not doubt the \nsincerity of my colleagues in believing that letter provides some \nsolace, but I would like to make five points with respect to that \nletter.\n\n  If the things under articles X and XI happen that we think will, it \ndoes not solve anything for the United States to pull out of the treaty \nas the President says he might do. The time to exercise leverage is now \nbefore we are a party to the treaty. And what we are saying is prior to \nthe United States getting into the treaty, we should make sure that \narticles X and XI are removed so that these bad things do not happen. \nOnce they happen, there is no point of the United States pulling out of \nthe treaty. That does not solve anything. So what the President says he \nis willing to do, frankly, is not an inducement.\n  Moreover, there is the argument that it is better to be inside the \ntreaty than outside the treaty. And believe me, once we are inside it \nis going to be much harder to leave than it is to get in in the first \nplace.\n  Third, certifications of the kind that the President indicated he \nwould be willing to make are very, very hard to do. There are a whole \nseries of certifications that have to be made under U.S. law. They are \ntoo hard. We end up not doing them. The certification of Mexico is a \ngood example, to certify that they are cooperating with us in the war \non drugs. Most people believe that that was not an honest \ncertification. But the desire to cooperate with Mexico was so strong \nthat it overrode the point of being honest in the certification. The \nsame thing is true with the Arms Control Disarmament Act, the annual \nPell report, section 51. We know that Russia is not in compliance with \nthe Biological Weapons Convention or with the Wyoming Memorandum of \nUnderstanding or with the Bilateral Destruction Agreement, but the most \nthis administration has ever done is to conduct high-level discussions \nwith the Russians. It is too hard to certify that they are in \nnoncompliance and therefore take the action that is required.\n  The same thing is true under the Export-Import Ban Act with respect \nto violations by China and several other laws that China has violated \nwith respect to its chemical weapons transfers to Iran. These \ncertifications are simply too hard. And while I agree, I am sure the \nintentions of the President are appropriate in this regard, those \ncertifications I submit are not going to be done.\n  The time line here is important, too. This is a commitment by \nPresident Clinton. It is between 2 and 3 years before any action can be \ntaken under this convention. That means that this President's term will \nalmost be expired before he would have the opportunity to even consider \nthe issues that are set forth in his letter. So it is not an effective \ncommitment.\n  And finally, Mr. President, the letter only deals with United States \nactions, the point that I made in the beginning. The question here is \nnot United States actions. The question has always been what are we \ngoing to do with those countries of the world that seek an offensive \nchemical weapons capability, a capability that we would like to deny \nthem, countries like Iran, the one I have been talking about here. This \ncommitment, the President's commitment in his letter does absolutely \nnothing with respect to the sales of chemicals and chemical technology \nfrom a country like China to a country like Iran. It doesn't affect it \nat all.\n  So while it is a nice commitment to have made with respect to the \nUnited States participation and attempting to keep the Australia Group \ntogether, the fact is it does not deal with part of the problem that \nhas concerned us from the very beginning.\n  I conclude with this letter to simply make this point. As I said, \nreasonable people can differ, and I respect the views of those who \ndisagree with me. They have sincere belief that this treaty is better \nthan nothing. And if they believe that way, they should vote yes on \nthis treaty. There are also those of us who disagree with that \nproposition. But I urge my colleagues, if you believe that this letter \nprovides the basis for support for the treaty, I honestly believe that \nis incorrect. If you are going to vote yes on this treaty, do it for \ngrounds other than this letter because it does not provide a \nsatisfactory response to the very real problem that\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\nhas been discussed by Secretary Cheney, by Secretary Weinberger, by \nSecretary Rumsfeld, by Secretary Schlesinger, and a host of other \npeople who have all said that the fundamental problem is articles X and \nXI. Unless they are removed, we are looking for more proliferation, not \nless, under this treaty. And it is for that reason the motion to strike \nshould be defeated, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. From my general debate time I yield 10 minutes to the \nassistant majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I would like to compliment my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, for an excellent statement. I \nhappen to think that this amendment we are debating is the key \namendment of the entire debate. I certainly compliment all Senators for \ntheir involvement in this debate. I think it has been one of the best \ndebates we have had in the Senate for a long time. It is also one of \nthe most important issues we have had where we have seen so many \ncolleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle, who have been \nundecided and probably because of this language dealing with article X \nand article XI.\n  This is the language we have heard former Defense Secretary Cheney, \nformer Secretary of Defense Schlesinger, and Cap Weinberger, really \nspeak out against in their statements before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  Also, I note that President Clinton has a letter addressing this \nissue. But I looked at it a little bit more. I certainly concur with \nthe goals and objectives; we want to reduce chemical weapons. And we \nhave taken a laudatory step of saying we are going to ban them in this \ncountry and we want to encourage other countries to ban them, and I \nthink that is great. And that is in article I. I see article I is over \nhere, and if one reads article I it looks great. But I think it is \nincumbent upon us as Senators to read the balance of the treaty.\n  When you read article X, and it is in the treaty, it says:\n\n       Each State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have \n     the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of \n     equipment, material and scientific and technological \n     information concerning means of protection against chemical \n     weapons.\n\n  Share defensive technology. I know the administration said, well, we \nare not going to do that. But it is in the treaty that we are going to. \nI find that a little contradictory, we are going to limit what we are \ngoing to share. This says to the fullest extent possible. The language \nis very contradictory in what the administration says they are going to \ndo in subsequent letters and what the language of the treaty is. I \nthink maybe the language of the treaty will supersede.\n  If we are signing a treaty, don't we mean to comply with all of it. \nAnd then again we are not just talking about the United States, because \nI hope that we don't just give our technology away to some countries, \nsome countries that will sign this convention and will not comply. We \nknow that. We have had some experience. We have seen it not only with \nthe Geneva Protocol on chemical weapons, but we also have seen it with \nthe biological weapons convention which a lot of countries signed but \nthey have not complied with and we know that. Our intelligence \ncommunity has done a pretty good job, and in many cases we know a lot \nof countries are not complying.\n  But I think it is legitimate to ask, are we better off with it or \nwithout. And I have heard good debate on both sides. But this language \nsays to me we have to share this technology. Not only do we have to but \nalso other countries, including countries like China, would be sharing \nthis technology with Iran. Under the treaty, they would be obliged to, \nor certainly that is what they will be saying. Does that increase the \nlikelihood and the dangers of chemical weapons? I am afraid it does.\n  And then looking at article XI, and again just looking at the treaty \nand looking at the language of the treaty--every once in a while I \nthink it is important we do it--under article XI, section 2(c) it says:\n\n       Not maintain among themselves any restrictions, including \n     those in any international agreements, incompatible with the \n     obligations undertaken under this convention, which would \n     restrict or impede trade and the development and promotion of \n     scientific and technological knowledge in the field of \n     chemistry for industrial, agricultural, research, medical, \n     pharmaceutical or other peaceful purposes.\n\n  In other words, we want a lot more trade in other chemicals that \naren't banned by this treaty.\n  There is an editorial in the Wall Street Journal that I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 24, 1997]\n\n                           Chemical Reactions\n\n       Before today's vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention, we \n     hope that some Senator will twist his tongue around the 20 \n     chemicals listed here and read their names into the record. \n     This list makes two important points about what's wrong with \n     the treaty.\n       First is that many ordinary chemicals can be put to deadly \n     use. The chemicals on this list can be used in such mundane \n     products as laundry soaps, ink and fumigation agents--or they \n     can be used in lethal weapons. Bear this in mind when you \n     hear the President assert that the CWC will ``banish poison \n     gas from the Earth.''\n       The second point is that the CWC not only will permit trade \n     in these 20 potentially deadly chemicals, it will require it. \n     American companies currently are restricted from exporting \n     these dual-use chemicals under the terms of an organization \n     called the Australia Group, which is made up of 29 Western \n     countries committed to ensuring that their exports don't \n     contribute to the spread of chemical weapons.\n       But Articles X and XI of the CWC require member countries \n     to transfer chemicals and technology to any other member \n     country that asks. This goes a long way toward explaining why \n     the Chemical Manufacturers Association is so loud in its \n     support of the treaty.\n       Senators who are still considering how to vote might \n     consider whether selling such chemicals to China or Iran or \n     Cuba will help make the world safe from chemical weapons--or \n     make the world a more dangerous place.\n\n                          Mustard Gas for Sale\n\n       Trade in these 20 precursors for chemical weapons agents, \n     now regulated, would be permitted under the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention:\n\n       3-Hydroxy-1-methylpiperidine\n       Potassium fluoride\n       2-Chloroethanol\n       Dimethylamine (DMA)\n       Dimethylamine hydrochloride\n       Hydrogen fluoride\n       Methyl benzilate\n       3-Quinuclidone\n       Pinacolone\n       Potassium cyanide\n       Potassium bifluoride\n       Ammonium bifluoride\n       Sodium fluoride\n       Sodium bifluoride\n       Sodium cyanide\n       Phosphorus pentasulfide\n       Diisopropylamine (DIPA)\n       Diethylaminoethanol (DEAE)\n       Sodium sulfide\n       Triethanolamine hydrochloride\n\n       Source: Senate Foreign Relations Committee\n  Mr. NICKLES. This article lists about 20 chemicals that are not \nprohibited by this treaty, that basically this section of article XI \nsays you will be able to sell those chemicals. As a matter of fact, no \nrestriction. This language says that countries cannot maintain amongst \nthemselves any restrictions including those in any international \nagreements. It does not say some. It says any international agreements. \nThat sounds pretty open. A lot of those chemicals can be used to \ndevelop chemical weapons. They can also have a dual purpose. It can be \nkind of confusing.\n  I understand the President in his letter today said, well, he would \ntry to end the confusion. And so I looked at his letter, and in his \nletter on page 2 he says--dealing with article X, he said:\n\n       Using article X to justify providing defensive chemical \n     weapon equipment, material or information to another State \n     Party that could result in U.S. chemical protective equipment \n     being compromised so that U.S. war fighting capabilities in a \n     chemical weapons environment are significantly degraded.\n\n  If that is the case, he wants out. What is ``significantly \ndegraded''? How do you reach that level. I do not know that you would \never reach--since he has ``significantly degraded,'' I do not know, \nbecause the word ``significantly'' is there that it would ever be \ntreated. And then in (b) he talks about where it would be impossible \nfor him to make a certification on the Australia Group. But in the \nfinal language he says we would get out if the implementing of this \nconvention carries out transfers or\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\nexchanges under either article X or XI which jeopardize U.S. national \nsecurity by promoting chemical weapons proliferation. When is that \ngoing to be triggered?\n  His final conclusion is kind of interesting. I read the AP story that \nsaid, well, because of the President's letter, he said if these things \nhappen, we are out of there, we are going to walk away from the treaty. \nI do not read that in his language. It says I would be prepared to \nwithdraw. It did not say he would withdraw. So if it really jeopardizes \nour national security, he might be prepared, but it did not say he \nwould withdraw, after consulting with Congress.\n  In other words, I do not find a lot in this letter that gives me any \nreal comfort or assurance that article X or XI has really been \naddressed. And I appreciate the fact that a lot of our colleagues have \naddressed this issue, but to me treaties are important. And we have had \na lot of significant discussion over various sections of the treaty, \nmaybe none more than article X and XI, but it happens to still be in \nthe treaty. And the President's letter notwithstanding, at the \nconclusion of his letter he said if all these things happen or any of \nthese things happen, I would be prepared to withdraw.\n  Frankly, Senator Kyl is right. That is not going to happen in 2 or 3 \nyears. It is not going to happen under President Clinton's term. I do \nnot know that this letter would be binding on succeeding or successors \nof the President.\n  So, Mr. President, this language is vitally important. I would tell \nmy colleague from North Carolina my vote on final passage depends on \nthis amendment. If we are able to make this change by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, I will vote maybe for final passage. I think this is a \nkiller amendment, having it in the treaty. I think it is that \nimportant. We are ratifying the entire treaty including article X, \nincluding article XI. And again I compliment my colleagues. I have the \ngreatest respect for Senator Lugar. I know he has worked hard on this. \nI have the greatest respect for Senator McCain and a lot of other \npeople on both sides of the aisle. They have conducted an excellent \ndebate. I have made a long list of pluses and minuses on this treaty. I \ncould debate either side of the treaty, I have spent just that amount \nof time on it. But I happen to think that this article X and article XI \ndo a lot of damage. Since we are ratifying not just article I, but the \nentire treaty, I urge my colleagues to vote to delete the section. I \nurge my colleagues to vote no on this. I think this is the most \nimportant amendment and discussion that we will have to date.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains under the control of \nthe Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I suggest my colleague and I divide that \ntime. I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the condition we are discussing, all \nSenators by this time, I am certain, understand, requires the President \nto certify that the parties to the convention have agreed to strike \narticle X of the convention and amend article XI of the convention. \nThat means, in simple language, that the United States would simply say \na treaty negotiated by 160 countries, now ratified by, apparently, 74--\nunilaterally, we simply knock out article X and severely amend article \nXI.\n  As all Senators who have addressed this will admit, this means \neffectively the end of the treaty, at least in terms of our \nparticipation, because, clearly, the other nations of the world are \nunder no obligation to renegotiate the entire treaty at that point. \nThis is the reason it is strictly a killer amendment. It simply knocks \nout material parts of the convention.\n  If those who are advocating this had a point, there might be reason \nto pause at this point and not ratify the treaty. But by and large it \nappears to me that most of us want to ratify the treaty and we do so \nwith assurance, first of all, that as a country we have our wits about \nus. There is no possibility this President, the next President, Members \nof the Senate, any responsible American is going to furnish material to \ncountries that are rogue states that are going to jeopardize our \nsecurity. The treaty does not call for that, as again and again we \npointed out. This was a generous interpretation that the Iranians gave \nbecause, at least from that standpoint, they would like to have the \nmaterial. But why we should ever be that gullible escapes me. There is \nno mandate to give anything away.\n  Those of us who advocate the treaty have been saying we will not. The \nPresident of the United States has been asked for assurance, and he \nsaid that he will not. He has sent letters to the majority leader and \nto individual Senators affirming this in any number of ways.\n  Furthermore, the question arises, ``Fair enough, Mr. President, or \nMr. Senator, if you will not give things away to the Iranians, how \nabout the French or the Germans or some other nation? Perhaps they will \ndo so.'' As Secretary Cohen replied on Meet The Press on Sunday--and \nSecretary Albright, likewise, who was sitting beside him responded to \nthis question--they pointed out that is a very good reason for us to be \naround the table with the other countries from the beginning, setting \nthe rules.\n  If Senators are seriously concerned that other countries are going to \ngive away the store, we had better be there to help restrain them, to \noffer our leadership. It comes back to that, our leadership. We were \nthe ones that started the whole process--President Reagan, President \nBush, President Clinton. We are the ones who had a good idea: If we \nwere getting rid of our chemical weapons, others ought to get rid of \ntheirs.\n  This is our treaty, as Secretary Albright said, ``Made in the USA.'' \nAnd we ought to be there to set the rules, to be the governing board, \nto assert our leadership at the moment that it is crucial after April \n29.\n  So I say simply to those who have qualms about articles X and XI, we \nare not going to give away the store, any of us, as patriotic \nAmericans. We would like to be at the table to make sure no one else \nentertains that thought. But I say again, whether we are there or not, \nthe treaty is going to happen after April 29. We better be there and, \nhopefully, with affirmative votes to strike this fifth situation we \nhave discussed this evening, this fifth condition, and for final \npassage, to vote for the treaty. These are very important for the \nforeign policy and security of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes and I ask to be \ninformed at the end of those 5 minutes. I am not going to take the time \nto speak to why this is a killer amendment and why this is so \nimportant, because I could not improve upon what the Senator from \nIndiana said. I mean that sincerely.\n\n  It is real basic. This gets down to real basic considerations. \nAnybody who has the capacity to transfer technology can do that right \nnow. They can do it right now. If they are in the treaty, the treaty \ndoes not require them to transfer that technology, but they, \ntheoretically, could transfer technology. If we are not in the treaty \nwe are not there to modulate their attitudes, their activities. We are \nout of the game.\n  This seems to me to be so simplistic and basic. But let me put on the \nhat I have been wearing for the past 5 years. I have been teaching \nconstitutional law at Widner University on Saturday mornings, a three-\ncredit course. You know the old joke is, if you want to learn a \nsubject, teach it. If I had spent nearly as much time studying it when \nI was in law school, as much time as I have spent teaching it, I would \nhave\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\nended up in the top of the class, not the bottom. I don't think I would \nhave the record the Senator from Indiana had, but it would be better.\n  But all kidding aside, there is something, to quote Elliot \nRichardson, our former Attorney General, and Abe Chayes, Harvard Law \nSchool professor, and a number of other professors, which I will submit \nfor the Record, there is, as the letter to me says, regarding article X \nand article XI, it says:\n\n       As it is axiomatic that all treaty provisions must be \n     interpreted in view of the purposes and objectives of the \n     treaty and that a subsidiary obligation should never be read \n     out of context to authorize behavior that would contravene a \n     primary obligation, nothing in article X or XI may undermine \n     article I . . ..\n\n  But the first part of that sentence--maybe I spent too much time in \nlaw schools. There is no legal scholar in America who will tell you \nthat you can read a subsidiary provision in a treaty, a document, a \ncontract or anything else, that contravenes the stated purpose of the \ntreaty--the stated purpose of the contract. You cannot do that.\n  Think about it. Forget being a lawyer, just think about it. How could \nyou write a contract, make a deal that said, ``This is our purpose,'' \nand five paragraphs later say, ``but if you don't want to meet the \npurpose, you don't have to.'' It is bizarre. This is an absolute \nbizarre interpretation.\n  Let me also point out--I wish my friend had not taken down their \nchart. The Senator's chart, those in opposition to my amendment, a \nchart on article XI, is somewhat incomplete. The paragraph that sat up \nthere for a half-hour or so, paragraph 2 in the chart, read, ``The \nstate party shall--'' and then it goes on, and then the subparagraphs \n(b) and (c) were shown. But they left out the remaining part of that. \nThe words that were missing are very key. They read as follows:.\n\n       Subject to the provisions of the convention and without \n     prejudice to the principles and applicable rules of \n     international law, the state party shall. . ..\n\n  That is the part they left out of article X and XI. What does article \nX and XI refer to? They are referring to article I.\n  I do not want to be overly technical here. This is not rocket \nscience. What does article I of the treaty say? It says:\n\n       Each State party to this convention undertakes never under \n     any circumstances:\n       (a) to develop or produce or otherwise acquire, stockpile \n     or retain chemical weapons or transfer, directly or \n     indirectly, chemical weapons to anyone;\n       (b) to use chemical weapons;\n       (c) to engage in any military preparation to use chemical \n     weapons;\n       (d) to assist, encourage or induce in any way anyone to \n     engage in any activity prohibited to a state party under this \n     convention.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 2 additional minutes under the bill.\n  Mr. President, what are we talking about here? Do you know what this \ndebate on article X and article XI reminds me of, speaking of law \nschool? The only thing I ever did do well in law school was moot court. \nI won that. Does that surprise you all? But I did.\n  It reminds me of what we used to do--maybe when my friend from \nIndiana was at Oxford. You would walk in and you would be presented a \nquestion. The question before the court or the question before the \nHouse is--and you got assigned a side and you came up with the best \narguments.\n  This reminds me of that, as if we all got together earlier today and \nsaid, OK, one side has to argue that article X and article XI do all \nthese terrible things. I am glad I did not get that side to argue. The \nreason is, it is much harder to make the case. My friend from Arizona, \nwho is an able trial lawyer, is doing a very good job. But, look, you \ncannot avoid the central purpose of the treaty and that is: Never, \nunder any circumstances, can any party assist, encourage, induce in any \nway anyone to engage in any prohibited activity.\n  I yield myself 2 more minutes on the bill.\n  So we are in a position here where I really understand the worry. \nBut, even if there was any merit to the reading that is given by my \nfriends, we have, in the conditions that we did support, we have two \nconditions which cover this--double cover it. We promise we are not \ngoing to transfer anything that is not medical in nature.\n  Mr. President, a party cannot do something in the treaty by \ntransferring material which would have the effect these Senators are \nworried about, because if it had the effect they were worrying about, \nthen it would be assisting, encouraging, inducing or in some way \nengaging in activity prohibited by the treaty. Chemical weapons are \nprohibited by the treaty.\n  To reiterate, Mr. President, this is a killer, pure and simple. This \nwill prevent the United States from joining the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  The condition requires the President to certify that he has achieved \nthe impossible: that he has been able to substantially rewrite the \ntreaty.\n  There is no chance--none--that he can achieve this by April 29, and \nit is highly unlikely that he can ever do so--because amendments may be \nblocked by any State party to the convention. If a party wants to keep \nus out--and thus render the treaty ineffective--it can easily do so.\n  Aside from the practical difficulties of rewriting a treaty that took \nnearly a decade to negotiate, there is no need to do so.\n  Let me start with article 10. The Senator from North Carolina wants \nto get rid of it completely.\n  Article 10 contains two paragraphs at issue. Paragraph three provides \nthat:\n\n       [E]ach State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have \n     the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of \n     equipment, material and scientific and technological \n     information concerning means of protection against chemical \n     weapons.\n\n  Note that this paragraph contains ambiguous terms like ``facilitate'' \nand ``possible.'' There's a reason for that--the negotiators did not \nwant us to make a concrete commitment.\n  And the Administration has made clear that it interprets this \nparagraph to mean that it will have the flexibility to decide what \nexchanges, if any, will occur under this paragraph.\n  On April 15, Sandy Berger wrote to me to say that:\n\n       . . . any exchange which does occur is limited to that \n     which we determine would be appropriate and permitted under \n     the Convention and consistent with our national export \n     controls on these heavily regulated items.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Joe: During the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's \n     hearings last week, concerns were again raised about the \n     impact of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) on the \n     ability of rogue states to acquire advanced chemical defense \n     or chemical manufacturing technology. I would like to take \n     the opportunity to elaborate further on these issues and set \n     the record straight.\n       First and foremost, I would like to take issue with the \n     charge that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and \n     the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which have language \n     similar to the CWC on promoting trade for peaceful purposes, \n     have hastened the spread of these dangerous weapons and \n     technologies. In fact, export controls in these areas have \n     been made tougher and these controls, as well as the treaties \n     themselves, have gained the support of more and more \n     countries over the years. In the early 1960s, President \n     Kennedy predicted that there would be 15-20 nuclear weapon \n     states by the 1970s. Due largely to the NPT, that number if \n     far lower today. Controls on biological weapons continue to \n     be strengthened, including in 1992, when the Australia Group \n     decided to add biological pathogens and related equipment to \n     their list of controlled items.\n       The CWC, like the NPT and the BWC, will result in a \n     strengthened export control regime on dangerous chemicals. \n     The CWC allows for maintenance and strengthening of the \n     controls already in place, while also formally expanding \n     controls over a broad range of chemicals and precursors. The \n     CWC also prohibits novel agents which are not currently \n     covered. The informal Australia Group consists of 30 \n     countries, while the CWC has been ratified by 72 countries \n     and the list is growing. Furthermore, the CWC provides for \n     trade restrictions against states who are not party to the \n     treaty.\n       Regarding the specific CWC Articles in question, one area \n     of concern has been whether Article X of the CWC might force \n     us to share advanced chemical defense technologies and \n     equipment with rogue nations like Iran and to assist in the \n     development of CW defensive capabilities. Let me assure you \n     that Article X does not require the U.S. or any other Party \n     to the treaty to share its advanced chemical weapons defense \n     technologies and equipment with countries such\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\n     as Iran or to assist them in the development of such \n     capabilities.\n       Although Paragraph 7 of Article 10 obligates States Parties \n     to provide assistance through the treaty organization in \n     response to a request by a State Party that has either been \n     threatened by the use of chemical weapons or has had chemical \n     weapons used against it, assistance is broadly defined in the \n     article as including medical antidotes and treatments. \n     Article X provides complete flexibility to States Parties to \n     determine what type of assistance they provide and how they \n     provide it. A State Party's obligation under paragraph 7 of \n     Article X may be met in one of three ways--by contributing \n     monies to a voluntary fund (managed by the treaty \n     organization); by concluding an agreement with the \n     organization concerning the procurement, if requested, of \n     specific types of assistance; or by declaring (within 180 \n     days after the CWC's entry-into-force) the kind of assistance \n     it might provide in response to an appeal by the \n     organization.\n       To meet its obligations under Article X, therefore, the \n     U.S. can choose from a variety of options and forms of \n     assistance. In no case would we be required to share advanced \n     chemical defense technology and equipment, or even to provide \n     older model gas masks. During our extensive negotiations with \n     Majority Leader Lott and the Task Force he established on the \n     CWC, the Administration has agreed to a binding condition, \n     regarding Article X, on the resolution of ratification that \n     will ensure that no assistance other than medical antidotes \n     and treatments is provided by the United States to any \n     country of concern.\n       A particular concern has also been raised about Paragraph 3 \n     of Article X. This paragraph states that ``Each Party \n     undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to \n     participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, \n     material and scientific and technological information \n     concerning means of protection against chemical weapons.'' \n     The inclusion of the words ``facilitate'' and ``possible'' \n     underscores that no specific exchange is required and that \n     any exchange which does occur is limited to that which we \n     determine would be appropriate and permitted under the \n     Convention and consistent with our national export controls \n     on these heavily regulated items. Paragraph 3 of Article X \n     does not override any other rights and obligations under \n     international law, such as the right to have export controls.\n       The concerns about Article X also include whether other \n     less scrupulous countries might seek to use this article as \n     an excuse to profiteer by giving away defense secrets. This \n     concern misses the main point, which is that any such \n     unscrupulous exchanges can take place now without the CWC. \n     With the CWC, the countries undertaking any exchanges in \n     Article X are legally bound by the fundamental obligation of \n     the treaty in Article I, which obligates Parties never to ``. \n     . . assist, encourage, or induce, in any way, anyone to \n     engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under this \n     Convention.'' The Chemical Weapons Convention will mean not \n     only that all relevant trade is subject to closer \n     scrutiny, especially with countries whose compliance may \n     be in doubt, but it will also provide the legal basis as \n     well as the verification and compliance measures to \n     redress those compliance concerns.\n       In this regard, concern has been raised specifically that \n     Paragraph 6 of Article X could provide the basis for other \n     Parties to argue that they must share defensive technologies. \n     Paragraph 6 states that ``Nothing in this Convention shall be \n     interpreted as impeding the right of States Parties to \n     request and provide assistance bilaterally . . . concerning \n     the emergency procurement of assistance.'' This paragraph \n     does not require or obligate a Party to provide emergency \n     bilateral assistance, but simply states that a party may \n     choose to provide such emergency assistance. Again, I would \n     underscore that with the CWC in force, any exchange of CW \n     defense assistance takes place within the framework of the \n     fundamental obligations of the treaty not to assist anyone in \n     acquiring a chemical weapons capability.\n       A specific concern also has been raised that Paragraph 5 of \n     Article X could be read to require the release of advanced \n     and classified information about defensive capabilities and \n     technologies. This is simply not the case. Paragraph 5 \n     requires the international Technical Secretariat which will \n     administer the Convention to establish and maintain ``for the \n     use of any requesting State Party, a data bank containing \n     freely available information concerning various means of \n     protection against chemical weapons as well as such \n     information as may be provided by States Parties.'' As stated \n     in the Article-by-Article Analysis submitted to the Senate on \n     November 23, 1993, ``freely available'' means ``from open \n     public sources.'' Further, the CWC imposes no obligation on \n     States Parties to contribute to this database. Hence, the \n     provision does not require the release of classified or \n     otherwise sensitive information about U.S. chemical defense \n     capabilities.\n       A second area of concern has been whether Article XI of the \n     CWC, which relates to cooperation in the field of chemical \n     activities for purposes not prohibited by the CWC, might \n     force our industry to share dual-use technologies and \n     manufacturing secrets with other nations. This is not what \n     the treaty says. Let me assure you that Article XI does not \n     require private businesses to release such proprietary or \n     otherwise confidential business information, nor does it \n     require the U.S. Government to force private businesses to \n     undertake such actions.\n       Article XI is explicitly subject to the fundamental ban in \n     Article I on assisting anyone in acquiring a chemical weapons \n     capability. Here again, far from undercutting export \n     controls, the CWC will be a basis for stronger controls, \n     enforced by more countries. I want to make clear that the \n     export controls that we and other Australia Group members \n     have undertaken, as well as our own national export \n     controls, are fully consistent with the CWC and will \n     further its implementation. This is not just a U.S. \n     Government position. In recent weeks, we have instructed \n     our embassies to confirm with our Australia Group partners \n     that they agree that the Group's export control and \n     nonproliferation measures are fully compatible with the \n     CWC. Our partners have confirmed this and have also \n     confirmed that they are committed to maintaining such \n     export control and nonproliferation measures in the \n     future.\n       In order to address the concerns raised about Article XI, \n     the Administration has agreed to a binding condition in our \n     negotiations with the Majority Leader's Task Force that would \n     have the President certify prior to the deposit of our \n     instrument of ratification that nothing in the Convention \n     obligates us to accept any weakening of our export controls, \n     that we maintain the right to impose export controls \n     unilaterally or collectively on chemicals and chemical \n     production technology, and that each member of the Australia \n     Group agrees that its export controls and nonproliferation \n     measures are consistent with the CWC and is committed to \n     maintaining such controls in the future.\n       Furthermore, as prescribed in the condition, the President \n     must certify on an annual basis that the Australia Group \n     continues to maintain equivalent or more effective controls \n     over exports and that it remains a viable mechanism for \n     limiting the spread of chemical and biological weapons-\n     related materials. If this certification cannot be made, the \n     President must consult with the Senate for the purpose of \n     obtaining a resolution of continued adherence to the \n     Convention.\n       I hope this information facilitates the Senate's \n     consideration of the CWC. I look forward to continuing to \n     work with you and other CWC supporters to ensure a successful \n     vote on this vital treaty in the days ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Moreover, as with any treaty, this paragraph must be read \nin light of the object and purpose of the convention. The purpose of \nthe treaty, quite obviously, is to ban chemical weapons.\n  And any nation which provides technology to a country of concern \nwould find itself in violation of the overriding obligation of Article \nOne of the treaty, which requires states ``never under any circumstance \n* * * to assist, encourage, or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in \nany activity prohibited to a state party under this Convention.''\n  This is an overriding obligation. It governs everything you do under \nthe treaty.\n  Ronald Lehman, the head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency \nduring the Reagan Administration, stated during a recent Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing that:\n\n       We made it very clear throughout the negotiations that all \n     of this was subject to [A]rticle I, which is the fundamental \n     obligation [under the Convention] not to assist. So we \n     reiterated that again and again and again. But the most \n     important, I think, telling factoid in support of the U.S. \n     interpretation is the fact that after the Convention was done \n     so many of the usual list of suspects were so unhappy that \n     they did not get what they wanted in these provisions.\n\n  On this point, I would also like to refer to a letter submitted to me \nby a group of eminent legal scholars, including Abe Chayes of Harvard \nLaw School, former State Department legal adviser, and Elliot \nRichardson, former Secretary of Defense and former Attorney General.\n  They write that the language in paragraph three which discusses that \neach State Party has the right to ``participate in exchanges of \nequipment'' is axiomatic--that is, it ``merely reaffirms current trade \npolicies that allow nations to exchange goods and services. Each State \nParty retains the right to participate in this trade at the level of \nits own choosing, including not to trade at all. There is no \naffirmative duty to trade * * *.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                   April 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: You have asked us to state whether \n     Articles X and XI of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) \n     require\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\n     States Parties to ``undertake to share everything that is \n     hard to achieve in a chemical weapons capability'' thereby \n     enabling States Parties to develop a ``militarily effective \n     chemical weapons capability.''\n       Before analyzing Articles X and XI, we note that the CWC \n     primarily obligates all States Parties, as set forth in \n     Article I, ``never under any circumstances'' to ``assist, \n     encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any \n     activity'' prohibited under the CWC. This includes the \n     obligations not to develop, produce, stockpile, acquire or \n     retain chemical weapons, and not to engage in any military \n     preparations to use chemical weapons. As it is axiomatic that \n     all treaty provisions must be interpreted in view of the \n     purposes and objects of that treaty and that a subsidiary \n     obligation should never be read out of context to authorize \n     behavior that would contravene a primary obligation, nothing \n     in Article X or XI may undermine Article I by assisting a \n     country in developing a chemical weapons capability.\n       Article X is titled ``Assistance and Protection Against \n     Chemical Weapons.'' Paragraph (7) is the only provision in \n     Article X which contains a specific obligation: each State \n     Party must elect to take one or more of three specified \n     measures of assistance. Under Agreed Condition 15 to the \n     Resolution of Ratification of Advice and Consent, the United \n     States, to meet its commitments, will only provide medical \n     antidotes and treatment to states not eligible for assistance \n     under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Nothing in \n     paragraph (7) can remotely be construed as requiring the \n     United States to provide equipment or assistance that would \n     enhance a rogue state's offensive or defensive chemical \n     weapons capability; again, a proper reading of the treaty as \n     a whole would prohibit the provision of assistance that would \n     encourage such a result.\n       Paragraph 2 clarifies that the CWC does not restrict a \n     State Party from researching chemical weapon protection \n     capabilities for purposes not prohibited. Paragraph 6 \n     clarifies that the CWC does not impede parties from providing \n     assistance or entering into bilateral agreements concerning \n     the emergency procurement of assistance. Neither of these \n     paragraphs compels any conduct whatsoever but merely enables \n     States Parties to pursue these activities without fear of \n     being in breach.\n       Article X, paragraph 3, asserts that: ``Each State Party \n     undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to \n     participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, \n     material and scientific and technological information \n     concerning means of protection against chemical weapons. In \n     our view, nothing in paragraph (3) requires the United States \n     to provide any particular matter or information. Accordingly, \n     this paragraph would require the United States to withhold, \n     either unilaterally or as part of a multilateral group, \n     materials or information that could enhance the chemical \n     weapons capability of any particular state.\n       That each State Party has the right to participate in \n     exchanges of equipment, etc. regarding chemical weapons \n     protection merely reaffirms current trade policies that allow \n     nations to exchange goods and services. Each State Party \n     retains the right to participate in this trade to the level \n     of its own choosing, including not to trade at all. There is \n     no affirmative duty to trade, but only a reaffirmation that \n     States Parties wishing to trade may do so without fear of \n     contravening the CWC. Under recognized principles of treaty \n     interpretation, the use of the intentionally vague and weak \n     verb ``undertakes to facilitate'' conveys no specific \n     affirmative obligation nor would the refusal to trade in \n     sensitive items support even the most tenuous claim that the \n     United States has breached its obligations.\n       Article XI is titled ``Economic and Technological \n     Development'' and seeks to balance free trade in chemicals, \n     equipment and technology with the prevention of proliferation \n     of chemical weapons. It is modeled on Article X of the \n     Biological Weapons Convention and is analogous to Article IV \n     of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) dealing with \n     peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Subparagraphs (b), (c), (d), \n     and (e) of paragraph 2 address the right of each State Party \n     to participate ``in the fullest possible exchange'' of \n     information; generally prohibits restrictions on trade; and \n     prohibits using the Convention as grounds for measures not \n     provided under the CWC. Only paragraph (2)(e) contains an \n     affirmative obligation: each State Party must review its \n     existing national regulations to make them consistent with \n     the CWC. The remainder of its provisions clarify that the CWC \n     should not restrict commercial and research activity that \n     would be otherwise permissible. Moreover, these provisions \n     are explicitly balanced against general provisions, \n     including: (1) ``without prejudice to the principles and \n     applicable rules of international law,'' (2) ``for purposes \n     not prohibited under this Convention'', (3) ``other peaceful \n     purposes'', and (4) to ``render them consistent with the \n     objects and purpose of the Convention''.\n       Article XI, when read in its entirety and together with \n     Article I, undoubtedly permits the United States to continue \n     national security controls over exports of chemical weapons \n     material, equipment and dual use items. We believe that \n     Agreed Condition 7 to the Resolution of Ratification of \n     Advice and Consent the continuing vitality of the Australia \n     Group and national export controls is consistent with Article \n     X and XI, and the CWC as a whole. Accordingly, we believe \n     that Agreed Condition 7 should alleviate concerns raised by \n     critics of the CWC concerning United States obligations under \n     Articles X or XI. Furthermore, we would note that the United \n     States has never been prevented (or seriously challenged) \n     from legally pursuing unilateral and multilateral export \n     controls on nuclear technology that it deems necessary on \n     national security grounds, despite objections from certain \n     states citing Article IV of the NPT. We do not believe that \n     the CWC requires any different course.\n       Throughout the Chemical Weapons Convention is a manifest \n     effort to balance the elimination of chemical weapons with \n     the legitimate security requirements of States as well as \n     their legitimate need to use, develop and trade chemicals for \n     commercial purposes. The critical characterization of the CWC \n     quoted in the first paragraph of this letter focuses on \n     selected provisions of the CWC reflecting only one side of \n     this balancing effort, misreads those provisions to render \n     them obligatory instead of voluntary or conditional, and \n     ignores the language of the treaty as well as principles of \n     international law. We disagree. We do not believe Articles X \n     and XI require the United States to take any steps contrary \n     to its security interests. Accordingly, we do believe that \n     Disagreed Condition 32, which would require an amendment to \n     strike Article X and amend Article XI, is legally unnecessary \n     to preserve U.S. security interests if the United States \n     ratifies the CWC.\n           Respectfully,\n     Abe Chayes,\n       Harvard Law School.\n     Elliot L. Richardson,\n       Former Secretary of Defense and Attorney General, Nixon \n     Administration.\n     Michael Moodie,\n       Former Bush Administration arms control negotiator.\n     John B. Rhinelander,\n       Former deputy legal advisor and arms control negotiator, \n     Nixon Administration.\n     George Bunn,\n       Center for International Security and Arms Control, \n     Stanford University.\n     Barry Kellman,\n       DePaul University Law School.\n     David Koplow,\n       Georgetown University Law School.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. More to the point, even if we were obligated--which we're \nnot, we maintain export controls on chemical defense equipment. In \nother words, we do not allow it to be sold to the rogue states.\n  The only specific obligation contained in Article Ten is in paragraph \nseven, which is where you provide assistance to nations facing attack \nby chemical weapons.\n  This provision also has much flexibility--it allows a nation to \nchoose one of three methods for providing assistance.\n  But to ensure that this paragraph does not become a loophole, we have \nadded a binding condition, condition number fifteen, which limits the \ntype of assistance we will provide--at least when it comes to countries \nineligible for economic or military assistance, which includes the \nrogue states--to medical antidotes and treatment.\n  Let me now turn to Article Eleven. The proponents of this condition \ncontend that this article requires us to weaken our export controls \nunder the CWC.\n  There is nothing in the CWC that requires us to weaken our export \ncontrols. But just to ensure that there isn't any doubt, we have agreed \nto a binding condition that addresses the problem.\n  Condition seven requires the President to certify that nothing in the \nConvention requires us to weaken our export controls, and that the \nAustralia Group--an informal group of potential supplier states to \nwhich the United States belongs--will continue to maintain controls \nover chemical weapons precursors that are equal to, or exceed, those in \neffect today.\n  the Australia Group has already indicated, as a group, that it would \nmaintain its export controls. On October 17, 1996--a little more \nrecently than the statement read by the Senator from Arizona--the \nAustralia Group stated that the ``maintenance of effective export \ncontrols will remain an essential practical means of fulfilling \nobligations under the CWC.''\n  But just to be sure, I asked the administration to ask each country--\nindividually--whether it intended to maintain existing levels of \ncontrols. The answers have come back--all in\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\nthe affirmative--as the president stated today in his letter to the \nmajority leader.\n  Finally, the President committed today, in the event that either \nArticle Ten or Article Eleven to legitimate trade in a manner that \nendangers our security, the President will consult promptly with \nCongress on whether we should withdraw from the Convention.\n  This is an extraordinary commitment. So I hope it resolves everyone's \nconcern.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time on the bill. I \nthink I have used up all the time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining on the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Oh, there is 1 minute remaining on the amendment? Mr. \nPresident, in that case I have another 10 minutes.\n  No, if the majority is ready to yield back their time, I will yield \nback my minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. A bum deal, just like this treaty.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I always enjoy holding court with my friend \nfrom Delaware. We have had some of these debates in the past, and this \nis the thing that lawyers like to argue about, but I believe that most \nlawyers will agree with me that what they learned in law school was \nthat the specific provisions of the contract always prevail over a \ngeneral statement at the beginning of the contract. There are a lot of \nrules of instruction. Later provisions generally govern over previous \nprovisions on the theory that you later describe your intent, fully \ncognizant of what existed before. The same thing is true with specific \nprovisions of the contract, and that is why article I is called, not \n``CWC article I,'' but rather ``general article.'' ``Article I, General \nObligations.''\n  Then article II is definitions, and after that are the specifics. \nThis is the reason why the Australia Group itself issued a statement \nright after this convention was entered into undertaking to review, in \nlight of the implementation of the convention, the measures that they \ntake to ``prevent the spread of chemical substances and equipment for \npurposes contrary to the objectives of the convention with the aim of \nremoving such measures for the benefit of states parties to the \nconvention acting in full compliance with the obligations under the \nconvention.''\n  Australia Group members would not have had to do this under the \ninterpretation of the convention by my friend from Delaware. Rather, \nthey began to do this because they read articles X and XI the same as \nthe many experts do that I cited earlier as limiting our ability to \nimpose trade restrictions on states parties to the convention. That is \nwhy it says we will undertake to facilitate, and the other states \nparties have the right to the fullest possible trade in these chemical \nweapons. This is not just my view. I read to you what Secretary Cheney \nsaid before, James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense and head of \nthe CIA. It is plain that article X legitimizes such transfers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 33 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter dated October 17, 1996--speaking of superseding--\nwhich supersedes the statement referred to by my colleague about the \nAustralia Group. It says:\n\n       In this context, the maintenance of effective export \n     controls will remain an essential practical means of \n     fulfilling obligations under the CWC and the BTWC.\n\n  Translated into ordinary English, it means that we adhere to the \ncommitment we made in the Australia Group with export controls. We \nbelieve it is consistent with the CWC and required by the CWC.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                        Australia Group Meeting\n\n       Australia Group participants held informal consultations in \n     Paris between Oct. 14-17, to discuss the continuing problem \n     of chemical and biological weapons (CBW) proliferation. \n     Participants at these talks were Argentina, Australia, \n     Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the \n     European Commission, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, \n     Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, \n     Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, \n     Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom \n     and the United States, with the Republic of Korea taking part \n     for the first time.\n       Paticipants maintain a strong belief that full adherence to \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and to the Biological \n     and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) will be the best way to \n     eliminate these types of particularly inhumane weapons from \n     the world's arsenals. In this context, the maintenance of \n     effective export controls will remain an essential practical \n     means of fulfilling obligations under the CWC and the BTWC.\n       All participants at the meeting welcomed the expected entry \n     into force of the CWC*, noting that this long-awaited step \n     will be an important, historic moment in international \n     efforts to prohibit chemical weapons. Participants agreed to \n     issue a separate statement on this matter, which is attached.\n       Participants also welcomed the progress of efforts to \n     strengthen the BTWC in the negotiations taking place in the \n     Ad Hoc Group of BTWC States Parties in Geneva. All Australia \n     Group participating countries are also States Parties to this \n     Treaty, and strongly support efforts to develop \n     internationally-agreed procedures for strengthening \n     international confidence in the treaty regime by verifying \n     compliance with BTWC obligations.\n       Experts from participating countries discussed national \n     export licensing systems aimed at preventing inadvertent \n     assistance to the production of CBW. They confirmed that \n     participants administered export controls in a streamlined \n     and effective manner which allows trade and the exchange of \n     technology for peaceful purposes to flourish. They agreed to \n     continue working to focus these national measures efficiently \n     and solely on preventing any contribution to chemical and \n     biological weapons programs. Participants noted that the \n     value of these measures in inhibiting CBW proliferation \n     benefited not only the countries participating in the \n     Australia Group, but the whole international community.\n       Participants also agreed to continue a wide range of \n     contacts, including a further program of briefings for \n     countries not participating in the Paris consultations to \n     further awareness and understanding of national policies in \n     this area. Participants endorsed in this context the \n     importance of regional seminars as valuable means of widening \n     contacts with other countries on these issues. In particular, \n     Romania's plans to host a seminar on CBW export controls for \n     Central and Eastern European countries and the Commonwealth \n     of Independent States in Bucharest on Oct. 21-22 and Japan's \n     plans to host a fourth Asian Export Control Seminar in Tokyo \n     in early 1997 were warmly welcomed by participants. Argentina \n     will also host a regional seminar on non-proliferation \n     matters, in Buenous Aires, in the first week of December \n     1996. France will organize a seminar for French-speaking \n     countries on the implementation of the CWC. This will take \n     place shortly before entry into force of the Convention.\n       The meeting also discussed relevant aspects of terrorist \n     interest in CBW and agreed that this serious issue requires \n     continuing attention.\n       Participants agreed to hold further consultations in \n     October 1997.\n\n\n AUSTRALIA GROUP COUNTRIES WELCOME PROSPECTIVE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE \n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n       The countries participating in the Australia Group warmly \n     welcomed the expected entry into force of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention (CWC) during a meeting of the Group in \n     Paris in October 1996. They noted that the long awaited \n     commencement of the CWC regime, including the establishment \n     of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, \n     will be an historic watershed in global efforts to abolish \n     chemical weapons for all time. They also noted that all \n     states adhering to the CWC are obliged to ensure their \n     national activities support the goal of a world free of \n     chemical weapons.\n       All of the participating countries reiterated their \n     previous statement underlining their intention to be among \n     the original States Parties to the CWC. They noted that 24 of \n     the 30 countries participating in the Australia Group have \n     already ratified the Convention. Representatives also \n     recalled their previous expressions of support for the CWC, \n     and reaffirmed these commitments. They restated their view \n     that the effective operation and implementation of the CWC \n     offers the best means available to the international \n     community to rid the world of these weapons for all time. \n     They called on all signatories to ratify the CWC as soon as \n     possible, and on the small number of countries which have not \n     signed the Treaty to join the regime and thereby contribute \n     to international efforts to ban these weapons.\n       Representatives at the Australia Group meeting recalled \n     that all of the participating countries are taking steps at \n     the national level to ensure that relevant national \n     regulations promote the object and purpose of the CWC and are \n     fully consistent with the Convention's provisions when the \n     CWC enters into force for each of these countries. They noted \n     that the practical experience each\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\n     country had obtained in operating export licensing systems \n     intended to prevent assistance to chemical weapons programs \n     have been especially valuable in each country's preparations \n     for implementation of key obligations under the CWC. They \n     noted in this context, that these national systems are aimed \n     solely at avoiding assistance for activities which are \n     prohibited under the Convention, while ensuring they do not \n     restrict or impede trade and other exchanges facilitated by \n     the CWC.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto use the 5 minutes allocated to each leader for purposes of closing \ndebate in addition to my 15 minutes for the leader in an effort to make \nmy statement at this point in the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by commending the \ndistinguished majority leader for his leadership on this issue and for \nhis eloquent statement earlier today. I think he spoke for a large \nnumber of the American people, both Republicans and Democrats in coming \nto the conclusion he did about this treaty. I rise to commend him and \nto support him in the decision that he made.\n  I also wish to commend the distinguished ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, the Senator from Delaware, for his \nleadership on our side of the aisle. No one could have managed this \nbill better. And we could not have come to this point were it not for \nthe remarkable commitment he has made in the effort to pass this \ntreaty. I thank him for his leadership in bringing us to this point \ntonight.\n  Under the terms of article II, section 2 of the Constitution, the \nSenate alone was granted the power to advise and consent to treaties \nmade by the President. Our Founding Fathers also decided that approval \nby a simple majority was simply not sufficient for legislation of this \nmagnitude. Instead, they established the requirement that two-thirds of \nthe Senate must support a treaty for it to take effect.\n  This is as it should be. There is no more important or unique power \nassigned to the Senate by the Constitution than the authority to \nprovide advice and consent on treaties. With this authority, however, \ncomes obligations. Senators must examine a treaty not through a prism \nof narrow political pursuits, but rather from the perspective of broad \nnational interests.\n  Put simply, the most important question we should ask ourselves when \nconsidering the Chemical Weapons Convention, or any other treaty, is, \ndoes this make sense for the Nation and are its citizens more secure?\n  Mr. President, after a thorough review of this treaty, its \nnegotiating history, and the 28 conditions added by the Senate, I \nbelieve the answer to this question is a resounding and unqualified \nyes.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, \nstockpiling, and use of toxic chemicals as weapons. A look at the \nnegotiating history of the CWC reveals that this treaty is truly a \nbipartisan product. Negotiations, as has been mentioned now on several \noccasions throughout the day, began with President Reagan in the early \n1980s.\n  While the bulk of the negotiations and most of the difficult \ndecisions occurred during the Bush administration, President Clinton \nfinished the work started by his two predecessors and submitted the \ntreaty to the Senate for consideration in November of 1993.\n  The Senate's counsel on crucial issues was sought and provided \nrepeatedly throughout the course of the decade-long negotiations. \nPlaying an especially important role in this regard was the Senate's \nArms Control Observer Group, a bipartisan gathering of Senators with \nspecial interests and expertise in arms control matters. Currently, \nSenators Stevens and Byrd lead the group.\n  In addition, since the treaty has been before the Senate for nearly 3 \nyears, Members have had ample opportunity to request the information \nneeded to reach their judgment, and more than sufficient time to carry \nout a thorough examination of the treaty's impact on our national \nsecurity.\n  During that 3-year period, nearly 20 hearings have been conducted in \nseveral different Senate committees, including Armed Services, Foreign \nRelations, Intelligence, and Judiciary. In addition, the administration \nhas made available over 1,500 pages of documentation on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention and answered over 300 questions from Senators and \ntheir staffs.\n  Moreover, as a result of intensive, around-the-clock negotiating \nsessions between the administration, Senator Helms and Senator Biden, \nthe resolution of ratification now contains 28 separate conditions on \nthe U.S. Senate's resolution of ratification. That is 28 individual \nclarifications by the Senate about the terms and conditions under which \nthe U.S. would enter into the Chemical Weapons Convention. These \nconditions were the product of over 100 hours of discussion. And I am \ntold that the vast majority of the conditions address problems first \nraised by Republicans. I think it is safe to say that these list of \nconditions address virtually every legitimate concern that has been \nraised about the potential impact of the CWC on our national security \nand economy.\n\n  Mr. President, we must now evaluate what has been revealed during \nthis process that has spanned three Presidential Administrations and \nincludes numerous hearings, briefings and mounds of documents. What \nhave we determined about the merits of the CWC in the nearly 3\\1/2\\ \nyears since President Clinton submitted it to us?\n  First, officials from previous Administrations who were involved in \nthe CWC negotiations support the treaty. General Brent Scowcroft, the \nNational Security Advisor to Presidents Reagan and Bush, has said the \nfollowing:\n\n       ``The time has come for the Senate to uphold U.S. \n     leadership in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction by providing its consent to the [Chemical \n     Weapons] Convention.\n\n  And President Bush himself, in a February meeting with Secretary of \nState Madeleine Albright and former Secretary of State James Baker, \nnoted:\n\n       ``I . . . strongly support efforts to get this chemical \n     weapons treaty approved. This should be beyond partisanship. \n     I think it is vitally important for the United States to be \n     out front. . . . We don't need chemical weapons, and we ought \n     to get out front and make clear that we are opposed to others \n     having them.''\n\n  Second, what are the views of America's chemical manufacturers--the \nindustry that will be most directly affected by the provisions of the \nCWC? The chemical industry is America's largest export industry, \nposting $60 billion in export sales last year alone. Opponents of this \ntreaty claim its ratification will lead to onerous and costly\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\nrestrictions and regulations on this industry as well as the exposure \nof confidential, proprietary information.\n  The chemical industry has repeatedly refuted these claims; yet, it \nappears that CWC's critics are so blinded by their ideological zeal to \nkill all arms control treaties that they cannot take no for an answer. \nOne of the industry's best responses was contained in a letter sent \nlate last year to the distinguished Majority leader, Senator Lott. This \nletter is an important one, so I will quote it at length:\n\n       ``The chemical industry has long supported the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention. Our industry participated in negotiating \n     the agreement and in U.S. and international implementation \n     efforts. The treaty contains substantial protections for \n     confidential business information. We know because industry \n     helped to draft these provisions . . . In short, our industry \n     has thoroughly examined and tested this Convention. We have \n     concluded that the benefits of the CWC far outweigh the \n     costs. . . . Indeed, the real price would come from not \n     ratifying the CWC. . . . If the Senate does not vote in favor \n     of the CWC, we stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in overseas sales, putting at risk thousands of good-paying \n     American jobs.''\n\n  So says the chemical industry in a letter signed by the CEOs of 53 of \nAmerica's preeminent chemical manufacturers. Signees include the ARCO \nChemical Company, the Ashland Chemical Company, the Bayer Corporation, \nthe B.F. Goodrich Company, the Dow Chemical Company, the Eastman \nChemical Company, the E.I. Dupont Company, the Exon Chemical Company \nand the Monsanto Company. I should also note that these companies \nissued this statement before we agreed upon the 28 conditions I \ndiscussed earlier, several of which would further reduce the \npossibility that proprietary information from American businesses would \nfall into the hands of our adversaries.\n  Well, Mr. President, what about the military? After all, it is our \nmen and women in uniform who must face, as they did in Desert Storm, \nthe threat of an attack from lethal chemical weapons. Make no mistake. \nWe are talking about invisible and instantaneous killers. What about \nour people in the Pentagon who have to make the decisions that may \nultimately lead to the exposure of our troops to that insidious threat? \nGeneral Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       ``The potential benefits of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     will have a positive impact on the lives of our service \n     people and how the U.S. military fulfills its responsibility \n     to national security.''\n\n  In another appearance before the Foreign Relations Committee, General \nShalikashvili noted:\n\n       ``From a military perspective, the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention is clearly in our national interest. The non-\n     proliferation aspects of the convention will retard the \n     spread of chemical weapons and, in so doing, reduce the \n     probability that U.S. forces may encounter chemical weapons \n     in a regional conflict.''\n\n  Some may argue that General Shalikashvili is but one general who was \nappointed by President Clinton. To those skeptics, let me say three \nthings. First, General Shalikashvili's record of service to this \ncountry is unparalleled. Second, a comprehensive review of this record \nwill not reveal a single instance where he failed to offer anything but \nthan his objective, untarnished opinion. Third, he is not alone.\n\n  An April 3 letter to the President states the following:\n\n       The CWC destroys stockpiles that could threaten our troops; \n     it significantly improves our intelligence capabilities; and \n     it creates new international sanctions to punish those states \n     who remain outside of the treaty. For these reasons, we \n     strongly support the CWC.\n\n  Mr. President, that letter was sent on behalf of 16 three- and four-\nstar generals and admirals, including Colin Powell, John Vessey, and \nNorman Schwartzkopf. This letter, in addition to an endorsement by \nDavid Jones, means that every occupant in the last 20 years of the \nposition of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this Nation's \nhighest military office, has come out in support of the CWC.\n  The final group the Senate has heard from in its efforts to weigh the \npros and cons of the Chemical Weapons Convention is the intelligence \ncommunity. The task of verifying this treaty, like other arms control \ntreaties, ultimately falls on the shoulders of the Central Intelligence \nand the other organizations within the intelligence community. Despite \nthe most comprehensive, intrusive verification regime in the history of \narms control, critics of CWC argue that it is unverifiable; if they had \ntheir way, the Senate would reject the CWC because the intelligence \ncommunity will be unable to detect any violations of the treaty itself. \nBut in this case, the perfect is the enemy of the good.\n  While the intelligence community has rightly acknowledged that it \ncannot detect any production of chemical agents--anywhere or at \nanytime--it has also said that it can effectively verify the provisions \nof this treaty. Moreover, the critics' argument ignores the fact that, \nwith or without the Chemical Weapons Convention, our intelligence \ncommunity will still seek to collect information on efforts by foreign \nnations to develop and produce chemical weapons. The more important \nquestion is whether our intelligence and nonproliferation efforts are \nhelped or hindered by the adoption of the treaty.\n  According to James Woolsey, then director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, and since confirmed by George Tenet, acting director of the \nCIA:\n\n       The Intelligence community has the broader mission--with or \n     without the treaty--of detecting the existence and assessing \n     the threat from chemical weapons programs of any country. \n     This mission must be carried out regardless of whether we \n     have the additional requirement to assess such activities \n     against the provisions of the treaty. And it is to this \n     broader mission that the CWC can make a significant \n     contribution.\n\n  The Senate has heard from President Reagan's National Security \nAdvisor, from President Bush, from the leading figures in the chemical \nindustry, from the current chairman of the JCS, three of his \npredecessors and 14 other three- and four-star generals and admirals, \nand from the intelligence community. Each of these groups and \nindividuals have looked at the CWC from their unique perspectives and \ninterests and each has reached the same conclusion: the Senate should \nsupport this treaty and should do so promptly.\n  Mr. President, I would submit since the Senate received the CWC \ntreaty for its advice and consent, one other group has spoken all too \nloudly to us: those who commit terrorist acts. In the 3\\1/2\\ years this \ntreaty has been before the Senate, terrorist incidents have occurred \nwith a sickening and disturbing regularity: the sarin gas attack in the \nTokyo subway; the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma \nCity; the attack on Khobar Towers in Dharan, Saudi Arabia; the \nsuspected bombing of TWA flight 800; the bombing in Olympic Park in \nAtlanta. Each incident has painfully dramatized the fact that we live \nin an age where, unfortunately, no one is inoculated against the threat \nof terrorism. No community stands outside the reach of determined \nterrorists. As President Clinton noted in a recent address, ``Terrorism \nhas become an equal opportunity destroyer, with no respect for \nborders.''\n  This treaty is an opportunity to send a small message to those who \nthreaten our families, our communities and our way of life with their \nunprovoked acts of violence.\n  The United States Senate has heard what terrorists have to say. \nToday, with our votes on this treaty, we determine how the United \nStates Senate will respond to these acts. I hope we will send the \nmessage that we are going to do all we can to ensure that these deadly \nchemicals will never be the means terrorists employ to advance their \ncause. It is time we said to the terrorists, on the issue of chemical \nweapons, enough is enough.\n  Now the argument will be made that this treaty will not halt \nterrorism, will not shut down the private laboratories of insane \nextremists and will not halt the efforts of various rogue nations.\n  To a certain degree, that is probably true. But what this treaty will \ndo is begin the orchestration of a concert of nations--an orchestration \nof civilized voices that speaks out forcefully against an unambiguous \nevil.\n  Tonight America has the opportunity to make the moral stand. We are \ndestroying our own chemical stockpiles. We began that cleansing process \nunder President Reagan and it continues today. Why should we oppose a \ntreaty that demands the world to live up to a moral standard that we \nhave already willingly accepted ourselves? Why deprive ourselves of the \nright to call upon our neighbors to live up to the example\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nthat we in the United States are willing to act?\n  In summary, Mr. President, this is a necessary treaty. It has been \nendorsed by a bipartisan group of Senators who are experts on this \nissue, by advisors to Presidents Reagan and Bush, and President \nClinton, by the U.S. military, by our chemical industry and by our \nintelligence community.\n  To all of this I would add two final points. First, over 80 percent \nof the American people have indicated their support for ridding the \nworld of toxic agents by ratifying the CWC. Second, over 70 countries \nhave already ratified this treaty and thereby forsworn the use of \nchemical weapons. Mr. President, this treaty is going to happen with or \nwithout us. I urge the Members of this body to set aside partisan \ndifferences, demonstrate leadership to our friends and enemies alike, \njoin with those who have already ratified this treaty and take the \nfirst step toward eliminating these evil weapons. Mr. President, I ask \nthat the Senate ratify this treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 21 \nminutes, the Senator from Delaware has 7 minutes, the Senator from \nVermont has 8\\1/2\\ minutes, and the majority leader has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself such time as I may consume under the 7 \nminutes. I do not plan on using it all.\n  Mr. President, it has been a long road to this spot, this point. We \nhave had not only extensive debate in the last 2 days, we have had an \nextensive debate on this floor, in committees, in the press, among \nforeign policy experts, think-tank types, for the past 3 years. We \nreached the point where we are constitutionally required to fulfill a \nduty of either giving our consent to ratification or withholding it. As \nboth leaders have pointed out, it is maybe the most significant \nresponsibility delegated to the U.S. Senate\n  I realize that we sometimes stand on this floor, particularly when \nany one of us and all of us have invested a significant amount of time \nin one issue or another where we feel that we have spent most of our \nwaking hours for the past month, two, or three--everyone has \nexperienced that on this floor--and we tend to think that since we put \nso much time into the passage of a piece of legislation, or in this \ncase, a treaty, that maybe it is the most important thing that the \nSenate has done or could do because I guess we say to ourselves we \nwould not invest that much of our time, our energy, our mind, our soul, \ninto the effort if it was not so important.\n  Acknowledging that we all err on that side of thinking what we do is \nsometimes more important than what it is, I respectfully suggest that \nthe vote each of us is about to cast on this treaty is likely to be the \nmost significant vote any of us cast in this Congress.\n  Twice today I have been referred to as the senior Senator from \nDelaware. I want the record to show, I know I am the junior Senator. I \nam the second most senior junior Senator in the United States. I have \nbeen here 25 years, but that young man in the back there is the most \nsenior junior Senator, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nSenator Hollings, because the most senior Senator of senior Senators is \nhis colleague, Senator Thurmond.\n  Mr. President, I am not sure that there is any vote that I have cast \nin the last 4 or 5 years that I think is as significant for the future \nof the United States as this treaty. And as I said, and I will conclude \nwith this, not merely because of what the treaty attempts to do--and \nthat is, for the first time in the history of modern man, ban even the \npossession of an entire category of weaponry--but that is not the \nreason why this is the most important vote. We are at a juncture in our \nhistory, Mr. President, in my opinion, where the United States has an \nopportunity, which rarely comes to any nation in its history--it has \ncome to us, in my opinion, on two occasions--where our actions and our \nleadership can literally, not figuratively--and it is not hyperbole--\ncan literally shape, at least on the margins, the future of the world.\n\n  After World War II, we stepped up to the plate. My father's \ngeneration and my grandfather's generation and grandmother's and my \nmother's generation stepped up to the plate. They did things, when we \nlook back on them, that must have taken incredible courage. Can you \nimagine having over 10 million men still under arms and standing up as \na Senator, or as a President, or as a Secretary of State, and saying, \nby the way, I want us now to send billions of dollars to those people \nwho killed our sons and daughters? That was the Marshall Plan. Can you \nimagine the foresight it took and how difficult it must have been to \ncast a vote to set up an outfit called NATO, of which Germany, our \nsworn enemy that killed our sons and daughters, were members? Those \npeople had courage. But they did what the Senator from Indiana, Senator \nLugar, said: They led.\n  This is about leadership. This is about the role of the United States \nin leading the world. If we refrain from exercising that opportunity--\nand we will if we do not vote for this treaty--we will have passed up \nan opportunity that, as I said, rarely comes to any nation in the \nhistory of the world. We can affect, if we are wise, the behavior, \nactivity and actions for a generation to come, not for what is \ncontained in this treaty, but because of the leadership that was \ndemonstrated in drafting this treaty, in ratifying this treaty and \nenforcing this treaty.\n  So, Mr. President, I realize that all of us--myself included--tend to \nengage in hyperbole and rhetoric that doesn't mean the substance of \nwhat we are talking about. But I honestly believe this is one of the \nmost important votes, in terms of the future of this country and its \nability to lead at a moment in history that seldom comes to any nation, \nthat may be the most important vote that any of us will cast. If we \nembark on this path of continuing to engage the world and lead the \nworld, we maintain the reasonable prospect that we can make the world--\nthe world--a better place in which to live.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am profoundly disappointed in the five votes of the \nSenate on the important, vital amendments. After all the debate, all \nthe gallons of newspaper ink spilled, all of the negotiations--\nultimately, I had hoped for better. But so be it.\n  There isn't a person in this room, rhetoric aside, who can believe \nthat the amendments that we have just considered are ``killer \namendments.'' The nature of international relations, and of treaties is \nthat what is negotiated can be renegotiated, and if necessary, \nnegotiated anew. If our aim is a better future, what are a hundred more \nmeetings in Geneva, or Vienna or the Hague? These amendments would have \nensured that this treaty did no harm, even if it did no good.\n  Now, we must vote on a treaty that, stripped of these key \nprotections, four former Defense Secretaries have told us is contrary \nto the national security interests of the United States.\n  The truth is that I cannot abide the pretense of action on a matter \nas weighty as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. If we \nratify this treaty today, the Senate, with the President, will announce \nto the world that we have done something about the scourge of chemical \nweapons. We will pat ourselves on the back and go home.\n  But, Mr. President, we will have done nothing. And, worse than \nnothing, we will have done harm. In the name of curbing the \nproliferation of these chemicals, we will allow rogue states to gain \naccess to our most precious defense secrets. We will guarantee that \nrogue nations of the World--both those who have signed this treaty and \nthose who have not--have the ability to manufacture chemical weapons \nand penetrate our Nation's most advanced chemical defenses.\n  Article X and XI--``Poisons for Peace''--will foster the \nproliferation of those very poisons. Anyone who doubts that need only \nlook to how Russia has abused similar provisions in the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty. The N.P.T.'s ``Atoms for Peace'' provisions \nallows Russia to transfer to Iran, a terrorist state, a nuclear \nreactor. Russia has argued that the sale is perfectly legal, and Russia \nis right. Iran, despite its nuclear weapons program and its chemical \nweapons program, is a nation\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nin full compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And so it will \nget one nuclear reactor from Russia, maybe more. And perhaps China will \nthrow in a reactor or two as well. And we can do nothing to stop it.\n  The administration says that we will not sell Iran chemical \ntechnology or defensive gear under the similar provisions of the CWC. \nWe are not selling them nuclear reactors either. Russia is.\n  And it will not be the United States which provides Iran the chemical \ntechnology. They will get it from Russia and China under ``Poisons for \nPeace.'' And Iran will give it to its terrorist allies Syria and Libya, \nwho have not signed up to the treaty. And we will be powerless to \nprotest--because if we ratify this treaty, here, today, in this body, \nwe will have endorsed those transfers.\n  Now this morning the President has offered us some sweeteners for the \nhemlock he is asking us to swallow. He promises to keep an eye on any \nproblems Articles X and XI may cause. I appreciate his willingness to \nrecognize the legitimacy of the concerns my colleagues and I have \nexpressed. However, I can't help but feel that this last ditch attempt \nto buy off opponents to this dangerous treaty is nothing more than \nempty promises.\n  I am a veteran of the counter-proliferation wars. Every week, I see \nmore and more classified information about proliferation activities \nthat should require the President, under existing law, to levy \nsanctions against Russia, China, or both. We never do, and we won't \nunder the terms of the CWC with or without the assurances under Article \nX and XI. The President doesn't want to fight with those 800-pound \ngorillas. In much the same way as we will turn a blind eye while Russia \nhelps Iran get a nuclear weapon, we will allow others to develop \nchemical weapons. And there won't be a darn thing we'll be able to do.\n  Should Articles 10 and 11 of the CWC be renegotiated? Yes. Did the \nSenate err by stripping out the protections we inserted that would have \nrequired the administration to do so? Yes. And I am deeply disappointed \nthat I was unable to convince my colleagues of the danger to the people \nof the United States and our allies. We have made a terrible, \npotentially cataclysmic, mistake today in ignoring the desperate need \nto revise the terms of this treaty.\n  Without revision of Articles 10 and 11, this treaty is bad for \nAmerica, and bad for the world. It must be voted down. For it we ratify \nthis treaty, our children and our grandchildren will hold us \naccountable. They will hold us accountable when Iran or Syria or Libya \nor North Korea finally uses a chemical weapon--and they will do so--\nbuilt with technology they acquired thanks to Articles 10 and 11 of the \nCWC. They will look back on this debate, look back on where each us of \nstood, and--mark my words--they will hold us accountable.\n  Mr. President, let us listen to the wisdom of the four former \nSecretaries of Defense, who have urged us to oppose this treaty. Let us \nlisten to the mountain of evidence--classified and unclassified--that \nhas been presented over the past two days as to the dangers posed by \nthis treaty. And most important, let us listen to our consciences. Let \nus vote to reject the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 52\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for Mr. Biden, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 52.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 18, strike ``payments'' and insert ``any \n     payment''.\n       On page 6, line 3, strike ``the head of''.\n       On page 8, line 2, insert ``or such other organization, as \n     the case may be,'' after ``nization''.\n       On page 8, line 10, insert ``or the affiliated \n     organization'' after ``tion''.\n       On page 9, line 11, insert ``or the affiliated \n     organization'' after ``Organization''.\n       On page 9, line 17, insert ``or the affiliated \n     organization'' after ``Organization''.\n       On page 13, line 21, insert ``, and any official or \n     employee thereof'' after ``it''.\n       On page 14, line 5, insert ``, and any official or employee \n     thereof'' after ``functions''.\n       On page 15, lines 6 and 7, strike ``to United States \n     ratification'' and insert ``affecting the object and \n     purpose''.\n       On page 18, line 2, insert ``support for'' after \n     ``resolution of''.\n       On page 20, line 12, strike ``citizens,'' and insert \n     ``citizens and''.\n       On page 23, line 18, strike ``obligation'' and insert \n     ``obligations''.\n       On page 25, line 19, strike the comma.\n       On page 32, line 13, insert ``of Representatives'' after \n     ``House''.\n       On page 32, lines 19 and 20, strike ``Foreign Military \n     Sales, Foreign Military Financing,'' and insert ``Foreign \n     Military Sales and Foreign Military Financing under the Arms \n     Export Control Act''.\n       On page 34, line 1, strike ``Committee'' and insert \n     ``Committees''.\n       On page 34, line 3, insert ``the'' after ``and''.\n       On page 37, line 11, insert a comma immediately after \n     ``games''.\n       On page 40, line 9, strike ``of'' and insert ``for''.\n       On page 41, line 16, insert ``of the Convention'' after \n     ``ratification''.\n       On page 47, line 19, insert ``the ratification of'' after \n     ``to''.\n       On page 49, line 5, move the margin of ``(i)'' 2 ems to the \n     right.\n       On page 49, line 11, move the margin of ``(ii)'' 2 ems to \n     the right.\n       On page 49, line 16, move the margin of ``(iii)'' 2 ems to \n     the right.\n       On page 52, line 9, insert a comma after ``(D)''.\n       On page 53, line 21, strike the comma.\n       On page 55, line 4, insert ``a schedule of'' after ``to''.\n       On page 57, line 1, strike ``the'' the first place it \n     appears and insert ``to''.\n       On page 59, line 15, strike the comma.\n       On page 61, line 11, strike ``on an involuntary basis''.\n       On page 61, line 12, insert ``where consent has been \n     withheld,'' after ``States,''.\n       On page 8, line 8, insert ``, if accepted,'' after \n     ``provision''.\n       On page 25, line 19, insert ``on Intelligence'' after \n     ``tee''.\n       On page 27, line 7, strike ``is'' and insert ``are''.\n       On page 27, line 22, insert ``on Intelligence'' after \n     ``Committee''.\n       On page 57, line 15, strike ``Ruanda'' and insert \n     ``Rwanda''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 52) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, it was President Ronald Reagan who \nsaid, ``Trust but verify.'' Sound advice I believe we should heed \ntoday.\n  Reluctantly, I rise in opposition to the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nDo I want to see the elimination of chemical weapons and deadly \npoisons? Absolutely. Will the proposed treaty actually prevent the use \nof chemical weapons? Not in my opinion. As I've listened carefully to \nall of the arguments, I have concluded the proposed treaty will not do \nwhat it is intended to do, and, in fact, may actually do more harm than \ngood.\n  Again, trust but verify.\n  Like many Americans, I took notice when four recent Secretaries of \nDefense came out in opposition to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The \nopposition of Secretaries Schlesinger, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Weinberger \nis based, in part, on the fact that the treaty is not verifiable. In \nother words, we have no way of knowing if our ``partners'' in this \nagreement are living up to their end of the deal. Like the four former \nSecretaries of Defense, I am troubled by statements by CIA and \nDepartment of Defense officials that admit they do not have ``high \nconfidence'' the treaty can be verified, key provisions ``can be \nthwarted'' and detection of small amounts of chemical weapons ``will \nadmittedly be extremely difficult.'' In my mind, the admission of \nClinton Administration officials that the treaty is not verifiable \nraises serious questions about the value of the agreement.\n  The Chemical Weapons Treaty also contains provisions, Articles X and \nXI, which mandate the sharing of all chemical equipment and technology, \nincluding chemical weapons defensive technology, with other countries. \nThese provisions might allow countries like Iran and Iraq to acquire \nadvanced defensive technologies so they can improve their chemical \nweapons combat capability. This exchange of technical information, \nmandated by the treaty, may also be used to develop ways to defeat our \nchemical weapons defensive technology. Because of these flaws in the \ntreaty, Secretary Cheney wrote ``In my judgement, the treaty's Articles \nX and XI amount to a formula for greatly accelerating the proliferation \nof chemical warfare capabilities around the\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\nglobe.'' This mandated sharing of technology represents one example of \nhow the treaty may actually do more harm than good.\n  I want to point out that one of the conditions removed from the \nResolution of Ratification directed the U.S. to renegotiate Articles X \nand XI to ensure the treaty does not inadvertently increase the threat \nof chemical weapons. The Clinton Administration viewed the requirement \nto renegotiate the treaty as a ``killer amendment'' and encouraged the \nSenate to strike this condition. Under pressure from the President, the \nSenate voted to remove this condition so renegotiation of these \nimportant articles will not happen.\n\n  In addition, the President's letter to Majority Leader Lott on the \nday of the vote acknowledges that there are legitimate security \nconcerns regarding the flaws in Articles X and XI. I'm troubled because \nthe letter is non-binding and it will be three years before we will \ndiscover if Articles X and XI lead to the proliferation of chemical \nweapons technology. The President says the U.S. could then withdraw \nfrom the Convention, but by then the damage will have been done.\n  If I believed this treaty by itself would stop chemical weapons, I \nwould support it. During my own deliberations regarding the CWC, I had \na thoughtful discussion with James Schlesinger, a former Secretary of \nDefense, Secretary of Energy and Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. Secretary Schlesinger made the point that although scores of \nnations ratified the Geneva Protocol which claimed to ``prohibit'' the \nuse of poison gas, Iraq used mustard gas against Iran and its own \ncitizens with impunity. In my mind, this episode demonstrates one of \nthe weaknesses of international treaties which sound good on the \nsurface but lack enforcement procedures in practice.\n  I am also concerned about the provisions of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention which will allow international inspectors access to chemical \nbusinesses and other important national security facilities. The idea \nthat North Korea or Iraq can come into the United States and examine \nour facilities and then take that information home to help their own \nchemical and defense industries is wrong. The treaty makes no \narrangement to compensate businesses for the loss of this sensitive \ndata. This is another reason I believe the Chemical Weapons Convention \nwill, in fact, do more harm than good.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I understand the \nmilitary threat posed by chemical weapons. I continue to support \nefforts to destroy the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile in a safe and \nenvironmentally sensitive manner. I oppose any use of these horrible \nweapons and I believe the United States should threaten massive \nretaliation against any nation that might consider using these weapons \nagainst our citizens or soldiers. I am also very proud of the \nleadership role of the United States in the fight to stop the spread of \nchemical weapons. Without a doubt, this leadership role will continue \nwhether or not we ratify the CWC.\n  But we must also be honest with ourselves. The Chemical Weapons \nConvention cannot be verified. The treaty will not prevent countries or \nterrorists from acquiring or using chemical weapons. The treaty may in \nfact increase proliferation of advanced defensive technologies and the \ntreaty may jeopardize proprietary information of U.S. companies.\n  As I weigh these facts, I conclude the Chemical Weapons Convention \nwill do more harm than good and I will cast my vote against the \nratification of this treaty.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will vote today to ratify the Chemical \nWeapons Convention (CWC). I do so without any illusions. I have \nconcluded that it will be of marginal benefit, but that its benefits do \noutweigh the risks. Clearly, no chemical weapons treaty can be 100% \nverifiable. Inside the CWC, there is at least a better chance of \ncatching violators than if we remain outside the treaty.\n  I commend the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nHelms, as well as Senator Kyl, and others who have worked so hard to \nimprove this treaty. As a result of their efforts, for example, we \nretain the right for our troops to use tear gas in hostage rescue \noperations; we require search warrants in cases where consent is not \ngranted to protect 4th amendment rights; and we restrict U.S. \nassistance to rogue nations under Article X to medical antidotes and \nhumanitarian assistance.\n  This is a historic agreement bringing together 74 countries that have \nratified the treaty in a comprehensive, worldwide fight, to ban \nchemical weapons. The treaty requires all nations to follow America's \nlead to destroy all chemical stockpiles by 2007. The CWC also provides \nfor sanctions against those who trade in chemical agents with non-\nparties to the treaty. These provisions will help to ensure that on a \nfuture battlefield our troops will be less likely to face chemical \nagents.\n  Passage of this treaty should not bring a false sense of security. A \ntreaty alone will not protect our troops and citizens from chemical \nweapons. We should continue to devote attention and resources to \nimproving our chemical weapons defenses. We should provide our troops \nwith the equipment and training they need in combat situations. The \nparties to this treaty must also take action against violators who \nresort to using chemical weapons. As a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, I will work to ensure that the goals of this treaty are not \nlost in its implementation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nresolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I am pleased that--more than 3 years after the administration sent \nthis treaty to the Senate--the CWC is finally before us on the floor of \nthis Chamber.\n  In these three years, Mr. President, three Senate committees have \nheld numerous hearings--nearly 20 of them--on the efficacy of this \ntreaty. As a Member of both the Foreign Relations and Judiciary \nCommittees, I have been privileged to participate in several of these \nhearings and to hear numerous perspectives during this debate.\n  More recently, several Senators and Administration officials have \nspent a considerable amount of time negotiating the terms under which \nthis treaty would come to the floor. And so I think we should all thank \nthe Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee [Mr. Helms] and the \nSenator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], the ranking member of that \ncommittee, for the time they both have spent on this issue.\n  I would also like to recognize the efforts of the White House Working \nGroup and the Lott Task Force to come to a consensus on the aspects of \nthis treaty on which we can agree. I know that the Members and \nAdministration officials involved in these negotiations have spent \nhours reviewing countless technical details. It is because of these \nefforts that the resolution of ratification before us today contains 28 \nagreed-upon conditions. These conditions were carefully crafted by our \ncolleagues to respond to Members' specific concerns. I am myself \ncomfortable with these conditions, which, for the most part, duly \nexercise the Senate's prerogatives with respect to treaty ratification, \nand instruct the administration to undertake certain commitments. They \nalso require greater reporting requirements which will help the Senate \nto monitor U.S. participation in the Convention in the future.\n  I am pleased that our colleagues have come to agreement on these \npoints, because throughout the deliberations over this convention, I \nhave made two observations: No. 1 the CWC is not a perfect document, \nand No. 2 notwithstanding that, the CWC is the best avenue available \ntoday for beginning to control the spread of chemical weapons, and \nleading, eventually, to the total elimination of such weapons.\n  Like any document arrived at through consensus, the Chemical Weapons \nConvention can not claim to address every party's concerns. But, it is \nmy view that the 28 agreed-upon conditions in the resolution before us \ntoday serve to strengthen what we do have.\n  Let me speak first on my initial point--that the CWC is not a perfect \ndocument. There are real flaws that we all recognize, and that experts \nboth pro and con acknowledge, related to the verifiability of the CWC. \nThere may well be cheating, evasions, and attempts to disobey the \nspirit, as well as the letter, of the treaty. Some of this cheating may \nescape detection--although not enough, I believe, to pose a\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\nlegitimate threat to the security of the United States.\n  Nevertheless, I think we gain more by establishing an international \nregime that prohibits such behavior than we do by refusing to exercise \nU.S. leadership in that regime.\n  My second, and more important, point is this: The CWC is the best \navenue available today for beginning to control the spread of chemical \nweapons, and leading, eventually, to the total elimination of such \nweapons.\n  Those countries that do ratify the treaty--and this group represents \nmost of the responsible players on the international stage--recognize \nthat through the CWC, the world firmly rejects the existence and use of \nchemical weapons. The treaty puts in place mechanisms to enforce its \nprecepts and monitor its progress, and signatories are committed to \ncomplying with these mechanisms.\n  What of the handful of nations who flout international will, and will \nnot sign on to this treaty?\n  First, defense experts at the very top of our military command \nstructure are satisfied that the use of chemical weapons by these so-\ncalled rogue states does not pose a significant threat to our national \nsecurity. In March 1996, then-Secretary of Defense William Perry told \nthe Foreign Relations Committee that he was ``damm sure'' that the \nUnited States could respond massively and effectively to any chemical \nweapons challenge.\n  Moreover, the CWC will make it easier for the international community \nto track the chemical ingredients necessary for weapons production and \nto inhibit the flow of these materials to rogue or non-signatory \nstates. The Convention will impose trade sanctions on non-signatory \ncountries whether or not they are known to posses chemical weapons. \nThis provision was devised by the Bush administration specifically to \nmake it expensive for countries not to join this Convention.\n  As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in testimony before the \nForeign Relations Committee earlier this month, ``These penalties would \nnot exist without the treaty. They will make it more costly for any \nnation to have chemical weapons, and more difficult for rogue states or \nterrorists to acquire materials needed to produce them.''\n  Those states that we are most concerned about currently are unwilling \nto accept the norms that the treaty would establish. That is why they \nhave thus far chosen not to ratify. But it is just as clear these \nstates will never accept the treaty if the United States refuses to \nratify.\n\n  This is why I plan to vote in favor of striking the so-called killer \namendments that would tie the deposit of our instrument of ratification \nto the actions of these nations.\n  If the linkage were to remain in the resolution, the Senate would \nbecome responsible for painting the United States into a very \nuncomfortable corner, a corner from which we would be unable to exit. \nSuch conditions would force the United States, which led the \nnegotiations of this treaty, to engage in a game of chicken with other \ncountries. It should instead join our allies in ratifying this treaty.\n  Mr. President, this treaty provides a solid start to limiting the \nflow of chemical weapons.\n  It urges the destruction of all chemical weapons. It will provide \nmore information about the prevalence of chemical weapons than we have \never had before. And it will make the dissemination of such weapons--\nand the materials used to make them--more actionable than they have \never been before.\n  Mr. President, do I think the treaty could be improved? Of course. So \nI am pleased that the CWC has the provision for amendment after it \ncomes into force.\n  But now is not the time to debate amendments to the treaty. One \nhundred sixty-one nations have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention \nand 74 of them have ratified it.\n  I think we can all assume that--just as we played a leading role in \nnegotiating the existing treaty--the United States will again be at the \nforefront of efforts to make the treaty more effective after a period \nto test its utility. We have the technological means and the economic \nweight to do so. But only if we ratify this treaty prior to its entry \ninto force on April 29. Only by that deadline--now less than a week \naway--will the United States be a full participant in the Organization \nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], the governing body that \nwill have the responsibility for deciding the terms for the \nimplementation of the CWC.\n  Would I like to see the enforcement provisions of the CWC written in \na less ambiguous manner? Certainly.\n  Could sanctions against violators be spelled out more clearly? \nAbsolutely.\n  But the CWC was laboriously crafted throughout three decades to meet \nthe security and economic interests of States' Parties. The United \nStates led this effort, and the treaty which we are voting on reflects \nour needs. As Secretary Albright has said, this treaty has ``Made in \nthe USA'' written all over it. That is why the CWC has the blessing and \nenthusiastic support of our defense and business communities.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to address an issue that is of particular \nimportance to me, and that is the potential constitutional implications \nof this treaty.\n  In particular, the argument has been made, incorrectly in my opinion, \nthat adoption of the CWC would subvert, in some way, the constitutional \nprotections of the fourth amendment which--as Americans--we all enjoy. \nLet me say at the outset that preserving the fourth amendment is a \nresponsibility that I take very seriously and very personally. My \nconcern about preserving the protections of the fourth amendment does \nnot end at the corners of this treaty. I have opposed in this Congress \nproposals to weaken the fourth amendment's protections, for example, in \nthe area of wire taps.\n  In fact, I am pleased to see that throughout the debate over this \ntreaty, many of my colleagues have taken an active interest in \npromoting the rights bestowed upon us by the fourth amendment. Indeed, \nI welcome the opportunity to work with these members on future \ninitiatives related to this vital provision of our Constitution.\n  With respect to the claim that ratification of this treaty risks \nconstitutional protections for Americans, I think three points need to \nbe stressed.\n  First, this treaty, and in particular the inspection language \ntherein, is the product of bipartisan efforts spanning many years. In \nfact, it was the Bush administration which rejected efforts to adopt \noverly broad, and undoubtedly unconstitutional inspection proceedings \nin favor of those in the treaty today.\n  Second, although the treaty itself acknowledges the supremacy of the \nconstitutions of its signatories, this would be the case even without \nspecific language. The Senate cannot, be it through signing a treaty or \npassing a law, subvert any of the protections guaranteed by our \nConstitution. That is the very essence of our Constitution: it is the \nbedrock of our freedoms and cannot be abrogated short of amendment to \nthe Constitution itself.\n  Mr. President, during a Judiciary Committee hearing last September, I \nquestioned Professor Barry Kellman of the DePaul Law School on various \naspects of the constitutionality of this treaty and on each of the \npoints I have raised here today. On each point, Professor Kellman was \nin agreement with me. In fact, Professor Kellman, who has dedicated \nmany years, and much time and energy to reviewing the constitutional \nimplications of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, testified that, ``every \nserious scholar'' who has looked into the issue has found this treaty \nto be constitutional.\n  Finally, to the extent there are concerns to be addressed, and there \nmay be, the proper context for airing those concerns is during what I \nexpect to be a lively discussion over the implementing legislation, \nwhich we will have a chance to debate in the next several weeks. It is \nin the implementing legislation--not the treaty itself--where these \nissues should be addressed and resolved.\n\n  I look forward to working with concerned colleagues as we consider \nimplementation of the treaty, so I am pleased that the unanimous \nconsent agreement arrived at regarding the resolution of ratification \nbefore us today included the intent to debate and vote on the \nimplementing legislation prior to the Memorial Day recess.\n  As the debate over the implementing language continues, I will work \nwith\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\nmy colleagues to ensure that the language we ultimately adopt fully and \nproperly reflects the protections embodied in the United States \nConstitution.\n  In the interim, however, we should not become side-tracked by \narguments that this treaty is unconstitutional or subverts the fourth \namendment. The inspections conducted pursuant to this treaty will be \nconducted pursuant to the Constitution of this nation. Nothing in this \ntreaty can, nor does it even attempt to, alter that simple, but \nfundamental fact.\n  Mr. President, I support the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention which I believe is in the best interests of the United \nStates.\n  And if the Senate is to lend its support to this treaty, we must vote \nto strike each one of the five conditions before us. Four of these \nwould pronounce the treaty dead on arrival by linking the deposit of \nthe U.S. instrument of ratification to conditions that are simply \nimpossible to achieve--by April 29, or at any time in the near future. \nThe other condition would establish a precedent for the selection of \ninspectors that would greatly undermine the entire inspection process.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that those of us who support this \ntreaty help strike the language that would undermine U.S. participation \nin the Convention in this manner.\n  And, after doing so, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me \nin voting for final passage of the resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to ratify \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is a historic arms control treaty \nwhich will significantly enhance America's security. The treaty \nprohibits the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, and \ntransfer of chemical weapons by those countries that are signatories. \nIt requires signatories to begin to destroy their chemical weapons \nwithin a year and to complete destruction of chemical weapons within \nten years. Importantly, it prohibits the use of chemical weapons in \ncombat, and it prohibits signatories from helping other countries to \nengage in any activity banned by the treaty. As such, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention is an important non-proliferation tool that will \nhelp slow the spread of dangerous chemical weapons and force the \ndestruction of most of the world's chemical weapons stockpiles.\n  President Reagan recognized the wisdom of working to ban chemical \nweapons worldwide. Under his administration, negotiations on the terms \nof a chemical weapons treaty began. Those negotiations continued under \nPresident Bush, who signed the treaty. Now, five years after \ncompletion, with the full support of President Clinton, the Chemical \nWeapons Treaty is before the Senate for ratification.\n  There are many good reasons to support the Chemical Weapons Treaty. \nFirst, and foremost, this treaty will protect America's military from \nthe threat of chemical weapons attack without requiring America to give \nup anything militarily. The United States has already decided to \ndestroy its stockpile of chemical weapons and has vowed not to use \nchemical weapons in warfare. Because the Chemical Weapons Convention \nrequires other nations to abandon chemical weapons as the United States \nhas done, America gains from this treaty. We give up nothing, and our \ntroops will be less likely to face poison gas in future conflicts.\n  Civilians in America and worldwide will benefit from Senate \nratification of this treaty as well. Last year's terrorist attack in \nJapan, in which chemical weapons were used against innocent civilians, \nreminds us that none of us is safe from the threat of chemical weapons. \nAs long as chemical weapons are produced and stockpiled, the \npossibility remains real that they will end up in the hands of \nterrorists. Because the Chemical Weapons Convention requires all \ncountries to enact laws making it a crime to develop or produce \nchemical weapons, the treaty will make it harder for terrorists to \nobtain chemical weapons, making America's cities, streets, and schools \nsafer.\n  Additionally, the Chemical Weapons Convention will help America and \nthe intelligence community to better track and control the spread of \nchemical weapons and to punish violators. Through the verification \nregime established by the treaty, our country will have an easier time \nmonitoring chemical weapons threats and establishing rigorous \nverification procedures to prevent cheating.\n  Already seventy countries have ratified the treaty, and it will go \ninto effect with or without the United States. But if the Senate does \nnot ratify the treaty, America will be siding with rogue nations like \nIraq and Libya. If the Senate does not ratify the treaty, American \nindustry will be sanctioned and will lose roughly $600 million in \ntrade, a point I addressed more fully in an earlier speech to the \nSenate. If the Senate does not ratify the treaty, America will not be \nable to participate in the body that will determine the rules for \nimplementing the treaty. And if the Senate does not ratify the treaty, \nAmerica's credibility as a proponent of nonproliferation and arms \ncontrol will be jeopardized.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt in my mind that the United States \nshould join a treaty we helped to shape and which enhances our \nsecurity. With the Chemical Weapons Convention and our leadership, \nother nations will follow the lead America set years ago by giving up \nchemical weapons. Rogue nations and terrorist countries will have a \nharder time acquiring or making chemical weapons, and new tools will be \navailable to prevent and punish them if they try. America is much \nbetter off with the Chemical Weapons Convention than without it, and I \nurge my colleagues to ratify it without delay.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have thought long and hard on whether I \nshould vote to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. I must admit \nthat as the Convention was originally presented, I was inclined to \noppose it. But after three weeks of hard work with the Majority Leader \nand with the many thoughtful opponents of ratification, I believe we \nhave resolved a significant number of issues in contention and now \nbelieve that ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention will do \nmore to reach our common goal of eradicating these deadly and detested \nweapons from the earth than will non-ratification.\n  First, I would like to commend my many constituents, and the \nthousands of Americans like them, who were relentless in raising their \nvoices against many dangerous aspects of the treaty and its \ninterpretation. Without their vigilance, we would never have reached \nthe point we have today.\n  I also commend Senator Helms, Senator Kyl, and the Majority Leader \nfor their work and negotiations with the Administration that has led to \nvast improvements in the Chemical Weapons Convention ratifying \ndocuments.\n  Since the beginning of the debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nI have stated that the real question is not whether to support the \ncause of restricting the production, stockpile, and use of chemical \nweapons throughout the world, but whether the Chemical Weapons \nConvention itself advanced or inhibited this honorable cause.\n  As it was originally presented to the Senate for ratification, Mr. \nPresident, I believe the treaty did not advance our cause, but instead \ninhibited it by making sensitive information on chemicals and chemical \nweapons technology so readily available as to encourage the \nproliferation of these hideous weapons. But through the good work of \nSenator Helms and Senator Kyl, we were able to reach 28 agreements with \nthe Administration. These 28 agreements went a long way toward \nadvancing our cause. I think three of these agreements are particularly \nimportant.\n  First, I shared the concern of many of my constituents and several \nformer Secretaries of Defense who testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee that the convention would create a false sense of security, \nnot only in the United States, but in nations around the world. It \nwould be easy, Mr. President, for governments to believe that, because \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention is in force, we no longer need to worry \nabout the use of chemical weapons or to prepare ourselves to defend \nagainst them. I found this aspect of the treaty to be quite troubling.\n  No arms control treaty has yet proven to be perfect. And chemical \nweapons are far more difficult to detect than missiles or nuclear \nwarheads. Thus, I originally feared that ratification of the treaty \nwould lull us into a false sense of security in which our armed forces \nwould not be properly prepared to deal with a chemical attack.\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\n  I now believe, however, that the agreement reached between Senator \nHelms and the Administration that ensures our armed forces will \ncontinue to receive the equipment and training necessary to complete \ntheir missions in the face of chemical weapons is a major \nimprovement which will guard against a debilitating false sense of \nsecurity.\n\n  Second, I and many of my constituents had grave concerns about the \ntreaty's impact on Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. The treaty, in its original form, did not go far \nenough to protect U.S. citizens and businesses from involuntary \ninspections. The treaty's provisions on challenge inspections of \nchemical producing facilities in the United States did not, in my \nopinion, comply with the Constitution.\n  I am pleased that the administration has agreed to a condition to \nprotect the Fourth Amendment rights of all Americans and to conform the \nChemical Weapons Convention to the United States Constitution. \nAccording to this condition, before the U.S. deposits its instrument of \nratification, the President must certify to Congress that for any \nchallenge inspection in the United States for which consent has been \nwithheld, the inspection team must first obtain a criminal search \nwarrant based upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, \nand describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be \nseized. For any routine inspection of a declared facility in the United \nStates that is conducted on an involuntary basis, the inspection team \nmust obtain an administrative search warrant from a United States \nmagistrate judge.\n  I am now confident that this agreement will ensure that the \nconstitutional rights of U.S. citizens and businesses will be protected \nunder the treaty. I commend Senators Helms and Kyl and the \nadministration for their work on this vitally important condition.\n  Third, I was troubled by the treaty's impact on the use of non-lethal \nriot control agents. Since the Chemical Weapons Convention was \noriginally drafted, there has been a great deal of debate in the United \nStates on whether the treaty language would preclude American armed \nforces from using non-toxic riot control agents. Tear gas and other \nsuch chemicals provide the United States military with an invaluable \ntool when conducting sensitive operations. Tear gas, for example, is an \nexcellent means of rescuing downed pilots, or avoiding unnecessary loss \nof life when enemy troops and civilians are in the same area.\n  I am pleased with the agreement that has been reached on this issue. \nAccording to a condition the administration has now accepted, the \nPresident will certify to Congress that the United States is not \nrestricted by the convention in the use of riot control agents in the \nfollowing situations: (1) in the conduct of peacetime military \noperations within an area of ongoing armed conflict when the United \nStates is not a party to the conflict; (2) in consensual peacekeeping \noperations when the use of force is authorized by the receiving state; \nand (3) in peacekeeping operations when force is authorized by the \nSecurity Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The \nagreement also leaves in place Executive Order 11850 signed by \nPresident Ford which cites four cases where the use of riot control \nagents should be permissible under the Chemical Weapons Convention: \navoiding unnecessary loss of life, subduing rioting enemy POWs, \nprotecting supply convoys, and rescuing a downed pilot from enemy \ntroops or a POW from behind enemy lines. I commend the administration \nfor agreeing to this reasonable and necessary condition. It will ensure \nthat the men and women of the United States armed forces have the tools \nnecessary to do their jobs in precarious situations.\n  While the 28 agreements made did go a long way to improve the \nChemical Weapons Convention, I still had one remaining concern, in my \nview the most important concern, until this morning. That concern \nrelates to Articles X and XI of the convention and the proposition that \nthey might well force the United States to share sensitive information \non our chemical weapons defense capabilities and to eliminate our \nexport controls on dangerous chemicals.\n  Article X of the treaty obliges all parties to provide assistance and \nprotection to any State Party threatened by the potential use of \nchemical weapons, including information on chemical weapons defense and \ndetection. Article XI of the treaty obliges all parties to freely \nexchange chemicals, equipment and scientific and technical information \nrelating to the development and application of chemistry for purposes \nnot prohibited by the Convention. It forbids parties to the treaty to \nmaintain export controls that would restrict the trade and development \nof chemicals and chemical technology with other treaty parties.\n  Ironically, these provisions of the treaty, a treaty designed to \neliminate the proliferation of chemical weapons, could in fact promote \nthat very proliferation. If the United States is forced under the \ntreaty to provide this sensitive technology to countries such as Iran, \nChina, or Cuba, those countries could use that information to develop \nweapons against which we have no ability to defend.\n  It is my contention that Articles X and XI do more to inhibit the \ncause of eradicating chemical weapons than they do to promote it. Thus, \nthey comprise a fatal flaw in the Chemical Weapons Convention. And, \nuntil today, I was inclined to vote against ratification because of my \nconcerns on Articles X and XI.\n  I am pleased to say, however, that the distinguished Majority Leader \nwas remarkably successful in his negotiations with the President on \nthis most important aspect of the debate on the treaty. I commend him \nfor his diligence and commend the President for his wisdom in \nresponding to our concerns.\n  This morning, the President sent Senator Lott a letter in which he \nextended a promise that the United States will withdraw from the \nConvention if Articles X and XI are used by other treaty parties to \nundermine the intent of the Convention. The specific circumstances \nunder which the President agreed to withdraw from the treaty are as \nfollows: (1) if Article X is used to justify actions that could degrade \nU.S. defensive capabilities; (2) if Article XI erodes the Australia \nGroup export controls; and (3) if Article XI promotes increased \nproliferation of chemical weapons.\n  With this assurance from the President, I am now prepared to support \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and will vote for its ratification. \nWith the 28 agreements Senator Helms and Senator Kyl were able to \nnegotiate, and with this final commitment from the President, I am \ncomfortable with the treaty. The Convention has been transformed from \none doing more harm than good, to one promoting rather than inhibiting \nthe cause of eradicating chemical weapons from the earth.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me say that these changes could not \nhave been made without the diligent and good-faith negotiating done by \nthe majority leader, and without the voices raised by thousands upon \nthousands of Americans who went out of their way to draw attention to \nthe treaty's many flaws. They should be given the lion's share of \ncredit for the conditions and modifications we have made that make the \nChemical Weapons Convention a more workable, more responsible treaty.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my firm support of \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty. I have thought long and hard on \nthis issue. And I believe that my colleagues--both for and against this \ntreaty--have shown patience, diligence and understanding during this \nimportant debate.\n  I also believe the time has come for us to lead the civilized world \nin signing this treaty. And to remember why, we need to look back to \nour history.\n  On October 30, 1918, 12 days before the end of the First World War, \nthe 362nd Infantry Division received orders to attack German positions \noutside the city of Audenarde in France. Many Montanans served in this \ndivision.\n  During this battle, German troops lobbed several gas shells toward \nthe Montana troops. The wind that morning just happened to be blowing \nto the east, and the gas carried over the American area.\n  The men of the 362nd fought valiantly that day. And in the end, they \novertook the German positions with a minimal loss of life. But they, \nand hundreds of thousands of other World War\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\nI veterans, carried scars in their lungs for the rest of their lives. \nIt made breathing difficult and left many of them invalids.\n  Chemical weaponry has come a long way in the 79 years since that \nbattle took place. Modern technology has made this type of warfare more \ndevastating and more deadly. It can now kill instantly as well as scar \nand maim the lungs.\n  Chemical warfare is an indiscriminate killer. It cannot tell the \ndifference between a soldier and a civilian, a bunker from a subway, or \na barracks from a school.\n  And worst of all, some chemical weapons are relatively easy to \ncreate. As we have seen in recent news reports, if the substances used \nto create chemical weapons are freely available, terrorist groups and \ncults can make them and use them against civilians.\n  This, of course, often makes them hard to detect. So the critics of \nthis Convention have a point when they say it will be hard to verify.\n  But this agreement will make it much easier than it is now for us to \nfind out when rogue states try to create or stockpile chemical weapons. \nWe will have the right to inspect the factories and defense \ninstallations of those we suspect are creating these weapons. And we \nwill be able to block those who do not sign from buying the substances \nthey need to create chemical weapons.\n  That is why this treaty has wide support. If we choose not to ratify \nit, we cast ourselves with such countries as Iraq and Libya--one which \nused chemical weapons against Iran and its own Kurdish citizens, \nanother suspected of clandestine efforts to create a chemical weapons \nprogram.\n  And we make it more likely that some day, another generation of \nAmerican servicemen and servicewomen will suffer the same kind of \noutrageous attack that the Montanans in the 362nd went through in 1918. \nThat must not happen. And the Senate must pass this Convention.\n  If we ratify this treaty now, we allow the United States to \nparticipate in its administration from the outset. To fail to ratify \nthe treaty is to lose our seat at the table. I want to make sure that \nwe put American inspectors on the ground to ensure the eventual end of \nthese horrible weapons.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this treaty. And \nI look forward to the day we remove chemical weapons from the face of \nthe earth.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \naddressing the issue of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n(CWC).\n  While some who are less familiar with the advice and consent process \nmay regret the pace the Senate has undertaken, I strongly believe it is \na point of pride. The Senate, led by Majority Leader Lott, Senator Kyl, \nSenator Helms, Senator Lugar and many others, has painstakingly \nreviewed the CWC for many months. The 33 conditions which have been the \nsubject of protracted negotiations have created a document which better \nprotects our nation's security interests. I congratulate Senator Lott \nand the rest of the participants for their efforts.\n  Despite the best efforts of all involved I continue to harbor a \nnumber of strong reservations about the convention. I am concerned \nabout its verifiability, the impact on U.S. business, the effect on \nU.S. efforts to eliminate existing chemical weapons stockpiles, and the \nnumber of rogue nations which are not party to the CWC.\n  Former CIA director James Woolsey testified that detection of \nviolations of the CWC is so difficult that we cannot ``have high \nconfidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a \nsmall scale.'' Nowhere is this more evident than Iraq. In a recent \ncolumn, Charles Krauthammer pointed out that Iraq has been subjected to \nthe most intrusive, comprehensive inspections for weapons of mass \ndestruction ever devised or implemented by an international \norganization. Yet, we continue to uncover secret sites and weapons and \nhave no confidence we know the extent of Saddam Hussein's lethal \nstockpile. If we are uncertain under the best of conditions, we should \nnot underestimate the significant risks under adverse circumstances.\n  Mr. President, my second concern is the unforseen impact inspection \nrequirements might have on U.S. businesses. One estimate puts the \nnumber of Kentucky businesses which are likely to be impacted by the \nCWC at 44. Not all of these companies are large enough to be able to \nafford the increased costs of additional burdensome regulations. The \nchemical industry is already one of the most over-regulated industries \nin America. Currently, the combined costs of EPA, OSHA and other \nfederal regulations on the industry is near $4.9 billion annually. \nAdding to this incredible financial burden is overkill.\n  In addition to the costly regulatory burdens CWC asks these companies \nto withstand, the treaty will require companies to open their books and \nfacilities to foreign inspection teams--creating a Pandora's box of \ncommercial hazards. Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld points \nout, despite best efforts its possible, even likely, that inspection \nteams could come away with classified and proprietary information.\n  Specifically, the inspection requirements may compel companies to \nprovide proprietary technical data which could be used to considerable \nfinancial advantage by competitors. Worse yet, the results might enable \nadversaries to enhance their chemical weapons capabilities, putting \nAmerican soldiers and citizens at potential risk. These risks \nunderscore the need to include the imperative protections in Condition \n31 enabling the President to ban inspection teams with terrorist track \nrecords.\n  The third issue of concern relates to Condition 27's direct affect on \nmy state and on our ability to dismantle our existing stockpiles. \nKentucky is home to the Lexington Bluegrass Army Depot where thousands \nof chemical munitions are currently stored. The community surrounding \nthis facility is justifiably concerned over the method by which the \nweapons will be destroyed. The Treaty mandates signatories register \nspecific technical plans for destruction shortly after the instruments \nof ratification are filed. This may undermine alternatives currently \nbeing explored.\n  Let me explain. Last year, I offered an amendment to the Defense \nAppropriations Bill which directed the Secretary of Defense to pursue \nthe acquisition of at least two alternative technologies to the current \nplan of incineration. Condition 27, provides some assurance that the \ndevelopment and use of alternatives to incineration would not be \naffected by the CWC regime. However, if this agreement between Congress \nand the Administration is overruled, reversed or challenged by the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, my constituents \nwill be placed at increased risk. I accept the President's written \nguarantee at this point, but will keep a close watch to assure his \ncommitment is not reversed or revised. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter from President Clinton to me on this issue be included in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Condition 27 also presents another problem. Current \nlaw requires the President to destroy the U.S. stockpile by 2004. \nCondition 27 extends the deadline to 2007. Mr. President I am \nemphatically opposed to this provision. I do not believe it wise to \ngive the Army, or any party the opportunity to slow down efforts to \nidentify alternative technologies or to delay the destruction process.\n  The weapons stored in the U.S. need to be dismantled now. They are \naging and therefore becoming more unstable every day. As this occurs, \nsafe destruction becomes increasingly difficult and the chance of an \naccident increases dramatically. I hope the Administration will not \nseek a delay in the destruction deadline unless it is absolutely \nnecessary in order to undergo the safe and effective elimination of our \nweapons.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the fact that many of the nations with either \nthe intent or the means to attack U.S. soldiers and citizens with \nchemical weapons are not covered by the CWC is deeply troubling. Libya, \nSyria, Iraq and North Korea are all suspected of possessing chemical \nweapons and not one is a participant in the CWC. This fact is strong \njustification for maintaining Condition 30 which compels their \nparticipation.\n\n  If the U.S. ratifies the CWC the horrors of chemical attack will not \nmagically disappear. Those of us in the\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\nUnited States Senate must remain vigilant in ensuring that America \ncontinues to prepare adequate defensive capabilities against potential \nchemical or biological attack. Incidents such as the sarin gas attack \nin the Tokyo subway cannot be prevented by this or any other treaty.\n  The world remains a dangerous place and this treaty will not \nsubstantially change that fact. The Secretary of State insists that \nthis Treaty is not about our chemical weapons--it is a means to limit \nother nations'. The plain fact is it will not constrain one nation from \nacquiring or using these weapons. Even if we are able to determine that \na participating nation is violating the CWC, the means of redress or \nsanction available under the treaty are toothless and largely \nineffective. The United Nations Security Council must craft penalties \nwhich could avoid potential Chinese or Russian vetoes. I am certain \nthis would be a near impossible task.\n  With these objections stated, it is clear that I do not believe the \nCWC is a perfect document. In fact, it remains unclear whether the \ntreaty will have any of the positive effects its proponents allege.\n  Why then do I feel compelled to support U.S. ratification? Quite \nsimply it comes down to one issue--the necessity to sustain the \nstrength and credibility of U.S. leadership. As the principal architect \nof the CWC, the United States risks our authority and stature should we \nrefuse to ratify the convention. If this treaty is to enjoy any success \nit will be due to U.S. participation and leadership. As President Bush \nhas stated repeatedly, ``it is vitally important for the United States \nto be out front.'' I also agree with former Secretary of State James \nBaker's assertion that failure to ratify the convention ``would send a \nmessage of American retreat from engagement in the world.''\n  The United States must be in a position to lead, and it must use this \nleadership to push other nations to follow our example and eliminate \ntheir chemical stockpiles. Just this week we heard from a former high \nranking North Korean official of that country's significant chemical \nand nuclear capabilities and willingness to use both. The U.S. must \nactively work to ensure that the North Korea's of the world recognize \nthe futility in relying on these weapons. The CWC is a modest step on \nthat road, a road which I hope yields success.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 19, 1997.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for your letter \n     concerning your support for the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     and for the alternative technologies program.\n       I want to assure you that nothing in the Convention would \n     preclude the consideration of alternative technologies funded \n     by your amendment to the FY 1997 Defense Appropriations bill. \n     Indeed, the Administration has agreed to a condition to the \n     CWC resolution of ratification which makes clear my \n     commitment to exploring alternatives to incineration for the \n     destruction of the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile and \n     clarifies the relationship between the CWC and our chemical \n     weapons demilitarization program. A copy of the condition is \n     attached.\n       I am gratified that you agree on the importance to U.S. \n     national security of banning the production, possession and \n     use of chemical weapons worldwide. I look forward to your \n     support for Senate ratification of the CWC in the weeks \n     ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, in recent weeks we have heard a \ngreat deal about the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  We have talked about the risks of information sharing, the \nreliability of the verification systems, and whether Russia should go \nfirst. We have debated the dangers of exchanging inspectors, we have \nquestioned whether outcasts like Iran, Iraq and North Korea should sign \nthis international agreement, and whether anything would change if they \ndid. Fundmentally, we have been considering whether the proposed treaty \nis a step forward, or whether it is worse than no treaty at all.\n  Opponents have argued that the treaty is fatally flawed, and that the \nUnited States is better off without it. It's true that the Chemical \nWeapons Convention is not perfect. Chemical weapons are cheap and easy \nto make, and despite our best efforts, we will never be able to monitor \nevery laboratory, or stop every nation in this world that is driven to \nmake tools of biological warfare.\n  But this debate is not about whether the treaty is perfect, or \nwhether its provisions must be changed. This debate is about what \nhappens if the United States fails to act.\n  Every weapon of war is horrible. While the bloodshed, violence and \ndestruction caused by things that kill people cannot be ranked, death \nby poison gases or viruses is particularly grisly. I am reminded of the \nwords of Erich Maria Remarque in his novel about men lost to poison gas \nattacks during the Great War in the early part of this century:\n\n       We found one dug-out full of them, with blue heads and \n     black lips. Some . . . took their masks off too soon . . . \n     they swallowed enough to scorch their lungs. Their condition \n     is hopeless; they choke to death with hemorrhages and \n     suffocation--``All Quiet on The Western Front'' Erich Maria \n     Remarque.\n\n  It was experiences like this that helped to generate worldwide hatred \nand fear of chemical weapons, and is what led to the Geneva Protocol of \n1925.\n  In the 70 years since that time, negotiations have been conducted, \nconferences have been held, and agreements have been signed to \npermanently ban chemical weapons from the earth. It is universally \nrecognized that outlawing chemical and biological weapons and their \nmanufacture--while it might not completely prevent any use in future \nconflicts--is the right thing to do.\n  That's why it is incredible to me, less than a week before the \nratification deadline, that this treaty has become a point of political \ndivision here in the U.S. Senate.\n  This treaty is the first global arms control agreement to ban an \nentire class of weapons. Participating states must destroy their \nchemical weapons within 10 years of the treaty's enactment and pledge \nto never make them again. The agreement also creates an international \norganization to monitor compliance, and signatories must exchange data \nand permit routine inspections of their facilities.\n  Nations refusing to participate will be barred from purchasing the \ningredients necessary to make chemical weapons and many commercial \nchemical products, and will face heightened scrutiny over their \nchemical weapons activities. Their chemical and biotechnology \nindustries will face great international trade obstacles.\n  Opponents of the Chemical Weapons Convention argue that this treaty \nshould not be ratified because countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria \nare not signatories. They argue that the treaty is unverifiable, that \nit is intrusive and damaging to confidential trade information held by \nthe U.S. chemical industry, and that, due to the Clinton \nadministration's refusal to modify article 10 and 11, the United States \nwill be forced to share critical technology with other nations.\n  I do not subscribe to this interpretation. The sanctions provided by \nthis treaty for nonmembers were designed with the distinct \nunderstanding that pariah states were unlikely to join the agreement, \nand therefore would be isolated and targeted for sanctions. \nFurthermore, article 10 does not obligate the United States to share \nchemical defense technologies and equipment with member or nonmember \nstates. Article 10, in fact, provides the United States with the \nflexibility to determine how and what types of assistance should be \nprovided to signatories. Article 11 will not force private businesses \nto release proprietary information. The convention legally binds \nsignatories, via article 1, never to engage in any activities \nprohibited under the convention, greatly decreasing the likelihood that \nnations would seek to profit by giving secrets to non-signatories.\n  For the American people, the benefits of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention are clear. Its provisions will diminish the threat of \nchemical warfare against our young troops overseas. It will help \nprotect Americans at home from terrorist attacks like the kind that \noccurred in the Tokyo subway. And it gives us new tools to help us \ntrack down and punish nations that violate this treaty.\n  The amount of good that this treaty can accomplish has been \nrecognized by the rest of the civilized world. One hundred and sixty-\nfour nations have signed, and seventy-four nations have ratified this \nagreement. The treaty,\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\nwhich was negotiated by the Republican administrations of Reagan and \nBush, has been endorsed by military leaders like General Powell and \nGeneral Schwartzkopf. It's supported by the chemical manufacturers, and \nmost significantly, it is supported by the American people.\n  The Senate has less than 1 week, however, to ratify this treaty. If \nwe miss the April 29 deadline, the world will move ahead without us, \nand the United States will lose a critical opportunity to take a stand \nagainst the worldwide proliferation of chemical weapons. America will \nlose its seat at the table in the international enforcement process, \nand American inspectors will be barred from examining foreign \nfacilities. Our chemical industry will lose hundreds of millions of \ndollars per year as a result of the treaty's trade restrictions. And we \nwill sit on the sidelines with outlaw nations like Libya, North Korea, \nIraq, and Iran.\n  The United States is not an outlaw nation, and should not be \nconsidered one because of our failure to act. We cannot stop these \ndeadly weapons alone, and the world cannot stop these weapons without \nus. As President Clinton said in his State of the Union Address, ``We \nmust be shapers of events, not observers.'' If we want to continue our \nleadership role into the next century, then it is time for the United \nStates to be leagued with the rest of the world and put an end to these \nweapons of death.\n  We have a clear choice. We can take the path of political \npartisanship, and stand in isolation. Or we can set aside discord, take \nresponsibility for our children's future, and ratify this agreement.\n  This is the decision that the Senate must make. In the 100 years \nsince the Hague Conventions, a historic opportunity is within reach to \nban chemical weapons forever. It is time for the Senate to complete the \njob and ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention. This international treaty is our best hope \nto end the use of lethal chemical weapons. It will protect Americans by \nmaking it harder for terrorists to produce chemical weapons and it will \nprotect our soldiers on the battlefield. This treaty will make America \nand the world more secure.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, \nstockpiling, and use of chemicals as weapons. Each and every nation \nthat signs this treaty becomes an ally in the fight against chemical \nweapons used by terrorists or by outlaw states. If we don't ratify this \ntreaty, America will join countries like Libya and Iraq who refuse to \njoin the worldwide effort to end the use of chemical weapons. I can't \nspeak for my colleagues, but I know that this Senator does not want the \nUnited States to be aligned with those terrorist states.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is not a liberal or a conservative \ndocument. It is not a Democratic or a Republican document. It was \nnegotiated by the Reagan and Bush administrations and it is supported \nby the Clinton administration. It is in the tradition of a nonpartisan \nforeign policy.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention was made in America. It is \ninconceivable that we--the world's only superpower--would refuse to \nratify a Convention that we were instrumental in drafting.\n  Of course no treaty can ever eliminate every threat. That is why the \nUnited States must continue to maintain our strong chemical weapons \ndefense program. At the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, scientists \nand technicians are developing better ways to protect our troops from \nthe effects of chemical weapons. This important work must continue.\n  In addition, our intelligence agencies, like the National Security \nAgency, must continue to provide the kind of information that prevents \nthe use of chemical weapons. The National Security Agency is listening \nin on the international criminals and terrorists as they seek to buy \nchemicals and produce weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention will aid \nthese efforts by making it harder for terrorists to get chemicals that \ncould be turned against Americans.\n  America has always led the effort to end the use of chemical \nweapons--and the convention will ensure that other countries follow our \nlead. We have already decided not to use chemical weapons and we have \nstarted to dismantle our chemical stockpile.\n  Maryland is one of seven States that stores chemical weapons left \nover from the First and Second World Wars. For many years, we have \nlived with the threat of an accident. We are only now preparing to \nneutralize the chemical stockpile that is stored in Maryland. We \nin Maryland know first-hand the dangers these chemical weapons pose to \nmilitary personnel and civilians. America's priority must be to safely \ndispose of these lethal chemicals--not to produce them.\n\n  Mr. President, The Chemical Weapons Convention will make it harder \nfor thugs and rogue nations to make and use chemical weapons. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting for its ratification.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in my view there is no greater threat to \nour nation's security than the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Among these is the scourge of chemical weapons which have \nbeen unleashed in this century with such horrifying effect in the \ntrenches of the First World War, in the villages of Iraq a decade ago, \nand more recently in the Tokyo subway.\n  In 1985 the United States took a bold unilateral decision to destroy \nour chemical weapons stockpiles because they serve no military purpose. \nAnd in 1990 the United States negotiated a bilateral chemical weapons \ndestruction agreement with the Soviet Union in an effort to begin the \nprocess of reducing that country's stockpiles, the largest in the \nworld. The leadership of the United States through the years has been \ncrucial in forging the broad international consensus which produced the \nChemical Weapons Convention. The whole world is watching us closely \ntoday to see whether or not the United States is going to continue its \nleadership role on this critical issue.\n  The United States must not retreat from more than a decade of \nleadership on controlling chemical weapons. We must ratify the Chemical \nWeapons Convention before it comes into force on April 29--not just to \nmaintain our leadership on this issue, but because it is in our best \ninterests to do so.\n  The issue is not whether the Convention will completely eliminate the \nthreat of chemical weapons. There is no magic wand to do that. However, \nwhat the Chemical Weapons Convention will do is nevertheless \nsubstantial. It will establish--for the first time--an international \nstandard against the production and use of chemical weapons. It will \nprovide us with significant additional monitoring and inspection tools \nto detect chemical weapons activities. And it will impose trade \nrestrictions that will make it more difficult for ``rogue'' states and \nterrorist organizations to start or continue chemical weapons programs.\n  Opponents of the Convention argue that it is not adequately \nverifiable, although many of those same critics argue at the same time \nthat the treaty is too intrusive. The fact is that the Convention \nincludes the most extensive monitoring and inspection regime of any \narms control treaty to date. The U.S. chemical industry--which will be \nthe target of most of the monitoring and inspection under the \nConvention-- helped write these provisions and is comfortable with \nthem.\n  The U.S. intelligence community believes that the Convention will \nsignificantly enhance its current ability to detect suspicious patterns \nof chemical activity in other countries. I am particularly pleased with \nthe Condition #5, which has been agreed to, that protects U.S. \nintelligence information that may be shared with the Organization for \nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. It reflects the legislation I have \nintroduced to protect U.S. intelligence which is shared with \ninternational organizations.\n\n  The trade restrictions imposed by the Convention represent another \nkey element in controlling the proliferation of chemical weapons. \nBuilding on the existing trade restrictions in chemicals under the \ninformal Australia Group, the Convention limits trade in the most \nlikely chemicals to be used in weapons production--Schedule I \nchemicals--to trade among countries that have already ratified it. The \nsame restrictions will apply after three years to Schedule II ``dual-\nuse'' chemicals\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\nwhich have both commercial and military applications.\n  Therefore, if we do not ratify, we hurt our own chemical industry \nwhich will be excluded from commerce in Schedule I chemicals with some \nof our principal trading partners, including the United Kingdom, \nFrance, Germany, Japan, and Canada. The economic loss to the United \nStates is estimated to be $600 million annually.\n  Opponents of the Convention also argue that it is contrary to our \nnational security interests because countries like Iraq and North Korea \nwill continue their chemical weapons programs while we destroy our own \nstockpiles. But the Convention will make it harder for these countries \nto obtain critical chemical ingredients for their weapons programs. \nAnd, by outlawing the production of chemical weapons for the first \ntime, the Convention will allow the international community to take \ncollective action to isolate ``rogue'' states intent on developing \nthese weapons.\n  The Pentagon's top military leaders have all testified that chemical \nweapons are not needed to deter other countries from using these \nweapons against the U.S. or our armed forces. In fact, chemical weapons \nserve no useful military purpose as a method of warfare. America's \nability to inflict overwhelming destruction, without resorting to \nchemical warfare, serves as a sufficient deterrent to the use of \nchemical weapons against our armed forces. I agree strongly with \nCondition #11, which has already been agreed to, that requires the \nUnited States to maintain a robust program of chemical and biological \ndefenses to ensure that our forces are provided with maximum protection \nin the event such weapons are ever used against U.S. forces. Such a \npolicy is only matter of prudence and common sense.\n  The resolution of ratification before the Senate today sets out \nfurther conditions that address widely-shared concerns about the \nChemical Weapons Convention. For instance, conditions will ensure the \nprimacy of the U.S. Constitution, limit U.S. financial obligations \nunder the Convention, ensure appropriate cost-sharing arrangements, and \nrequire consultation with this body in cases of noncompliance with the \ntreaty. By clarifying and reinforcing the Senate's views on these and \nother important issues, the conditions constitute a useful complement \nto the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that this Convention has a \nhistory of bipartisan support. Negotiations began under the Reagan \nAdministration and were concluded by the Bush Administration. Former \nPresident George Bush has said, and I quote, ``This Convention clearly \nserves the best interests of the United States in a world in which the \nproliferation and use of chemical weapons is a real and growing threat \n. . . United States leadership is required once again to bring this \nhistoric agreement into force.''\n  A total of 162 countries have now signed the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and 74 countries have ratified it. Russia, China and Iran--\nall with known chemical weapons programs--have signed the Convention, \nbut it is unlikely that these countries will ratify it if the U.S. does \nnot do so first.\n  Mr. President, American leadership is needed once again. The U.S. \nmust be among the original ratifying states in order to play a central \nrole in setting up the new Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical \nWeapons and to participate fully in the Convention's monitoring, \ninspection, and trade control activities. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the resolution of ratification for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr President, I am pleased that the United States Senate \nhas finally turned its attention to the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nBefore this body today sits the work of President Reagan, President \nBush and now President Clinton. The CWC will place a global ban on the \nmanufacture, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons by its \nsignatories. Along with protocols for inspections and sanctions against \ncountries that do not abide by the CWC, it contains a specific \ntimetable for the destruction of existing chemical weapons and \nproduction facilities.\n  The United States provided valuable leadership for many years in the \neffort to outlaw chemical weapons and their use. Our government was the \ndriving force behind the negotiations that produced the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. The CWC will go into effect next week with or \nwithout U.S. participation. Failure to ratify the CWC would be a \nmonumental error for the United States; a symbolic retreat from our \ntraditional role in the world that will likely impede our efforts to \nfurther eliminate and combat proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I do strongly support the immediate ratification of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. I want to add my personal thanks to my many \ncolleagues who have worked so hard to bring the articles of \nratification to the Senate floor. Senator Biden and Senator Lugar have \nboth been champions in this effort. I have great admiration and respect \nfor both of these Senators and I know many thousands of my constituents \nalso appreciate their leadership on the CWC.\n  As a Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I have been \nparticularly impressed by the support given to the CWC by numerous \nveterans service organizations. My own state has more than 700,000 \nveterans and thousands of additional active duty personnel stationed in \nevery corner of my state. The following veterans organization have all \ncalled upon the Senate to ratify the CWC; the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nthe Vietnam Veterans of America, the Reserve Officers Association of \nthe United States, the American Ex-Prisoners of War and the Jewish War \nVeterans of the USA. The National Gulf War Resource Center, a coalition \nof two dozen Gulf War veterans organizations has also publicly endorsed \nthe CWC.\n  Such distinguished senior US military commanders as General Norman \nSchwarzkopf, former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Generals John \nM. Shalikashvili and Colin Powell, former Chief of Naval Operations \nAdmiral Elmo Zumwalt, and former National Security Adviser General \nBrent Scowcroft have all publicly called for the ratification of the \nCWC. Colin Powell appeared before the Veterans Affairs Committee last \nweek; he gave the committee his unequivocal support for the CWC. \nGeneral Powell stated that the treaty will lessen the likelihood that \nU.S. troops will be safer from chemical attack in the future. Given the \nproblems many of our Gulf War veterans are suffering that many \nattribute to exposure to chemical weapons, I believe the Senate should \ngive General Powell's comments in support of the CWC special \nconsideration.\n  Also of great importance to me in considering the merits of the CWC \nis the strong support of the chemical industry, including both small \nand large businesses. It is noteworthy that our business community \nprovided advice to the Reagan and Bush administrations on the treaty \nprovisions affecting this industry.\n  If the United States does not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention \nit will not have access to the Treaty's tools to help detect rogue \nstates and terrorists who seek to acquire chemical weapons. The United \nStates will not be allowed to participate in the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the governing body deciding the \nterms for the implementation of the Treaty. Therefore, Americans will \nnot be able to serve on inspection teams or influence amendments, and \nAmericans now serving as head of administration, head of industrial \ninspections, and head of security will be replaced by nationals from \ncountries that have ratified the CWC. Chemical proliferation and \nterrorism are undoubtedly problems the United States can fight more \neffectively within the framework of global cooperation.\n  The Chemical Manufacturing Association has stated that the CWC ``does \nnot trump US export control laws.'' Instead, the Treaty will expand and \nimprove the effectiveness of non-proliferation by instituting a strong \nsystem of multilateral export controls. No information will be \ndisclosed regarding imports, exports or domestic shipments. The CWC \nwill affect approximately 2,000 companies, not 8,000 as the Treaty's \nopponents hold. About 1,800 of those 2,000 companies will do nothing \nmore than check a box regarding the range of Discrete Organic Chemicals \nthey produce, without specifying the nature of these chemicals. Of the \nsome 140 companies most likely to be subjected to routine inspections, \na large\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\nproportion are CMA members, who assisted in writing the provisions of \nthe Treaty. Regardless, it is anticipated that any challenge \ninspections will more than likely involve military, rather than \ncommercial facilities. Thus, we should not concern ourselves with a \npotential negative impact of the CWC on the industry, because clearly \nthis is not the case. On the contrary, if the US Senate chooses not to \nratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, American chemical companies \nrisk losing as much as $600 million a year in sales and many well-\npaying jobs when the mandatory trade sanctions against non-parties are \nenforced.\n  Critics insist that the CWC will be ineffective because rogue states \nsuspected of possessing or attempting to acquire chemical weapons, such \nas Syria, Iraq, North Korea and Libya, have not joined the convention. \nAccordingly, they argue that the United States should hold up \nratification until these states join. The reality is that only about 20 \nstates are believed to have or to be seeking a chemical weapons \nprogram, more than two-thirds of which have already signed the CWC. For \nthe past 40 years, the United States has led nonproliferation regimes \nthat have established accepted norms of international behavior. Failing \nto ratify the convention will not persuade the rogue states to join the \nCWC. Rather, it will legitimize their action and hurt US credibility in \nthe international community. The Treaty ensures that non-party states \nare isolated and makes it extremely difficult for them to pursue their \nnefarious objectives.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to reflect on the measure of American \nleadership and the indispensability of our nation on nonproliferation \nissues and to vote for the Chemical Weapons Convention. This Treaty \nmakes sense on political, legal and moral grounds. As officials of both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations assert, the Chemical Weapons \nConvention will ensure that Americans live in a safer America and a \nsafer world.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President I will vote against ratification of the \nChemical Warfare Convention. I came to this decision, not because I am \nagainst doing away with chemical weapons, we all are. I will vote \nagainst ratification because amendments which I believe were critical \nto ensuring our safety and security were stricken rendering the \nconvention more dangerous to our well being than one which would \ninclude those conditions, even if it means having to renegotiate the \nconvention. Of the outstanding amendments which were debated through \nout the day today, I believe those covering Russian ratification and \ntheir compliance with previous treaties, the rejection of inspectors or \ninspections by states with a history of violating non-proliferation \ntreaties or which have been designated by our State Department as \nsporting terrorism, striking article 10 of the treaty and amending \narticle 11, and having our intelligence agencies certify that the \ntreaty would be credibly verifiable were critical to making the treaty \nworthwhile.\n  The fact that the President suggested we could withdraw from the \nconvention if there were a compelling reason to do so, was a placebo \nwhich carried little viable meaning. I believe that it would not only \nbe more difficult to withdraw from the convention once we ratify it, it \nwould be much more dangerous to world stability if we were to withdraw \nafter obligating ourselves to a flawed treaty. And so, I must, in good \nconscience, vote not to ratify.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the first thing I wish to express is my \ngratitude to the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the \nMajority Leader for the work they have done in the final weeks to \nimprove this resolution of ratification.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention before us is significantly better \nthan what we faced last year. In addition, I wish to compliment both \nthe Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations Committee \nfor holding numerous hearings during the past month and for the way \nthey have led the debate over the past two days. The duty of this body \nto advise and consent has never been more honorably met.\n  This treaty, with the resolution of ratification, while now an \nacceptable treaty, is not the panacea for chemical weapons that some of \nthe more adamant proponents have implied or suggested. It will not, in \nand of itself, spare our grandchildren from the horrors of chemical \nwarfare. It will not, in and of itself, protect our citizens from \nterrorists intent on using chemical weapons.\n  This Convention will not significantly reduce the threat of \nterrorism, Mr. President. Now that this debate is almost concluded, it \nwould be of great benefit to the future of this agreement that everyone \nbe realistic about this. The Administration and other proponents of \nthis agreement recognized this when they stated in the resolution of \nratification, condition 19 that: ``The Senate finds that without regard \nto whether the Convention enters into force, terrorists will likely \nview chemical weapons as a means to gain greater publicity and instill \nwidespread fear; and the March 1995 Tokyo subway attack by the Aum \nShinrikyo would not have been prevented by the Convention.''\n  Mr. President, I am greatly concerned about future terrorist threats \nto the citizens of this country, and I urge those who have suggested \nthat this Convention will curb that threat to decease from such \ncounterproductive rhetoric that could disastrously mislead us about \nfuture threats.\n  In addition, I must note to the ardent proponents of the CWC that a \nnumber of nations will remain outside of this regime, and some of them \nhave policies inimical to this nation's welfare and security. I have \nread the Convention, and I wish to state that I read Article XI, \nsection (d) to mean that the U.S. is free to pursue any action--\nunilaterally or multilaterally--against nations having chemical \nweapons. Furthermore, I will insist on clarification indicating that \ncurrent trade sanctions promoting U.S. national security, and supported \nby this body as well the executive, will not be infringed by this \nTreaty.\n\n  The benefits of this Treaty will not nearly approach the rhetoric of \nsome of its proponents. In my opinion, overblown rhetoric enhanced the \npossibility that this Treaty could have failed, as some of us studied \nthe document and realized the great gap between the rhetoric and \nreality.\n  The current resolution of ratification helps to close that gap. The \nconditions included in the resolution preserve the Senate's \nconstitutional role in treaty-making, including approval of amendments \nto the CWC. Agreed conditions established standards for U.S. \nintelligence sharing, including requiring reports on such sharing. They \nlimit the sharing of defensive capabilities under Article X. They \nclarify our position on the use of riot control agents in wartime \ncircumstances, preserving for us that option along the lines originally \nintended by our negotiators under President Reagan. They require the \nPresident to report regularly on the threat of chemical weapons.\n  Finally--and this is extremely important, Mr. President--the \nresolution of ratification requires criminal search warrants for \nchallenge inspections against non-complying parties.\n  I stress again, Mr. President, my gratitude to those, on both sides \nof the aisle as well as in the Clinton Administration, who negotiated \nthis resolution.\n  The letter the Majority Leader has obtained from President Clinton \nalso helps close the gap between rhetoric and reality. The President \nrecognizes, with this letter, that the Treaty may not guarantee the \ncessation of proliferation of these monstrous weapons and their \nprecursors. He recognizes that, despite the goals of this document, our \ndefenses against their possible use on our troops should not wane. He \nrecognizes that we have a regime--the Australia Group--in place that \nhas addressed the problem of illicit trade in chemicals and that that \nregime should not go by the wayside.\n  With this letter, the President recognizes that if this Treaty is \nseen to be failing, we can and will exercise Article XVI, which defines \nhow a State Party may withdraw from the CWC.\n  Despite these improvements and assurances, Mr. President, I know that \na number of thoughtful colleagues continue to have reservations about \nthe effectiveness of this Treaty. And I wish to say that I respect \ntheir decisions, and I object to certain exceptional notions heard \nduring the debate that opponents of this Treaty object because they are \nagainst all arms control treaties. I don't believe this to be the case\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\nat all. This Treaty has many practical limitations, and I believe that \nwe should not impugn the motives of individuals who, at the end of the \nday, have great reservations over its benefits.\n\n  I have supported many arms control agreements myself, Mr. President, \nbut always after careful consideration of the strategic value as well \nas practical consequences of making so grave a commitment. And I must \nsay that it has never been more difficult for me to determine the net \nworth of an arms control agreement as it has been for me regarding the \nChemical Weapons Convention before us today.\n  I have concluded that this treaty can advance our security, but only \nif Administration matches the rhetoric of arms control with the muscle \nof political will. Because, Mr. President, international norms without \npolitical will do not become norms.\n  The benefits of treaties are measured on achievements, not \nintentions. If intentions were all that mattered, all treaties would be \nbeneficial prima facie. By this standard, the Kellogg-Briand Treaty, \nwhich outlawed war, or the 1925 Geneva Convention Against the Use of \nChemical Weapons, would have been rousing successes. History has proven \nthat they were not. But, the success of treaties is measured in \nreality, not rhetoric. And the benefits of this Treaty are measured on \na narrow margin.\n  It is after a careful parsing of this margin, and much reflection, \nthat I have determined that I will vote for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. But I do so with the expectation that this Chief Executive, \nand subsequent ones, must be wholly dedicated to implementing this \nagreement in a way that advances U.S. security interests and protects \nU.S. domestic interests.\n  Mr. President, this Treaty will give us some tools--inspections and \nother data collections--that will enhance our knowledge of the threat \nof chemical weapons. The information will not be comprehensive; it will \nnot apply universally. But, if in collecting this information we reduce \nthe possibility that our troops will face a chemical threat, then this \nis a tangible, defensible goal, for which anyone could support this \nTreaty.\n  The United States has been a principal negotiator of this agreement, \nthrough Republican and Democratic administrations. To abandon it now \nwould be to abdicate U.S. leadership. We are now burdened to support it \nand implement it. The goals are admirable. The bridge to achieving \nthose goals, to bridging the gap between the idealistic rhetoric and \nthe vexing reality, will be difficult. On that bridge, Mr. President, \nwill ride the credibility of the United States, and, I believe, the \ncredibility of future arms control. Past administrations have led in \nthe establishment of this international norm. Future administrations \nwill need to verify its legitimacy. President Clinton must carry \nthrough on his pledge for strict international compliance and for \nvigilence regarding threats by terrorists or renegade groups.\n\n  Over 70 nations have ratified this Convention. Of course, we decided \nto unilaterally destroy our stockpile more than a decade ago, and we \nare proceeding as expeditiously as possible, restrained only by \nprudence regarding safety and the environment. We've known all along \nthat our unilateral destruction plan was not contingent on the outcome \nof this debate. We determined these weapons were not militarily useful \nto us; our defense establishment can preserve and promote our national \nsecurity without them. But as of the moment that our instrument of \nratification is deposited, we will be the first of the countries with a \nlarge stockpile to ratify. The United States is leading. Will other \nnations follow?\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about Russia. With the \nconsent of the Senate today, the Administration will be able to deposit \nthe instrument of ratification before the April 29 deadline, allowing \nU.S. participation in the formation of the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. The U.S. and Russia are the only \npowers that voluntarily declare they have chemical weapons. On two \noccasions the Russians have joined us--in the 1990 Bilateral \nDestruction Agreement and under the 1989 Wyoming Memorandum--in \nbilateral commitments to expose and destroy our stockpiles. As those \nwho have studied this question know, the record of Russian compliance \nis not good. As those who read the papers and get the briefings know, \nthe Russian chemical arms capability is not stagnant.\n  President Yeltsin has indicated that he wishes the Russian Duma to \napprove ratification before the April 29 deadline. I hope they do. The \nRussians need to join and participate in the initial construction of \nthis regime. And we need to begin to inspect and expose all of our \nstockpiles. If the Russians are not part of this Treaty, Mr. President, \nthis regime may be stillborn, because the largest stockpile of chemical \nweapons in the world exists in the Russian Federation. I hope we can \nwork with the Russians as partners beginning next week.\n  If the Senate gives its consent today, Mr. President, next week the \nhard work will begin. The success or failure of this regime will not be \na function of depositing the instrument of ratification. It will be a \nfunction of implementing the agreement. I am supporting this Convention \ntoday because I think it can only succeed with U.S. participation--and \nleadership. It can fail for many reasons, including noncompliance or \nnonparticipation by nations around the world. But it won't succeed \nwithout U.S. leadership.\n  Leadership will require more than idealistic promises. We must \nabandon the rhetoric of unattainable promises and commit to the reality \nof national interest. I fear the Administration will have a lot of work \nbuilding the bridge between the rhetoric and reality. On that bridge \nlies the future of this Convention and the future of arms control.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me state the order of distinguished \nspeakers on this side of the aisle. I am going to start with the most \ndistinguished of all. The President pro tempore of the Senate, Senator \nThurmond, will have 5 minutes; followed by Senator Hutchison of Texas, \nfor 5 minutes; Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas to follow with 2 minutes; \nSenator Brownback, for 1 minute; Senator Kyl, for 1 minute; Senator \nAshcroft, for 2 minutes. They will be recognized in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to recognize the work done on \nthis treaty by the floor managers--both in opposition and in support of \nthis very important international treaty. Both sides have made laudable \narguments in supporting their different positions. This subject is one \nof great importance. I want to especially commend our able majority \nleader for the long hours he spent working with both floor managers and \nthe administration.\n  Mr. President, during the Senate Armed Services Committee's review of \nthe national security implications of the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nI raised concerns about the ability of the U.S. to comply with the \ntreaty obligation to destroy our chemical stockpile within the \ntimeframe stipulated, the universality of the treaty, the verifiability \nof the treaty, and the administration's interpretation of the provision \non the defensive use of riot control agents by U.S. forces.\n  During the committee's hearings on the treaty in August 1994, I took \nno position on this treaty. I made it clear that the administration \nwould have to convince me that it was in the national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  I have concerns about statements made over the past few weeks, by the \nPresident and several administration representatives, that if the \nUnited States does not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, that we \nwould be aligning ourselves on the side of rogue nations, like Iraq and \nLibya, and against our allies.\n  Mr. President, in 1985 the Congress legislated the requirement for \nthe United States to destroy its chemical stockpile, and has reaffirmed \nthat decision every year since that time. The Senate agreed to take \nactions against Iraq for attacking its neighbor, and against Libya for \nterrorist actions which resulted in the death of American citizens. How \ncan the President, the Secretary of State and other administration \nrepresentatives liken a decision by the Senate, in its performance of \nits constitutional duties to provide advice and consent to \ninternational treaties, to be aligning the United States with rogue \nnations? Regardless of the outcome of the CWC,\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\nthe United States will continue to destroy its chemical stockpiles.\n  Last Sunday, the Secretary of Defense talked about his recent visit \nto South Korea and the discussions he had about the threat posed to \nU.S. Forces by the chemical weapons in North Korea. He also mentioned \nGeneral Tilelli's support for ratification of the CWC because it would \nreduce the chemical weapons threat faced by his troops in South Korea.\n  Mr. President, North Korea has not signed the CWC. As I read the \ntreaty, none of the provisions will apply to nations that have not \nsigned and ratified it. Only trade sanctions will apply to countries \nthat have not signed it. United States ratification of the CWC will not \nminimize the North Korean chemical weapons threat which face our United \nStates forces.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support the Chemical Weapons Convention. I \nappreciate the efforts made by the White House to work out conditions \nto the resolution of ratification that respond to concerns raised about \nthe treaty made by Members of the Senate. However, I do not believe \nthey go far enough. I remain concerned about the ability of the \nintelligence community to verify compliance with the treaty. Rogue \nnations which pose a military and terrorist threat to the United States \nhave not signed the treaty, and most likely will not sign it. I am also \nconcerned about the potential compromise of U.S. defensive capability \nthrough potential transfers of chemical defensive protective equipment, \nmaterial or information under article X and article XI.\n  It is for these reasons that I cannot vote for this treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I respect everyone who is going to \nvote today for the position that they are taking because I know that it \nis sincere. I respect the people who have come out for this convention \ntreaty--the former Presidents--and I respect the people who have come \nout against the treaty, the former Secretaries of Defense.\n  It comes down, for me, to a basic question, and that is: Do we \nbelieve that international conventions and conferences keep us safe at \nnight? Or do we believe a strong national defense is what keeps us safe \nat night and what has served us so well for this century? Mr. \nPresident, I think it is a commitment to a strong national defense, and \nI have decided, reluctantly, to vote against this convention treaty \nbecause I believe this does more to harm our strength and our national \ndefense than it does to help it.\n  Mr. President, we have seen our allies transfer nuclear technology \nthat can be made into weapons to rogue nations. So now we have a treaty \nthat will allow people to come into our chemical plants--not chemical \nplants that make weapons, because we are not going to make weapons, but \ninto our chemical plants that might be doing research on how to defend \nagainst chemical weapons. That technology can then be transferred to \nthe nations who would use the chemical weapons.\n  It seems to me that we are unilaterally disarming ourselves, Mr. \nPresident, with a treaty that would say we must allow international \ngroups to come into plants that use chemicals, whether it is to make \nfertilizer or disinfectant, or defenses to chemical weapons, any of \nthose things. An international group will be able to come in and, I \nthink, violate our constitutional right against search and seizure. I \nam concerned that we are hurting our ability to defend our country.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we have a choice here between America \nbeing the leader and undercutting our defenses, or standing on \nprinciple and protecting our security. Mr. President, I just don't \nthink there is a choice. We must stand on principle. So that if our \nyoung men and women in the field are attacked by chemical weapons by \nthose who will not sign this treaty, we will surely have the defenses \nto protect them; and so that we will keep the ability in our country to \nhave the strength to fight the chemical weapons that will be produced, \nthat we know are being produced right now, by nations who will not \nabide by this treaty.\n  So I do not buy the argument that we are better off with this treaty \nthan without it. In fact, I think we are hurting our ability to combat \nthe rogue nations, the terrorist nations with whom we are dealing all \nover the world, and I could not vote in good conscience to do that. \nThank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to especially applaud this \nevening the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from Arizona \nfor their courageous opposition to this treaty. I also want to \nrecognize the good and patriotic Americans and Senators who have \ndiffered on this treaty and have come down to different places on how \nthey are going to vote.\n  But this treaty is not about who is committed to and who believes in \nthe elimination of chemical warfare in this world. I believe all of us \nare equally committed to that goal.\n  I rise in opposition to the CWC because I simply believe that it is a \nflawed treaty in which we claim to verify the unverifiable, we are \nratifying the unenforceable, and we are trusting the untrustworthy. We \nare binding ourselves and our friends, while those that we should be \nmost concerned about go unrestrained and undeterred. When addressing \nthe ratification of a treaty, we in this body are executing one of our \nmost solemn duties. When addressing our Nation's security and when \naddressing our Nation's sovereignty, our watch words should be \n``prudence'' and ``caution.''\n  I believe that prudence and caution call out for a ``no'' vote. By \nratifying this treaty, we spurn the sage advice of former Secretaries \nof Defense. And I close with the words of one of those Secretaries, \nSecretary Cheney, who wrote that ``This accord is worse than no treaty \nat all.''\n  So, while I recognize and applaud the sincerity and the passion with \nwhich the advocates of this treaty have spoken and how they articulated \ntheir position, I believe firmly that it is not in the interest of the \nsovereignty and the security of the United States. And I urge a ``no'' \nvote on the treaty ratification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I join with other Senators noting how extremely \ndifficult and important this decision is to vote for treaty \nratification. I have taken it very seriously, as well as everybody \nelse. I have read the entire treaty. I sat down and thought it through. \nI have talked with people. I have talked with President Bush, Bob Dole, \nColin Powell, Casper Weinberger, James Schlesinger, Richard Perle, and \nmy 9-year-old son, too, who I think has a stake in this as well.\n  I find it a terribly tough call to make on this treaty; a tough one \nto be able to decide what is in the best interest and ultimately what \nwill get the fewest chemical weapons used in this world. That to me is \nthe real litmus test issue. What is going to make the world safer is \nwhen we are going to have fewer chemical weapons used in the world.\n  I would like to bare to the body that I chair the Middle East \nSubcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee. We held a hearing just \nlast week on U.S. policy toward Iran. Our policy has failed to stop \nthem from receiving weapons of mass destruction, particularly chemical \nweapons. The Iranians are receiving precursor chemical weapons from the \nChinese.\n  May I have an additional minute and a half?\n  Mr. HELMS. Please. Yes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the chairman very much.\n  As I mentioned in our hearing last week, it was noted and pointed out \nthat the Iranians have received chemical weapons, precursor chemical \nweapons, from the Chinese and from other sources.\n  I have reluctantly but clearly concluded that Iran would be more \nlikely to obtain and use chemical weapons if we enter into this \nChemical Weapons Convention with article X in place, which is currently \nhow it sits; that they will be more likely to get and use chemical \nweapons, weapons of mass destruction. Iran is our erstwhile terrorist \nenemy.\n  I spoke to Colin Powell. He noted that chemical weapons today are the\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\nweapons of choice, primarily, for terrorists. These are primarily \nweapons used by terrorists. That certainly fits the Iranians.\n  So that is why I have, unfortunately, reluctantly yet clearly, \ndecided that with article X in it and with the likelihood of that being \nused by the Iranians, that this treaty would actually cause more \nchemical weapons to be used by people that we don't want; by terrorist \nregimes such as the Iranians. Therefore, I will have to vote against \nthis treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to make \nsome comments in regard to this serious matter.\n  None of us has any affection for chemical weapons. Each of us hates \nchemical weapons. We would all like to see chemical weapons abolished. \nNone of us would like to see chemical weapons used. We would all like \nto believe the statements of prominent experts that have been made \nabout this treaty. We would all like to embrace the assurances of the \nPresident that, if something goes wrong, the treaty could be something \neasily walked away from.\n  But, in spite of all our aspirations, in spite of all of our desires, \nand in spite of all our hopes, there is one reality which will persist; \nand that reality is the language of the treaty itself. Long after the \nassurances have stopped echoing through this Chamber, long after the \nPresident has left office, who is trying to assuage the fears of those \nwho have misgivings about this treaty, the black and white letters of \nthe treaty itself will be the controlling components of what happens. \nAnd the thing that gives me great pause is that the treaty will remain.\n  There are the requirements, particularly in articles X and XI of the \ntreaty, which require us to share technology, to share information, and \nto share, in particular, the defensive technology of chemical weaponry. \nThere is an anomaly in chemical weaponry which is challenging. It is \nthat when you provide the defensive technology for chemical weapons, \nyou are providing one of the essential components of delivering \nchemical weapons. No one can deliver chemical weapons, unless it \nis launched by a missile, without having to have all the technologies \nof how to defend against the chemistry of the weapons.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  If a rogue state wants to deliver chemical weapons, one of the things \nthey need to do is to acquire the defensive technology to defend \nagainst them and to protect their own soldiers in delivery. That seems \nto me one of the substantial problems contained in articles X and XI. \nThe risks far exceed the benefits.\n  As a result, I think it is ill-advised for us to accept assurances \nwhich would mislead us. We need to read the treaty, and the treaty is \nnot one which merits our approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senator Helms and \nSenator Biden, the floor managers of this treaty, for the work they did \nin bringing it before us.\n  Mr. President, I share the hope of the supporters of this treaty that \nit will help end the proliferation of chemical weapons. I believe, \nhowever, that history will record this treaty as one of the most well-\nintentioned yet least effective in our history. My hope is that we will \nnot relax our efforts in other ways to reduce this threat, that we will \nnot be lulled into a sense of security when it is ratified.\n  With the protections in the original resolution of ratification, I \nvoted for the treaty. But the protections having been stricken, I must \nvote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senators will be glad to hear this.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the final vote in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not use all of that time, only to \nsay this. We will advise and consent so the President can ratify this \ntreaty. I truly believe we will. It will show the moral leadership that \nthe Senate should show and that the United States should show. We will \nact as the conscience of this Nation, and we will advise and consent to \nthis treaty. We will show the moral leadership because we began this by \nsaying we would act unilaterally, if need be, renouncing our own use of \nchemical weapons with or without a treaty. That was true leadership.\n  Not all countries are going to join with us. But most did join with \nus on this, and we should be proud of that leadership that brought them \ntogether. We will never have all of the countries with us, but we know \nthat it is in the best interests of the United States to do this.\n  I suggest, after we do this, Mr. President, that we should again look \nat the question of antipersonnel landmines and show the same moral \nleadership to get countries to join with us--not all countries will--to \nban antipersonnel landmines which kill and injure far more people than \nchemical weapons.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for advice and consent of this treaty so \nthe President can ratify it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I, on behalf of the leader's time and any \nother time that may be assigned to me, yield the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution \nof ratification.

and\n       (iv) each Australia Group member, at the highest diplomatic \n     levels, has officially communicated to the United States \n     Government its understanding and agreement that export \n     control and nonproliferation measures which the Australia \n     Group has undertaken are fully compatible with the provisions \n     of the Convention, including Article XI(2), and its \n     commitment to maintain in the future such export controls and \n     nonproliferation measures against non-Australia Group \n     members.\n       (C) Annual certification.--\n       (i) Effectiveness of australia group.--The President shall \n     certify to Congress on an annual basis that--\n       (I) Australia Group members continue to maintain an equally \n     effective or more comprehensive control over the export of \n     toxic chemicals and their precursors, dual-use processing \n     equipment, human, animal and plant pathogens and toxins with \n     potential biological weapons application, and dual-use \n     biological equipment, as that afforded by the Australia Group \n     as of the date of ratification of the Convention by the \n     United States; and\n       (II) the Australia Group remains a viable mechanism for \n     limiting the spread of chemical and biological weapons-\n     related materials and technology, and that the effectiveness \n     of the Australia Group has not been undermined by changes in \n     membership, lack of compliance with common export controls \n     and nonproliferation measures, or the weakening of common \n     controls and nonproliferation measures, in force as of the \n     date of ratification of the Convention by the United States.\n       (ii) Consultation with senate required.--In the event that \n     the President is, at any time, unable to make the \n     certifications described in clause (i), the President shall \n     consult with the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a \n     resolution of support for continued adherence to the \n     Convention, notwithstanding the fundamental change in \n     circumstance.\n       (D) Periodic consultation with congressional committees.--\n     The President shall consult periodically, but not less \n     frequently than twice a year, with the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives, on Australia Group \n     export control and nonproliferation measures. If any \n     Australia Group member adopts a position at variance with the \n     certifications and understandings provided under subparagraph \n     (B), or should seek to gain Australia Group acquiescence or \n     approval for an interpretation that various provisions of the \n     Convention require it to remove chemical-weapons related \n     export controls against any State Party to the Convention, \n     the President shall block any effort by the Australia Group \n     member to secure Australia Group approval of such a position \n     or interpretation.\n       (E) Definitions.--In this paragraph.\n       (i) Australia group.--The term ``Australia Group'' means \n     the informal forum of states, chaired by Australia, whose \n     goal is to discourage and impede chemical and biological \n     weapons proliferation by harmonizing national export \n     controls, chemical weapons precursor chemicals, biological \n     weapons pathogens, and dual-use production equipment, and \n     through other measures.\n       (ii) Highest diplomatic levels.--The term ``highest \n     diplomatic levels'' means at the levels of senior officials \n     with the power to authoritatively represent their \n     governments, and does not include diplomatic representatives \n     of these governments to the United States.\n       (8) Negative security assurances.--\n       (A) Reevalation.--In forswearing under the Convention the \n     possession of a chemical weapons retaliatory capability, the \n     Senate understands that deterrence of attack by chemical \n     weapons requires a reevaluation of the negative security \n     assurances extended to non-nuclear-weapon states.\n       (B) Classified report.--Accordingly, 180 days after the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     President shall submit to the Congress a classified report \n     setting forth the findings of a detailed review of United \n     States policy on negative security assurances, including a \n     determination of the appropriate responses to the use of \n     chemical or biological weapons against the Armed Forces of \n     the United States, United States citizens and allies, and \n     third parties.\n       (9) Protection of advanced biotechnology.--Prior to the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, and \n     on January 1 of every year thereafter, the President shall \n     certify to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives that the legitimate \n     commercial activities and interests of chemical, \n     biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms in the United States \n     are not being significantly harmed by the limitations of the \n     Convention on access to, and production of, those chemicals \n     and toxins listed in Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals.\n       (10) Monitoring and verification of compliance.--\n       (A) Declaration.--The Senate declares that--\n       (i) the Convention is in the interests of the United States \n     only if all State Parties are in strict compliance with the \n     terms of the Convention as submitted to the Senate for its \n     advice and consent to ratification, such compliance being \n     measured by performance and not by efforts, intentions, or \n     commitments to comply; and\n       (ii) the Senate expects all State Parties to be in strict \n     compliance with their obligations under the terms of the \n     Convention, as submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification;\n       (B) Briefings on compliance.--Given its concern about the \n     intelligence community's low level of confidence in its \n     ability to monitor compliance with the Convention, the Senate \n     expects the executive branch of the Government to offer \n     regular briefings, not less than four times a year, to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives on compliance issues related to the \n     Convention. Such briefings shall include a description of all \n     United States efforts in bilateral and multilateral \n     diplomatic channels and forums to resolve compliance issues \n     and shall include a complete description of--\n       (i) any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     at meetings of the Organization, in advance of such meetings;\n       (ii) any compliance issues raised at meetings of the \n     Organization, within 30 days of such meeting;\n       (iii) any determination by the President that a State Party \n     is in noncompliance with or is otherwise acting in a manner \n     inconsistent with the object or purpose of the Convention, \n     within 30 days of such a determination.\n       (C) Annual reports on compliance.--The President shall \n     submit on January 1 of each year to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a full and complete \n     classified and unclassified report setting forth--\n       (i) a certification of those countries included in the \n     Intelligence Community's Monitoring Strategy, as set forth by \n     the Director of Central Intelligence's Arms Control Staff and \n     the National Intelligence Council (or any successor document \n     setting forth intelligence priorities in the field of the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction) that are \n     determined to be in compliance with the Convention, on a \n     country-by-country basis;\n       (ii) for those countries not certified pursuant to clause \n     (i), an identification and assessment of all compliance \n     issues arising with regard to the adherence of the country to \n     its obligations under the Convention;\n       (iii) the steps the United States has taken, either \n     unilaterally or in conjunction with another State Party--\n       (I) to initiate challenge inspections of the noncompliant \n     party with the objective of demonstrating to the \n     international community the act of noncompliance;\n       (II) to call attention publicly to the activity in \n     question; and\n       (III) to seek on an urgent basis a meeting at the highest \n     diplomatic level with the noncompliant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n       (iv) a determination of the military significance and \n     broader security risks arising from any compliance issue \n     identified pursuant to clause (ii); and\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\n       (v) a detailed assessment of the responses of the \n     noncompliant party in question to action undertaken by the \n     United States described in clause (iii).\n       (D) Countries previously included in compliance reports.--\n     For any country that was previously included in a report \n     submitted under subparagraph (C), but which subsequently is \n     not included in the Intelligence Community's Monitoring \n     Strategy (or successor document), such country shall continue \n     to be included in the report submitted under subparagraph (C) \n     unless the country has been certified under subparagraph \n     (C)(i) for each of the previous two years.\n       (E) Form of certifications.--For those countries that have \n     been publicly and officially identified by a representative \n     of the intelligence community as possessing or seeking to \n     develop chemical weapons, the certification described in \n     subparagraph (C)(i) shall be in unclassified form.\n       (F) Annual reports on intelligence.--On January 1, 1998, \n     and annually thereafter, the Director of Central Intelligence \n     shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed \n     Services, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate and to the Committees on International Relations, \n     National Security, and Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives a full and \n     complete classified and unclassified report regarding--\n       (i) the status of chemical weapons development, production, \n     stockpiling, and use, within the meanings of those terms \n     under the Convention, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (ii) any information made available to the United States \n     Government concerning the development, production, \n     acquisition, stockpiling, retention, use, or direct or \n     indirect transfer of novel agents, including any unitary or \n     binary chemical weapon comprised of chemical components not \n     identified on the schedules of the Annex on Chemicals, on a \n     country-by-country basis;\n       (iii) the extent of trade in chemicals potentially relevant \n     to chemical weapons programs, including all Australia Group \n     chemicals and chemicals identified on the schedules of the \n     Annex on Chemicals, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (iv) the monitoring responsibilities, practices, and \n     strategies of the intelligence community (as defined in \n     section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947) and a \n     determination of the level of confidence of the intelligence \n     community with respect to each specific monitoring task \n     undertaken, including an assessment by the intelligence \n     community of the national aggregate data provided by State \n     Parties to the Organization, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (v) an identification of how United States national \n     intelligence means, including national technical means and \n     human intelligence, are being marshaled together with the \n     Convention's verification provisions to monitor compliance \n     with the Convention;

and\n       (ii) an identification of the priorities of the executive \n     branch of Government for the development of new resources \n     relating to detection and monitoring capabilities with \n     respect to chemical and biological weapons, including a \n     description of the steps being taken and resources being \n     devoted to strengthening United States monitoring \n     capabilities.\n       (11) Enhancements to robust chemical and biological \n     defenses.--\n       (A) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) chemical and biological threats to deployed United \n     States Armed Forces will continue to grow in regions of \n     concern around the world, and pose serious threats to United \n     States power projection and forward deployment strategies;\n       (ii) chemical weapons or biological weapons use is a \n     potential element of future conflicts in regions of concern;\n       (iii) it is essential for the United States and key \n     regional allies to preserve and further develop robust \n     chemical and biological defenses;\n       (iv) the United States Armed Forces are inadequately \n     equipped, organized, trained and exercised for chemical and \n     biological defense against current and expected threats, and \n     that too much reliance is placed on non-active duty forces, \n     which receive less training and less modern equipment, for \n     critical chemical and biological defense capabilities;\n       (v) the lack of readiness stems from a de-emphasis of \n     chemical and biological defenses within the executive branch \n     of Government and the United States Armed Forces;\n       (vi) the armed forces of key regional allies and likely \n     coalition partners, as well as civilians necessary to support \n     United States military operations, are inadequately prepared \n     and equipped to carry out essential missions in chemically \n     and biologically contaminated environments;\n       (vii) congressional direction contained in the Defense \n     Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996 (title XIV of \n     Public Law 104-201) should lead to enhanced domestic \n     preparedness to protect against chemical and biological \n     weapons threats; and\n       (viii) the United States Armed Forces should place \n     increased emphasis on potential threats to forces deployed \n     abroad and, in particular, make countering chemical and \n     biological weapons use an organizing principle for United \n     States defense strategy and development of force structure, \n     doctrine, planning, training, and exercising policies of the \n     United States Armed Forces.\n       (B) Actions to strengthen defense capabilities.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall take those actions necessary to \n     ensure that the United States Armed Forces are capable of \n     carrying out required military missions in United States \n     regional contingency plans, despite the threat or use of \n     chemical or biological weapons. In particular, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall ensure that the United States Armed Forces \n     are effectively equipped, organized, trained, and exercised \n     (including at the large unit and theater level) to conduct \n     operations in a chemically or biologically contaminated \n     environment that are critical to the success of the United \n     States military plans in regional conflicts, including--\n       (i) deployment, logistics, and reinforcement operations at \n     key ports and airfields;\n       (ii) sustained combat aircraft sortie generation at \n     critical regional airbases; and\n       (iii) ground force maneuvers of large units and divisions.\n       (C) Discussions with regional allies and likely coalition \n     partners.--\n       (i) In general.--The Secretaries of Defense and State \n     shall, as a priority matter, initiate discussions with key \n     regional allies and likely regional coalition partners, \n     including those countries where the United States currently \n     deploys forces, where United States forces would likely \n     operate during regional conflicts, or which would provide \n     civilians necessary to support United States military \n     operations, to determine what steps are necessary to ensure \n     that allied and coalition forces and other critical civilians \n     are adequately equipped and prepared to operate in chemically \n     and biologically contaminated environments.\n       (ii) Reporting requirement.--Not later than one year after \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     Secretaries of Defense and State shall submit a report to the \n     Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the \n     Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on \n     the result of these discussions, plans for future \n     discussions, measures agreed to improve the preparedness of \n     foreign forces and civilians, and proposals for increased \n     military assistance, including through the Foreign Military \n     Sales and Foreign Military Financing under the Arms Export \n     Control Act, and the International Military Education and \n     Training programs pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961.\n       (D) United states army chemical school.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall take those actions necessary to ensure that the \n     United States Army Chemical School remains under the \n     oversight of a general officer of the United States Army.\n       (E) Sense of the senate.--Given its concerns about the \n     present state of chemical and biological defense readiness \n     and training, it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (i) in the transfer, consolidation, and reorganization of \n     the United States Army Chemical School, the Army should not \n     disrupt or diminish the training and readiness of the United \n     States Armed Forces to fight in a chemical-biological warfare \n     environment;\n       (ii) the Army should continue to operate the Chemical \n     Defense Training Facility at Fort McClellan until such time \n     as the replacement training facility at Fort Leonard Wood is \n     functional.\n       (F) Annual reports on chemical and biological weapons \n     defense activities.--On January 1, 1998, and annually \n     thereafter, the President shall submit a report to the \n     Committees on Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committees on International \n     Relations, National Security, and Appropriations of the House \n     of Representatives, and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives on previous, current, and planned chemical \n     and biological weapons defense activities. The report shall \n     contain for the previous fiscal year and for the next three \n     fiscal years--\n       (i) proposed solutions to each of the deficiencies in \n     chemical and biological warfare defenses identified in the \n     March 1996 report of the General Accounting Office entitled \n     ``Chemical and Biological Defense: Emphasis Remains \n     Insufficient to Resolve Continuing Problems'', and steps \n     being taken pursuant to subparagraph (B) to ensure that the \n     United States Armed Forces are capable of conducting required \n     military operations to ensure the success of United States \n     regional contingency plans despite the threat or use of \n     chemical or biological weapons;\n       (ii) identification of the priorities of the executive \n     branch of Government in the development of both active and \n     passive chemical and biological defenses;\n       (iii) a detailed summary of all budget activities \n     associated with the research, development, testing, and \n     evaluation of chemical and biological defense programs;\n       (iv) a detailed summary of expenditures on research, \n     development, testing, and evaluation, and procurement of \n     chemical and biological defenses by fiscal years defense \n     programs, department, and agency;\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\n       (v) a detailed assessment of current and projected vaccine \n     production capabilities and vaccine stocks, including \n     progress in researching and developing a multivalent vaccine;\n       (vi) a detailed assessment of procedures and capabilities \n     necessary to protect and decontaminate infrastructure to \n     reinforce United States power-projection forces, including \n     progress in developing a nonaqueous chemical decontamination \n     capability;\n       (vii) a description of progress made in procuring light-\n     weight personal protective gear and steps being taken to \n     ensure that programmed procurement quantities are sufficient \n     to replace expiring battle-dress overgarments and chemical \n     protective overgarments to maintain required wartime \n     inventory levels;\n       (viii) a description of progress made in developing long-\n     range standoff detection and identification capabilities and \n     other battlefield surveillance capabilities for biological \n     and chemical weapons, including progress on developing a \n     multichemical agent detector, unmanned aerial vehicles, and \n     unmanned ground sensors;\n       (ix) a description of progress made in developing and \n     deploying layered theater missile defenses for deployed \n     United States Armed Forces which will provide greater \n     geographic coverage against current and expected ballistic \n     missile threats and will assist in mitigating chemical and \n     biological contamination through higher altitude intercepts \n     and boost-phase intercepts;\n       (x) an assessment of--\n       (I) the training and readiness of the United States Armed \n     Forces to operate in a chemically or biologically \n     contaminated environment;

and\n       (xiii) a description of progress made in resolving issues \n     relating to the protection of United States population \n     centers from chemical and biological attack, including plans \n     for inoculation of populations, consequence management, and a \n     description of progress made in developing and deploying \n     effective cruise missile defenses and a national ballistic \n     missile defense.\n       (12) Primacy of the united states constitution.--Nothing in \n     the Convention requires or authorizes legislation, or other \n     action, by the United States prohibited by the Constitution \n     of the United States, as interpreted by the United States.\n       (13) Noncompliance.--\n       (A) In general.--If the President determines that \n     persuasive information exists that a State Party to the \n     Convention is maintaining a chemical weapons production or \n     production mobilization capability, is developing new \n     chemical agents, or is in violation of the Convention in any \n     other manner so as to threaten the national security \n     interests of the United States, then the President shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate, and promptly submit to it, a \n     report detailing the effect of such actions;\n       (ii) seek on an urgent basis a challenge inspection of the \n     facilities of the relevant party in accordance with the \n     provisions of the Convention with the objective of \n     demonstrating to the international community the act of \n     noncompliance;\n       (iii) seek, or encourage, on an urgent basis a meeting at \n     the highest diplomatic level with the relevant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n       (iv) implement prohibitions and sanctions against the \n     relevant party as required by law;\n       (v) if noncompliance has been determined, seek on an urgent \n     basis within the Security Council of the United Nations a \n     multilateral imposition of sanctions against the noncompliant \n     party for the purposes of bringing the noncompliant party \n     into compliance; and\n       (vi) in the event that the noncompliance continues for a \n     period of longer than one year after the date of the \n     determination made pursuant to subparagraph (A), promptly \n     consult with the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a \n     resolution of support for continued adherence to the \n     Convention, notwithstanding the changed circumstances \n     affecting the object and purpose of the Convention.\n       (B) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed \n     to impair or otherwise affect the authority of the Director \n     of Central Intelligence to protect intelligence sources and \n     methods from unauthorized disclosure pursuant to section \n     103(c)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     403-3(c)(5)).\n       (C) Presidential determinations.--If the President \n     determines that an action otherwise required under \n     subparagraph (A) would impair or otherwise affect the \n     authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to protect \n     intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized \n     disclosure, the President shall report that determination, \n     together with a detailed written explanation of the basis for \n     that determination, to the chairmen of the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence not later than 15 days after making \n     such determination.\n       (14) Financing russian implementation.--The United States \n     understands that, in order to be assured of the Russian \n     commitment to a reduction in chemical weapons stockpiles, \n     Russia must maintain a substantial stake in financing the \n     implementation of both the 1990 Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement and the Convention. The United States shall not \n     accept any effort by Russia to make deposit of Russia's \n     instrument of ratification of the Convention contingent upon \n     the United States providing financial guarantees to pay for \n     implementation of commitments by Russia under the 1990 \n     Bilateral Destruction Agreement or the Convention.\n       (15) Assistance under article x.--\n       (A) In general.--Prior to the deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     the Congress that the United States shall not provide \n     assistance under paragraph 7(a) of Article X.\n       (B) Countries ineligible for certain assistance under the \n     foreign assistance act.--Prior to the deposit of the United \n     States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to the Congress that for any State Party the \n     government of which is not eligible for assistance under \n     chapter 2 of part II (relating to military assistance) or \n     chapter 4 of part II (relating to economic support \n     assistance) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961--\n       (i) no assistance under paragraph 7(b) of Article X will be \n     provided to the State Party; and\n       (ii) no assistance under paragraph 7(c) of Article X other \n     than medical antidotes and treatment will be provided to the \n     State Party.\n       (16) Protection of confidential information.--\n       (A) Unauthorized disclosure of united states business \n     information.--Whenever the President determines that \n     persuasive information is available indicating that--\n       (i) an officer or employee of the Organization has \n     willfully published, divulged, disclosed, or made known in \n     any manner or to any extent not authorized by the Convention \n     any United States confidential business information coming to \n     him in the course of his employment or official duties or by \n     reason of any examination or investigation of any return, \n     report, or record made to or filed with the Organization, or \n     any officer or employee thereof, and\n       (ii) such practice or disclosure has resulted in financial \n     losses or damages to a United States person,\n\n     the President shall, within 30 days after the receipt of such \n     information by the executive branch of Government, notify the \n     Congress in writing of such determination.\n       (B) Waiver of immunity from jurisdiction.--\n       (i) Certification.--Not later than 270 days after \n     notification of Congress under subparagraph (A), the \n     President shall certify to Congress that the immunity from \n     jurisdiction of such foreign person has been waived by the \n     Director-General of the Technical Secretariat.\n       (ii) Withholding of portion of contributions.--If the \n     President is unable to make the certification described under \n     clause (i), then 50 percent of the amount of each annual \n     United States contribution to the regular budget of the \n     Organization that is assessed pursuant to paragraph 7 of \n     Article VIII shall be withheld from disbursement, in addition \n     to any other amounts required to be withheld from \n     disbursement by any other provision of law, until--\n       (I) the President makes such certification, or\n       (II) the President certifies to Congress that the situation \n     has been resolved in a manner satisfactory to the United \n     States person who has suffered the damages due to the \n     disclosure of United States confidential business \n     information.\n       (C) Breaches of confidentiality.--\n       (i) Certification.--In the case of any breach of \n     confidentiality involving both a State Party and the \n     Organization, including any officer or employee thereof, the \n     President shall, within 270 days after providing written \n     notification to Congress pursuant to subparagraph (A), \n     certify to Congress that the Commission described under \n     paragraph 23 of the Confidentiality Annex has been \n     established to consider the breach.\n       (ii) Withholding of portion of contributions.--If the \n     President is unable to make the certification described under \n     clause (i), then 50 percent of the amount of each annual \n     United States contribution to the regular budget of the \n     Organization that is assessed pursuant to paragraph 7 of \n     Article VIII shall be withheld from disbursement, in addition \n     to any other amounts required to be withheld from \n     disbursement by any other provision of law, until--\n       (I) the President makes such certification, or\n       (II) the President certifies to Congress that the situation \n     has been resolved in a manner\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\n     satisfactory to the United States person who has suffered the \n     damages due to the disclosure of United States confidential \n     business information.\n       (D) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) United states confidential business information.--The \n     term ``United States confidential business information means \n     any trade secrets or commercial or financial information that \n     is privileged and confidential, as described in section \n     662(b)(4) of title 5, United States Code, and that is \n     obtained--\n       (I) from a United States person; and\n       (II) through the United States National Authority or the \n     conduct of an inspection on United States territory under the \n     Convention.\n       (ii) United States person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' means any natural person or any corporation, \n     partnership, or other juridical entity organized under the \n     laws of the United States.\n       (iii) United states.--The term ``United States'' means the \n     several States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United \n     States.\n       (17) Constitutional prerogatives.--\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (i) Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States \n     Constitution states that the President ``shall have Power, by \n     and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make \n     Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present \n     concur''.\n       (ii) At the turn of the century, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge \n     took the position that the giving of advice and consent to \n     the ratification of treaties constitutes a stage in \n     negotiation on the treaties and that Senate amendments or \n     reservations to a treaty are propositions ``offered at a \n     later stage of the negotiation by the other part of the \n     American treaty making power in the only manner in which they \n     could then be offered''.\n       (iii) The executive branch of Government has begun a \n     practice of negotiating and submitting to the Senate treaties \n     which include provisions that have the purported effect of--\n       (I) inhibiting the Senate from attaching reservations that \n     the Senate considers necessary in the national interest; or\n       (II) preventing the Senate from exercising its \n     constitutional duty to give its advice and consent to treaty \n     commitments before ratification of the treaties.\n       (iv) During the 85th Congress, and again during the 102d \n     Congress, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     made its position on this issue clear when stating that ``the \n     President's agreement to such a prohibition cannot constrain \n     the Senate's constitutional right and obligation to give its \n     advice and consent to a treaty subject to any reservation it \n     might determine is required by the national interest''.\n       (B) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) the advice and consent given by the Senate in the past \n     to ratification of treaties containing provisions which \n     prohibit amendments or reservations should not be construed \n     as a precedent for such provisions in future treaties;\n       (ii) United States negotiators to a treaty should not agree \n     to any provision that has the effect of inhibiting the Senate \n     from attaching reservations or offering amendments to the \n     treaty; and\n       (iii) the Senate should not consent in the future to any \n     article or other provision of any treaty that would prohibit \n     the Senate from giving its advice and consent to ratification \n     of the treaty subject to amendment or reservation.\n       (18) Laboratory sample analysis.--Prior to the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that no sample collected in the \n     United States pursuant to the Convention will be transferred \n     for analysis to any laboratory outside the territory of the \n     United States.\n       (19) Effect on terrorism.--The Senate finds that--\n       (A) without regard to whether the Convention enters into \n     force, terrorists will likely view chemical weapons as a \n     means to gain greater publicity and instill widespread fear; \n     and\n       (B) the March 1995 Tokyo subway attack by the Aum Shinrikyo \n     would not have been prevented by the Convention.\n       (20) Constitutional separation of powers.--\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (i) Article VIII(8) of the Convention allows a State Party \n     to vote in the Organization if the State Party is in arrears \n     in the payment of financial contributions and the \n     Organization is satisfied that such nonpayment is due to \n     conditions beyond the control of the State Party.\n       (ii) Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution \n     vests in Congress the exclusive authority to ``pay the \n     Debts'' of the United States.\n       (iii) Financial contributions to the Organization may be \n     appropriated only by Congress.\n       (B) Sense of senate.--It is therefore the sense of the \n     Senate that--\n       (i) such contributions thus should be considered, for \n     purposes of Article VIII(8) of the Convention, beyond the \n     control of the executive branch of the United States \n     Government; and\n       (ii) the United States vote in the Organization should not \n     be denied in the event that Congress does not appropriate the \n     full amount of funds assessed for the United States financial \n     contribution to the Organization.\n       (21) On-site inspection agency.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that the On-Site Inspection Agency of the Department \n     of Defense should have the authority to provide assistance in \n     advance of any inspection to any facility in the United \n     States that is subject to a routine inspection under the \n     Convention, or to any facility in the United States that is \n     the object of a challenge inspection conducted pursuant to \n     Article IX, if the consent of the owner or operator of the \n     facility has first been obtained.\n       (22) Limitation on the scale of assessment.--\n       (A) Limitation on annual assessment.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of the Convention, and subject to the requirements \n     of subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), the United States shall \n     pay as a total annual assessment of the costs of the \n     Organization pursuant to paragraph 7 of Article VIII not more \n     than $25,000,000.\n       (B) Recalculation of limitations.--On January 1, 2000, and \n     at each 3-year interval thereafter, the amount specified in \n     subparagraph (A) is to be recalculated by the Administrator \n     of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the \n     immediately preceding 3-year period.\n       (C) Additional contributions requiring congressional \n     approval.--\n       (i) Authority.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     President may furnish additional contributions which would \n     otherwise be prohibited under subparagraph (A) if--\n       (I) the President determines and certifies in writing to \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate that the failure to \n     provide such contributions would result in the inability of \n     the Organization to conduct challenge inspections pursuant to \n     Article IX or would otherwise jeopardize the national \n     security interests of the United States; and\n       (II) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the \n     certification of the President.\n       (ii) Statement of reasons.--The President shall transmit \n     with such certification a detailed statement setting forth \n     the specific reasons therefor and the specific uses to which \n     the additional contributions provided to the Organization \n     would be applied.\n       (D) Additional contributions for verification.--\n     Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for a period of not more \n     than ten years, the President may furnish additional \n     contributions to the Organization for the purposes of meeting \n     the costs of verification under Articles IV and V.\n       (23) Additions to the annex on chemicals.--\n       (A) Presidential notification.--Not later than 10 days \n     after the Director-General of the Technical Secretariat \n     communicates information to all States Parties pursuant to \n     Article XI(5)(a) of a proposal for the addition of a chemical \n     or biological substance to a schedule of the Annex on \n     Chemicals, the President shall notify the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate of the proposed addition.\n       (B) Presidential report.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     Director-General of the Technical Secretariat communicates \n     information of such a proposal pursuant to Article XV(5)(a) \n     or not later than 30 days after a positive recommendation by \n     the Executive Council pursuant to Article XV(5)(c), whichever \n     is sooner, the President shall submit to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate a report, in classified and \n     unclassified form, detailing the likely impact of the \n     proposed addition to a schedule of the Annex on Chemicals. \n     Such report shall include--\n       (i) an assessment of the likely impact on United States \n     industry of the proposed addition of the chemical or \n     biological substance to a schedule of the Annex on Chemicals;\n       (ii) a description of the likely costs and benefits, if \n     any, to United States national security of the proposed \n     addition of such chemical or biological substance to a \n     schedule of the Annex on Chemicals; and\n       (iii) a detailed assessment of the effect of the proposed \n     addition on United States obligations under the Verification \n     Annex.\n       (C) Presidential consultation.--The President shall, after \n     the submission of the notification required under \n     subparagraph (A) and prior to any action on the proposal by \n     the Executive Council under Article XV(5)(c), consult \n     promptly with the Senate as to whether the United States \n     should object to the proposed addition of a chemical or \n     biological substance pursuant to Article XV(5)(c).\n       (24) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the Constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification with respect to the INF \n     Treaty. For purposes of this declaration, the term ``INF \n     Treaty'' refers to the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols, approved by the Senate on May \n     27, 1988.\n       (25) Further arms reductions obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval international \n     agreements that would obligate the United States to reduce or \n     limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a \n     militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty \n     power as set forth in Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the \n     Constitution.\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\n       (26) Riot control agents.--\n       (A) Permitted uses.--Prior to the deposit of the United \n     States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to Congress that the United States is not restricted \n     by the Convention in its use of riot control agents, \n     including the use against combatants who are parties to a \n     conflict, in any of the following cases:\n       (i) United states not a party.--The conduct of peacetime \n     military operations within an area of ongoing armed conflict \n     when the United States is not a party to the conflict (such \n     as recent use of the United States Armed Forces in Somalia, \n     Bosnia, and Rwanda).\n       (ii) Consensual peacekeeping.--Consensual peacekeeping \n     operations when the use of force is authorized by the \n     receiving state, including operations pursuant to Chapter VI \n     of the United Nations Charter.\n       (iii) Chapter vii peacekeeping.--Peacekeeping operations \n     when force is authorized by the Security Council under \n     Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\n       (B) Implementation.--The President shall take no measure, \n     and prescribe no rule or regulation, which would alter or \n     eliminate Executive Order 11850 of April 8, 1975.\n       (C) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``riot control \n     agent'' has the meaning given the term in Article II(7) of \n     the Convention.\n       (27) Chemical weapons destruction.--Prior to the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification of the \n     Convention, the President shall certify to the Congress that \n     all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n       (A) Exploration of alternative technologies.--The President \n     has agreed to explore alternative technologies for the \n     destruction of the United States stockpile of chemical \n     weapons in order to ensure that the United States has the \n     safest, most effective and environmentally sound plans and \n     programs for meeting its obligations under the Convention \n     for the destruction of chemical weapons.\n       (B) Convention extends destruction deadline.--The \n     requirement in section 1412 of Public Law 99-145 (50 U.S.C. \n     1521) for completion of the destruction of the United States \n     stockpile of chemical weapons by December 31, 2004, will be \n     superseded upon the date the Convention enters into force \n     with respect to the United States by the deadline required by \n     the Convention of April 29, 2007.\n       (C) Authority to employ a different destruction \n     technology.--The requirement in Article III(1)(a)(v) of the \n     Convention for a declaration by each State Party not later \n     than 30 days after the date the Convention enters into force \n     with respect to that Party on general plans of the State \n     Party for destruction of its chemical weapons does not \n     preclude in any way the United States from deciding in the \n     future to employ a technology for the destruction of chemical \n     weapons different than that declared under that Article.\n       (D) Procedures for extension of deadline.--The President \n     will consult with Congress on whether to submit a request to \n     the Executive Council of the Organization for an extension of \n     the deadline for the destruction of chemical weapons under \n     the Convention, as provided under part IV(A) of the Annex on \n     Implementation and Verification to the Convention, if, as a \n     result of the program of alternative technologies for the \n     destruction of chemical munitions carried out under section \n     8065 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1997 \n     (as contained in Public Law 104-208), the President \n     determines that alternatives to the incineration of chemical \n     weapons are available that are safer and more environmentally \n     sound but whose use would preclude the United States from \n     meeting the deadlines of the Convention.\n       (28) Constitutional protection against unreasonable search \n     and seizure.--\n       (A) In general.--In order to protect United States citizens \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures, prior to the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     President shall certify to Congress that--\n       (i) for any challenge inspection conducted on the territory \n     of the United States pursuant to Article IX, where consent \n     has been withheld, the United States National Authority will \n     first obtain a criminal search warrant based upon probable \n     cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and describing with \n     particularity the place to be searched and the persons or \n     things to be seized; and\n       (ii) for any routine inspection of a declared facility \n     under the Convention that is conducted on the territory of \n     the United States, where consent has been withheld the United \n     States National Authority first will obtain an administrative \n     search warrant from a United States magistrate judge.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of this resolution, the term \n     ``National Authority'' means the agency or office of the \n     United States Government designated by the United States \n     pursuant to Article VII(4) of the Convention.\n\n     SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this resolution:\n       (1) Chemical weapons convention or convention.--The terms \n     ``Chemical Weapons Convention'' and ``Convention'' mean the \n     Convention on the Prohibition of Development, Production, \n     Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their \n     Destruction, Opened for Signature and Signed by the United \n     States at Paris on January 13, 1993, including the following \n     protocols and memorandum of understanding, all such documents \n     being integral parts of and collectively referred to as the \n     ``Chemical Weapons Convention'' or the ``Convention'' \n     (contained in Treaty Document 103-21):\n       (A) The Annex on Chemicals.\n       (B) The Annex on Implementation and Verification.\n       (C) The Annex on the Protection of Confidential \n     Information.\n       (D) The Resolution Establishing the Preparatory Commission \n     for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\n       (E) The Text on the Establishment of a Preparatory \n     Commission.\n       (2) Organization.--The term ``Organization'' means the \n     Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \n     established under the Convention.\n       (3) State party.--The term ``State Party'' means any nation \n     that is a party to the Convention.\n       (4) United States instrument or ratification.--The term \n     ``United States instrument of ratification'' means the \n     instrument of ratification of the United States of the \n     Convention.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, of course I am disappointed by today's vote \non the CWC. But I find some solace in the fact that, thanks to our \nefforts, this treaty is much less harmful than it would have been. I am \nenormously proud of Senators Kyl, Inhofe, and other Senators who stood \nwith us despite enormous pressure against this treaty. I believe \nhistory will vindicate their efforts.\n  Make no mistake, this is a dangerous treaty. But it is a little less \ndangerous thanks to the efforts we made to amend it, and to deliver the \ntruth to the American people. Last September, treaty proponents were \npressing the Senate to vote on a treaty that had none of the key \nprotections that some of us succeeded in inserting in this treaty. Had \nwe not been a phalanx of common sense standing in their way, the exact \nsame treaty would have been before the Senate for ratification today, \nand that would have been a disaster.\n  The treaty approved by the Senate tonight was toned down with 28 \nconditions, most of which the administration was until recently calling \n``killer amendments.'' Those include, among many others, conditions \nthat limit the cost of the treaty to the American taxpayer, place \nsafeguards on intelligence sharing, enhance our chemical defenses, and \nprotect confidential business information.\n  Further, concessions on what I consider some of the most important \nissues--such as protecting the right of American commanders in the \nfield to use tear gas, and requiring criminal search warrants for \nforeign inspectors--came only the final days before I agreed to allow \nthe treaty to go to the Senate floor for a vote. If we had not held out \nso long--in spite of all the criticism and derision lobbed in our \ndirection--none of those protections would be in the treaty today.\n  I hope I may be forgiven for taking some satisfaction in the \nknowledge that, thanks to what our critics called our stubbornness, our \nsoldiers in the field will be a little safer, and the constitutional \nrights of American citizens will be a little better protected. Final \njudgment of our efforts will be left to future generations.\n  I do know this: those great Senators with whom I was honored to stand \nfought the good fight, we won some battles, and lost others. But we \nfought with honor, and integrity, and for the cause of right.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to thank the Vice President for being at the \nready the whole day, and I would like to thank my colleagues for not \nmaking it necessary. I am glad they deprived the Vice President of the \nUnited States the opportunity to vote on the five conditions and on \nfinal passage. But I want to point out to my colleagues who are being \nvery nice and solicitous about my efforts in this regard, the Vice \nPresident of the United States, who is in the Chair, played a critical \nrole in pushing this, making sure that we kept it before the Nation, \ngenerating the interesting debate so this could not be left untouched, \nand I want to publicly thank him.\n  There is that old expression in politics that politics makes strange \nbedfellows. I have had the distinction and the honor of having been the \nranking member and/or chairman with the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Thurmond, and when I\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\ngot that assignment I think most of my colleagues looked at me and \nsaid, this is going to be an interesting time, Biden and Thurmond. We \nturned out to be very good friends. This is the first occasion after 25 \nyears that I have had to work as closely as I have with my new chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, on which I rank, and that is \nSenator Helms. I want to publicly thank him. He kept his word at every \nstage of this long, arduous, and for me ultimately rewarding \nnegotiation. I want to acknowledge how much I appreciate it.\n  I conclude by saying, because I do not want to turn this into some \nlitany of people to thank, what a pleasure it has been to work with and \nreceive the guidance and encouragement from the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar]. He has served this Nation well on this occasion, as well \nas Senator McCain. I hope I am not hurting their credentials in the \nRepublican party by acknowledging how closely I worked with both of \nthem. However, I think it should be noted that without the two of them \nweighing in on this treaty I not only doubt, I know we would not have \npassed this.\n  I conclude by saying I truly think this is a very important moment in \nthe Senate, and I do think the vote we just cast will be within the \nnext hour heard around the world. Had we voted the other way, it would \nhave been a louder, more resounding sound than the one now. It will be \nheard around the world, and it will reaffirm American leadership.\n  I thank the Vice President for being here again and I am also \nthankful we did not have to have his vote, but I knew where it was if \nwe had needed it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the previous order, the President will be \nimmediately notified.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3570-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I just want to take a moment to extend my \npersonal thanks to the Kentucky Air National Guard for a job well done. \nWhen the U.S. Air Force chose the Kentucky Derby Festival's annual \nThunder Over Louisville celebration as one of the high points in a \nyear-long celebration of the Air Force's 50th anniversary, the Kentucky \nAir National Guard proved to be the perfect hosts. They not only \nbrought in all the aircraft, but coordinated all the different \nservices.\n  Thunder Over Louisville has already gained a reputation as a one-of-\na-kind air show and fireworks display. But I think everyone agreed that \nthis year will be hard to top. The performances were truly spectacular, \nbut much of the success is also due to the tremendous job the city, the \nAir Force, the Derby Festival and the Kentucky Air National Guard did \nto assure the event ran smoothly and safely.\n  Called ``Wild Blue Thunder'' in tribute to the Air Force's 50th \nAnniversary, it was the world's largest show of its kind in America, \nboth for the fireworks display and for the air performances.\n  The fireworks were reported to be larger than the opening and closing \nof the Atlanta Olympics combined and of the Inaugural fireworks. The \nimpressive show culminated in an 11,000 waterfall of fireworks off the \nClark Memorial Bridge.\n  The television and radio commercials for Thunder Over Louisville use \nthe tag line ``you haven't seen anything until you've seen \neverything.'' The Air Force and other armed services certainly pulled \nout all the stops with air performances showcasing the ``Thunderbirds \nUSAF Aerobatic Team,'' the F-117 A Stealth Fighter, the B-2 Stealth \nBomber, the SR-71A Strategic Reconnaissance Plane, the B-1B Long Range \nStrategic Bomber, F-14 ``Tomcat'' jet fighter, the A-10 Warthog Tank \nKiller jet fighter, the F-15 ``Eagle'' jet fighter, the T-33 \n``Thunderbird,'' and Apache and Blackhawk helicopters.\n  The performances were not only a great source of entertainment, but \nalso were a tremendous learning experience for spectators of all ages, \nespecially about Kentucky's homegrown talent.\n  Kentucky's 123rd already has an impressive list of accomplishments \nunder their belt. And I've come to the Senate floor time and again to \ncommend them on their exceptional work in places like Bosnia, Somalia, \nand Rwanda.\n  But as part of the Derby Festival's spectacular display, the 123rd \ngot to show off for the hometown crowd. 650,000 Kentuckians saw first-\nhand the 123rd's skill and expertise with the C-130Hs, getting a better \nidea of how important this unit is to the overall operations of this \nnation's active duty Air Force. And that will make my job much easier \nthis year if Pentagon officials start making moves to pull any of the \n123rd's C-130Hs.\n  Mr. President, let me close by thanking the 123rd for their hard work \nand their hospitality. I know the true test of their abilities happens \nwhen they are far from home. But it's nice to remind everyone at home \njust how lucky we are to have such a talented, committed group of \nservice people right here in Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3658-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

WINDHAM\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \npay tribute to Patrick H. Windham, the long-serving Senior Democratic \nProfessional Staff Member for the Subcommittee on Science, Technology \nand Space. Pat is leaving Washington for California with his wife Arati \nPrabhakar and newborn baby Katie after nearly 20 years of service to \nthe Senate, primarily on science and technology policy issues. For the \nmany people here who knew or worked with Pat, including my staff and \nme, he will be sorely missed as a great source of institutional \nknowledge but most of all as a friend, a genuine and nice guy in a town \nnot always known for its friendliness.\n  Originally from California, Pat completed his undergraduate work at \nStanford, received a Masters in public policy from the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley and first came to the Hill in 1976 as a \nCongressional Fellow to the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation. In 1982 Pat began his long association with Senator \nHollings, joining his personal staff as a legislative assistant. He has \nheld his present position of Senior Democratic Professional staff \nmember for the Subcommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation \nsince 1984.\n  I met Pat through his many hours of work on the important issue of \ntechnology partnerships, especially those run through the Commerce \nDepartment such as the Advanced Technology Program. Pat, along with my \nable colleague Senator Hollings, has been a\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\ntireless advocate of promoting the movement of new ideas generated by \nscientists and engineers in our universities and national laboratories \nout into the commercial marketplace. Widely respected for his \nsubstantive thinking on such topics, Pat has tirelessly worked on \nlegislative solutions that would bridge the cultural gap existing \nbetween the differing worlds of academia, government and industry. I \nbelieve this effort to be critical towards ensuring the future ability \nof America to compete in a global market.\n  During World War II and the subsequent Cold War, federal investment \nin science and technology was seen as essential to maintaining \nAmerica's national security. A by-product of federal investment was an \ninfrastructure of world-leading high tech defense companies, \nlaboratories and universities and subsequent creation of an entire new \ngeneration of products and industries. With the end of the Cold War, \nthe defense rationale for continued investment is not as politically \ncompelling and the growth of information technologies continues to \nchange the landscape for American business.\n  We are now in a period of transition, looking for ways to move from \nthe old system of innovation where the government funded the science, \npaid for development and then purchased the final product--to a new \nsystem that preserves both our country's security and its competitive \neconomic advantage. It is not an exaggeration to say that Pat has been \na major contributor in the development of science and technology policy \nduring this turbulent transition period. My office and I particularly \nrespect his work for Senator Hollings as an architect of both the \nAdvanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Program, \nboth of which help move technology and information out to the \nmanufacturing floors of America's workplaces. Pat has always been open \nminded, has carefully listened and will be remembered as a joy to work \nwith. My staff and I hope that Pat will find some time to write and \nreflect on the technology policy issues he's been grappling with for so \nlong, and welcome fresh insights from him. The Senate owes him a large \ndebt of thanks for his fine work here. Good luck in California, Pat, \nand best wishes to your wonderful wife and daughter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3658-5", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               82ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks the 82nd anniversary of the \nbeginning of one of the most tragic episodes in human history. \nBeginning in 1915, the Government of the Ottoman Turks waged a vicious \ncampaign of genocide against the people of Armenia. One and a half \nmillion Armenians were killed in the following eight years. Over \n500,000 more Armenians were forced into exile from their homeland and \ncompelled to seek havens in other lands.\n  The extraordinary resiliency of the Armenian people can be seen by \nwhat they have accomplished in their new lands. Nations around the \nworld have benefited from the spirit and perseverance of the Armenians. \nNo nation has benefited more from the contributions of the Armenian \nDiaspora than the United States. My own state of Massachusetts is \nblessed with a large and vigorous community of Armenians who have \nplayed an important role in all aspects of public and private life in \nour state.\n  I commend the tireless efforts of the Armenian Assembly of America \nand the Armenian National Committee for their outstanding work in \ninforming Americans about the history and culture of Armenia and its \npeople. In honoring Armenians throughout the world today, we also \npledge to do all we can to banish genocide against any peoples anywhere \nfrom the face of the earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3659-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees to \nthe following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \neliminate from its regulations the restrictions on the cross-ownership \nof broadcasting stations and newspapers; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      THE NEWSPAPER OWNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Newspaper \nOwnership Act. This legislation would eliminate one of the most archaic \nprovisions remaining in telecommunications law: that which prohibits a\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\nnewspaper from being co-owned with a local radio or television station.\n  Mr. President, at a time when the number of outlets for news, \ninformation, and entertainment has expanded exponentially, and at a \ntime when other restrictions on ownership of mass media companies have \nbeen rethought and liberalized one fossil from the age of Walter \nWinchell and the Dumont Network remains--the law that keeps one entity \nfrom owning both a newspaper and a radio or TV station in the same \nmarket. It's time to finally get rid of this relic.\n  The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership prohibition dates from a day \nwhen there was a realistic fear that common control of both media in \nthe same locale could result in the public's receiving only one point \nof view on important issues.\n  Radio and television outlets abound. Many are supplemented by \nmultichannel news and entertainment outlets like cable TV and satellite \nbroadcasting. Even in the smallest markets, diversity of viewpoints is \nas close as clicking on the Internet.\n  It is not surprising that, in this era of media diversity, newspapers \nhave found it tough going, their numbers steadily declining over the \nyears. In this environment, the infusion of resources that would result \nfrom allowing them to be owned by local radio and TV station owners \nwould be most beneficial. Moreover, is there any reason to think that \nan attempt to make a newspaper walk in the lock-step with a co-owned \nbroadcast station would not be readily detected by the public, and \nrejected in favor of more diverse sources of information? It is \ndifficult to believe that, given the almost bewildering variety in the \nnumbers and types of information sources available in even the smallest \nmarkets, any seeker of information could be either so passive or so \ndefenseless.\n  Mr. President, I introduce this bill in an effort to engage informed \ndebate on this outdated restriction. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed on the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 641\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CROSS-OWNERSHIP OF BROADCASTING AND NEWSPAPERS.\n\n       (a) Rule Changes Required.--The Federal Communications \n     Commission shall modify section 73.3555 of its regulations \n     (47 C.F.R. 73.3555) by eliminating any provisions limiting \n     the granting or renewal of an AM, FM, or TV broadcast station \n     license to any party (including parties under common control) \n     on the basis of the ownership, operation, or control by such \n     party of a daily newspaper.\n       (b) Deadline for Action.--The Federal Communications \n     Commission shall complete all action necessary to complete \n     the modifications required by subsection (a) within 90 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 642. A bill to amend section 842 of title 18, United States Code, \nrelating to explosive materials; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the explosives protection act of 1997\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I introduce the Explosives \nProtection Act of 1997. I do so just over two years after the tragic \nbombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, because I hope that \nthis bill will, in some small way, prevent future bombings--whether by \nterrorists of symbolic targets, malcontents of random ones, or even \nspouses involved in marital disputes.\n  This bill, while not directly related to the circumstances in \nOklahoma City, is a first step towards protecting the American people \nfrom those who would use explosives to do them harm.\n  Not many people realize, Mr. President, just how few restrictions on \nthe use and sale of explosives really exist. While we have increasingly \nrestricted the number of people who can obtain and use a firearm, we \nhave been lax in extending these prohibitions to explosives.\n  For instance, while we prohibit illegal aliens from obtaining a gun, \nwe allow them to obtain explosives without restriction. And this same \ndivergence applies to those who have been dishonorably discharged from \nthe armed forces, those who have renounced U.S. citizenship, people who \nhave acted in such a way as to have restraining orders issued against \nthem, and those with domestic violence convictions. Each of these \ncategories of persons are prohibited from obtaining firearms, but face \nno such prohibition on obtaining explosive material.\n  Additionally, while this Congress has been moving to prevent \nnonimmigrant legal aliens from obtaining a gun, in response to the \nrecent shooting at the Empire State Building, we have neglected to work \ntowards this same goal with regards to explosives.\n  Mr. President, many of these differences in the law are simply \noversights--Congress has often acted to limit the use and sale of \nfirearms, and has neglected to bring explosives law into line. And in \nso doing, we have made it all too easy for many of the most dangerous \nor least accountable members of society to obtain materials which can \nresult in an equal or even greater loss of life.\n  Congress has already made the determination that certain members of \nsociety should not have access to firearms, and the same logic clearly \napplies to dangerous and destructive explosive materials. It is time to \nbring the explosives law into line with gun laws, and this is all my \nbill does.\n  Specifically, my bill would take the list of categories of people who \ncannot obtain firearms and would add any of those categories not \ncurrently covered under the explosives law. Additionally, my bill would \ninsert the Durbin-Kennedy nonimmigrant provisions into the law to \nprotect us from persons entering the country and quickly moving to \npurchase and use deadly explosive material.\n  Mr. President, this is a simple bill meant only to correct \nlongstanding gaps and loopholes in current law. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill, and I hope we can quickly move to get this passed and \nprotect Americans from future acts of explosive destruction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the Federal Government from providing \ninsurance, reinsurance, or noninsured crop disaster assistance for \ntobacco; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               THE TOBACCO SUBSIDY REDUCTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, people often ask their elected officials, \n``If smoking is so dangerous, why does Congress subsidize tobacco?'' \nToday, my colleagues Senator Gregg of New Hampshire and Senator \nLautenberg of New Jersey are joining me in introducing legislation that \nwill give my colleagues an answer to this question.\n  The Tobacco Subsidy Reduction Act of 1997 ends the largest direct \nfederal subsidy of tobacco. Specifically, this legislation prohibits \nthe federal government from offering crop insurance or providing crop \ninsurance subsidies for tobacco. For consistency, it also prohibits \npayments for tobacco under the Non-Insured Disaster Assistance Program, \nan alternative risk management program created in the 1996 Farm Bill \nfor crops not eligible for the crop insurance program. I ask that the \nfull text of the legislation appear in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  Tobacco growing and processing is one of the most lucrative \nindustries in America. To protect their profits despite the health \ndangers of their product, tobacco growers created the ``no net cost'' \nprice support program. But a variety of taxpayer subsidies to tobacco \nremain, including crop insurance, extension services, and other \nprograms assisting tobacco production and sales.\n  Last year, the federal government spent $98 million on tobacco-\nrelated subsidies and programs. These costs include $68 million for \ncrop insurance losses beyond the premiums tobacco farmers paid, and $11 \nmillion for overhead costs of administering the crop insurance program \nfor tobacco crops. This year, federal tobacco-related subsidies are \nestimated to amount to $67 million, including $48 million related to \ncrop insurance.\n  In an era of tight budgets, there are better uses for this money. It \nmakes no budgetary sense to subsidize a crop that causes an enormous \namount of disease, disability, and death.\n  This amendment will not affect the tobacco price support program, so \nit will not drive any tobacco farmers out of business. It will merely \nget the federal government out of the business of paying for these \nspecific subsidies for this deadly crop.\n  Cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products kill more than 400,000 \nAmericans every year of cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses. \nThese products also disable hundreds of thousands of other Americans \nthrough emphysema and other respiratory illnesses. It's time to take \nanother step toward getting the federal government out of this \nbusiness.\n  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor the Tobacco Subsidy Reduction Act \nand tell their constituents that they are working to cut government \ntobacco subsidies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to establish standards \nfor relationships between group health plans and health insurance \nissuers with enrollees, health professionals, and providers; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               the patient access to responsible care act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill in an effort \nto protect the vast majority of patients in this country. Currently, in \norder to control the cost of health care, managed care organizations \noften place limits on the delivery of necessary medical services. I \nbelieve American families must be guaranteed basic health rights when \ndealing with HMOs and managed care providers. The bottom line in \nmedicine must be the health of the patient, not the profits of any \ngiven company. This legislation, the Patient Access to Responsible Care \nAct, will meet this obligation.\n  With this Act, I seek to establish basic protections for patients and \nhealth care providers in order to ensure the best medical care for \npatients. I envision these basic provisions giving Americans a set of \nhealth rights, in the form of a Patients' Bill of Rights, when dealing \nwith HMOs and other health insurance plans. These rights include:\n  The Right to Choose Your Own Doctor. This bill will allow patients to \nselect their own doctors within their plan and change their selection \nof doctor as the patient feels necessary. It also gives patients, who \nare in managed care-only health plans, the option to see doctors \noutside their HMOs for an additional fee.\n  The Right to Quality Health Care. This legislation will ensure that \ndoctors are not prohibited or limited in any way from discussing a \npatient's health status, treatment options or any other medical \ncommunications. It also stops HMOs from using financial incentives for \ndoctors to deny or limit care to patients. We must make sure that \nhealth care decisions are based on sound medical criteria and not the \nfinancial bottom line.\n  The Right to Justice. This Act closes loopholes in current law that \nallow the vast majority of health insurance plans to escape legal \nresponsibility for decisions causing needless injury or death to a \npatient. Currently, self-insured managed care plans cannot be held \nliable for a patient's wrongful death or personal injuries resulting \nfrom plan policies even when those policies directly contributed to the \npatient's death or injury. This is wrong and this bill would guarantee \nthat if HMO policies hurt patients, the HMO will be held accountable \nfor their actions.\n  In addition, within a patient's health plan, this bill guarantees \npatients can quickly and easily appeal adverse decisions by their \nmanage care plans. We've heard too many horror stories of patients who \nhave been denied treatment by a health plans' policy. In addition, the \nappeals process is too bureaucratic and lengthy, sometimes resulting in \ntragic consequences. We must always put the quality of patient care \nfirst.\n  The Right to Full Disclosure. This bill also provides that health \ninsurance plans make available to each patient a list of what health \ncare is covered, what are the plans costs and profits, and how much is \nthe plan spending on marketing and other non-medical costs. This is a \nsort of ``truth-in-lending'' statement for health plans.\n  When I first considered introducing this Patients' Bill of Rights, I \nwas concerned about how prevalent a need there was for this type of \nlegislation. I quickly found numerous instances where patients were \nsuffering adverse outcomes from poor medical decisions made by managed \ncare companies. The most publicized recent case is Corcoran versus \nUnited Health Care. In this case, Ms. Corcoran, a Louisiana woman with \na high risk pregnancy, was admitted to a hospital under her physician's \norders. She was discharged from the hospital after her health plan \nrefused to pay for her care. The health plan would only authorize a \nvisiting nurse to check on the woman at home. At one point, when the \nnurse was absent, the unborn child went into distress and died. The \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the woman had no \nright to sue the HMO for damages because the insurance plan was \ngoverned under ERISA laws. These laws preempt state insurance laws \nallowing patients to seek due process. Americans cannot expect health \ncare with this type of managed health care.\n\n  As I said before, there are numerous instances where managed care is \nrevealed to be ruled by a company's profits. In New York, a diabetic \ndeveloped an infection in his foot that had become gangrenous and had \nspread all the way to his groin. Almost his entire leg was infected and \nthe blood vessels clogged. His doctor, a cardio-vascular specialist, \nfeared that the gentleman could lose his foot if treatment was not \ninitiated immediately. So, as a responsible physician, he admitted his \npatient to the hospital where he was immediately treated with \nintravenous antibiotics to combat the infection. Once in the hospital, \nthe gentleman's HMO contacted the doctor to find out how long he \nanticipated the hospital stay would be. Since the man had clogged blood \nvessels and had to undergo a vascular bypass in order to be treated, \nthe doctor estimated a stay between 10 and 15 days.\n  Upon learning this, an HMO official went to the gentleman's hospital \nroom, and without even notifying the doctor, told the man that ``he \ncould watch Oprah and be treated as well from home with a visiting \nnurse.'' The gentleman's doctor repeatedly argued with the HMO that it \nwas not medically safe to release his patient from the hospital. But, \nwith fluid still draining from his wounds and the doctor still \nprotesting against the early discharge, the gentleman was sent home \njust a week after being admitted. The next day, the HMO sent a nurse--\nnot a cardiovascular specialist or even a doctor, but a nurse--to his \nhome to evaluate his condition and to show his wife how to change the \ndressing covering his wounds. With this state of affairs, the man \neventually required surgery. With the early discharge and the lack of \nresponsible care on the part of the HMO, the surgery had to be \npostponed because the patient's blood had become too thin to safely \nperform surgery.\n  In Georgia, a 2-year old boy was suffering from a high fever which \ndid not respond to medication. His parents followed the insurance \ncompany's instructions for pre-authorization of emergency room care and \nattempted to drive 42 miles to the preferred hospital. The couple \npassed five emergency rooms along the way. Before they could reach the \npreferred hospital, their son went into cardiac arrest and stopped \nbreathing. The child slipped into a coma, developed gangrene in his \nextremities, and subsequently lost his arms and legs to amputation.\n  In California, a young girl was diagnosed with Wilm's tumor, a rare \nchildhood kidney cancer. The families new HMO required that the girl's \nsurgery be performed by a surgeon within the managed care plan. None of \nthe plan's surgeons had any experience with Wilm's tumor. The family \nchose to use an expert surgeon outside of the plan who had a proven \ntrack record with this type of tumor. The surgery was a success and the \nchild has fully recovered. However, the HMO denied coverage for going \noutside of their system causing the family to enter a 2 year legal \nbattle with the plan. In the first ever enforcement action against an \nHMO for a patient complaint, the state imposed a $500,000 fine against \nthe plan for denying appropriate medical care.\n  In Colorado, a 75-year old woman was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer, \nbut her plan refused to authorize surgery to remove the kidney and \ntumor of such an elderly woman. The plan only relented and allowed the \nsurgery to be performed when a Congressman finally intervened on her \nbehalf. The lady's cancer is now in full remission.\n  In Texas, a 17-year old Texas girl was critically injured in a head-\non car crash that left her with severe head trauma, a broken back, a \ncrushed pelvis, and numerous other injuries. She\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\neventually pulled through, but her health plan refused to pay $40,000 \nof her hospital bill because her family had not received ``prior \nauthorization'' for her emergency admission to the hospital--even \nthough the hospital was a preferred provider for the plan.\n  These stories are not isolated incidents. They do not happen just in \nNew York and Georgia, but across the nation. They speak for the \nthousands of patients across the country who have been denied access to \nthe responsible care they need and deserve.\n  Mr. President, I believe it would be beneficial for my colleagues if \nI summarized what rights this bill will provide for patients across the \ncountry and how this bill meets those rights.\n  First of all, we are trying to increase patient access to plans and \ndoctors. Patients, including those in under served inner-city and rural \nareas, are ensured their choice of doctor within the plan. The bill \nwill ensure that health plans have enough doctors to guarantee this \nchoice. Patients will also have access to any specialist required by \ntheir medical condition within the plan. In addition, patients are to \nhave emergency health care without the burden of seeking prior approval \nfrom their health plan.\n  Also in this Act, patients will have an expanded choice of health \ncare providers inside and outside of the network. People can either go \nthrough the network, or choose a plan that allows them to go out of the \nnetwork, although at a higher cost. They will be allowed to select \ntheir own personal doctors within their plan and change their selection \nas the patient feels necessary. Patients will also be given the option \nto choose a health insurance plan that covers health care options not \noffered in the network. The managed care plan would reimburse the costs \nof these services based on rates consistent with those negotiated under \nthe plan. Patients would be responsible for any remaining costs.\n  This bill will include a prohibition on gag rules. Patients are \nensured that the health plan will not in any way limit doctors from \ndiscussing the patient's health status, treatment options or any other \nmedical communication. Health plans can not offer any incentives, \nfinancial or otherwise, for doctors to deny or limit any health care.\n  In addition, this Bill of Rights forces HMOs to be responsible for \ntheir decisions. Currently, HMOs can not be held liable for wrongful \ndeath or personal injury suffered by the medical decision making \npolicies of the plan, action may only be brought against the doctor and \nthe hospital. Even if the HMO or the plan had in place a policy which \ndirectly contributed to death or injury of a patient, they are \nprotected. This bill changes that by ensuring that managed care plans \nare held responsible for any medical decisions that they make. This \nbill says that if you make a medical decision, no matter who you are, \nyou will be responsible for your actions. ERISA was never intended to \nbe used as a shield for health plans providing negligent medical care. \nAlso, there will be a provision providing due process on patient \nappeals claims made to their heath plans. Within the plan, patients \nwill be guaranteed the ability to quickly and easily appeal adverse \ndecisions.\n  The act will establish an information disclosure provision allowing \npatients to make informed decisions about which health plan would be \nbest for them. This is a sort of ``Truth in Lending'' statement for \nHMO's. Every health plan will be required to disclose information about \nplan benefits, appeals procedures, plan performance measures, history \nof patient satisfaction, as well as the number and type of health care \nproviders participating in the network. Based on this information, \npatients will be guaranteed the ability to make informed decisions \nabout the quality of their health care and the managed care companies \nthey choose from.\n  In addition, there will be doctor and patient protections from \ndiscrimination. The provision allows any doctor who meets a clear set \nof standards the opportunity to be a member of any managed care plan. \nIn addition, patients will not be discriminated against based on their \npersonal background or preexisting conditions, such as long-term and \ncostly diseases.\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to set minimum health care \nstandards in the private sector to protect American families and ensure \nthey have access to quality health care. We cannot allow the profits of \nthe company to get in the way of patient health.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 644\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nimprove and enforce compliance programs; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n   the clean water enforcement and compliance improvement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Clean Water \nEnforcement and Compliance Improvement Act of 1997. This important bill \nwill put real teeth in the enforcement provisions of the Clean Water \nAct, and will help restore and preserve our Nation's already stressed \nlakes, rivers and coastal areas. I would like to commend my colleague \nfrom New Jersey, Congressman Pallone, for introducing similar \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. Senator Torricelli has \njoined as a co-sponsor of our bill.\n  Mr. President, when Congress first enacted the Clean Water Act in \n1972, we established lofty goals-to make our Nation's waters fishable \nand swimmable. And we mandated strict enforcement and provided for \npenalties to assure compliance with the act's provisions.\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\n  We were responding to strong public concern about pollution of our \nwaterways. That concern is every bit as strong today because people \nunderstand that clean water is essential to human life. The American \npeople want us to rid our waters of bacteria, toxins, and garbage.\n  Yet, as we approach the 25th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, and \nafter several substantial revisions since its enactment, the act has \nfailed to meet all of our goals. While the Act has resulted in \nsignificant progress and water quality is improving, our waters are not \nclean. In 1988, over one-third of our rivers, lakes and estuaries \nsurveyed throughout the country were either failing to achieve \ndesignated water quality levels or were threatened with failing to \nachieve those levels. In my State of New Jersey, a survey of roughly 10 \npercent of the State's rivers showed that only 15 percent were safe for \nswimming.\n  One reason we haven't made more progress is that the Clean Water Act \nis not being adequately enforced.\n  Mr. President, effective enforcement is essential to achieving the \ngoals of the act. Not only does effective enforcement deter violations, \nbut it also helps ensure that appropriate corrective actions are taken \nin a timely manner when violations do occur. The Clean Water \nEnforcement and Compliance Improvement Act will strengthen enforcement \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, my bill will toughen penalties for polluters, improve \nenforcement by EPA and state water pollution agencies, and expand \ncitizens' right-to-know about violations of the Clean Water Act.\n  It establishes mandatory minimum penalties for serious violations of \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  It requires that civil penalties be no less than the economic benefit \nresulting from the violation.\n  It requires more frequent reporting of water discharges to identify \nviolations more quickly.\n  And it requires EPA to publish annually a list of those facilities \nthat are in significant noncompliance with the Clean Water Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Water Enforcement and \n     Compliance Improvement Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a significant number of persons who have been issued \n     permits under section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act are in violation of such permits;\n       (2) current enforcement programs of the Administrator of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency and the States fail to \n     address violations of such permits in a timely and effective \n     manner;\n       (3) full, accurate and prompt reporting of possible \n     violations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is \n     necessary for implementation and well served by assuring that \n     good faith reporters of possible violations are protected \n     against adverse personnel actions;\n       (4) often violations of such permits continue for a \n     considerable period of time, yielding significant economic \n     benefits for the violator and thus penalizing similar \n     facilities which act lawfully;\n       (5) penalties assessed and collected by the Administrator \n     from violators of such permits are often less than the \n     economic benefit gained by the violator;\n       (6) swift and timely enforcement by the Administrator and \n     the States of violations of such permits is necessary to \n     increase levels of compliance with such permits; and\n       (7) actions of private citizens have been effective in \n     enforcing such permits and directing funds to environmental \n     mitigation projects with over $12.8 million in penalties and \n     interest having been recovered and deposited with the \n     Treasury of the United States over the fiscal years 1990 \n     through 1994.\n       (b) Finding With Respect to Harm Caused by Violations.--\n     Section 101 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1251) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Finding With Respect to Harm Caused by Violations.--\n     Congress finds that a discharge which results in a violation \n     of this Act or a regulation, standard, limitation, \n     requirement, or order issued pursuant to this Act interferes \n     with the restoration and maintenance of the chemical, \n     physical, and biological integrity of any waters into which \n     the discharge flows (either directly or through a publicly \n     owned treatment works), including any waters into which the \n     receiving waters flow, and, therefore, harms those who use or \n     enjoy such waters and those who use or enjoy nearby lands or \n     aquatic resources associated with those waters.\n       ``(i) Finding With Respect to Citizen Suits.--Congress \n     finds that citizen suits are a valuable means of enforcement \n     of this Act and urges the Administrator to take actions to \n     encourage such suits, including providing information \n     concerning violators to citizen groups to assist them in \n     bringing suits, providing expert witnesses and other evidence \n     with respect to such suits, and filing amicus curiae briefs \n     on important issues related to such suits.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. VIOLATIONS OF REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL CONTROL \n                   AUTHORITIES.\n\n       Section 307(d) of Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1317(d)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Violations.--After the date on which (1) any effluent \n     standard or prohibition or pretreatment standard or \n     requirement takes effect under this section, or (2) any \n     requirement imposed in a pretreatment program under section \n     402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of this Act takes effect, it shall be \n     unlawful for any owner or operator of any source to operate \n     such source in violation of the effluent standard, \n     prohibition, pretreatment standard, or requirement.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impeachment \nControl Act of 1974 to limit consideration of nonemergency matters in \nemergency legislation; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee \non Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, \n1977, as modified by the order of April 11, 1986, with instructions \nthat if one committee reports, the other committee have 30 days to \nreport or be discharged.\n\n\n               THE EMERGENCY SPENDING CONTROL ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce a \nmeasure designed to limit consideration of non-emergency matters in \nemergency legislation. This bill, S. 647, the Emergency Spending \nControl Act of 1997, passed the Senate during the last Congress as part \nof the Senate's version of the line-item veto act, though it was later \ndropped in conference. Identical language passed the other body during \nthe 103d Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, first as a \nsubstitute amendment by a vote of 322 to 99, and then, as amended, by a \nvote of 406 to 6.\n  Mr. President, the support this measure has received in both Houses \nis a reflection of the keen awareness Members have of the abuses of the \nemergency appropriations process that have taken place. This measure \nhelps address one aspect of that abuse by limiting emergency spending \nbills solely to emergencies by establishing a new point of order \nagainst nonemergency matters, other than rescissions of budget \nauthority or reductions in direct spending, in any bill that contains \nan emergency measure, or an amendment to an emergency measure, or a \nconference report that contains an emergency measure.\n  As an additional enforcement mechanism, the legislation adds further \nprotection by prohibiting the Office of Management and Budget from \nadjusting the caps on discretionary spending, or from adjusting the \nsequester process for direct spending and receipts measures, for any \nemergency appropriations bill if the bill includes extraneous items \nother than rescissions of budget authority or reductions in direct \nspending.\n  Mr. President, though this proposal relates to shoring up our budget \nrules, I want to stress that the rules themselves do not solve the \ndeficit problem. No rule can--whether it is a procedural rule of the \nSenate, a statute, or a constitutional amendment. The only way we will \nbalance the budget is through specific spending cuts and exercising \nfiscal restraint.\n  However, we have made some progress over the past 4 years, and that \nprogress, as well as the continued work we need to do, can be sustained \nthrough the budget rules we impose on ourselves by ensuring the \nsacrifices that have been made, and that we will ask in the future, \nwill not be hollow or futile.\n  The rules that have been developed over the past twenty years have \nproven useful in this regard, though it bears repeating that the \ndeficit has begun to come down only as a result of our willingness to \nvote for tough measures.\n  In general, the rules require that new spending, whether through \ndirect spending, tax expenditures, or discretionary programs, be offset \nwith spending cuts or revenue increases. However, the rules provide for \nexceptions in the event of true emergencies.\n  The deliberate review through the federal budget process, weighing \none priority against another, may not permit a timely response to an \ninternational crisis, a natural disaster, or some other emergency. We \ndo not ask that earthquake victims find a funding source before we send \nthem aid. But that should not, even in dire circumstances, be read to \nimply we must not find ways to pay for emergencies, rather than simply \nadd their costs to the deficit.\n  But, Mr. President, the emergency exception to our budget rules, \ndesigned to expedite a response to an urgent need, has become a \nloophole, abused by those trying to circumvent the scrutiny of the \nbudget process, in particular, by adding non-emergency matters to \nemergency legislation that is receiving special, accelerated \nconsideration.\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\n  Mr. President, the measure I introduce today targets that abuse by \nhelping to keep emergency measures clean of extraneous matters on which \nthere is no emergency designation.\n  When the appropriations bill to provide relief for the Los Angeles \nearthquake was introduced in the 103rd Congress, it initially did four \nthings: provided $7.8 billion for the Los Angeles quake, $1.2 billion \nfor the Department of Defense peacekeeping operations; $436 million for \nMidwest flood relief, and $315 million more for the 1989 California \nearthquake.\n  But, Mr. President, by the time the Los Angeles earthquake bill \nbecame law, it also provided $1.4 million to fight potato fungus, $2.3 \nmillion for FDA pay raises, $14.4 million for the National Park \nService, $12.4 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, $10 million \nfor a new Amtrak station in New York, $40 million for the space \nshuttle, $20 million for a fingerprint lab, $500,000 for United States \nTrade Representative travel office, and $5.2 million for the Bureau of \nPublic Debt.\n  Though non-emergency matters attached to emergency bills are still \nsubject to the spending caps established in the concurrent budget \nresolution, as long as total spending remains under those caps, these \nunrelated spending matters are not required to be offset with spending \ncuts. In the case of the LA earthquake bill, because the caps had been \nreached the new spending was offset by rescissions, but those \nrescissions might otherwise have been used for deficit reduction. \nMoreover, by using emergency appropriations bills as a vehicle, these \nextraneous proposals avoid the examination through which legislative \nproposals must go to justify Federal spending. If there is truly a need \nto shift funds to these programs, an alternative vehicle--a regular \nsupplemental appropriations bill, not an emergency spending bill --\nshould be used.\n  The measure I am introducing today will restrict that kind of misuse \nof the emergency appropriations process. Adding non-emergency, \nextraneous matters to emergency appropriations not only is an attempt \nto avoid the legitimate scrutiny of our normal budget process, it can \nalso jeopardize our ability to provide relief to those who are \nsuffering from the disaster to which we are responding.\n  Just as importantly, adding superfluous material to emergency \nappropriations bills degrades those budget rules on which we rely to \nimpose fiscal discipline, and that only encourages further erosion of \nour efforts to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. President, as I noted earlier, this legislation has passed both \nHouses in recent years--in the Senate during the 104th Congress as the \namendment I offered to the Line Item Veto Act, and in the other body, \nduring the 103rd Congress, by a vote of 406 to 6. I urge my colleagues \nto join in this effort to pass this measure through both Houses during \nthis Congress, and help end this abusive practice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish legal standards and procedures for \nproduct liability litigation, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                the product liability reform act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am introducing this evening, along with \nSenators Ashcroft, McCain, and Lott, a bill to reform and rationalize \nour product liability system.\n  At the beginning of this session, Senator Ashcroft and others \nintroduced S.5, another measure to address product liability. Although \nI agreed with the substance of S.5, which was identical to the \nconference report on Product Liability that the President vetoed in the \n104th Congress, I did not co-sponsor S.5 because I knew that that \nparticular bill would not be enacted into law and because I wanted to \ncraft another bill that would obtain bi-partisan support in the Senate, \naddress the President's legitimate concerns with the conference report, \nand accomplish meaningful reform.\n  Mr. President, I cannot say that the measure I am introducing tonight \nfully accomplishes that. But it comes very close. I introduce this \nmeasure without the co-sponsorship of my good friend and long-time \ncompanion on this worthy mission, Senator Rockefeller, but I introduce \nit with the sincere belief that we will continue to work together to \nenact product liability reform in 1997.\n  I introduce this measure to get the process started. It is a good \nmeasure that I believe goes a long way toward meeting the goals I \ndescribed above. But as I said, the process is just starting. I welcome \ninput from my Republican and Democratic colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) our Nation is overly litigious, the civil justice \n     system is overcrowded, sluggish, and excessively costly and \n     the costs of lawsuits, both direct and indirect, are \n     inflicting serious and unnecessary injury on the national \n     economy;\n       (2) excessive, unpredictable, and often arbitrary damage \n     awards and unfair allocations of liability have a direct and \n     undesirable effect on interstate commerce by increasing the \n     cost and decreasing the availability of goods and services;\n       (3) the rules of law governing product liability actions, \n     damage awards, and allocations of liability have evolved \n     inconsistently within and among the States, resulting in a \n     complex, contradictory, and uncertain regime that is \n     inequitable to both plaintiffs and defendants and unduly \n     burdens interstate commerce.\n       (4) as a result of excessive, unpredictable, and often \n     arbitrary damage awards and unfair allocations of liability, \n     consumers have been adversely affected through the withdrawal \n     of products, producers, services, and service providers from \n     the marketplace, and from excessive liability costs passed on \n     to them through higher prices;\n       (5) excessive, unpredictable, and often arbitrary damage \n     awards and unfair allocations of liability jeopardize the \n     financial well-being of many individuals as well as entire \n     industries, particularly the Nation's small businesses and \n     adversely affects government and taxpayers;\n       (6) the excessive costs of the civil justice system \n     undermine the ability of American companies to compete \n     internationally, and serve to decrease the number of jobs and \n     the amount of productive capital in the national economy;\n       (7) the unpredictability of damage awards is inequitable to \n     both plaintiffs and defendants and has added considerably to \n     the high cost of liability insurance, making it difficult for \n     producers, consumers, volunteers, and nonprofit organizations \n     to protect themselves from liability with any degree of \n     confidence and at a reasonable cost;\n       (8) because of the national scope of the problems created \n     by the defects in the civil justice system, it is not \n     possible for the States to enact laws that fully and \n     effectively respond to those problems;\n       (9) it is the constitutional role of the national \n     government to remove barriers to interstate commerce and to \n     protect due process rights; and\n       (10) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and \n     fairness to the civil justice system in order to protect \n     against excessive, arbitrary, and uncertain damage awards and \n     to reduce the volume, costs, and delay of litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in Article \n     I, Section 8, Clause 3 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the \n     United States Constitution, the purposes of this Act are to \n     promote the free flow of goods and services and to lessen \n     burdens on interstate commerce and to uphold constitutionally \n     protected due process rights by--\n       (1) establishing certain uniform legal principles of \n     product liability which provide a fair balance among the \n     interests of product users, manufacturers, and product \n     sellers;\n       (2) placing reasonable limits on damages over and above the \n     actual damages suffered by a claimant;\n       (3) ensuring the fair allocation of liability in civil \n     actions;\n       (4) reducing the unacceptable costs and delays of our civil \n     justice system caused by excessive litigation which harm both \n     plaintiffs and defendants; and\n       (5) establishing greater fairness, rationality, and \n     predictability in the civil justice system.\n\n                TITLE I--TITLE PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM\n\n     SEC. 101. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this title--\n       (1) Actual malice.--The term ``actual malice'' means \n     specific intent to cause serious physical injury, illness, \n     disease, death, or damage to property.\n       (2) Claimant.--The term ``claimant'' means any person who \n     brings an action covered by this title and any person on \n     whose behalf such an action is brought. If such an action is \n     brought through or on behalf of an estate, the term includes \n     the claimant's decedent.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or \n     instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States,\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\n     the prospects for development of new sources of supply for \n     the full range of threatened raw materials and component \n     parts for medical devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of bone mass measurements for certain individuals \nunder part B of the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the bone mass measurement standardization act of 1997\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Bone Mass \nMeasurement Standardization Act of 1997.\n  Millions of women in their post-menopausal years face a silent \nkiller, a stalker disease we know as osteoporosis. This unforgiving \nbone disease afflicts 28 million Americans; causes 50,000 deaths each \nyear; 1.5 million bone fractures annually; and the direct medical costs \nof osteoporosis fracture patients are $13.8 billion each year, or $38 \nmillion every single day. This cost is projected to reach $60 billion \nby the year 2020 and $240 billion by the year 2040 if medical research \nhas not discovered an effective treatment.\n  The facts also show that one out of every two women have a lifetime \nrisk of bone fractures due to osteoporosis, and that it affects half of \nall women over the age of 50 and an astounding 90% of all women over \n75. Perhaps the most tragic consequences of osteoporosis occur with the \n300,000 individuals annually who suffer a hip fracture. Twelve to \nthirteen percent of these persons will die within six months following \na hip fracture, and of those who survive, 20% will never walk again, \nand 20% will require nursing home care--often for the rest of their \nlives.\n  We all know that osteoporosis cannot be cured, although with a \ncontinued commitment to research in this area I remain hopeful that we \nwill find one. We also know that once bone mass is lost, it cannot be \nreplaced. Therefore, early detection is our best weapon because it is \nonly through early detection that we can thwart the progress of the \ndisease and initiate preventive efforts to stop further loss of bone \nmass.\n  Bone mass measurement can be used to determine the status of a \nperson's bone health and to predict the risk of future fractures. These \ntests are safe, painless, accurate and quick. Our expanding technology \nis adding new methods to determine bone mass and we need to keep up \nwith this technology. The most commonly used test currently is DXA \n(Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry).\n  In order to ensure that we detect bone loss early, we need to ensure \nthat older women have coverage for bone mass tests. Unfortunately, \nMedicare coverage is inconsistent in its coverage depending on where an \nindividual resides. Instead of national coverage of the DXA test, \nMedicare leaves coverage decisions to local Medicare insurance \ncarriers. The definition of who is qualified to receive a bone mass \nmeasurement varies from carrier to carrier. Some carriers require \nbeneficiaries to have suffered substantial bone loss before allowing \ncoverage for a bone density test. For example, in about 20 States, the \ncarriers require x-ray proof of low bone mass or other abnormalities. \nUnfortunately, standard x-rays do not reveal osteoporosis until 25 to \n40 percent of bone mass has been lost.\n\n  One carrier allows pre-menopausal women to have a DXA test to \ndetermine whether hormone replacement therapy is indicated. However, it \ndoes not allow the test to determine treatment for the post-menopausal \nwomen--the majority of Medicare beneficiaries. Other carriers have no \nspecific rules to guide reimbursement and cover the tests on a \nhaphazard case-by-case basis.\n  Frequency of testing also varies from carrier to carrier. Re-testing \nis important to monitor treatment, yet only eight states specifically \nallow coverage for people who are under treatment for osteoporosis.\n  This patchwork coverage is confusing to beneficiaries, and means that \nan older woman who lives in one State will be covered, but if she moves \nto another state, she may not be. A woman may also lose coverage if she \nmoves to another city within a given State.\n  Mr. President, a woman shouldn't have to change zip codes to obtain \ncoverage for a preventive test, especially when early intervention is \nthe only action we can take right now to slow the loss of bone mass. \nOnce it is lost, it cannot be replaced.\n  The Medicare Bone Mass Measurement Standardization Act will clarify \nthe Medicare coverage policy for DXA testing to make it uniform in all \nstates. We all know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of \ncure. This bill will ensure that older women, regardless of where they \nlive, will have access to bone mass measurement technology that will \nhelp detect bone loss and allow preventive steps to be taken.\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\nI urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe, to introduce legislation to standardize \nMedicare eligibility for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. It is estimated \nthat osteoporosis results in 1.5 million fractures and $20 billion in \nmedical costs each year. The Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, through the use of 1992 incidence data of bone fractures \nrelated to osteoporosis, determined that such fractures represent three \npercent of all Medicare costs. A recent report issued by the Alliance \nfor Aging Research examined the dramatic savings realized when the \nonset of age-related disability is delayed. The report indicates that \ndelaying the onset of osteoporosis by 5 years could save the economy up \nto as much as $10 billion annually.\n  In the state of Iowa, 15 percent of men and women over the age of 50, \nwhich is approximately 340,000 Iowans, have osteoporosis. Women are \nparticularly prone to getting osteoporosis, which can lead to bone \nfractures that result in loss of independence and eventually to nursing \nhome care. Early detection is critical, and there are effective \ntreatments available to prevent bone mass deterioration. An ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  Medicare currently covers bone mass measurement, which is the \ndiagnostic tool used to detect osteoporosis. However, Medicare carriers \nhave discretion regarding eligibility requirements. States cover bone \nmass measurement on a case-by-case basis; some States cover it when an \nindividual is in the early stages of or already has the disease; and \nsome States allow early detection of the disease based on whether or \nnot the patient is at high risk of developing osteoporosis.\n  Medicare carriers in states such as Iowa and Maine promote early \ndetection of osteoporosis by covering bone mass measurement for \nindividuals at-risk of the disease. However, carriers in more than half \nthe States do not allow testing until the person already has the \ndisease or is at very high-risk of getting it.\n  The legislation I am co-sponsoring with Senator Snowe would help \nreduce the economic and social costs of osteoporosis through early \ndetection of this crippling disease. The bill would establish uniform \neligibility requirements for coverage of bone mass measurement, \neliminating the variation in Medicare coverage that currently exists. \nIt would not require that every individual be screened for the disease, \nonly those that are considered at-risk. Medicare is a federal program \nwhere everyone pays 2.9 percent of their pay. Therefore, everyone \ndeserves to have access to the same benefits.\n  I congratulate my colleague, Senator Snowe, for taking the lead on \nthis very important health issue. I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 650. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nestate taxes by providing a 20 percent rate of tax on estates exceeding \n$1,000,000, and a 30 percent rate of tax on estates exceeding \n$10,000,000, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the estate tax reduction act of 1997\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, an April 15, 1997 letter to the Wall \nStreet Journal, which I will insert for the Record, describes one \nfamily's recent experience with the estate tax.\n  The letter states, ``We finally did it. We didn't want to, but we had \nno choice. Exactly nine months after my father-in-law died, my wife and \nI signed a check for $1,285,000 payable to the Internal Revenue \nService.''\n  The man who wrote this letter goes on to talk about what his family \ncould have used that money for, such as buying a beach house, prepaying \ntheir kids' college education, or even retiring.\n  Instead, he calculates that the federal government will spend in 26.8 \nseconds what took his father-in-law 75 years to accumulate.\n  After I read this letter, I decided to do some calculations of my \nown. In 1997, the federal government will collect $19.2 billion in \nestate taxes from 37,200 Americans. The federal government will spend \nthat $19.2 billion in 4.3 days. Assuming each of those decedents was 70 \nyears old when they died, that represents more than 2.6 million years' \nworth of work and savings which will be wiped-out forever and spent by \nthe government in less than five days.\n  Mr. President, some people mistakenly believe estate taxes only \naffect the rich. In the Washington Post this week, Deputy Treasury \nSecretary Larry Summers says in response to a question about the estate \ntax, ``You have to raise revenue somewhere, and ability to pay seems \nlike a good way to do it.''\n  The truth is that there are thousands of small businesses and farms \nthroughout the country owned and operated by middle-income Americans \nthat are affected by the estate tax. In Oklahoma alone, statistics from \nthe U.S. Census of Agriculture indicate that over 7,500 farms and \nranches have a value that could trigger estate tax. Even those who do \nnot end up paying the tax will spend thousands of dollars planning to \navoid it or insuring against it.\n\n  What is the ultimate impact of all this uneconomic activity? \nAccording to the Small Business Administration, only 30 percent of \nfamily businesses are passed down to a second generation, and only 13 \npercent make it to a third generation.\n  It does not take a lot of success in business or investing these days \nto become a ``taxable estate'' in the eyes of Uncle Sam. With the \nexplosive growth in mutual fund investments over the last several \nyears, and the corresponding increase in stock prices, workers will \nretire and discover their pension plan to be much larger than they had \nanticipated. Aggressive business owners who reinvest all their profits \nback into their business will find themselves asset-rich and cash-poor.\n  Under current law, a taxable estate of $1 million faces a marginal \ntax rate of 39 percent. A taxable estate of $3 million qualifies you \nfor a confiscatory 55 percent marginal tax rate. A tax credit limits \nthe tax on the first $600,000 of the estate.\n  If a person starts a small business--be it a farm, a restaurant, or a \ncar dealership--and they work hard, expand, and become successful, why \nshould Uncle Sam be entitled to 39 percent or 55 percent of it? What \ndid the government do to build that business?\n  This business owner has already paid annual income tax (twice if \norganized as a corporation), self-employment tax, FICA tax, FUTA tax, \nand capital gains tax. Why should the Government come in and say, after \nall these taxes are paid, ``We want over half of everything that's \nleft''?\n  Mr. President, the current estate tax is unfair and it is \ncounterproductive. In the long term, it needs to be repealed. In the \nshort term, it needs to be dramatically changed.\n  I am introducing legislation today which represents dramatic change \nin the short term and provides a stepping-stone to eventual repeal. My \nbill goes right to the basic problem, which is estate tax rates. With \nseventeen marginal tax rate brackets ranging from 18 percent to 55 \npercent, estate tax rates are too complex and too high.\n  Under my legislation, taxable estates and gifts under $1 million will \npay no tax, taxable estates and gifts from $1 million to $10 million \nwill be taxed at a marginal rate of 20 percent, and taxable estates and \ngifts over $10 million will be taxed at a marginal rate of 30 percent.\n  Mr. President, this legislation benefits all taxpayers by simplifying \nthe structure of the estate tax and reducing the number of tax brackets \nfrom seventeen to three. Further, by increasing the basic exemption \nfrom $600,000 to $1 million, it will reduce the number of estates \nsubject to taxation by more than 40 percent and greatly reduce the need \nfor and cost of estate tax planning.\n  The benefits of this legislation are also progressive. A taxable \nestate worth $1 million will have its tax liability completely \neliminated. A taxable estate worth $5 million will receive a 64 percent \nreduction in tax liability, and a taxable estate worth $50 million will \nreceive a 50 percent reduction in tax liability.\n  Finally, the benefits of this legislation are fair. It does not \nsingle-out certain types of estate assets for preferential treatment, \nand thus avoids the problems of picking winners and losers.\n  The enactment of estate tax reform this year will not be very easy, \nMr. President, despite broad, bipartisan support in the Senate and the \nHouse.\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\nThe Clinton administration continues to block estate tax reform with \npartisan, class-warfare rhetoric. In the Washington Post article I \nmentioned earlier about estate tax reform, Deputy Secretary Summers \neven said, ``When it comes to the estate tax, there is no case other \nthan selfishness.''\n  I find that statement offensive, and I wonder if President Clinton \nagrees with his lieutenant. Is passing your life's work on to your \nchildren is ``selfish''?\n  I encourage all my colleagues to read the letter I submitted with my \nstatement today and ask themselves, ``Is our estate tax policy \npromoting freedom, family, and opportunity, or does it just promote the \nredistribution of wealth?''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Young)\n\n       We finally did it. We didn't want to, but we had no choice.\n       Exactly nine months after my father-in-law died, my wife \n     and I signed a check for $1,285,000, payable to the Internal \n     Revenue Service.\n       Now, you may ask what we are complaining about. After all, \n     we were born into enlightened, liberal upper-middle-income \n     families in the 1950s. Our fathers extolled our obligation to \n     pay taxes so that the government can provide for the less \n     fortunate. Indeed, it may have been those principles that \n     dissuaded my father-in-law from engaging in any estate \n     planning. So we had to sign away--in addition to state \n     inheritance taxes, deferred income taxes, excise taxes and \n     countless legal and accounting fees incurred just so we could \n     compute how much tax we must pay--the great bulk of my \n     father-in-law's estate.\n       Having had the privilege of holding on to this much money \n     for these past months--as executors of the estate we are \n     legally obligated to accumulate and preserve the assets for \n     paying taxes--we dreamed of what we could have done with the \n     funds: buy a beach house, prepay our kids' college education, \n     even quit our jobs and retire. Instead, the reality of how \n     fast that money will be spent by the government is hammered \n     home by the giant billboard tallying government debt at the \n     intersection of Sixth Avenue and 43rd Street in New York. I \n     calculate that the federal government will spend in 26.8 \n     seconds what took my father-in-law 75 years to accumulate--\n     after the taxes he paid during his lifetime. Not a satisfying \n     thought.\n       We thus propose the following: Rather than paying my \n     father-in-law's hard-earned money to the government, which \n     acts as no more than a greedy and inefficient middleman \n     between the haves and have-nots, it should simply identify \n     three of the neediest families and let us hand over a half-\n     million dollars or so to each. This way we can know that my \n     father-in-law's money will make a difference. And at least \n     someone would give my father-in-law a posthumous thank-you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n

A joint resolution proposing an amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States granting the President the \nauthority to exercise an item veto of individual appropriations in an \nappropriations bill; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the line-item veto constitutional amendment\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a \nline-item veto constitutional amendment.\n  This action is particularly timely in light of the decision by a \nFederal district court judge which declared the recently enacted \nstatutory line-item veto, or more accurately, enhanced rescission \nauthority, to be unconstitutional.\n  This judge's decision may be overturned, or Congress may be able to \nmodify the language in a way that satisfies the courts. Baring either \nof these, a line-item veto can only be provided by amending the \nConstitution.\n  Fortunately, Congress provided for expedited judicial review of the \nconstitutionality of the 1996 Line Item Veto legislation, and the \nSupreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in the case next month, and \nto render a decision by July.\n  Prior to my election to the Senate I served in the House of \nRepresentatives. In that body I introduced a constitutional line-item \nveto on several occasions. This was motivated by my view that the \ngreatest threat to our economy is the continued deficits which Congress \npiles on top of the accumulated $5.3 trillion national debt.\n  Obviously, the budget system that we have in place is not working. We \nneed a balanced budget amendment and a line-item veto.\n  Last year, Congress gave the President what is generally referred to \nas expanded rescission authority. The Republican Congress committed to \ngive this authority to whoever was elected President in 1996, Democrat \nor Republican. It was immaterial to us, our objective was to provide a \nbi-partisan tool to help eliminate wasteful spending beginning on \nJanuary 1, 1997.\n  Last year's legislation was an expansion of the very limited \nrescission authority granted to the President in 1974 under the \nImpoundment Control Act. Under that earlier statute, the President \ncould indicate items in the budget that he wanted to rescind, but he \nwas required to obtain the support of both Houses of Congress in order \nfor the rescission to actually be enacted. The budget history of the \npast two decades demonstrates better than I could why this is akin to \nthe fox guarding the henhouse.\n  The Line-Item Veto Act reversed this burden and required the Congress \nto disapprove any rescissions identified by the President within 30 \ndays. If this deadline was not met, then the item was eliminated.\n  This new authority permitted three types of rescissions. First, \ndiscretionary appropriations could be rescinded. Discretionary spending \nis about one-third of the budget and is where most of what is \nconsidered pork barrel spending occurs.\n  Second, the law permitted the rescission of any new item of \nentitlement spending. While currently existing entitlements would be \nexempt, any new item could be stricken--entitlements constitute the \nremaining two-thirds of the budget and is certainly the fastest growing \nportion of the budget.\n  Finally, certain limited tax benefits could be rescinded. These \nlimited tax provisions were generally defined as provisions that \nprovided a federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to \n100 or fewer beneficiaries.\n  The judge who ruled the line item veto statute unconstitutional \nfocused on the fact that the cancellation or rescission authority under \nthe statue exists only after the President signs a bill. He has up to 5 \ndays after signature to identify these rescissions. The judge concluded \nthat this was an unconstitutional delegation of Congressional power.\n  I find this reasoning puzzling since the statute was crafted in a \nmanner that Congress believed to be consistent with past Supreme Court \ndecisions concerning Congressional delegation of authority. The statute \nalso provides nearly identical authority to the impoundment authority \nheld by all Presidents from George Washington up through 1974 when \nCongress voted to deny this authority to future presidents.\n  Obviously, we will hear the final word on this in July. One thing \nhowever, is certain. The authority given to the President last year was \ndifferent from that authority held by 43 state governors. In the states \nthe governor has the explicit authority to line item veto provisions in \na bill as part of the actual bill-signing process.\n  I believe it is time that we take the approach of the states. In \norder to do this we must enact a Constitutional Amendment. Under \narticle I, section 7 of the Constitution, the President's veto \nauthority has been interpreted to mean that he must sign or veto an \nentire piece of legislation--he cannot pick and choose.\n  This language reads: ``Every Bill which shall have passed the House \nof Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be \npresented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall \nsign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that \nHouse in which it shall have originated, . . .'' this section then \nproceeds to outline the procedures by which Congress may override this \nveto with a two-thirds vote of both houses.\n  The amendment that I am introducing today amends this language as it \npertains to appropriations bills. It specifically provides that the \nPresident shall have the power to disapprove any appropriation of an \nappropriations bill at the time the President approves the bill.\n  This change will make explicit that the President is no longer \nconfined to either vetoing or signing an entire bill, but that he may \nchoose to single out certain appropriations for veto and still sign a \nportion of the bill.\n  I noted earlier that 43 state governors have some type of line item \nveto. This is consistent with the approach taken in most state \nconstitutions of providing a greater level of detail concerning the \nbudget process than is contained in the U.S. Constitution. In my view, \nthe line item veto has been an important factor in the more responsible \nbudgeting that occurs at the state level.\n  Colorado is one of the states that gives line item veto authority to \nthe governor. That power, along with a balanced budget requirement in \nthe state constitution, has worked well and insured that Colorado has \nbeen governed in a fiscally responsible manner regardless of who served \nin the legislature or in the governor's office.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to further discussion on this important \nissue. I realize that the Supreme Court may overturn the lower court \ndecision and declare the line item veto statute\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\nconstitutional. However, in my mind, this is no substitute for moving \nahead on a constitutional amendment. It is time to eliminate the \nuncertainly, and provide for explicit line item veto authority for the \nPresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, today I submit a Senate concurrent \nresolution honoring the lifetime achievements of Jackie Robinson. I \nurge its immediate consideration.\n  After an already distinguished career in the Negro League, Jackie \nRobinson became the first African-American to play major league \nprofessional baseball and one of the best individuals ever to play the \ngame. Just over 50 years ago, Mr. Robinson animated for the entire \ncountry the simple premise on which our Nation was founded--that all \nmen are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with \ncertain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. Given that this animation occurred more than a \ndecade and a half before Martin Luther King reminded us that man should \nbe judged not by the color of his skin but by the content of his \ncharacter, Mr. Robinson's accomplishments were truly great.\n  As his biographers have noted, Jackie Robinson began playing major \nleague baseball 7 years before the historic Brown versus Board of \nEducation Supreme Court ruling, 18 years before voter registration \ndrives in Selma, Alabama. And 18 years before passage of the Voter \nRights Act of 1965.\n  At a time when African Americans were still being forced to walk to \nthe back of the bus, Jackie Robinson was walking up to the plate and \nreceiving cheers of Americans from all walks of life. But for the \ncheers given the efforts of Jackie Robinson, I doubt we would have \nheard the cheers given to Arthur Ashe, Michael Jordon, and Tiger Woods.\n  While Jackie Robinson is best known for being the first African-\nAmerican to play major league baseball, his entire life was full of \nachievements. These are all detailed in this resolution.\n  Jackie Robinson was the first four sport letterman at the University \nof California at Los Angeles.\n  Jackie Robinson was named Rookie of the Year and subsequently led the \nBrooklyn Dodgers to six National League pennants and a World Series \nchampionship.\n  Jackie Robinson's career earned him recognition as the first African-\nAmerican to win a batting title, lead the league in stolen bases, play \nin an All-Star game, win a Most Valuable Player Award, play in the \nWorld Series and be elected to baseball's Hall of Fame.\n  Beyond his accomplishments in baseball, Jackie Robinson was active in \nthe civil rights movement and founded the first bank owned by African-\nAmericans in New York city.\n  Jackie Robinson's legacy continues to uplift the Nation through the \nJackie Robinson Foundation that has provided 425 scholarships to needy \nstudents.\n  It is difficult to list the many heights obtained by Jackie Robinson. \nHe was as successful off the playing field as he was on. It is fitting \nfor the Congress of the United States to honor and celebrate the \nachievements and contributions of Jackie Robinson; that his dedication \nand sacrifice be recognized; and that his contributions to African-\nAmericans and to the Nation be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3687-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3688-S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 78--NATIONAL ERASE THE HATE AND ELIMINATE RACISM DAY\n\n  Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. \nFaircloth, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Abraham, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Reid, \nMr. Lieberman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerrey, Mr. Levin, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Moynihan) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas the term ``hate crime'' means an offense in which \n     one or more individuals, commits an offense (such as an \n     assault or battery (simple or aggrevated), theft, criminal \n     trespass, damage to property, mob action, disorderly conduct, \n     or telephone harassment) by reason of the race, color, creed, \n     religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or \n     mental disability, or national origin of another individual \n     or group of individuals;\n       Whereas there are almost 8,000 hate crimes reported to the \n     Department of Justice each year, and the number of hate \n     crimes reported increases each year;\n       Whereas hate crimes have no place in a civilized society \n     that is dedicated to freedom and independence, as is the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the people of the United States must lead and set \n     the example for the world in protecting the rights of all \n     people;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should take \n     personal responsibility for and action against hatred and \n     hate crimes;\n       Whereas the Members of Congress, as representatives of the \n     people of the United States, must take personal \n     responsibility for and action against hatred and hate crimes;\n       Whereas the laws against hate crimes, which have been \n     passed by Congress and signed by the President, must be \n     supported and implemented by the people of the United States \n     and by Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials \n     and other public servants: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 1997, as ``National Erase the Hate \n     and Eliminate Racism Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issues a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and throughout \n     the world to recognize the importance of using each day as an \n     opportunity to take a stand against hate crimes and violence \n     in their nations, states, neighborhoods, and communities.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Baucus and \n23 of our fellow colleagues, to submit a resolution to designate April \n30 as ``National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.'' We are \nsubmitting this measure because, as you may know, a few years ago a \nseries of anti-semitic and racially biased crimes occurred in my home \ntown of Billings, MT. However, instead of ignoring these events, I am \nproud to say that the community united and worked together to ban these \nacts of hatred. We are hoping that the American people will learn from \nMontanans that racism and hate crimes can be done away with if we work \ntogether.\n  According to the United States Department of Justice, there are \nalmost 8,000 racially and biased crimes each year--and unfortunately, \nthis number is rising. Due to this disappointing fact, my colleagues \nand I have determined that a day should be set aside to bring groups \ntogether that will work to begin to heal our Nation from the sins of \nour past and present.\n  This day would serve as a day for people in the United States, and \nthroughout the world, to recognize the importance of using every day as \nan opportunity to take a stand against hate crimes and violence in \ntheir neighborhoods, communities, states and nations.\n  Through this legislation, we hope to reinforce in the American people \nthat our diversity is something to be proud of. A new understanding of \nour differences would help bring forth a new respect for each other, \nand this resolution should serve as the vehicle to educate Americans \nand promote unity throughout our communities and States.\n  Now, I realize that passage of this measure will not immediately \nobliterate racism from our country. But it is our responsibility, as \nMembers of this distinguished, elected, body to set an example for the \nAmerican people by speaking up for what is right and encouraging others \nto do so.\n  I would like to offer a special thanks to the YWCA and the Anti-\nDefamation League for their assistance in garnering support for this \nmeasure. Their continued service to the American people in supporting \ndiversity serves as a means to open the doors between divergent groups. \nThey should be acknowledged and praised by all.\n  We welcome each of our colleagues to join with us to work to \neradicate the forces that divide us. Finally, I hope that by April 30, \nthe American people are made aware of our thoughts and that we will \nwork for justice for all.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which \nwill designate this April 30 as a National Day to Erase the Hate and \nEliminate Racism.\n  In the last couple of years, we Montanans have seen our state come \nunder the microscope of considerable media scrutiny. We've had the \narrest of the alleged ``Unabomber,'' the standoff between the FBI and \nthe so-called Freemen outside Jordan, and a series of hate crimes in \nsome of our cities.\n  And it's appropriate for the press to take a look at these things, \nwhile recognizing that many of these incidents are repeated on a larger \nscale throughout the rest of the country.\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\n  What has frustrated me, and many other Montanans, however, is the \nlack of attention to the vast majority of Montanans--the people who are \nwilling to stand up to bigots and hate groups. For example, take what \nhappened in Billings, Montana, a few years ago.\n  People in Billings enjoy a high quality of life that only Montana can \nprovide. It is the largest city in Montana, but it still has the feel \nof a small town. Folks say hello to strangers in the street. Families \ngo to the symphony in Pioneer Park in the summer. And neighbors go out \nof their way to help someone when they need a hand.\n  That placid life was shattered in November 1993, when a group of \n``skinheads'' threw a bottle through the glass door of the home of a \nJewish family. A few days later they put a brick through the window of \nanother Jewish family's home--with a five-year-old boy in the room. \nThen they smashed the windows of a Catholic high school that had a \n``Happy Hanukkah'' sign on its marquee.\n  The people of Billings were horrified. But they did not sit at home \nand try to ignore the problem. They did not let the hatred take root. \nThe community banded together.\n  Thousands of homes put Menorahs in their windows. They showed the \nskinheads that the people of Billings were united against hate. And \nthat year, Billings held the largest Martin Luther King Day march ever \nin Montana.\n  And all over Montana, we see more of the same. Whether it is a county \nattorney who stands up to militia groups in Jordan. Or the unsung \npeople who work in their communities, such as Helena, to stamp out \nracism and hatred through the Montana Human Rights Network. These are \nall stories that need to be told.\n  Recently, the USA Network aired a movie called ``Not In This Town,'' \nwhich told the story of these events to the country. I commend the \nnetwork for bringing this story to the world because it sends two \npowerful messages. First of all, Montana is no home for bullies and \nhate-mongers. And second, wherever you live, violence and bigotry do \nnot have to be accepted in your community.\n  That is why today I am submitting, with my colleague from Montana, \nSenator Burns, and many others from across America, a bill which will \ndesignate April 30, 1997, as a National Day to Erase the Hate and \nEliminate Racism.\n  I know a simple bill like this one will not end the problems we still \nhave. A piece of paper alone cannot teach a child that hate is wrong.\n  But I do believe a piece of paper can make people think. It can make \npeople talk about hate crimes. And it can light a spark in people's \nhearts and minds.\n  And if we continue to look at the good, courageous, decent things our \nneighbors are doing, that spark just might catch fire, in Montana and \nall across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3688-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION RATIFICATION RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      BIDEN AMENDMENTS NOS. 47-51\n\n  Mr. BIDEN proposed five amendments to the executive resolution (S. \nRes. 75) to advise and consent to the ratification of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, subject to certain conditions;

Mr. President, in 1995, my first year in the U.S. \nSenate, the Medicare Trustees told Congress that unless it took \n``prompt effective, and decisive action * * * Medicare will be dead in \nseven years.''\n  Two years later, another Trustees' report has been delivered to \nCongress and we are even worse off. We still face the same tough \nchoices. We must balance the budget, restore integrity to the Medicare \ntrust fund, update the Medicare system and provide consumers with more \nchoice--a cornerstone structural change that addresses the long-term \nviability of the Medicare program.\n  In the 104th Congress, the U.S. Congress realized that the \nfundamental way to capture the dynamics of change in the health care \nsystem would be to modernize Medicare by opening it to a broader array \nof private health plans that would compete on the basis of quality and \nnot just cost.\n  President Clinton embraced this ideal as well by initiating a \nMedicare Choices demonstration and including provisions to expand \nchoice, although I feel they are limited, in his February budget \nsubmission to the U.S. Congress.\n  Therefore, Senator Rockefeller and I introduced S. 146, the Provider-\nSponsored Organization Act of 1997. S. 146 expands the current Medicare \nrisk contracting program to include PSO's, Provider Sponsored \nOrganizations.\n  A PSO, very simply, is a public or private provider, or group of \naffiliated providers, organized to deliver a spectrum of health care \nservices under contract to purchasers.\n  Our bill specifies detailed requirements for certification, quality \nassurance and solvency to ensure that PSO's contracting with Medicare \nmeet standards that are comparable to or higher than those for health \nmaintenance organizations [HMO's].\n  Specifically, the bill provides Federal leadership for States to \nfashion a streamlined PSO approval process that is consistent with \nFederal standards protecting Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Second, by providing incentives for PSO's and HMO's to evaluate \npatterns of care, it promotes state of the art continuous quality \nimprovement.\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\n  Third, the bill creates a mechanism by which the Secretary of HHS \nwould be allowed, but not required, to enter into partial risk payment \narrangements with PSO's or HMO's.\n  Fourth, it outlines specific solvency standards for PSO's which \nreflect the peculiarities of their operating environment.\n  Now, why are PSO's, to my mind, a good place to start in opening up \nand modernizing Medicare to offer our seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities more choice of private plan options?\n  First, and something very close to me as a physician and as one who \nhas spent over 50,000 hours working in hospitals, PSO's will improve \nquality of health care. The creation of PSO's in the Medicare \nenvironment, I am absolutely convinced, will improve quality.\n  It really goes back to personal experience. But the fundamental \nreason is that PSO's are the care-givers. PSO's are the physicians, the \nhospitals, the facilities.\n  It is those physicians, those care-givers who are on the front line \nof health care every day. Thus, they are in the best position to \ncontrol, monitor, and demand quality for that individual patient who \nwalks in through the door.\n  It is my feeling that in a competitive managed care environment, \nPSO's will be at the table competing with insurance companies, \ncompeting with HMO's. But it is they, because they are the care-givers, \nthat can bring to the table that concern for the individual patient, \nand demand quality which will have a spill-over effect in the \nnegotiations in the managed care environment. There is an inherent PSO \nemphasis on quality because the people at the table are the people who \nare taking care of the individual patient.\n  The second issue around quality, is that S. 146 requires collective \naccountability, where quality and cost are measured by overall practice \npatterns across the entire PSO rather than just case-by-case \nutilization review.\n  It used to be that we did not know how to do that. In 1997, we do \nknow how to do that. We look at system-wide measures of quality. The \nadvantage of system-wide measures, instead of case-by-case utilization, \nis better use of resources, less intrusiveness in the doctor/patient \nrelationship, and it is state of the art today. It is built into our \nbill.\n  S. 146 requires PSO's to meet new, higher quality standards and they \nmust, as spelled out in our bill, have experience in the coordination \nof care. Thus, we will not see the creation of inexperienced groups \ncoming forward.\n\n  That is important because of the so-called 50-50 rule, a standard \nwhich is inappropriately used as a surrogate measure for quality, \nrequiring that plans participate in the commercial marketplace.\n  Well, today, because of the outline of higher quality standards, and \nbecause of the requirement for experience with the coordination of \ncare, the 50-50 rule does not apply and would be waived for PSO's.\n  I should also say that non-PSO Medicare risk contractors, under our \nbill, would be eligible for waiving this quasi-quality measurement as \nlong as they met the enhanced quality standards spelled out in our \nbill. Thus, S. 146 sets a new standard for quality assurance, a \nstandard that I feel will set the pace for the rest of the industry.\n  Mr. President, the Provider Sponsored Organization Act returns to a \nbasic concept that applies a lot to what we are doing in the U.S. \nCongress today. This bill will empower providers to become, once again, \ntrue partners in the clinical decisionmaking process. The PSO really \ndoes allow physicians, care-givers, and facilities to once again regain \nsome control over what goes on at that doctor/patient relationship \nlevel.\n  In the U.S. Congress over the last year we have seen bills, like a \n48-hour maternity stay bill post-birth, and a proposal for a 48-hour \nstay after mastectomy. I have even had proposals come forward to me for \n5-day bills after heart surgery. Well, obviously the U.S. Congress can \ngo in and try to micro-manage body part by body part, but I do not \nthink that is the direction to go.\n  By bringing care-givers to the table, by reenfranchising them, by \nallowing them to once again regain participation in the clinical \ndecision-making process, we get out of that business.\n  Why? Because at the negotiating table in the managed care environment \nyou have physicians and care-givers there speaking for the patient, not \nallowing just cost to drive what goes on in the managed care \nenvironment.\n  In addition, the PSO option will bring coordinated care to more \ncommunities. Again, this is terribly important because we see so much \nof managed care in urban areas and not in rural areas and not in under-\nserved areas.\n  This bill very specifically has incentives built in it to encourage \nparticipation in those under-served and rural areas. It will very \nclearly, to my mind, bring managed care, coordinated care, networking \nof care to those communities where it is not an available choice today.\n  As you know, managed care has had great difficulty in attracting \nseniors. We know that about three-quarters of the employed population \nare enrolled in coordinated/managed care today. But in Medicare, only \nabout 13 percent are enrolled.\n  Two reasons. Right now, the rigidity of our Medicare system does not \nallow any other entities besides a very narrowly defined HMO to \nparticipate in Medicare. We can agree or disagree whether to open that \nsystem up to a broad array of plans. Indeed, I think this first step of \na PSO is the most reasonable way to go to begin to expand that choice.\n  In the State of Tennessee, the majority of Medicare beneficiaries \nhave no choice. There is no HMO, except right in middle Tennessee. \nThere are no other plans. Senior citizens have no choice whatsoever in \nTennessee, except in Nashville, where they can choose one plan today.\n  The second reason, is that our seniors are scared their care is going \nto be taken away. They are scared to join managed care because they are \nscared that their local physician will be dropped from the network. \nMany fear that an HMO or managed care plan might drop their physician \nonce they join it, and that frightens them a great deal.\n  It only makes sense that Medicare beneficiaries will feel much more \nsecure about coordinated care knowing that they have the choice of a \nhealth care plan run by care-givers, run by physicians, nurses, and \nhospitals who are in their own local community. The Rockefeller/Frist \nbill will give them that security.\n  PSO's, as I mentioned, do apply particularly well to rural \ncommunities. Because the doctors and hospitals are already in the rural \nareas, serving the local population, it is easier for them, rather than \nsome outside insurance company maybe located 200 miles away, to \norganize, network and provide a coordinated care option for seniors in \nwhat have been traditionally underserved rural areas.\n  Finally, given the fact that Medicare's own trustees have reported \nthat the trust fund will soon be bankrupt, Medicare's rate of growth \nclearly must be slowed. The introduction of PSO's will advance market-\nbased competition within Medicare, which I believe is absolutely \nessential to the long-term integrity of the entire Medicare Program, \nboth part A and part B.\n  The Provider Sponsored Organization Act of 1997 builds on the PSO \nprovision included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 [BBA]. The BBA \ncreated a legal definition of PSO's and developed a definition of \n``affiliated provider.'' S. 146 goes one step further. It defines a \nMedicare Qualified PSO as a PSO that has the capability to contract to \nprovide full benefit, capitated, coordinated care to beneficiaries.\n  Specific criteria for the direct provision of services by affiliated \nproviders are spelled out in the bill. This ensures that all but a \nsmall fraction of contracted services are provided either under \naffiliation or by participating provider agreements.\n  It also ensures that current Medicare provider contracting rules, \nespecially those that protect beneficiaries or consumers from financial \nliability in the event of a plan failure, will also apply to PSOs.\n  Since Medicare qualified PSOs do not enter the commercial market as a \nhealth plan in order to contract with Medicare, S. 146 provides Federal \ncertification for the first four years, after which transition to State \nlicensure is carried out.\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\n  In addition, this bill requires that the Secretary contract with \nstates during that four year period to provide local monitoring of \nongoing PSO performance, as well as beneficiary access to services. At \nthe end of the four year period, State licensure would be required as \nlong as State standards are sufficiently similar to the Federal \nstandards, and the solvency standards are identical.\n  This approach over these initial four years, marries the benefits of \nnational standards for a national program with the benefits of close \nmonitoring at the State level by State agencies, an approach currently \nused by Medicare in certifying a variety of health care providers.\n  The issue of solvency. Last year's Balanced Budget Act mandated that \nthe Secretary develop new solvency standards that are more appropriate \nto this PSO, provider-sponsored, environment.\n  Similarly, S. 146 recognizes that PSOs are different. They are not \ninsurance companies, nor should they pretend to be insurance companies. \nPSOs are the caregivers themselves.\n  Thus, it is not necessary, because they are care-givers--physicians, \nnurses, and facilities--for them to go out and contract out or pay \nclaims for health care services that they have to go out and \nessentially buy--as insurance companies have to do. Very different. \nThis bill establishes these new solvency standards to protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries against the risk of PSO insolvency.\n  The test of fiscal soundness is based on net worth and reserve \nrequirements drawn from current Medicare law and the current National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) ``Model HMO Act.'' \nAdjustments are made to reflect the operational characteristics of \nPSOs. For example, in measuring net worth, it ensures that health \ndelivery assets held by the PSOs, such as the hospital building, are \nrecognized just as they are in NAIC's Model HMO Act. Thus, fiscal \nsoundness is assured.\n  Another issue on which the Rockefeller/Frist bill differs from the \n1995 Balanced Budget Act is that it gives the Secretary authority to \nenter partial risk contracts, either with PSO's or HMO's.\n  The Balanced Budget Act required that PSO's take full risk with \nrespect to Medicare benefits. While both bills would require that PSO's \nprovide the full Medicare-defined benefit package, S. 146 adds a \npartial risk payment method, that is, payment for all services based on \na mix of capitation and cost. This is actually very important if we \nwant to have coordinated care go to our rural communities.\n  Now, why is PSO legislation necessary? First, current Medicare \nstatute does not allow managed care plans to serve only Medicare \npatients. Instead, currently it requires these types of plans to \nparticipate also in the commercial market.\n  The Balanced Budget Act established the premise, that PSO's should be \nallowed to offer Medicare-only plans. Therefore, the rule that I \nmentioned earlier, the so-called 50-50 rule, is inappropriate under our \nbill for Medicare-only type plans.\n  Second, plans today are required to go through the State licensure \nprocess. Yet, the overwhelming majority of State licensure processes do \nnot recognize the fact that PSO's differ from most insurers. Rather, \nStates today expect them to look and act like insurers. But they are \nnot, they are caregivers.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I, in closing, did not introduce this \nlegislation to eclipse the current Medicare risk contractors. Rather, \nthe Provider Sponsored Organization Act compliments existing HMO \noptions in the Medicare program and expands the choices available to \nseniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  This bill is narrow. It is focused. It really does not take on the \nbroader issues of structural reform that must be addressed in Medicare. \nI would like to see much more choice than this bill, but this is the \nplace to start.\n  Mr. President, Qualified Provider-Sponsored Organizations will \nchallenge all health care organizations participating in Medicare to \nmeet the goal of an integrated, coordinated health care system where \nquality, and not just cost, is put forward, where relationships of \ncare-givers and their patients is preserved, and where physicians, \nnurses and hospitals come to the table. PSO's will challenge the entire \nsystem and the result will be higher quality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3690-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3692-S3693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SENATOR SAM NUNN SUPPORTS THE B-2\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, there have been many supportive \ncomments on the remarks I presented last week on the need to acquire \nnine additional B-2 global precision strike aircraft. There is one \nresponse, in particular, which I wish to share with my colleagues.\n  Former Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia served the Senate for many years. \nThrough dedicated work and thoughtful analysis, Senator Nunn came to be \nregarded as a national authority on defense issues. I now ask that a \nletter in support of additional B-2 procurement, which Senator Nunn \nsent to Congressman Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Committee on \nNational Security, Subcommittee on Military Procurement, be printed in \ntoday's Record. I believe that all Senators will benefit from a close \nand thoughtful reading of former Senator Nunn's letter.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                               King & Spalding\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Duncan Hunter,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Military Procurement,\n     Committee on National Security,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for asking me to provide \n     testimony for your March 12, 1997, hearing on bomber force \n     structure. As you know, I have been a strong supporter of the \n     B-2 bomber program since its inception as the Advanced \n     Technology Bomber in the early 1980's. I continue to believe \n     that 21 B-2 bombers will not constitute an adequate force \n     level to deal with many likely future contingencies and \n     crises, and that no other military systems in existence or on \n     the drawing boards can adequately substitute for the \n     capabilities the B-2 offers. Therefore, I strongly endorse \n     the Subcommittee's reconsideration of the future bomber force \n     structure to include the issue of resuming production of the \n     B-2 bomber. I believe the Subcommittee needs to carefully \n     consider the following points in its deliberations.\n       * For the foreseeable future, two major hot spots will \n     remain in the Middle East and on the Korean peninsula. Yet \n     these set-piece scenarios should not be the only scenarios \n     against which the adequacy of our forces (and our military \n     strategy) are tested.\n       * Potential enemies have learned several valuable lessons \n     from Iraq's experience during Operation Desert Storm don't \n     give the U.S. time to deploy forces and their support to the \n     theater, do focus on disrupting U.S. air operations, do \n     target strategic objectives that allies will be reluctant to \n     counterattack (Seoul, Saudi oil field, etc.) and plan to \n     seize them rapidly, before U.S. power can be brought to bear.\n       * Future conflicts are likely to confront the U.S. with a \n     race against time and the advance of enemy forces toward \n     important strategic objectives (think how different it might \n     have been if Saddam's troops had not stopped after taking \n     Kuwait.)\n       * U.S. contingency planning, including the BUR analyses and \n     the JCS ``Nimble Dancer'' wargames (and the widely criticized \n     1995 DOD Heavy Bomber Study), assumes the U.S. will enjoy two \n     weeks of actionable warning prior to an enemy attack--\n     valuable time during which our military plans to deploy \n     forces from CONUS and Europe, and more important, to start \n     the sealift bridge from CONUS to the theater.\n       * This sealift link is crucial to U.S. performance in 1990, \n     the U.S. needed six months in which to build up forces levels \n     and to establish the sealift pipeline to support those forces \n     during high-intensity conflict. Yet, the adequacy of \n     logistics support has never been adequately modeled in JCS \n     wargames.\n       * In 1994, Iraq suddenly mobilized troops and sent them to \n     the border with Kuwait The U.S. response capability raises \n     serious questions. U.S. planning assumes two carriers in the \n     Persian Gulf, yet there were none, U.S. planning assumes \n     deployment of many hundreds of tactical aircraft to the \n     theater in the first week, yet only about one hundred \n     arrived, U.S. planning assumes prepositioned equipment aboard \n     ships berthed at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean are \n     important assets, yet these ships did not arrive until after \n     the crisis was ended, U.S. planning assumes many precision \n     munitions, yet supplies in the theater were low.\n       * If an important class of future contingencies will be \n     those in which U.S. forces are trying to prevent an enemy \n     surprise attack from seizing high-value targets, then U.S. \n     forces will have to place a premium either on combat-ready \n     forces stationed within the theater or on forces that can \n     reach the theater and conduct effective operations in a \n     timely fashion.\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\n       * We cannot count on having stationed forces in the right \n     place at the right time, all the time. This suggests the \n     importance of long-range assets, to provide the flexibility \n     to respond rapidly from CONUS to trouble spots around the \n     globe. The B-2 can reach any point on the globe from just \n     three bases--Guam, Diego Garcia, and the U.S.\n       * Once in the theater, U.S. assets must be both survivable \n     and highly effective against an invading enemy force. The B-2 \n     bomber has a combination of range, payload, and stealth that \n     is unmatched by any other system. And, precision munitions \n     are continuing to enhance the value of all tactical aircraft, \n     including the B-2 bomber.\n       * The value of stealth for conducting operations in a high-\n     threat environment has been clear ever since the air \n     operations against Iraq began in early 1991. The F-117A \n     Stealth Fighter conducted countless missions over Baghdad \n     without any loses and are widely cited for the success of the \n     air war. Yet the F-117A has many operational limitations--it \n     is a medium altitude attack platform capable of effective \n     operations only at night in clear weather.\n       * The B-2 is an all-altitude, all-weather platform that is \n     more stealthy than the F-117A and that carries many more \n     individually-targetable weapons. The B-2's advanced \n     capabilities go well beyond those of the F-117A or any other \n     non-stealthy bomber.\n       * A number of recent analytic studies have shown that \n     against many plausible invading forces, 20 or 21 B-2 bombers \n     are simply not enough force to stop enemy invaders short of \n     their important strategic objectives.\n       * The cost of additional B-2's is high relative to non-\n     stealthy, short-range tactical aircraft. But so is the cost \n     of failing to stop a determined enemy short of his strategic \n     objectives. The inherent flexibility and capability of the B-\n     2 bomber will be most important in those cases where we are \n     surprised, where an enemy doesn't do what we had expected, \n     and/or where we did not plan to have to fight.\n       I commend these points to the attention of your \n     Subcommittee, and would urge you to undertake a searching \n     review of the assumptions and assertions that underlie \n     present U.S. military contingency plans. I thank you for \n     inviting me to submit these thoughts for the Subcommittee's \n     consideration and for your Subcommittee's careful attention \n     to these important questions for national security.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sam Nunn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3692-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING TURKEY'S GENOCIDE OF THE ARMENIANS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, America has always been a haven \nfor victims of oppression and it is fitting that Members of this body \nrise every year to mark April 24--the day that commemorates Turkey's \ngenocide of the Armenians. In the first instance in the 20th century \nwhen a state declared war on a minority group, an estimated 1.5 million \npeople were killed. We rise today to show our solidarity with the \nvictims and our condemnation of the slaughterers.\n  Many Armenian survivors came to the United States, where they found \nsanctuary. They have prospered and their vibrant community as a whole \nhas become an integral part of American life and the democratic \nprocess. But while realizing and contributing to the American dream, \nthey always remembered their Armenian origins, and never forgot their \nnational sorrow. As Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel has written, \nthe Armenian people are rooted firmly ``in their collective and \nimmutable memory where death itself is vanquished, because the memory \nof death is received as a symbol, an instant of eternity.''\n  Their sharing of the Armenian historical experience with non-\nArmenians has served as a stark reminder for us all of the universality \nof human evil and the strength of the human spirit, even at the darkest \nmoments. The resilience of the survivors and Armenians the world over \nhave inspired in other peoples feelings of shared sorrow and \nadmiration. We mourn with them, and simultaneously take pride in their \nability to overcome a great historical injustice, the consciousness of \nwhich never disappears.\n  Unhappily for them, Armenians have been called upon to be our \nteachers. From their terrible suffering we have learned that states may \nnot make war upon minority groups, and the international community will \nneither tolerate nor forget such transgressions. From their ability to \ntranscend the saddest moments of their history, we take heart and \nrecommit ourselves to remembrance, celebration, and vigilance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3693-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO JOE STERNE OF THE BALTIMORE SUN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

As editor, he has \nbeen one of the best. I cannot remember a time when his name was not at \nthe top of the paper's masthead. I read his editorials and he has read \nmy press releases.

Mr. President, On February 3, of this year, \nCarolyn\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\nStradley testified before the Small Business Committee regarding the \nproblems she had starting a paving company. It was one of the most \ninteresting and compelling statements I have heard since I came to the \nSenate, and I have heard thousands.\n  Mr. President, without further elaboration, I ask that Mrs. \nStradley's statement be printed in the Record for all to see and \nappreciate.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                    Testimony of Carolyn A. Stradley\n\n       Good morning. Thank you for your time today.\n       My name is Carolyn Stradley, I am the founder and owner of \n     C Paving, Inc. in Marietta, Georgia.\n       I was born in the Appalachian Mountains at home in a two-\n     room shack, without electricity or water. I had never seen \n     indoor plumbing until I went to school.\n       My mother died when I was only 11 years old and my father, \n     an alcoholic, walked away. For two years I survived in the \n     mountains, then at 13 years old, I moved to Atlanta, \n     sometimes sleeping in the back of cars and bathing at the bus \n     station. When I entered high school, I did so without front \n     teeth. Working at night, going to school in the day time. I \n     married at 15 years old, was kicked out of school at 16 for \n     being pregnant, became a mother at 17, caring for a totally \n     disabled husband at 21 and became a widow at age 26.\n       I started C Paving, Inc. out of necessity, not by choice, \n     from the back of a pickup truck, shoveling asphalt into \n     potholes. But I quickly found out that in 1979 very few \n     people would take a single, 32-year-old woman in the asphalt \n     paving business seriously.\n       When I tried to purchase equipment and trucks in 1979, the \n     sales people just laughed at me. So, I asked my brother, who \n     was unemployed and only had an 8th grade education to work \n     with me for 25 percent of this new company. It was necessary \n     for us to work 14-16 hours a day, so I asked my brother's \n     wife if she would care for the children and answer the \n     telephone--for another 25 percent of the company.\n       When the company was first started, I went to the Small \n     Business Administration and asked for an 8-A package, but was \n     told I did not qualify, but I persisted and finally was able \n     to obtain a package after many years of trying. After its \n     costly completion, and several months of waiting C Paving \n     was again denied entrance into the program.\n       However, I did not give up and tried several years later \n     and once again was told that I was not and had not ever been \n     disadvantaged. I saw other people--some third generation \n     company and college graduates--qualify and permitted to \n     negotiate jobs that I was not allowed to bid on. I felt very \n     angry and betrayed. Sadly, it seems to me that the 8(a) \n     Program does not include white females whose circumstances \n     would otherwise qualify them as being disadvantaged. In my \n     case that was totally unfair and an abrogation of Congress' \n     intent for the program.\n       In 1986, I realized that I could no longer work with my \n     brother because of a total different set of values in \n     business and life. I told him if he would just get my name \n     off the personal guarantees, he could have everything. He \n     could not and demanded $500,000 for his and his wife's \n     shares. My options, as I saw them: murder, suicide, or find a \n     way to buy him out.\n       I went to several banks before I found one that believed a \n     woman could run an asphalt paving company, however, they \n     would only make the loan if the SBA would guarantee it.\n       Business was great for the first 6 years into a 10-year \n     loan. However, several of our job sites were hit by two \n     tornadoes and one flood and the most rain that was ever \n     recorded in Georgia.\n       The small bank that I had been dealing with was purchased \n     in 1993 by a large multi-state group. The loan was then \n     ``called'' at a time when I could not work because of \n     weather--the fact that I had never missed a payment for six \n     years meant absolutely nothing to the bank.\n       I then requested a meeting with the Small Business \n     Administration. I met with Fred Stone, District Director for \n     the State of Georgia, Ray Gibeau, Chief, Portfolio Management \n     and Janis Burda, Loan Liquidation Specialist. It was at this \n     meeting that I realized that these three people were \n     completely different than anyone I had ever dealt with before \n     at the SBA. They were very professional, understood small \n     business and were willing to go the extra mile.\n       It was with their help and guidance that C & S Paving was \n     able to restructure the remaining balance of the loan. As a \n     result of SBA's recognition that C & S Paving was a company \n     worth saving, we have grown, prospered and are currently \n     planning to build a new building this year which will enable \n     us to hire about 10 more people this year.\n       Without SBA's help, I would have lost everything that I had \n     worked my whole life for and over 30 period would have lost \n     their jobs. Therefore, I am living proof that the SBA works \n     for this Nation by helping small business create jobs and \n     economic independence for its citizens. My survival has \n     provided encouragement to many other people, especially women \n     who wish to start their own companies.\n       From its humble beginning, by the reinvestment of profits \n     back into the Company, C & S Paving was awarded the largest \n     single contract ever let to a female-owned company through \n     open-competitive bids. Other notable projects we have \n     constructed are the running tracks inside the Olympic Stadium \n     and the Georgia Dome.\n       Additionally, we were honored by President Bush in 1989 at \n     the White House as Second Runner Up for the National Small \n     Business Person of the Year as well as the Small Business \n     Person of the Year Award for 1996 by The Small Business \n     Council of America.\n       I share all of this with you, hopefully to help you \n     understand the passion I feel towards the Small Business \n     Administration. It is not perfect by any means, but to \n     millions of women of this country, who by no fault of their \n     own, do not have a father, husband, the education or \n     community standing to ask for help--SBA's Women Business \n     Ownership Program is their only glimmer of light and hope.\n       Today, you can be the vehicle that helps those that seek to \n     help themselves by recognizing the true value that the Small \n     Business Administration has and the difference it has made in \n     so many lives and the tremendous contributions that small \n     business makes to this country's economy and to the world.\n       This Agency's programs are not a hand out, but truly a hand \n     up. Please allow us to hope.\n       Hope sees the invisible; feels the intangible and hope \n     achieves the impossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3693-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3694-S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today on Take Our Daughters \nto Work Day, to encourage young women and girls across America to set \ntheir sights high, and to reach for their dreams.\n  Since my childhood, the composition of the work force has changed \ndramatically, and job opportunities have significantly increased for \nyoung women and girls. Today, women comprise 46 percent of the paid \nlabor force, and according to Bureau of Labor and Statistics, by the \nyear 2000, roughly half of new entrants into the labor force will be \nwomen.\n  Despite these gains, studies show that during adolescence, girls \noften receive less attention in school and suffer from lower \nexpectations than do boys. They also set their future sights lower than \ntheir male counterparts. This is reflected in a New York Times/CBS \npoll, which found that over one third of girls surveyed believed that \nthere are more advantages to being a man than a women. For many girls, \nlow self-esteem can lead them to lose confidence in their abilities, \nwhich may prevent them from achieving their fullest potential later in \nlife.\n  In this day and age, we cannot accept reduced opportunities for girls \nand women from either an equity standpoint or an economic one. Today, \nwomen are equally responsible for the well-being of their families. So \nit is not just their own futures that are at stake, but the future of \ntheir children and their children's children. It is our responsibility \nto set high standards and provide them with the experiences and role \nmodels that will inspire them to be extraordinary leaders of the \nfuture.\n  We need to do far more to challenge our daughters' notions of women's \nwork. While most school-age girls plan to work, they do not plan for \ncareers that could sustain themselves and their families. In 1992, 53.8 \nmillion women were employed and only 3.5 million were employed in \nnontraditional occupations. Further, women working in nontraditional \njobs earn 20 to 30 percent more than women in traditionally female \njobs. Women remain significantly under-represented in careers requiring \nmath and science skills--women comprise only 11 percent of today's \ntechnical work force, and only 17 percent of all doctors are women. \nNearly 75 percent of tomorrow's jobs will require the use of computers, \nbut girls comprise less than one-third of students enrolled in computer \ncourses. And a study by the Glass Ceiling Commission found that women \noccupy only 5 percent of senior-level management of the top Fortune \n1000 industrial and 500 service companies. As leaders and as parents, \nwe must do our best to ensure that American girls are prepared to step \ninto those high-wage jobs and management positions that command higher \nsalaries in the work force.\n  I was honored to endorse again, this year, Take Our Daughters to Work \nDay, organized by the Maine's Women's Development Institute, in my home \nState. Girls in Maine and across the Nation will have another \nopportunity to see first-hand that they have a range of life options. \nIn the past, Take\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\nOur Daughters to Work Day has encouraged young girls to reach out and \nuse their creative spirit and I am confident that this special day will \nprove again to be a rich and rewarding experience for all parents and \ndaughters alike.\n  Today, millions of parents across the Nation will take their \ndaughters to work. In 1996, in Maine alone, 10,000 Maine girls and \n5,000 Maine businesses participated in Take Our Daughters To Work Day. \nThese parents perform a great service by exposing their daughters to \nnew and exciting experiences. They are not only expanding their \nhorizons and helping them to explore opportunities, but teaching them \nimportant lessons about goal-setting as well. Take Our Daughters to \nWork Day has encouraged a new generation of young girls to envision a \nworld where no goal is impossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3694-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, thanks to Take Our Daughters to \nWork Day, young girls from all over the country will be given the \nopportunity to accompany adults to the workplace. Today, young girls \nwill be given the opportunity to shadow an adult mentor--and gain \nexperience in a work environment. What better way to enable girls to \nexplore their future and gain exposure to a wide range of career \noptions?\n  The focus of this one day event is to bring awareness to the \ndevelopment and education of young girls. Research suggests that young \ngirls often receive less attention in school and suffer from lower \nexpectations than boys. This difference can affect their self-esteem \nand self-confidence, particularly during the difficult years of \nadolescence. Lower expectations and self esteem can later prevent them \nfrom achieving their maximum potential. This in turn can hinder their \nown personal and professional development. Therefore, adolescence is a \ncrucial time period for adults to intervene in the lives of young \ngirls. Adults need to take the time to show girls that they can set \nhigh goals and pursue their dreams. Today's events will offer \ninspiration and encouragement to millions of young girls--and show them \nthat adults are committed to helping them--so they can fully expand \ntheir horizons and pursue their dreams.\n  In 1995, women comprised 46 percent of the paid labor force. The \ncomposition of the work force has changed significantly, and \nopportunities have continued to increase for women. Despite these \ngains, women's wages, on average, still remain below men's. We cannot \naccept the gap that still exists between men and women. Even though the \ngap is narrowing--we must continue to work on this issue. Women still \nexperience barriers to non-traditional career roles. A study by the \nGlass Ceiling Commission found that women occupy only 5 percent of \nsenior level management of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 \nservice companies. Women only comprise 11 percent of the technical \nworkforce. This needs to change. America's future depends on it. Women \nneed to be encouraged to seize opportunities and explore non-\ntraditional careers. This includes developing skills that will prepare \nthem for high wage jobs and management positions that offer higher \nsalaries in the workforce.\n  Women are increasingly becoming responsible for the financial well-\nbeing of their families. We need to ensure that young girls are \nprepared for the workforce--and have the opportunity to live up to \ntheir full potential. We can only do this if we have a community \neffort. Today, more than ever--young girls need role models and \nmentors--so that they can achieve success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3695-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF SERVICE BY MAYOR SMIGLEY\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, today, April 24th, marks the \n82nd anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian Genocide. I rise \ntoday to acknowledge and commemorate this terrible chapter in history, \nto help ensure that it will never be forgotten.\n  Eighty-two years ago today, one of the darkest chapters in human \nhistory began. On April 24, 1915, Ottoman authorities began arresting \nArmenian political and religious leaders throughout Anatolia. Over the \nensuing months and years, some 1.5 million Armenians were killed at the \nhands of the Ottoman authorities, and hundreds of thousands more were \nexiled from their homes.\n  On this 82nd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, let us renew our \ncommitment never to forget the horror and barbarism of this event.\n  We must remember, we must speak out, and we must teach the next \ngeneration about the systematic persecution and murder of millions of \nArmenians by the Ottoman government. I know that I am joined by every \none of my colleagues, by the Armenian-American community, and by people \nacross the United States in commemorating the Genocide and paying \ntribute to the victims of this crime against humanity.\n  As Americans, we are blessed with freedom and security, but that \nblessing brings with it an important responsibility. We must never \nallow oppression and persecution to pass without notice or \ncondemnation.\n  By commemorating the Armenian Genocide, we renew our commitment \nalways to fight for human dignity and freedom, and we send out a \nmessage that the world can never allow genocide to be perpetrated \nagain.\n  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the \nliving. Out of the ashes of their history, Armenians all across the \nworld have clung to their identity and have prospered in new \ncommunities. My state of California is fortunate to be home to a \ncommunity of Armenian-Americans a half-a-million strong. They are a \nstrong and vibrant community whose members participate in every aspect \nof civic life, and California is the richer for their presence.\n  The strength and perseverance of the Armenian people is a triumph of \nthe human spirit, which refuses to cede victory to evil. The best \nretort to the perpetrators of oppression and destruction is rebirth, \nrenewal, and rebuilding. Armenians throughout the world have done just \nthat, and today they do it in their homeland as well. A free and \nindependent Armenia stands today as a living monument to the resilience \nof a people. I am proud that the United States, through our friendship \nand assistance, is contributing to the rebuilding and renewal of \nArmenia.\n  Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian Genocide; let their \ndeaths not be in vain. We must remember their tragedy to ensure that \nsuch crimes can never be repeated. And as we remember Armenia's dark \npast, we can take some consolation in the knowledge that its future is \nbright with possibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3695-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3695-S3696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 82ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \ncommemorating the 82nd anniversary of the Armenian genocide, the first \nsuch tragedy to occur in the twentieth century. Today, as we renew our \ncommitment to the rights and freedoms of all humanity, we also \ncelebrate the reemergence of an independent Armenia.\n  It is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of the Armenian people \nthat, after centuries of oppression, they have persevered and re-\nestablished a free\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nand independent nation--a nation as determined as its citizens. In its \nshort existence, the Republic of Armenia has survived the earthquake of \n1988, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and a blockade by its \nneighbors. Truly, the spirit of the nation reflects the spirit of its \npeople.\n  Despite these hardships, the young republic has made economic \nprogress. As the first of the former Soviet republics to record \neconomic growth, Armenia has kept inflation under control and made \ngreat advances toward privatization. Now, it is incumbent upon nations \nlike the United States to continue our policy of engagement and \nassistance, as Armenia continues its efforts toward establishing a \ndemocratic society.\n  The United States has also benefitted from a strong Armenian \npresence. With their firm resolve and dedication to democracy, the more \nthan one million Armenian Americans have made significant contributions \nto the cultural, political and economic life of this nation. At the \nsame time, by preserving their Armenian faith and traditions, they have \nachieved a balance that enriches our diverse and vital American \nculture.\n  The tragic events of 1915-1923 contain in them some important moral \nlessons. We now realize that a quick and decisive response by the \ninternational community might have prevented the persecution and death \nof more than 1.5 million Armenians. Unfortunately, the world's \nindifference to their plight not only sealed the futures of the \nArmenian victims, but paved the way for similar tragedies in the years \nthat followed.\n  It is imperative, Mr. President, that no nation or individual ever \nforgets the injustices suffered by the Armenians in 1915. Only by \nstriving for human rights and civil liberties for all people can the \npromises of human dignity be achieved. In that regard, the highest \nhonor we can accord the heroic Armenian people is to continue the \nstruggle for freedom wherever we are, be it America, Armenia, or \nanywhere else across the globe. By pursuing that mission, hopefully we \ncan prevent such tragedies from happening again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3695-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to observe the 82d \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide. It is only by keeping the memory \nof this dark time alive will we keep it from occurring again.\n  On April 24, 1915, over 200 Armenian religious, political and \nintellectual leaders were arrested in Constantinople--now Istanbul--and \nkilled, marking the beginning of an organized campaign to eliminate the \nArmenian presence from the Ottoman Empire.\n  Thousands of Armenians were subjected to torture, deportation, \nslavery and ultimately, murder. In the 8 years between 1915 and 1923, \nroughly 1.5 million men, women and children lost their lives to this \ngenocide. More than 500,000 were removed from their homeland, many of \nwhom perished in forced marches ending in the deserts of Syria.\n  The Armenians were able to gain their freedom for a short time in \n1918, but in 1920, when the former Soviet Union joined the Turkish \nattack, they were again overpowered. It was only in 1991, following the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union, that the new Republic of Armenia was born. \nToday, we pay tribute to the courage and strength of a people who would \nnot know defeat.\n  Yet, independence has not meant an end to their struggle. There are \nstill those who question the reality of the Armenian slaughter. There \nare those who have failed to recognize its very existence. But we must \nnot allow the horror of the Armenian genocide to be either diminished \nor denied.\n  The pages of history are replete with stories of the atrocities man \ncommits against his fellow man. And upon those pages, this massacre is \none of the most vile stains. We must learn the lessons of the past \nwell, and never tire of the fight to end prejudice and discrimination. \nWe must show the world the Armenian people did not suffer in \nvain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3696-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN VICTIMS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n82d anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Today we remember the \nArmenians who died during the years 1915 to 1923 at the hands of the \nOttoman Empire.\n  From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Turkish government systematically \nmurdered 1.5 million Armenians and drove half a million into exile. On \nthe eve of the first World War, 2.5 million Armenians lived in the \nOttoman Empire. Following the brutal Ottoman Turkish campaign, less \nthan 100,000 remained. These Armenians were victims of a policy \nexplicitly intended to isolate, exile, and even extinguish the Armenian \npopulation.\n  As we look at world events today--in Bosnia, in Rwanda, and \nelsewhere--we see a repetition of what happened in Armenia. In \ncommemorating this day, we remember those who died, and condemn \nviolations of human rights at anytime in the past or the future. We all \nknow that, in the context of world politics, human rights violations \nare far too common and the response to those violations is often tame \nat best.\n  As we meet here today, it is likely that somewhere, a political \nprisoner is being beaten by the police or armed forces, or by some \nparamilitary group whose members might include police officers or \nsoldiers. It is likely that a union organizer is being detained or \nharassed by authorities, that a woman is being raped by government \nthugs, that a newspaper is being shut down, or that a prisoner has \n``disappeared.'' It is equally likely that the people responsible for \nsuch outrages will never be held accountable.\n  As Americans we must keep a vigilant watch on our world so that the \nhorrors that occurred in Armenia 82 years ago might not be repeated \nagain, and again, and again. History means nothing if we do not learn \nfrom it. On a day like today, we must remember what we stand for, and \nensure that the U.S. continues to be a beacon of strength and hope for \nthe heroes that stand up and survive such atrocities. These deaths \nshould not be in vain.\n  I am proud to commemorate this important occasion today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3696-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3696-S3697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 82d \nanniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  In the 1930's, someone questioned Adolph Hitler about the possible \nconsequences of his plan for the systematic elimination of the Jews. \nHitler seemed to believe that there would be none. He allegedly \nresponded, ``Who, after all, today remembers the Armenians?''\n  One of my constituents, Noyemzar Alexanian, remembers. On a spring \nmorning in 1915, when she was 6 years old, the Kurdish calvary \nsurrounded her village. They rounded up all the men and teen-aged boys, \ntied their hands with rope, took them to a distant field and stabbed \nthem to death. Her father escaped to a neighboring village but was soon \ndiscovered. Noyemzar says she remembers her father being led away while \nher mother cried for help. This little 6-year-old girl then ``watched \nthe white shirt of her father as he was led up a mountainside by the \nsoldiers. The white shirt became a dot, and then it was gone.'' \nNoyemzar's father was stabbed to death. Over the next few years, as she \nwas shuttled from the houses of strangers to orphanages, Noyemzar lost \nher two sisters. But still she did not lose hope. After several years, \nshe and the remaining members of her family escaped to Cuba. She later \nsettled in Rhode Island with her husband, Krikor, another refugee from \nArmenia. Noyemzar Alenanian is now 88 years old, and every day she \nremembers.\n  Mr. President, old and young around the world today remember the \nArmenian holocaust. We remember that on this date in 1915, the Ottoman \nEmpire and the successor Turkish nationalist regime began a brutal \npolicy of deportation and murder. Over the next 8 years 1.5 million \nArmenians would be massacred at the hands of the Turks and another \n500,000 would have their property confiscated and be driven from their \nhomeland. Engrossed in its own problems at the time, the world did \nlittle as the population was devastated.\n  Despite having already undergone such terrible persecution and \nhardship, the people of the Armenian Republic\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\nstill suffer today. The peace talks recently concluded in Moscow \nregrettably made no progress toward the resolution of the Karabagh \nconflict. Turkey continues to blockade humanitarian aid to Armenia.\n  However, the Armenian people look hopefully to the future. Their \nquest for peace and democracy continues to inspire people around the \nworld. Armenians who have emigrated to other countries, especially \nthose in my home State of Rhode Island, bring their traditions with \nthem. They enrich the culture and contribute much to the society of \ntheir new homelands.\n  The continuing reports of the recent atrocities committed in Bosnia \nreaffirm the importance of our commitment to always remember the \nArmenian genocide. As long as hate and intolerance are a part of our \nworld, we must be vigilant. We must stand as witnesses to protect \npeople from persecution for the simple reason that they are different.\n  I hope to visit Armenia in the near future. I wish to see the \ntreasures of that land firsthand and pay tribute to the indomitable \nspirit of the people of Armenia. Until that time, I want to ensure the \nArmenian community that we remember.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \ntomorrow from 9:30 in the morning until 11:30, the Senate will be in a \nperiod of morning business to accommodate a number of Senators wishing \nto speak.\n  At 11:30, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 562, the reverse \nmortgage bill. Under the agreement, there will be 1 hour for debate on \nthat bill. However it is our understanding that no Senator will request \na rollcall on passage, therefore, with that in mind, Senators should \nnot expect rollcall votes to occur during Friday's session of the \nSenate.\n  On Monday, April 28, the Senate will debate the motion to proceed to \nS. 543, regarding protections to volunteers. A cloture motion will be \nfiled tomorrow on this issue, which will call for a cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 543 on Tuesday of next week. Therefore, the \nnext rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday, April 29, at 2:15 p.m. If \ncloture is invoked on Tuesday, it is expected that the Senate will \nproceed to the bill on Tuesday. Therefore, additional votes can be \nexpected to occur on Tuesday on amendments to the volunteer protection \nbill.\n  The Senate could also be asked to turn to any other Legislative or \nExecutive Calendar items that may be cleared for action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/24/senate-section/article/S3697-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
