Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof S. 25, the pending campaign finance reform bill. As announced last \nweek, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. Senators \nwho desire to speak with regard to the pending amendment or bill are \nencouraged to do so during today's session. We should be able to get 5 \nhours or so of debate in today if the Senators are willing to speak.\n  I also remind my colleagues that a cloture vote is scheduled on the \npending amendment regarding paycheck protection at 2:15 tomorrow. Also, \nunder the provisions of rule XXII, Members have until the hour of 1:30 \ntoday in order to file timely amendments to S. 25. In addition to the \ncloture vote on the pending amendment, a cloture vote may occur on \nTuesday on the underlying campaign finance reform bill.\n  On Friday, a cloture motion was also filed on the Mack-Graham \namendment on immigration to the D.C. appropriations bill. So it may be \nnecessary to have a cloture vote during Tuesday's session on that also \nif an agreement is not reached. The Senators are working together. I \nhave spoken with them and I am still hopeful that an agreement can be \nworked out.\n  There are some other pending amendments on the D.C. appropriations \nbill, but we think maybe we will be able to reach a conclusion on those \nif we can get the immigration amendment by Senator Mack worked out. \nTherefore, it is possible that we could complete action on the D.C. \nappropriations bill tomorrow.\n  This week, the Senate will also be considering other available \nappropriations conference reports. I talked to the chairman, Senator \nStevens, on Friday. We think maybe there could be as many as three that \nwould be ready in the next couple of days that we can bring up for \nconsideration. We intend, also, to begin consideration of the ISTEA \ntransportation infrastructure legislation, and we hope to be able to go \nto that on Wednesday or Thursday and spend the remainder of the week, \nexcept for interruptions for votes on the conference reports, on that.\n  I believe we will be in session on Friday and will probably have \nvotes up until around noon. But we will get more information on that as \nthe day progresses.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10339-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have to applaud the opponents of campaign \nfinance reform. They have done a great job. They set out to confuse and \ndistract from the real issue of campaign reform, and they have \nsucceeded. They have diverted attention from the fact that raising \nmoney becomes one of the essential items and activities of those of us \nwho serve in Congress just to remain competitive. They have done this \nby focusing on extraneous matters like who made phone calls, where did \nthey make them from?\n  We have not focused, as we should, on the continued increased cost of \nthe media in campaigns. Consultants have become more controlling. Self-\nfinancing has become the norm. Opponents, Mr. President, of real \ncampaign finance reform are focused on anything to divert attention \nfrom the fact that campaigns are very expensive and too long. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee hearing has clearly shown, at least in \nthis Senator's opinion, that both parties need more constraints, more \ncontrols, and more attention.\n  We must bring attention back to what the real issues are in campaign \nfinance--that is, the fact that Senators and Representatives spend \nlarge amounts of their time and their efforts simply raising money in \norder to pay for escalating media costs. As I have said, we have the \nnever-ending, it seems, self-financing of candidates. Take a small \nState like the State of Nevada or one like the Presiding Officer's \nState of Arizona, $4 million, which has a relatively small campaign \nfund in this modern era, sadly. To raise that much money, you have to \nraise about $13,000 or $14,000 a week every year. You don't take a week \noff for Christmas. If you do, you have to raise more money. If you do \nthat 52 weeks a year for 6 years, you can raise enough to be \ncompetitive in a race; you will raise about $4 million. As we know, in \nsome States it takes a lot more money. In those States, you have to \nraise twice that much or three times or four times that much. Instead \nof raising $13,000 or $14,000 a week, people have to raise $50,000 a \nweek. That is what we should be focusing on, Mr. President--the fact \nthat these campaigns are very expensive.\n  Eleven years ago, I came to the Senate floor and talked about this \ncampaign I had been through, a campaign where corporate money was used. \nComplaints had been filed with the Federal Election Commission. It is \n11 years now, and a number of those complaints have still never been \ndisposed of by the Federal Election Commission. They are still pending. \nI thought to myself, I can't believe there would be another election \nwith the same rules in effect. We haven't had one election since then; \nwe have had six since then where the same rules applied to Members of \nCongress. I, personally, will begin my third campaign using these same \nrules. In fact, I have to say they are not identical rules; they are \nworse, because in the early part of this century Congress decided it \nwasn't appropriate to have corporate money used in campaigns. The \nSupreme Court came back last year and said, oh, well, you can use \ncorporate money in campaigns. State parties can virtually use the money \nany way they want. So corporate money is now back into elections for \nthe first time in 85 or 90 years. Now corporate money is important.\n\n  I guess we have to be satisfied that there is a debate. I extend my \nappreciation to the majority leader for allowing this debate to take \nplace; a debate about campaign financing. I have to say, though, Mr. \nPresident, that we started out saying, well, McCain-Feingold doesn't do \nit all, but it is not a bad bill. That is why I joined as a sponsor of \nthat legislation. But now we are here before the Senate, the original \nMcCain-Feingold is long gone, and we are now talking about a mini \nMcCain-Feingold, which we are now happy that we have, that even though \nthe original bill was lacking in many elements, now we are \ncongratulating ourselves for going with a slimmed-down version of \nMcCain-Feingold, which we probably won't get a chance to vote on \nbecause of all the extracurricular, extraneous matters being debated in \nthis.\n  This watered-down version, I hope, can be passed. But because \nopponents of campaign finance reform have taken it upon themselves to \nexpand a Supreme Court decision, the Beck case, I am not sure we are \ngoing to be able to. I have come to the floor today to remind my \ncolleagues that we are not debating campaign finance reform to find out \nif the President had made phone calls from an inappropriate place or \nwhether he should have gone to his home. Think about that; he could not \ndo that because that is on Federal property. Maybe he should have taken \nSecret Service agents with him and found a pay phone to make those \ncalls.\n  The fact is, we should be debating that campaigns take too much time \nand campaigns are far too long and take too much money. Since 1992, we \nhave had a $900 million election cycle. In 1996, there was a 70-percent \nincrease, in just those 4 years. In the last 20 years, congressional \nraces have increased their spending by some 700 percent. Both political \nparties, Democrats and Republicans, know that the cost of campaigns is \nthe problem. So I think we should bring back the focus on the real \nissue of campaign finance reform, which is that there is too much money \nbeing spent and campaigns are too long.\n  I see my friend from Kentucky on the floor. I have to say to him that \nI appreciate his honesty in this campaign debate. From the very first \ntime that he took this as a campaign issue, he hasn't minced any words. \nHe has said basically that he is opposed to it. We have a lot of \npeople, Mr. President, who don't have the--I won't say courage, but \nthat is a decent word--ability to get up and call things the way he \nsees them. I disagree with my friend from Kentucky, but he is willing \nto debate the issues as they stand. He has been willing to do this from \nthe first time it was brought up when Senator Byrd was majority leader \nand when Senator Mitchell was majority leader. He doesn't hide how he \nfeels about campaign finance reform. I appreciate his approach. Many \npeople are hiding between the nuances of campaign finance reform and \nside issues. I say to my friend from Kentucky that I appreciate his \napproach. He says he is against campaign finance reform, and he has \nnever hidden that fact; he has spoken out openly and has been very \ncandid about it. I appreciate his approach to it.\n  I do say, however, that I wish that there were others like my friend \nfrom Kentucky who would stand up and debate the issue. McCain-Feingold, \nfor example, let's debate it, and if there are enough votes to pass it, \nfine. If not, let's go on to another issue. We don't need filibusters \non either side. We need to debate whether or not we need campaign \nfinance reform. We need to go forward.\n  I personally believe that campaigns, I repeat, are too long, too \ncostly, and we owe an obligation to the American public to do something \nabout that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this would be a good time, in the \nbeginning of the debate, to thank my colleague from Nevada for his kind \nwords. I appreciate that very much. Also, Mr. President, I would like \nto insert a number of things into the Record with some explanation, \njust to make the Record complete, before we go to further debate later \nthis afternoon. There are a number of Senators on my side of this issue \nwho want to speak, and they will be coming over at various times during \nthe course of the afternoon's debate.\n  First, Mr. President, I would like to submit a sampling of the \nopinion pieces I have authored in the past year. One is from January of \nthis year, published by the Washington Times, in which I had a \npremonition that President Clinton, as his own campaign finance scandal \ndeepened, would become campaign finance reform's No. 1 fan. Frankly, \nit's not that I am particularly clairvoyant, but rather that they are \nso predictable.\n  As the Clinton administration and the Democratic National Committee \nhave sunk in a scandalous quicksand of their own making, the more they \npublicly thrashed around groping for a campaign finance bill as if it \nwere a life preserver. Unfortunately for America, the President and \nVice President Gore seek to save themselves from their own embarrassing \nmalfeasance in raising money from foreigners and the\n\n[[Page S10341]]\n\nother episodes which have been so much in the newspapers. They want to \nsave themselves at the expense of core constitutional freedoms for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article I wrote for \nthe Washington Times be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 30, 1997]\n\n                       Keep Campaign Reform Legal\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       ``Offense is the best defense'' is a cliche and a \n     frequently employed political tactic. Diversion, skillfully \n     applied, also can have great utility in politics. President \n     Clinton is hoping both work for him in deflecting attention \n     from the waves of campaign finance scandals lapping up on the \n     White House lawn. That is why Mr. Clinton strives to become \n     campaign finance reform's No. 1 fan.\n       Mr. Clinton's newfound zeal for campaign finance reform is \n     transparent and dangerous. The McCain-Feingold bill around \n     which he belatedly rallies is a convenient fig leaf. It is \n     also a tremendous threat to political freedom, as it would \n     restrict political speech and participation. The president's \n     party hopes it will prevent collateral damage arising from \n     the latest Clinton scandals. They contend, wrongly, that the \n     campaign finance shenanigans making today's headlines merely \n     illustrate a systemic problem solvable only through \n     comprehensive ``reform.'' Never mind that the foreign \n     contributions and contribution-laundering reportedly done on \n     behalf of the Clinton reelection campaign are illegal, under \n     current law.\n       Mr. Clinton's ``reform'' agenda, while a clever \n     diversionary tactic, is unconstitutional. It is that element \n     which should disturb us most of all.\n       The Constitution's First Amendment is America's premier \n     political reform. It should be the touchstone for campaign \n     finance reform. But the McCain-Feingold bill and the \n     president instead treat it as an impediment to be undermined, \n     circumvented, even diminished. The McCain-Feingold bill, with \n     its coerced campaign spending limits and restrictions on \n     independent speech, is a square peg reformers try in vain to \n     pound into the First Amendment's round hole. In tacit \n     recognition of this, the Democrats' House and Senate leaders \n     recently endorsed a constitutional amendment to narrow the \n     First Amendment so that the unconstitutional (the McCain-\n     Feingold bill) could, thus, become constitutional. Audacious, \n     to say the least.\n       The Supreme Court has for years ruled, in no uncertain \n     terms, that campaign spending is protected by the First \n     Amendment because communication with voters costs money. \n     Hence, spending limits are speech limits which Congress \n     cannot constitutionally mandate. Congress must also tread \n     lightly on the ability of private citizens and groups to \n     participate in campaigns and affect elections via independent \n     expenditures.\n       Regrettably, while striking down mandatory spending limits, \n     the court ruled two decades ago that the government could pay \n     candidates large sums from the U.S. Treasury in exchange for \n     candidates' agreeing to forgo their First Amendment right to \n     unlimited spending (i.e., speech). However, the spending \n     limit system must be purely voluntary. That is the state of \n     play in the billion-dollar presidential campaign finance \n     system, where every major candidate except John Connally and \n     the circa-1992 Ross Perot (in 1996, Perot's campaign received \n     $30 million from the taxpayers) has opted into the taxpayer-\n     financed spending limits program. Have the tax dollars \n     limited spending or so-called ``special interests''? No. Like \n     a rock on Jello, the spending limits merely redirect the \n     spending into other, unlimited, channels--including party and \n     labor ``soft'' money. Spending limits promote subterfuge, \n     which the 1996 Clinton reelection campaign may have taken to \n     new lows (or highs, depending on your perspective).\n       Just as it seized upon the Keating Five scandal seven year \n     ago, so does Washington's reform industry now exploit the \n     emerging Clinton campaign finance scandal. The media-anointed \n     reformers seek to complete a job they started 20 years ago--\n     that is, to put (via the McCain-Feingold bill) the \n     discredited presidential model of spending limits on \n     congressional campaigns. It is an absurd proposition, but \n     reform groups and politicians reap gains--including fawning \n     editorials--from the battle. They are adept at massaging the \n     press with snappy soundbites and voluminous ``studies'' to \n     build a case for creating a bureaucratic regulatory regime of \n     extraordinary proportion to micromanage and ration the speech \n     of candidates and millions of private citizens. Why? Because, \n     they contend that: 1) campaigns spend too much; 2) \n     ``legalized bribery'' is rampant; and 3) special interests \n     influence is pervasive.\n       The truth is, Americans spend far more on yogurt than \n     political campaigns, bribery is illegal and the U.S. always \n     has been and will be a teeming cauldron of ``special \n     interests.'' It is government that is pervasive. It is little \n     wonder that virtually every American has a host of \n     ``special'' interests in their government.\n       In his State of the Union speech, Mr. Clinton will call for \n     campaign finance reform, specifically, the McCain-Feingold \n     bill. He may be so audacious as to bemoan ``special \n     interest'' influence, leaving unspoken his own culpability in \n     rewarding contributors with White House access and nights in \n     the Lincoln bedroom. It will take great restraint on the part \n     of Congress and the country not to hoot and howl during this \n     brazenly hypocritical call for systemic reform.\n       President Clinton can do much to restore confidence in the \n     political process by cleaning up his own act. That is why on \n     the subject of campaign finance I have two words of advice \n     for the president: Reform yourself.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed \nof mine which appeared in the Boston Globe in a somewhat altered form \non Sunday, September 7, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       As with a Rorschach test, different people can view the \n     same campaign finance data and come away with wildly \n     divergent conclusions. Supporters of the McCain-Feingold \n     campaign finance ``reform'' scheme look upon the record \n     spending in the 1996 election cycle and profess to be \n     horrified--hysterically seeing malevolent ``special'' \n     interests at every turn, poised to plunder our democracy. I \n     look upon that same election as the culmination of a fierce, \n     and healthy, philosophical battle over how best to ensure a \n     prosperous future for our nation.\n       Where I see a vibrant democracy-in-action, the ``reform'' \n     agitators see chaos crying out for a big government remedy. \n     In the 1996 election cycle, the liberal status quo came \n     roaring back from the 1994 elections in which they had been \n     so profoundly rejected. The conservative insurgents of 1994 \n     responded in-kind, fighting to prevail in the 1996 elections \n     with their recently acquired power intact, and the addition \n     of a Republican-held White House. With Democrats desperate to \n     regain control of Congress, Republicans having (after four \n     memorable decades in minority exile) savored majority status, \n     and momentous decisions to be made about the role of \n     government in our society, you may be assured that the next \n     few elections will be similarly boisterous. This political \n     energy should be applauded, not condemned, and certainly not \n     reformed away.\n       McCain-Feingold proponents have long believed that there is \n     ``too much'' campaign spending, a notion that finds, at first \n     blush, a receptive audience in cynical times. What makes the \n     task of limiting spending so daunting for the reformers and \n     so dangerous for our nation is that, as the Supreme Court has \n     repeatedly ruled, in political campaigns spending limits \n     function as speech limits of the most undemocratic and \n     nefarious sort. Ergo, what the campaign finance reform debate \n     is really about are First Amendment freedoms of speech, \n     association and the right to petition the government. In our \n     modern society, exercising these freedoms is an expensive \n     endeavor. That is why McCain-Feingold's convoluted provisions \n     to limit the speech of private citizens, groups, candidates \n     and parties would surely be struck down as unconstitutional.\n       The Supreme Court has emphatically rejected the goals of \n     McCain-Feingold's proponents. On whether government can \n     intervene to limit spending, the court has said: ``The First \n     Amendment denies government the power to determine that \n     spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, \n     excessive or unwise.'' As to the reformer contention that \n     campaign spending breeds corruption, the Court held that \n     there is ``nothing invidious, improper or unhealthy'' in \n     campaigns spending money to communicate. And on the \n     reformers' appealing argument that McCain-Feingold would help \n     ``level the playing field,'' the Court is contemptuous: ``. . \n     . the concept that government may restrict the speech of some \n     elements of our society in order to enhance the relative \n     voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.''\n       In addition to failing the constitutional test, McCain-\n     Feingold cannot, as a practical matter, achieve its stated \n     aims. Level the playing field? What is a famous family name \n     worth? What is the value of incumbency? Spending limits do \n     not take such non-monetary factors into account. Reduce \n     ``special'' interest influence? The reformers cannot even \n     define ``special'' interests (the truth is everyone has \n     ``special'' interests), let alone shoo them out of a \n     democracy. Banish ``legalized bribery?'' That is an oxymoron. \n     Bribery is illegal, period. Restore confidence in government? \n     That is a tall order for any ``reform'' and unlikely to be \n     achieved by a measure such as McCain-Feingold which would \n     necessitate a huge bureaucracy to regulate the political \n     speech of private citizens, groups, parties and thousands of \n     candidates in every election.\n       To illustrate the absurdity of the McCain-Feingold approach \n     to reform, consider its bizarre spending limit formula. For \n     Senate general elections, reformer nirvana is achieved by \n     limiting campaigns to spending an amount equal to: 30 cents \n     times the number of the state's voting-age citizens up to \n     four million, plus 25 cents times the number of voting-age \n     citizens over four million, plus $400,000. However, if you \n     are running in New Jersey, 80 cents and 70 cents are \n     substituted for 30 and 25. The formula notwithstanding, for \n     all states, regardless of population, the minimum general \n     election limit would be $950,000 and the maximum, $5,500,000. \n     The primary election limit is set at 67 percent of the\n\n[[Page S10342]]\n\n     general and runoffs are limited to 20 percent. In the \n     unlikely event this atrocity was deemed constitutional, it \n     would be a mess to administrate, a nightmare to comply with, \n     and a blight on the Republic.\n       To propel their effort to have the government ration \n     political speech, McCain-Feingold proponents have seized upon \n     the White House-Democratic National Committee campaign \n     finance scandal which centers on violations of existing law. \n     They exploit legitimate outrage over illegal foreign \n     contributions in order to restrict political speech and \n     participation by American citizens. It is a brazen and \n     despicable strategy.\n       Curiously, those most associated with the First Amendment--\n     the news media--display a callous disregard for the political \n     freedom of private citizens, groups, candidates and parties \n     in McCain-Feingold's cross hairs. Newspapers spew forth reams \n     of editorials endorsing McCain-Feingold. Television's talking \n     heads pontificate on the dire need to limit the political \n     speech of non-media political participants. Why is the media \n     an eager accomplice in advancing this unconstitutional and \n     undemocratic ``reform'' agenda? One might reasonably conclude \n     that media poobahs see an opportunity to fill the void left \n     when the political speech of every other player in the \n     political process is limited by McCain-Feingold. Newspaper \n     editorials and articles, not to mention television, exert \n     tremendous influence on elections. Most media outlets are \n     subsidiaries of corporate conglomerates (i.e. ``special'' \n     interests), yet they would not be limited by McCain-Feingold. \n     On this one point alone is McCain-Feingold sensitive to the \n     First Amendment.\n       That there is no media conspiracy to snuff out competitors \n     in the political sphere makes this confluence of support for \n     a legislative assault on their core First Amendment freedom \n     no less lamentable. Those in the media should consider that \n     they are but one ``loophole'' away--a special exemption under \n     the Federal Election Campaign Act--from having their product \n     regulated by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Assuming, \n     of course, that the Courts did not intervene. Perhaps some \n     experience with the FEC speech police would sensitize \n     editorial writers, reporters and TV talking heads to the \n     insidious effects of regulating election-related speech.\n       The Supreme Court astutely observed six decades ago that \n     First Amendment freedom of speech is the ``matrix, the \n     indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of \n     freedom.'' Recognizing this, an extraordinary alliance of \n     citizens groups has coalesced to oppose the McCain-Feingold \n     bill. Ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union and the \n     National Education Association on the left, to the Christian \n     Coalition, National Right to Life and the National Rifle \n     Association on the right, this coalition has little in common \n     except a determination to preserve these core political \n     freedoms for all Americans. In fighting the McCain-Feingold \n     juggernaut, they are doing America a great public service.\n       No one is arguing that the current campaign finance system \n     is ideal but like so many things in life, ``reform'' is in \n     the eye of the beholder. I believe the current scandal-ridden \n     presidential system of squandered taxpayer funding and \n     illusory spending limits should be repealed. Circa-1974 \n     contribution limits should be updated to make fundraising \n     less time-consuming for all candidates and less formidable \n     for challengers who usually do not have a large base of \n     contributors from which to draw support. All contributions \n     should be purely voluntary which is why union members' \n     compulsory dues should not be diverted to politicking. And \n     more citizens should be encouraged to participate in \n     campaigns through volunteer activities and financial \n     contributions to the candidates and causes of their choosing. \n     Campaign contributions are a laudable and honorable means of \n     participation in campaigns and so long as they are publicly \n     disclosed and continue to be scrutinized by the media, voters \n     can judge for themselves what is appropriate.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a piece I authored and which \nappeared in the National Review in its June 30 edition. This op-ed \nstarts out with the observation that proponents of spending limits are \nstuck between a rock and a hard place: The Constitution and reality.\n  It is my hope that some of the signatories to the Project \nIndependence petition drive will read this, and particularly paying \nattention to the McCain-Feingold bill's absurd spending limits \nformula--and refrain from signing such a misleading and shallow \ndocument in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             The Money Gag\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       Proponents of campaign-spending limits are stuck between a \n     rock and a hard place: the Constitution and reality.\n       It is impossible constitutionally to limit all campaign-\n     related spending. The Supreme Court has been quite clear on \n     this matter, most notably in the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo \n     decision: ``The First Amendment denies government the power \n     to determine that spending to promote one's political views \n     is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society \n     ordained by our Constitution it is not the government but the \n     people--individually as citizens and candidates and \n     collectively as associations and political committees--who \n     must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on \n     public issues in a political campaign.''\n       For those who do not at first blush see the link between \n     the First Amendment and campaign spending, the Court \n     elaborates: ``A restriction on the amount of money a person \n     or group can spend on political communication during a \n     campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by \n     restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of \n     their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This \n     is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in \n     today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.''\n       The reformers do not care or, in some cases, cannot accept \n     that spending limits limit speech. They believe that spending \n     limits are justified and necessary to alleviate perceived or \n     actual corruption. But the Court slapped that argument aside, \n     holding that there is ``nothing invidious, improper, or \n     unhealthy'' in campaigns spending money to communicate. The \n     reformers cannot that spending limits are essential because \n     campaign spending has increased dramatically in the past two \n     decades, a woefully lame premise the Court easily dispatched: \n     ``The mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns \n     in and of itself provides no basis for governmental \n     restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending.'' \n     Appealing to Americans' instinct for fairness, the reformers \n     passionately plead for spending limits to ``level'' the \n     political playing field. The Court was utterly contemptuous \n     of this ``level playing field'' argument. ``The concept that \n     government may restrict the speech of some elements of our \n     society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is \n     wholly foreign to the First Amendment.''\n       There you have it. The reformers cannot achieve their \n     objectives statutorily. To realize the reformers' campaign-\n     finance nirvana would require essentially repealing the First \n     Amendment--blowing a huge hole in the Bill of Rights--via a \n     constitutional amendment. Frightfully undemocratic? Yes. Out \n     of the question? No; 38 United States senators voted to do \n     just that on March 18, 1997. These 38 senators voted, in the \n     name of ``reform,';' for S.J. Res. 18, a constitutional \n     amendment to empower Congress and the states to limit \n     contributions and spending ``by, in support of, or in \n     opposition to, a candidate.'' Thus would the entire universe \n     of political speech and participation be subjected to \n     limitation by congressional edict, and enforcement by \n     government bureaucrats.\n       This wholesale repeal of core political freedom registered \n     barely a ripple in the nation's media. Perhaps reporters and \n     editorial writers do not appreciate that their campaign \n     coverage could be construed as spending ``by, in support of, \n     or in opposition to, a candidate'' and, therefore, could be \n     regulated under a Constitution so altered. It is not a \n     stretch. The television networks and most major newspapers \n     are owned by corporate conglomerates (a/k/a ``special \n     interests'' and the blurred distinction is already \n     acknowledged in federal campaign law, which currently exempts \n     from the definition of expenditure ``any news story, \n     commentary, or editorial'' unless distributed by a political \n     party, committee, or candidate.\n       I do not advocate regulating newspaper editorials, \n     articles, and headlines. I do not believe that government \n     should compensate candidates who are harmed by television \n     newscasts or biased anchors. However, the political playing \n     field can never be ``level'' without such regulation, and it \n     is the only area of political speech upon which the vaunted \n     McCain-Feingold bill is silent. McCain-Feingold has \n     provisions to enable candidates to counteract independent \n     expenditures by every ``special interest'' in America, except \n     the media industry. This ``loophole'' is the only one which \n     editorial writers are not advocating be closed by the \n     government.\n       Such regulation of the media may strike one as an absurd \n     result of the campaign-reform movement, but it is a logical \n     extrapolation of McCain-Feingold's regulatory regime. The \n     McCain-Feingold bill's spending-limit formula for candidates \n     is itself ludicrous. For Senate general elections: 30 cents \n     times the number of the state's voting-age citizens up to 4 \n     million, plus 25 cents times the number of voting-age \n     citizens over 4 million, plus $400,000. However, if you are \n     running in New Jersey, 80 cents and 70 cents are substituted \n     for 30 and 25 because of the dispersed media markets. \n     Moreover, the formula notwithstanding, for all states the \n     minimum general election limit is $950,000 and the maximum \n     $5,500,000. McCain-Feingold sets the primary-election limit \n     at 67 per cent of the general-election limit and the runoff \n     limit at 20 per cent of the general-election limit.\n       Reading the Clinton-endorsed McCain-Feingold bill, one can \n     only conclude that the era of big government is just \n     beginning. The Courts have repeatedly ruled that \n     communications which do not ``expressly advocate'' the \n     election or defeat of a candidate (using terms such as ``vote \n     for,'' ``defeat,'' ``elect'') cannot be regulated, yet \n     McCain-Feingold would have the Federal Election Commission \n     policing such ads if ``a reasonable person'' would \n     ``understand'' them to advocate election or defeat. Out of \n     260 million Americans,\n\n[[Page S10343]]\n\n     just which one is to be this ``reasonable person''?\n       The McCain-Feingold bill seeks to quiet the voices of \n     candidates, private citizens, groups, and parties. Why? \n     Because, it is said, ``too much'' is spent on American \n     elections. The so-called reformers chafe when I pose the \n     obvious question: ``Compared to what?''\n       In 1996--an extraordinarily high-stakes, competitive \n     election in which there was a fierce ideological battle over \n     the future of the world's only superpower--$3.89 per eligible \n     voter was spent on congressional elections. May I be so bold \n     as to suggest that spending on congressional elections the \n     equivalent of a McDonald's ``extra value'' meal and a small \n     milkshake is not ``too much?''\n       The reformers are not dissuaded by facts. Their agenda is \n     not advanced by reason. It is propelled by the media, some \n     politicians, and the recent infusion of millions of dollars \n     in foundation grants to ``reform'' groups. Fortunately, the \n     majority of this Congress is not ideologically predisposed \n     toward the undemocratic, unconstitutional, bureaucratic \n     finance scheme embodied in McCain-Feingold. Further, a \n     powerful and diverse coalition has coalesced to protect \n     American freedom from the McCain-Feingold juggernaut.\n       Ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union and the \n     National Education Association on the left to the Christian \n     Coalition, the National Right to Life Committee, and the \n     National Rifle Association on the right, the individual \n     members of the coalition agree on little except the need for \n     the freedom to participate in American politics. There is \n     perhaps no better illustration of the Supreme Court's \n     observation in 1937 that freedom of speech ``is the matrix, \n     the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of \n     freedom.'' These groups understand that the First Amendment \n     is America's greatest political reform.\n       Where do we go from here? After ten years of fighting and \n     filibustering against assaults on the First Amendment \n     advanced under the guise of ``reform,'' I am heartened by the \n     honest debate in this Congress. In the House of \n     Representatives, John T. Doolittle's bold proposal to repeal \n     government-prescribed contribution limits and the taxpayer-\n     financed system of (illusory) presidential spending limits \n     has more co-sponsors than McCain-Feingold's companion bill, \n     the Shays-Meehan speech-rationing scheme. In the Senate, \n     McCain-Feingold's fortunes cling pathetically to the specter \n     that the Government Affairs investigation into the Clinton \n     campaign-finance scandal will fuel public pressure for \n     reform.\n       My goal is to redefine ``reform,'' to move the debate away \n     from arbitrary limits and toward expanded citizen \n     participation, electoral competition, and political \n     discourse. McCain-Feingold is a failed approach to campaign \n     finance that has proved a disaster in the presidential \n     system. McCain-Feingold would paper over the fatal flaws in \n     the presidential spending-limit system and extend the \n     disaster to congressional elections. Experience argues for \n     scuttling it entirely.\n       The best way to diminish the influence of any particular \n     ``special interest'' is to dilute its impact through the \n     infusion of new donors contributing more money to campaigns \n     and political parties. Those who get off the sidelines and \n     contribute their own money to the candidates and parties of \n     their choice should be lauded, not demonized. The increased \n     campaign spending of the past few elections should be hailed \n     as evidence of a vibrant democracy, not reviled as a \n     ``problem'' needing to be cured.\n       My prescription for reform includes contribution limits \n     adjusted, at the least, for inflation.\n       The $1,000 individual limit was set in 1974, when a new \n     Ford Mustang cost just $2,700. The political parties should \n     be strengthened, the present constraints on what they can do \n     for their nominees, repealed. These would be steps in the \n     right direction.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is also an op-ed which I did for \nUSA Today--a publication whose word limits force you to distill your \narguments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Beware So-Called Fixes\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       The First Amendment of the Constitution is America's \n     premier political reform. To reformers, it's a ``loophole.'' \n     The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that because \n     communication with voters costs money, campaign spending is \n     protected by the First Amendment and cannot be rationed by \n     the government. That does not stop the so-called reformers \n     from trying.\n       The presidential system of campaign finance is the monument \n     to reform excess. Thanks to the Democratic National \n     Committee's apparent penchant for illegal foreign \n     contributions, it is also scandal-ridden. A post-Watergate \n     ``reform,'' the presidential system gives candidates tax \n     dollars for which, in exchange, they agree to campaign \n     spending limits. But like a rock placed on Jello, the \n     spending limits merely shift the money into other channels--\n     notably party and union ``soft'' money.\n       Political parties, unions and newspapers have a \n     constitutional right to spend as much as they choose to \n     affect elections. Some newspapers want to neuter the \n     political parties under the guise of ``reform.'' The parties \n     are vital components of the electoral process, the only \n     entities that will consistently support challengers--of all \n     ideological stripes. Their only litmus test is party \n     affiliation. They do not have a vote in Congress. They are a \n     buffer between so-called ``special interests'' and \n     government.\n       The presidential system of taxpayer-funded spending limits \n     is a disaster that should be repealed. But so-called \n     reformers instead want to extend that debacle to \n     congressional elections and exploit the Democrats' scandal to \n     justify eviscerating the political parties.\n       Rather than admit spending limits have failed, the \n     reformers want to add even more layers of bureaucracy to \n     police American political speech and participation by \n     candidates, political parties, private citizens and groups. \n     Why? The reformers say ``too much'' is spent on elections. \n     Americans spend more on yogurt. The reformers bemoan \n     ``legalized bribery,'' an oxymoron. Bribery is illegal, \n     period. They say special-interest influence is pervasive. Yet \n     they cannot define ``special interest.''\n       Disclosure--not arbitrary, bureaucratic limits--should be \n     the linchpin of reform. Voters can decide for themselves what \n     is appropriate. Taxpayers should not be called upon to fund a \n     campaign-finance scheme in which the First Amendment is \n     regarded as a ``loophole,'' and so long as America is a \n     democracy, the spending limits can never be more than a \n     facade.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, further, I submit for the Record four \nilluminating documents from the American Civil Liberties Union. Say \nwhat you will about this organization--one that Members on my side, \nincluding me, are infrequently aligned with--they take some gutsy \npositions. It is tough for a liberal group--a label usually given to \nthe ACLU--to go against the liberal grain, particularly on an issue \nthis high-profile, as this one which we are debating today.\n  Particularly, Mr. President, I want to single out Laura Murphy, \ndirector of the ACLU's Washington office, and no doubt others in that \norganization, have taken a lot of grief for their brave and resolute \nposition in defense of political freedom for all Americans--liberals, \nconservatives, and every ideological shade in between. I cannot say \nenough good things about the work that Laura, Joel Gora, Ira Glasser, \nand other folks in the ACLU have done on this issue. Their effort \nagainst McCain-Feingold has been truly heroic. Two-hundred and sixty \nmillion American beneficiaries of the first amendment owe these people \na debt of thanks.\n  With a few notable and admirable exceptions, I have been sorely \ndisappointed by the willingness of liberal groups to walk off a cliff \nfor this blatantly unconstitutional reform effort. I'm told some have \nmade the calculated decision that if the McCain-Feingold bill passed, \nliberal causes would benefit.\n  I think they are right on that score but it is shameful that so many \nwould eagerly jettison 200 years of core political freedom--which \nbenefits all citizens and makes America a uniquely free country--in \norder to stick it to conservatives and anyone else who does not support \nthe liberal agenda.\n  These liberal, Democrat-leaning groups know McCain-Feingold is \noutrageous--that its issue advocacy provisions, to name just a few, are \nunconscionable assaults on the first amendment right of all Americans \nto petition the government as individuals, and as groups, and to weigh \nin on public issues. But still some actively promote McCain-Feingold, \nmore simply look the other way--acquiescing on the sidelines of this \ncritical debate over core constitutional freedoms they get paid to \nexercise.\n  Perhaps they believe, correctly I might add, that Republicans will \nsave the Nation from McCain-Feingold. I predict that will be the \noutcome.\n  Mr. President, I will now read into the Record some highlights of the \nACLU's most recent denunciation of the McCain-Feingold bill, dated \nOctober 1, 1997:\n\n       Ever since the very first version of the various McCain-\n     Feingold campaign finance bills was introduced in the Senate, \n     the ACLU has gone on record to assert that each version was \n     fatally and fundamentally flawed when measured against \n     settled First Amendment principles. Now the Senate is \n     debating a new ``revised'' incarnation of the bill. While we \n     are pleased that the sponsors of the new version have \n     abandoned some of the more egregious provisions that appeared \n     in earlier versions, the ``pared down'' bill still cuts to \n     the core of the First Amendment. We once again urge you to \n     reject McCain-Feingold's unconstitutional and unprecedented \n     assaults on freedom of speech and association.\n       Although the bill has a number of constitutional flaws, \n     this letter focuses on those\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\n     that impose restrictions primarily on issue advocacy. It is \n     important to note at the outset that the recent letter from \n     126 law professors, commenting on McCain-Feingold, was silent \n     on the issue advocacy restrictions in the bill, which are the \n     subject of this letter.\n       1. The unprecedented restrictions on issue advocacy \n     contained in the McCain-Feingold bill are flatly \n     unconstitutional under settled First Amendment doctrine.\n\n  Last week there was a lot of discussion of a law professor named Burt \nNeumann at the Brennan Center of New York. I believe it is interesting \nthat everyone believes Brennan wrote the Buckley case, one of the \nironies of this debate. Mr. Neumann for 24 years had said the Buckley \ndecision was wrong. And he is free to say that. He wishes it were \notherwise. But his position and the position of the man he presumably \nadmires the most, William Brennan, not only prevailed in the Buckley \ncase but has been further elaborated on in 21 years of litigation. \nThus, the ACLU says under settled first amendment doctrine:\n\n       What we are talking about here is not the law as some wish \n     it were but the law as it is. And that is what the ACLU is \n     referring to.\n\n  Further, in another place in the letter, Mr. President, they say:\n\n       The unprecedented and sweeping restraints on the ``soft \n     money'' funding of issue advocacy and political activity by \n     political parties raise severe first amendment problems.\n\n  At another point in the letter, the ACLU says, ``The same principles \nthat protect unrestrained issue advocacy by issue groups safeguard \nissue advocacy and activity by political parties.''\n  So, if issue advocacy has been well laid out by 21 years of court \ncases for groups, the same thing applies for political parties.\n  By the way, Mr. President, this letter was signed by Ira Glasser, \nexecutive director; Laura Murphy, director, Washington office; Joel \nGora, professor of law at Brooklyn Law School.\n  I might just say a word about Joel Gora. He was cocounsel in the \nBuckley case. So my side in this argument is that they didn't have to \ngo out and find somebody to certify that they wish the law were what it \nisn't. These folks know what the law is, were involved in litigating \nthese cases, and are simply certifying as to their opinion based upon \ndeep experience in this field as to the constitutionality of the \nmeasure before us.\n  So, here is what they say at the end of the letter.\n       Accordingly, we submit that McCain-Feingold's sweeping \n     controls on the amount and source of soft money contributions \n     to political parties and disclosure of soft money \n     disbursements by other organizations continue to raise severe \n     constitutional problems. Disclosure, rather than limitation, \n     of large soft money contributions to political parties, is \n     the more appropriate and less restrictive alternative.\n       McCain-Feingold's labyrinth of restrictions on party \n     funding and political activity can have no other effect but \n     to deter and discourage precisely the kind of political party \n     activity that the First Amendment was designed to protect.\n       . . . While reasonable people may disagree about the proper \n     approaches to campaign finance reform, this bill's restraints \n     on political party funding and issue advocacy raise profound \n     First Amendment problems and should be opposed. The bill has \n     a number of other severe flaws, some old, some new, which we \n     will address in a future communication. But we wanted to take \n     the opportunity to share our assessment of two of the most \n     salient problems with the bill now.\n\n  So, Mr. President, there it is from America's experts on the first \namendment, one of whom was one of the lawyers in the Buckley case. \nThese are people who are experts on this kind of litigation, and that \nis their opinion about the constitutionality of McCain-Feingold, as \nrevised.\n  Now, Mr. President, a September 25, 1997, letter from the Christian \nCoalition. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator: The Christian Coalition has long supported \n     campaign finance reform that encourages citizen participation \n     and nonpartisan voter education. Any reform of our system of \n     campaign financing should allow for educational tools such as \n     nonpartisan voter guides, issue advertising, congressional \n     scorecards and newsletters. Christian Coalition vigorously \n     opposes the McCain-Feingold legislation which \n     unconstitutionally restricts these types of issue advocacy.\n\n  I will just read one other sentence, Mr. President, from this \nparticular letter. This organization says:\n\n       Voter education should be encouraged, not discouraged. An \n     informed electorate is part of the solution, not part of the \n     problem.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Christian Coalition,\n\n\n                                          Capitol Hill Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1997.\n\n Support First Amendment--Free Speech Oppose McCain-Feingold Campaign \n                              Finance Bill\n\n       Dear Senator: The Christian Coalition has long supported \n     campaign finance reform that encourages citizen participation \n     and non-partisan voter education. Any reform of our system of \n     campaign finance should allow for educational tools such as \n     non-partisan voter guides, issue advertising, congressional \n     scorecards, and newsletters. Christian Coalition vigorously \n     opposes the McCain-Feingold legislation which \n     unconstitutionally restricts these types of issue advocacy.\n       Issue advocacy is constitutionally protected free speech. \n     Expressing opinions on issues and informing voters where \n     candidates stand on the issues are constitutionally protected \n     free speech, so long as the election or defeat of a candidate \n     is not ``expressly advocated.'' For over 20 years, the \n     Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the test must be \n     objective, not subjective. ``Express advocacy'' is defined by \n     using such words as, ``vote against,'' and ``oppose.'' The \n     McCain-Feingold bill imposes an unconstitutional subjective \n     test.\n       Voter education should be encouraged, not discouraged. An \n     informed electorate is part of the solution, not part of the \n     problem. Without voter education efforts, our supporters \n     would be forced to rely entirely on slick political \n     advertising and the news media. In fact, newspapers and other \n     media outlets express opinions and even expressly advocate \n     the election or defeat of candidates through editorials. \n     While the media is totally unregulated, as it should be under \n     the First Amendment, some want to prohibit and heavily \n     regulate issue organizations from exercising similar free \n     speech.\n       Restrictive speech provisions will not withstand \n     constitutional challenge. Therefore we oppose any proposals \n     which attempt to bring constitutionally protected issue \n     advocacy under the regulatory control of the federal \n     government. Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Heidi H. Stirrup,\n                                   Director, Government Relations.\n\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will read just a few of the \nhighlights from the cover letter. This is dated October 3, 1997.\n\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for requesting our \n     comments on the revised McCain-Feingold campaign finance \n     bill. . . .\n       Much of what the Cato Institute and similar nonprofit \n     research and public policy corporations do could no longer be \n     done or, done only if we are comfortable having research \n     publications, public policy forums, city seminars, \n     conferences and the like classified as ``contributions.'' In \n     this bizarre scenario, these ``contributions'' would have to \n     be paid for out of our ``PAC'' (which, of course, we would \n     never have), and, probably, could not be done at all since \n     much of the ``anything of value'' we produce often costs more \n     than the $5,000 limit on contributions.\n       Here is a group, Mr. President, not in politics. They do \n     not go out and create a PAC, they do not do voter guides, and \n     they think that the most recent version of McCain-Feingold is \n     going to make it hard for them to function.\n\n  The Cato Institute goes on:\n\n       For example, if we published a study on the flat tax, or \n     tax reform and ever discussed the issue with Representative \n     Dick Armey--or, heaven forbid, held a policy forum or city \n     seminar with Dick Armey, Steve Forbes, Reps' Paxon, Tauzin, \n     Archer, or any of the other leading proponents of tax \n     reform--under the new McCain-Feingold, these could become \n     contributions.\n       I guess the good news is, as Bob Levy says, that ``the \n     September 29 version of McCain-Feingold reduces the first \n     amendment to scrap''--so blatantly unconstitutional that it \n     will never become law. As Bob also says, ``McCain-Feingold is \n     an insidious and destructive piece of legislation. It \n     deserves an ignominious burial. To be blunt, either it dies, \n     or we do.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the communication from \nthe Cato Institute be printed in the Record, along with another letter \nfrom the National Taxpayers Union.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         Cato,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1997.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for requesting our \n     comments on the revised McCain-Feingold campaign finance \n     bill. A copy of Bob Levy's detailed analysis is attached (Bob \n     is a senior fellow in constitutional studies here at Cato.) I \n     think you will find the first two and closing paragraphs \n     succinct and to the point.\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\n       In summary, much of what the Cato Institute and similar \n     non-profit research and public policy corporations do, could \n     no longer be done or, done only if we are comfortable having \n     research publications, public policy forums, city seminars, \n     conferences and the like classified as ``contributions.'' In \n     this bizarre scenario, these ``contributions'' would have to \n     be paid for out of our ``PAC'' (which of course, we would \n     never have), and, probably, could not be done at all since \n     much of the ``anything of value'' we produce often costs more \n     than the $5,000 limit on contributions. And, of course, if \n     you know anything at all about the Cato Institute and our \n     president, Ed Crane, the last thing we would ever do is allow \n     ourselves to be in a situation that could be interpreted as \n     making contributions to political candidates.\n       For example, if we published a study on the flat tax, or \n     tax reform and ever discussed the issue with Rep. Dick \n     Armey--or, heaven forbid, held a policy forum or city seminar \n     with Dick Armey, Steve Forbes, Reps. Paxon, Tauzin, Archer, \n     or any of the other leading proponents of tax reform--under \n     the new McCain-Feingold, these could become \n     ``contributions.''\n       I guess the good news is, as Bob Levy says, that ``the \n     September 29 version of McCain-Feingold reduces the First \n     Amendment to scrap''--so blatantly unconstitutional that it \n     will never become law.

Ellis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Attachment.\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, October 6, 1997.\n     Attention: Campaign Finance Reform Aide.\n\n       Dear Senator: When you took your oath of office you said:\n       I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will \n     support and defend the Constitution of the United States \n     against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear \n     true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this \n     obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose \n     of evasion; and that I well and faithfully discharge the \n     duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me \n     God (5 U.S.C. 3331.)\n       S. 25, the campaign finance bill by Senators McCain and \n     Feingold, is blatantly unconstitutional under the First \n     Amendment, which says in part that ``Congress shall make no \n     law-.-.-.-abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; \n     or the right to the people peaceably to assemble, and to \n     petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'' You \n     cannot ``support the Constitution'' by trying the patience of \n     the Courts. Therefore, we believe that every Senator has a \n     constitutional obligation to vote against passage of this \n     bill.\n       The restrictions are so absurd that, if the bill were law, \n     it would be illegal for any organization to energetically \n     lobby for or against any legislation within 60 days of any \n     election unless it excluded the names of their lawmakers. So \n     for at least four months of every other year, groups could \n     not pay for ``any paid advertisement that is broadcast by a \n     radio broadcast station or television broadcast station'' if \n     they identified the name of a local lawmaker. If the Congress \n     wants such silly rules, then it should also arrange to be out \n     of session during these 60-day periods, and require that all \n     state congressional primaries he held on the same day.\n       The bill also proposes to ban, year-round, so-called \n     express advocacy while going far beyond the Supreme Court's \n     definition of express advocacy. The definitions are so vague \n     that candidates could complain to the Federal Election \n     Commission that many criticisms of their views constitute \n     ``illegal'' activity. Since there would be no cost to \n     complain, complain they will.\n       The sponsors of this legislation may claim it would have no \n     cost to taxpayers. We strongly disagree. Since the proposal \n     is so vague and so far-reaching in its application and \n     attempt to regulate speech and political activity, it would \n     take an enormous and costly expansion of the FEC to \n     administer our newly regulated ``free-speech'' rights. \n     Therefore, we will count a vote against this bill as a pro-\n     taxpayer vote in our annual Rating of Congress.\n       One final note. As a taxpayer organization, we know a thing \n     or two about complex and vague laws such as our tax code. But \n     if this bill becomes law, many of our tax laws will be a \n     model of clarity compared to the election law. And the tax \n     laws will have one advantage. Audits are not set in motion by \n     the frivolous complaints that would be the rule under this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Keating,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Preferring substance to petitions, I have a couple of \nconstitutional analyses to have printed in the Record. I understand \nfrom the Government Printing Office that it will cost approximately \n$12,000 to print this material in the Record.\n  The first is an outstanding dissertation on the constitutional \nimplications of campaign finance reform by law professor and renowned \nlegal scholar Lillian R. BeVier of the University of Virginia, and \nagain I will just read some of the highlights for the information of \nthose listening to the debate.\n  Professor BeVier appeared before the Rules Committee on several \noccasions. Her report of September 4, 1997, says:\n\n       The shortcomings of current ``reform'' proposals are no \n     small matter, given the First Amendment's crucial historical \n     role in protecting our right to self-government and its \n     sustaining liberty. For the proposals to pass constitutional \n     muster, the First Amendment would have to be itself \n     ``amended'' by judicial fiat.\n\n  And that, Mr. President, sums up I think quite well what Professor \nBeVier goes on to point out in some greater detail and I ask unanimous \nconsent that that dissertation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Campaign Finance ``Reform'' Proposals--A First Amendment Analysis\n\n                         (By Lillian R. BeVier)\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       In the wake of recent reports of questionable campaign \n     finance practices have come ever more draconian proposals to \n     ``reform'' the campaign finance system. Those proposals pose \n     a disturbing threat to the individual political freedom \n     guaranteed by the Constitution. Under current precedents, \n     none of them could survive a First Amendment challenge.\n       In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Supreme Court affirmed that \n     giving money to and spending money on political campaigns is \n     a core First Amendment activity. Accordingly, regulations of \n     political contributions and expenditures will not be \n     sustained unless justified by a compelling state interest and \n     crafted to achieve their objective by the least restrictive \n     means.\n       Current proposals to regulate campaign finance practices \n     cannot survive the kind of scrutiny that the First Amendment \n     requires. This study demonstrates that the ban on political \n     action committees, the PAC ban fallback provisions, the \n     ``voluntary'' spending limits, the restrictions on soft \n     money, the regulation of issue advocacy, and the proposals to \n     expand the enforcement powers for the Federal Election \n     Commission all substantially infringe on core First Amendment \n     freedoms, but none serves a compelling interest with the \n     least restrictive means. And the proposal that broadcasters \n     be required to provide free TV time to federal candidates is \n     constitutionally insupportable.\n       The shortcomings of current ``reform'' proposals are no \n     small matter, given the First Amendment's crucial historical \n     role in protecting our right to self-government and in \n     sustaining liberty. For the proposals to pass constitutional \n     muster, the First Amendment would have to be itself \n     ``amended'' by judicial fiat.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Since the 1996 elections, campaign finance practices have \n     dominated the news. Reports of unpalatable fundraising \n     strategies, such as renting out the Lincoln bedroom to major \n     donors and using White House telephones to solicit \n     contributions, have appeared with distressing frequency on \n     the nightly news. The media tend to portray those actions not \n     as straightforward individual ethical or legal lapses but as \n     self-evidently symptomatic of the need for stringent new \n     campaign finance ``reforms.'' President Clinton, who claims \n     to have played by the rules in his reelection campaign, also \n     claims to strongly favor ``reform.'' Recently, for example, \n     in a ``stop-me-before-I-kill-again'' move, he petitioned the \n     Federal Election Commission to ban political parties from \n     accepting the ``soft-money'' contributions that provided so \n     much of the fuel for the 1996 presidential contest.\n       A chorus of those who advocate increased regulation of the \n     political process is always available to chant the reform \n     mantras, and the mainstream press appears credulously willing \n     to broadcast them: ``Well-heeled [unequivocally self-serving \n     and never public-regarding] special interests'' dominate the \n     political process; challengers and incumbents alike, consumed \n     by the need to raise money for their campaigns, spend ``most \n     of their time . . . scrounging for funds.'' \\1\\ A Washington \n     Post headline declared, ``The System Has Cracked under the \n     Weight of Cash.'' \\2\\ ``[F]renized fund-raising and \n     freewheeling spending . . . [of] torrents of cash'' now rule \n     the day, and election contests are conducted principally via \n     expensive ad campaigns that saturate the airwaves.\\3\\ Money--\n     dollars contributed to candidates, given to political \n     parties, and spent on election campaigns--undermines the \n     integrity of and ``defeat[s] the democratic process'' \\4\\--or \n     so it is said.\n       Despite the overheated rhetoric of dysfunctionality and \n     doom, the debate about the nature of the changes that ought \n     to be made in the present system of campaign finance \n     regulations is often framed as though short-term political \n     advantage were the only thing at stake.\\5\\ Republicans, it is \n     said, are against restricting campaign contributions and \n     expenditures--but only because they are richer and better at \n     raising money. Democrats, on the other hand, favor \n     restrictions--but only because they wish to counter the \n     perceived Republican money-raising advantage. Because \n     Republicans control the present Congress, stringent new \n     giving and spending regulations are thought unlikely.\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\n     And finally, it is said that because the incumbents of both \n     parties are ``beneficiaries'' of the present system, \n     political reality suggests that those incumbents are unlikely \n     to change the system in any way that might threaten their \n     reelection.\n       For all the rhetoric, however, the debate over campaign \n     finance regulation raises issues that genuinely transcend the \n     short run, issues of fundamental and permanent significance \n     that cry out to be acknowledged. Indeed, though they come to \n     us in the benign guise of ``reform,'' many of the campaign \n     finance regulations that have recently been proposed would \n     require us to renege on a central premise of our \n     representative democracy--the individual political freedom \n     our Constitution guarantees.\n       This study will examine the constitutionality of current \n     campaign finance regulatory proposals. It will also strive to \n     bring the stakes in the campaign finance debate into the \n     sharpest possible focus--to provide a full accounting of \n     regulation's cost to political freedom so that, if they find \n     themselves tempted to adopt a short-term fix to the campaign \n     finance ``mess,'' legislators will not fatally underestimate \n     the price.\n\n\n                         the regulatory agenda\n\n       On the agenda of today's proponents of reform are a number \n     of specific, often shifting legislative proposals. Rather \n     than treat each of those proposals in detail, I will proceed \n     in more generic terms, focusing on the broad outlines of the \n     most frequently recurring--and thus most prominent--\n     individual suggestions for ``reform.'' I will consider the \n     following proposals:\n       The PAC ban: Eliminate political action committees (PACs) \n     from federal election activities by banning all expenditures \n     by and contributions to them for purposes of influencing \n     elections for federal office, broadly defined, except those \n     contributions and expenditures made by political parties and \n     their candidates.\n       The PAC ban fallback: If the complete ban if found \n     unconstitutional, lower the permissible amount of PAC \n     contributions to single candidates from the present $5,000 to \n     $1,000 and prohibit any candidate from receiving any PAC \n     contribution that would raise that candidate's PAC receipts \n     above a given percentage (say, 20 percent) of applicable \n     expenditure ceilings; ban the ``bundling'' of individual \n     contributions; ban the receipt by a candidate of PAC monies \n     that exceed 20 percent of the particular election's campaign \n     expenditure ceilings; redefine independent expenditures so as \n     to turn more activities into ``coordinated'' expenditures \n     (thus subjecting them to the contribution limitations); and \n     broaden the definition of ``express advocacy'' so as \n     essentially to prohibit generic partisan communications of \n     any kind (by defining express advocacy to include any \n     ``expression of support for or opposition to a specific \n     candidate, to a specific group of candidates, or to \n     candidates of a particular political party'' and to include \n     suggestions ``to take action with respect to an election * * \n     * or to refrain from taking action'').\n       Spending limits and communication discounts: Impose \n     ``voluntary'' spending limits for candidates in House and \n     Senate races and prohibit spending of personal funds in \n     excess of 10 percent of that limit; provide to candidates who \n     agree to be bound by the limits certain amounts of free \n     television time, plus the right to purchase additional time \n     at reduced rates, and give them a reduced rate for mailing to \n     state voters; limit their receipt of out-of-state \n     contributions by requiring them to receive 60 percent of the \n     contributions to their campaign from individuals in their own \n     states or districts; and prohibit candidates who do not agree \n     to be bound by the spending limits from receiving PAC \n     contributions, require them to pay full rates for \n     broadcasting and postage, raise the limits on contributions \n     to their opponents from $1,000 to $2,000, and raise the \n     expenditure limits of their opponents by 20 percent.\n       Restrictions on soft money: Bar federal officeholders, \n     candidates, and national political parties from accepting \n     unregulated contributions; subject all election-year \n     expenditures and disbursements by political parties, \n     including state and local parties that ``might affect the \n     outcome of a federal election''--including those for voter \n     registration, get-out-the-vote drives, generic campaign \n     activities, and any communication that identifies a federal \n     candidate--to the full panoply of Federal Election Campaign \n     Act (FECA) restrictions and compliance and regulatory rules.\n       Controls on ``issue advocacy'': Regulate communications \n     that do not contain words of ``express advocacy'' as defined \n     by the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo (i.e., \n     communications that do not ``in express terms advocate the \n     election or defeat of a clearly defined candidate for federal \n     office'').\\6\\ Define ``issue advocacy'' to include a broader \n     range of communications than does ``express advocacy''; \n     regulate it by subjecting groups funding issue advocacy \n     communications to FECA disclosure requirements and \n     controlling the content of issue advocacy communications \n     by requiring disclosure of funding sources and disclaimers \n     of candidate advocacy.\n       Free TV: In exchange for, and as a ``public service'' \n     condition of, the allocation to them of spectrum space, \n     require broadcasters to provide substantial amounts of free \n     air time to all candidates for federal office. Require \n     candidates to appear in person in the free time provided to \n     them and to speak for themselves.\n       Expand Federal Election Commission enforcement powers: \n     Grant broad new enforcement powers to the Federal Election \n     Commission, including the right to go to court to seek an \n     injunction against potential offenders on the ground that \n     there is a substantial likelihood that a violation is about \n     to occur.\n\n\n              first amendment analysis: general principles\n\n                         The Buckley Framework\n\n       To be constitutional, the proposals outlined above must not \n     violate principles of political freedom and free political \n     speech as protected under the First Amendment. The \n     cornerstone of the Supreme Court's First Amendment \n     jurisprudence in this area is Buckley. In that case the Court \n     decided several challenges to the FECA amendments of 1974.\\7\\ \n     FECA was at that time Congress's most ambitious effort at \n     election campaign reform. According to its defenders, the act \n     was designed to equalize access to and purify the political \n     process by ridding it of corruption and the appearance of \n     corruption. Among other things, the plaintiffs in Buckley \n     challenged the act's stringent limitations on the amounts of \n     money individuals could contribute to and spend on campaigns \n     for federal office and the act's provisions for public \n     funding of presidential candidates who agreed to abide by \n     spending limits during their campaigns. The Court sustained \n     the provisions for public funding of presidential campaigns \n     and the contribution limitations. It invalidated the \n     expenditure limitations.\n       In resolving the Buckley challenges, the Court correctly \n     took as its central premises that ``a major purpose of [the \n     First] Amendment was to protect the free discussion of \n     governmental affairs'' and that contribution and expenditure \n     limitations ``operate in an area of the most fundamental \n     First Amendment activities.'' \\8\\ Pursuant to conventional \n     canons of First Amendment review, that meant that \n     contributions and expenditure limitations would be subject to \n     ``strict scrutiny'' by the Court and would not survive unless \n     they were found to serve a ``compelling state interest'' \n     using the ``least restrictive means.'' Due to differences it \n     perceived in the relative magnitudes of the First Amendment \n     interests, the Court distinguished between limits on \n     contributions of money to politicians or their campaigns and \n     limits on campaign expenditures by citizens and candidates. A \n     contribution limit, said the Court, ``entails only a marginal \n     restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free \n     communication,'' \\9\\ because ``the transformation of \n     contributions into political debate involves speech by \n     someone other than the contributor.'' \\10\\ Hence, such limits \n     could presumably be evaluated using a slightly more lenient \n     standard of review.\\11\\ Limits on expenditures, on the other \n     hand, ``represent substantial rather than merely theoretical \n     restraints on the quantity and diversity of political \n     speech.'' \\12\\\n       Thus, whereas the Court strongly suggested that limitations \n     on expenditures may well run afoul of the First Amendment \n     regardless of the context or the purported justification for \n     their imposition, it held that limitations on contributions \n     are constitutional if their purpose is the compelling one of \n     preventing corruption (i.e., ``the attempt to secure a \n     political quid pro quo from current and potential \n     officeholders'') \\13\\ or the appearance of corruption. Of \n     particular importance to today's debate, the Court rejected \n     equalization of political power as even a permissible, much \n     less a compelling, justification for restrictions on either \n     contributions or spending, observing that ``the concept that \n     government may restrict the speech of some elements in our \n     society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is \n     wholly foreign to the First Amendment.'' \\14\\\n       Buckley has proven remarkably robust and has provided the \n     doctrinal framework for all seven of the major campaign \n     finance cases that the Court has since decided. In each of \n     those cases (briefly summarized in the Appendix), the Court \n     has remained committed to Buckley's major conclusions. That \n     is not to say that the Buckley framework has gone \n     unchallenged within the Court itself.\\15\\ Still, taken as a \n     whole, Buckley and its progeny stand foursquare for the \n     following doctrinal generalizations. Because they represent \n     governmentally imposed constraints on political activity,\n       Restrictions on political contributions and expenditures \n     infringe on rights of speech and association. Therefore, the \n     Court will strictly scrutinize such restrictions, even \n     when they are directed at corporations instead of at \n     individuals or groups.\n       Limits on independent expenditures by individuals and \n     political groups are likely to be unconstitutional regardless \n     of the context or the purported justification.\n       Preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption \n     remains the ``single narrow exception to the rule that limits \n     on political activity'' are contrary to the First \n     Amendment.\\16\\\n       Since a ballot measure offers no opportunity to corrupt \n     elected officials with either contributions or expenditures, \n     the First Amendment probably prohibits restrictions on both \n     contributions and expenditures in the context of ballot-\n     measure elections: both kinds of restrictions infringe on \n     First Amendment rights without countervailing benefit since \n     ``there is no significant state or public interest in \n     curtailing debate and discussion of a ballot measure.'' \\17\\\n       Equalization of political influence is not a permissible \n     justification for restrictions. The Court has never wavered \n     in its view that government may not restrict the speech of \n     some to enhance the relative voice of others.\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\n                      Applying Buckley: In General\n\n       How do the campaign finance regulations that are presently \n     being debated fare when subjected to analysis in light of the \n     Buckley framework and the First Amendment foundation upon \n     which it rests? The first step in the calculus of \n     constitutionality is to determine the extent to which each \n     proposal infringes on established First Amendment rights. \n     That step is doctrinally uncontroversial, its analytical path \n     clearly marked, for Buckley and its progeny unequivocally \n     establish that regulations of campaign contributions and \n     expenditures operate upon fundamental First Amendment rights \n     to free speech and free association.\n       Cynically claiming that that central premise of Buckley \n     represents nothing more than capitulation to the idea that \n     ``money talks,'' advocates of regulation mock and demean the \n     premise. In doing so, they miss the point entirely. Buckley \n     was not written on a blank First Amendment slate. Rather, it \n     was firmly grounded upon, and thus was the natural outgrowth \n     of, a long line of cases that affirmed that the core \n     principles of the First Amendment protected citizens' right \n     to speak, to publish, and to associate for political causes, \n     free from government interference or control. Contributing to \n     and spending money on political campaigns--whether to \n     advocate the election of particular candidates or to take \n     positions with respect to particular issues--was protected in \n     Buckley not because money talks but because the central \n     purpose of the First Amendment is to guarantee political \n     freedom. The amendment ensures that individual citizens may \n     exercise that freedom by speaking, discussing, publishing, \n     advocating, and persuading and that they may enhance their \n     individual voices by joining together in groups, \n     organizations, associations, and societies. The specific \n     rights of citizens to contribute to and spend money on \n     political campaigns are merely necessary corollaries of their \n     more general rights to speak freely and to associate with one \n     another to advocate causes in which they believe.\n       Having established that regulations of campaign \n     contributions and expenditures impinge on fundamental First \n     Amendment rights, the Court will then apply ``strict \n     scrutiny'' and sustain the regulations only if it finds that \n     they serve a compelling government interest and use the least \n     restrictive means to do so. The analytical task implicit in \n     those second and third steps in the constitutional calculus \n     is the identification and evaluation of the government \n     interests that supposedly support regulation and the \n     appraisal of the means deployed to serve those interests.\n       Performing that task is not as easy as its doctrinal \n     formulation suggests. Although the Court has clearly \n     commanded that strict scrutiny is required, it has not always \n     adhered to the implications of that command by engaging in \n     rigorous examination of both proffered ends and the means \n     chosen to achieve them. In fact, the Court has occasionally \n     been highly deferential and credulous in its assessments of \n     ends and means, making prediction in the present case an \n     uncertain undertaking. Still, if the integrity of First \n     Amendment principles is to be preserved, it is critically \n     important that both legislators and judges take great care \n     that rhetoric and assertion not substitute for the careful \n     analysis that truly strict scrutiny requires. For that \n     reason, the analysis that follows will attempt not merely to \n     summarize but to examine skeptically the arguments and the \n     rhetorical strategies of the advocates of regulation.\n\n                  Applying Buckley: Specific Proposals\n\n       The PAC Ban\n       In Buckley, the Supreme Court held that the only legitimate \n     and compelling government interest in restricting campaign \n     contributions and expenditures is to prevent corruption or \n     the appearance of corruption. And the Court defined \n     corruption precisely and narrowly as entailing a financial \n     quid pro quo: dollars for political favors.\n       Despite that, advocates of the PAC ban offer justifications \n     unrelated to preventing corruption as the Court defined it in \n     Buckely. Instead, such justifications as they offer are \n     directed, in vague terms, at reforming ``an unresponsive \n     government and a political process that has grown \n     increasingly mean-spirited''--a view reformers seem to \n     believe is universally shared. Regarding contribution \n     prohibitions, reformers condemn unspecified ``elected \n     officials who listen more to big money and Washington \n     lobbyists than to their own constituents''; they decry the \n     ``influence-money culture'' and claim that ``our political \n     system is rigged to benefit campaign contributors and \n     incumbent officeholders at the great expense of citizens''; \n     and they see an ``inherent problem''--the nature of which \n     they do not define--``with a system in which individuals and \n     groups with an interest in government decisions can give \n     substantial sums of money to elected officials who have the \n     power to make those decisions.''\\18\\ At bottom, the \n     justification they offer seems to be that special-interest \n     PAC contributions are a dominant force in the financing of \n     federal election campaigns, that members of Congress are \n     dependent on them and influenced by them, that the giving of \n     PAC money is linked to the particular PAC's legislative \n     agenda, and that PAC money goes overwhelmingly to incumbents. \n     Thus, they justify the PAC expenditure ban not with reference \n     to preventing corruption but on the ground that it is a \n     loophole-closing measure: if independent PAC expenditures \n     continue to be permitted for ``purposes of influencing any \n     election for Federal office,'' they will undermine the \n     ability of the contribution prohibitions to achieve their \n     purpose of preventing PACs from wielding influence.\n       Buckley and its progeny signal quite clearly that those \n     ``justifications'' for the PAC contributions and expenditure \n     ban are neither legitimate nor compelling. The rhetorical \n     parade of horribles cited by the advocates of increased \n     regulation simply does not amount to corruption as the Court \n     has defined it; thus, curing the system of them is not \n     corruption prevention. Even if ridding the political system \n     of the influence of big money and Washington lobbyists were \n     somehow transformed into legitimate ends of government, a \n     total ban on PAC contributions could not survive, for it is \n     grossly over inclusive. Eliminating all political committee \n     activity is not narrowly tailored, nor is it the least \n     restrictive means of ridding the system of the influence of \n     the money culture.\n       Unless the advocates of increased regulation truly intend \n     to denounce all political alliances--regardless of whether \n     they be ideological, issue driven, or public spirited--on the \n     ground that they are all, in the very nature of things, bound \n     to represent special interests, and unless they think that \n     all attempts by individuals to maximize their political \n     voices by joining together with others of like mind present \n     an inherent problem, it is impossible to imagine how they \n     could justify such a draconian measure as a total ban on PAC \n     giving and spending. Cutting the heart out of the freedom of \n     political speech and association, and conferring what would \n     amount to a permanent monopoly on political parties, is \n     neither necessary nor a narrowly tailored means for attaining \n     even the ill-defined--and probably illegitimate--goal of \n     eliminating the influence of big money and Washington \n     lobbyists.\n       The PAC Ban Fallback. The fallback provision--which would \n     lower the permissible amount of PAC contributions from $5,000 \n     to $1,000 per election and would go into effect if or, more \n     accurately, when the total ban on PAC contributions was \n     declared unconstitutional--allegedly serves the same interest \n     as the total ban. Since it aims to reduce rather than \n     prohibit permissible contributions, the fallback provision \n     might appear on its face to be less problematic than the \n     total ban. That appearance is deceptive. Although the Court \n     stated in Buckley that contribution limits are easier to \n     defend than expenditure limits, it held that strict scrutiny \n     was appropriate for both. Thus, the contribution limits of \n     the fallback provision must run the same strict scrutiny \n     gauntlet, and their chances of surviving are slim to none.\n       First, note again that the advocates have not claimed \n     during the course of recent debates that the interest being \n     served by reducing the contribution limit from $5,000 to \n     $1,000 is that of preventing corruption in the Buckley sense. \n     It seems quite implausible to assert that any politician \n     would be corrupted--or even appear to be corrupted--in the \n     quid pro quo sense by a single contribution of even $5,000. \n     Instead, the interest that the contribution reduction would \n     serve is, again, the diffuse one of ending the ``dominance'' \n     and ``influence'' of PACs. Thus, the problem the fallback \n     limitation confronts at the outset is that, even if precisely \n     defined, it serves an interest that has never been held to \n     be either legitimate or compelling. And second, instead of \n     being narrowly tailored, the limitation appears quite ill-\n     suited to serve the interest asserted for it. Indeed, it \n     is difficult to identify any interest that would be served \n     by making it so much more difficut than it presently is \n     for candidates to raise money: candidates will hardly be \n     less distracted by fundraising if they have to raise money \n     from even greater numbers of people because of the smaller \n     amounts that any one individual or PAC may contribute.\n       Both the contribution ban and the fallback treat all PACs \n     alike, as though whatever cause they espouse and however \n     great (or limited) their resources, they all pose precisely \n     the same danger--and the same degree of danger--of \n     undermining the integrity of our political process. But given \n     the enormous range and diversity of interests that PACs \n     represent, treating them all alike makes little sense--and \n     certainly fails the narrowly tailored, least restrictive \n     means test. Moreover, it is important to note that even while \n     it was sustaining the particular contribution limits in \n     Buckley, the Court ``cautioned . . . that if the contribution \n     limits were too low, the limits could be unconstitutional.'' \n     \\19\\ Thus, contribution limits so low as significantly to \n     impair the regulated party's ability to exercise First \n     Amendment rights (as a $1,000 limit on PAC contributions \n     would surely do) or so unreasonably below an amount that \n     would give legitimate rise to a perception that the \n     contributor was acquiring ``undue influence'' (as the $1,000 \n     limit would surely be) are constitutionally vulnerable.\n       The only interest served by the fallback provision's ban on \n     the bundling of small individual contributions to PACs would \n     be that of preventing evasion of the contribution limitation. \n     The bundling ban, however, represents a different sort of \n     burden on First Amendment rights than does the \n     constitutionally doubtful contribution limitation, which it \n     supposedly serves as a backstop. For the bundling ban \n     directly burdens the associational rights of individual PAC \n     contributors. The Supreme Court recognizes that the right to \n     associate is a ``basic constitutional freedom'' \\20\\ and has \n     stated repeatedly that ``the practice of persons sharing\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\n     common views banding together to achieve a common end is \n     deeply embedded in the American political process.'' \\21\\\n       Advocates of the bundling ban claim that it is necessary to \n     forestall PACs' evading the contribution limitations. Thus, \n     whether the ban serves a compelling state interest will \n     depend upon whether the interest served by the contribution \n     limitations survives review and, if so, whether the ban is \n     narrowly tailored--whether the Court sanctions a one-size-\n     fits-all prohibition. Since the contribution limitations are \n     unlikely to survive review, and since the one-size-fits-all \n     prohibition is a clumsy solution in any event, the bundling \n     ban is likely to be even more vulnerable than the \n     contribution limitation it serves.\n       The fallback's prohibition of PAC contributions that raise \n     any candidate's PAC receipts above 20 percent of campaign \n     expenditure ceilings would also, to a large extent, stand or \n     fall with the contribution limitations themselves, since the \n     prohibition is defended in terms of its ability to strengthen \n     the contribution limitations. The First Amendment burden of \n     the 20-percent-of-expenditure limitation is more onerous than \n     first appears, however, for after the 20 percent limit is \n     reached the so-called limitation has the effect of a total \n     ban. How such a limit would serve a corruption-prevention \n     objective, moreover, is very difficult to discern. Corruption \n     arises when large contributions are exchanged for particular \n     political favors. If PAC contributions are not individually \n     large enough to create a risk of corruption or its \n     appearance, the fact that a candidate receives many of them--\n     even were he to receive 100 percent of his campaign funding \n     from them--simply does not increase the risk that he will be \n     corrupted. Thus, the 20-percent-of-expenditure limitation not \n     only is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state \n     interest in preventing corruption or its appearance but also \n     is not tailored to serve any identifiable or legitimate \n     interest at all.\n       Finally, the attempt to redefine ``independent \n     expenditure''--and, in particular, to redefine ``express \n     advocacy'' so as to include any and all partisan \n     communications--runs flatly counter to the Buckley Court's \n     explicit effort to immunize issue advocacy from regulation or \n     restriction: ``So long as persons or groups eschew \n     expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to \n     spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his \n     views.'' \\22\\\n\n                     ``Voluntary'' Spending Limits\n\n       The proposals for voluntary spending limits keyed to \n     relevant voting age populations are said to serve the \n     interest in curbing excessive and even obscene campaign \n     spending. Spending limits will hold down the costs of running \n     for office and thus prevent one candidate from having an \n     excessive advantage over another by reason of spending more. \n     The limits are also touted for their supposed ability to \n     redress the present imbalance in favor of incumbents (who \n     have a grossly unfair advantage in fundraising because \n     most PAC money goes to them).\n       Mandatory spending limits confront an impenetrable \n     constitutional wall. The Supreme Court said in Buckley that \n     expenditure limits simply do not serve to prevent corruption \n     or the appearance of corruption in the electoral process, \n     which is the only justification that the Court has ever \n     accepted for limiting political expression. Indeed, the Court \n     went further. It explicitly denounced the other \n     justifications for spending limits that proponents had \n     offered in Buckley, namely equalizing speech resources and \n     stemming the rising cost of political campaigns. Because it \n     represents such an unequivocal endorsement of freedom from \n     government as the underlying conception of the First \n     Amendment, the Court's aversion to restricting the voices of \n     some in order to enhance the voices of others is worth \n     emphasizing. Moreover, because it represents such a clear and \n     definite rejection of the paternalism of those who think they \n     know how much is too much to spend on political campaigning, \n     it is worth quoting the Court's confirmation that ``the mere \n     growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of \n     itself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the \n     quantity of campaign spending and the resulting limitation on \n     the scope of federal campaigns . . . In the free society \n     ordained by our Constitution it is not the government, but \n     the people--individually as citizens and candidates and \n     collectively as associations and political committees--who \n     must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on \n     public issues in a political campaign.'' \\23\\\n       It is, of course, because mandatory spending limits are so \n     clearly unconstitutional that advocates of the proposed \n     spending limits insist that they be voluntary. The \n     transparent objective is to fit the limits into the safe \n     harbor that the Buckley Court provided when it qualified its \n     rejection of expenditure limitations by the following \n     footnote:\n       ``Congress may engage in public funding of election \n     campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an \n     agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure \n     limitations. Just as a candidate may voluntarily limit the \n     size of the contributions he chooses to accept, he may decide \n     to forgo private fundraising and accept public funding.'' \n     \\24\\\n       For a number of reasons, all reflecting the magnitude of \n     the benefits and burdens attached to accepting or not \n     accepting the limits, it is pure fiction to call them \n     voluntary. They simply do not fit the Buckley proviso. To be \n     specific, significant benefits are promised to those who \n     accept the voluntary limits: candidates become eligible for \n     free and reduced-rate television time \\25\\ and reduced \n     mailing rates while their opponents who do not accept the \n     voluntary limits receive neither free time nor reduced rates. \n     Moreover, candidates who agree to voluntary contribution \n     limits when their opponents do not get an added benefit--\n     their contribution limits and expenditure ceilings are \n     raised. But burdens come with the benefits as well: \n     candidates who volunteer to comply with the spending limits \n     must demonstrate a threshold level of support (by raising 10 \n     percent of the limit) before becoming eligible for the \n     benefits; they must agree to raise 60 percent of their funds \n     from individuals who reside in their own states or districts; \n     and they must agree to limit the use of their own resources. \n     In addition, they cannot use their free air time for \n     commercials of less than 30 seconds in length.\n       When the Court in Buckley sustained the exchange of a \n     presidential candidate's right to make unlimited expenditures \n     in his own behalf for the right to receive public funding, it \n     did so because it concluded that the purpose of public \n     funding ``was not to abridge, restrict, or censor speech, but \n     rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public \n     discussion and participation in the electoral process.'' \\26\\ \n     The purpose of the current proposals to impose voluntary \n     spending limitations along with their accompanying burdens \n     and benefits, however, is quite different.\n       In the first place, the limits are not imposed in exchange \n     for receipt of public funding and thus could not be defended \n     as necessary to protect the integrity of a government-funded \n     program. Second, the effect of the proposed expenditure \n     limitations--whether they are deemed voluntary or not--will \n     be to reduce substantially the quantity of campaign speech. \n     Indeed, that must be their purpose, since the restrictions \n     are explicitly motivated by the objective of reducing \n     excessive spending. As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     recently noted when evaluating analogous provisions of state \n     campaign finance restrictions, one is ``hard-pressed to \n     discern how the interests of good government could possibly \n     be served by campaign expenditure laws that necessarily have \n     the effect of limiting the quantity of political speech in \n     which candidates for public office are allowed to engage.'' \n     \\27\\\n       The spending limitations also do not serve the posited goal \n     of creating a level playing field between incumbents and \n     challengers because the limitations fail to dissipate the \n     already significant advantages of incumbency. Incumbents \n     begin every electoral race with important advantages; \n     equalizing the amount of money that incumbents and \n     challengers can spend would simply make permanent the \n     incumbent advantages that already exist. When the spending \n     limits are combined with the proposed new restrictions on \n     contributions and the increasingly complicated system of \n     fundraising for challengers, they appear narrowly tailored \n     not to level the playing field for challengers but instead to \n     transform a challenger's initial disadvantage into a \n     practically insurmountable barrier. That is the reason the \n     proposals are so susceptible to the charge of being \n     incumbent-protection measures.\n\n                          Limits on Soft Money\n\n       Advocates of increased regulation of campaign finance often \n     assert that soft money is the most dangerous and destructive \n     money in the political system today. Soft money is money \n     contributed by individuals, corporations, unions, and the \n     like to the national and state parties for party-building \n     activities, voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, \n     and generic issue- (rather than candidate-) oriented \n     advertising. It is not subject to contribution limitations \n     imposed by FECA because it is not used to advocate expressly \n     the election of any clearly identified candidate. Reformers \n     want to ban soft money because they believe that even though \n     it does not go to support particular candidates it \n     nevertheless has the unseemly propensity to influence \n     elections. Thus, it invites wholesale evasion of the \n     contribution limits now in place.\n       The reformers are right, of course: soft money does \n     influence elections. But the resort to soft-money \n     contributions is exactly what one would expect when people \n     are prohibited from giving more directly.\n       Yet a ban on soft-money contributions would amount to an \n     unprecedented restriction on political activity, one whose \n     justification is not compelling and whose scope far exceeds \n     what the First Amendment allows. Advocates of a soft-money \n     ban defend it as a contribution-limitation-loophole-closing \n     device: corporations and unions that would not otherwise be \n     permitted to contribute to candidates' campaigns make large \n     soft-money donations to political parties; and individuals \n     often contribute soft money in excess of the amount they \n     would be entitled to contribute to particular candidates. \n     Such arguments assume, of course, that contribution \n     limitations represent an appropriate and inviolable ceiling \n     on the amount of money that individuals, corporations, and \n     unions should be allowed to contribute to the political \n     process whether or not the contribution funds speech that \n     creates a risk of quid pro quo corruption of particular \n     candidates. Thus, supporters of the ban make no pretense of \n     establishing a link between soft-money contributions and the \n     appearance or reality of candidate corruption that alone\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\n     provides a constitutional predicate for regulation.\\28\\\n       Calling the soft-money contribution ban a contribution-\n     limit-loophole closure does not change the basic fact, \n     however: soft money does not fund speech that ``in express \n     terms advocate[s] the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate for federal office,'' which is the only \n     kind of speech for which the Court has held that \n     contributions may be constitutionally restricted.\\29\\ To \n     regulate contributions for speech that is other than express \n     advocacy of the election of particular candidates, the Court \n     said, would create intractable vagueness problems and cause \n     unacceptable chilling of protected, issue-oriented political \n     speech. It would, in other words, thwart speech debating the \n     merits of government policies and addressing the public \n     issues that are at stake in an election--the very kind of \n     speech that the First Amendment was written primarily to \n     protect. Thus, because a ban on soft money aims directly and \n     indiscriminately at core political activity, and because its \n     proponents have not made their case that soft-money \n     contributions pose a danger of quid pro quo corruption, the \n     ban could not pass muster as a finely tuned means of \n     achieving a compelling state interest.\n       Also bearing on the First Amendment implications of a ban \n     on soft money is the Court's recent decision in Colorado \n     Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, which held \n     limits on independent expenditures by political parties--\n     expenditures not coordinated with any candidate--to be \n     unconstitutional. The independent expression of a political \n     party's views, the Court affirmed, is core First Amendment \n     activity, and limits on it cannot be justified with reference \n     to a corruption-prevention rationale. Indeed, although the \n     majority of the Court did not reach or address the issue, \n     four justices expressed the further view that, given the \n     practical identity of interests between party and candidate \n     during an election, the corruption-prevention rationale for \n     sustaining limitations on contributions did not support any \n     limits on party spending, whether coordinated with the \n     candidate or not. Although present law makes coordinated \n     spending illegal, Justice Thomas pointedly questioned its \n     rationale: ``What could it mean for a party to `corrupt' \n     its candidate or to exercise `coercive' influence over \n     him?'' \\30\\ If the Court were to decide, when squarely \n     facing the issue, that party spending on political \n     activity cannot be limited, whether or not coordinated, \n     then contributions to the party to make those expenditures \n     would likewise seem to be protected from regulation. In \n     sum, from constitutional perspective, restrictions on soft \n     money are among the least defensible proposals for \n     campaign finance reform. Indeed, arguments purporting to \n     support such restrictions serve only to raise questions \n     about limits on direct contributions.\n\n                             Issue Advocacy\n\n       Insofar as they entail broadening the reach of campaign \n     speech regulation to include speech that does not ``in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate for federal office,'' proposals to \n     control issue advocacy are constitutionally inform for the \n     same reason that the soft-money ban is constitutionally \n     infirm: they would regulate--and thus unacceptably chill--\n     core political speech about the merits of policies and the \n     proper resolution of public issues without a corruption-\n     prevention rationale for doing so. Proponents of controls on \n     issue advocacy claim that controls are necessary to prevent \n     the acquisition of undue influence by advocates of particular \n     issues. There is, however, no constitutional warrant or means \n     for calibrating what constitutes ``undue'' influence, for the \n     Constitution does not permit, nor does it provide, a metric \n     for discerning how much influence is enough. We have no \n     constitutional Goldilocks to say when the amount of influence \n     possessed by advocates of particular positions is ``just \n     right.'' The inherent payoff for political participation in a \n     democracy is the acquisition of influence, and it is the \n     function of the First Amendment to protect efforts to acquire \n     it, not to limit or constrain them.\\31\\\n       The constitutionality of proposals for regulation, insofar \n     as they require disclosure by groups engaging in issue \n     advocacy, is seriously jeopardized by McIntyre v. Ohio \n     Electrons Commission.\\32\\ In McIntyre, the Court had before \n     it an Ohio statute that prohibited the distribution of \n     anonymous campaign literature. Because the statute was a \n     regulation of core political speech, the Court subjected it \n     to strict scrutiny; and, because the statute did not serve a \n     compelling state interest using the least restrictive means, \n     the Court proceeded to strike it down. Unpersuaded that the \n     ban was justified by Ohio's asserted interests either in \n     preventing fraudulent and libelous statements or in providing \n     voters with relevant information, the Court also could find \n     no support for the statute in either First National Bank of \n     Boston v. Bellotti \\33\\ or in arguably relevant portions of \n     Buckley.\n       In Bellotti, the Court invalidated a state law that \n     prohibited corporations from spending money on speech \n     designed to influence the outcome of referenda. In the course \n     of doing so, the Court commented in dicta on the possibility \n     that a requirement that the sponsor of corporate advertising \n     be identified might be thought to be permissible on account \n     of its ``prophylactic effect.'' The McIntyre Court realized \n     that the context of the Bellotti statement--expenditures by \n     corporations--was not the same as the context of the Ohio \n     statute, which purported to regulate independent expenditures \n     by an individual. And whereas in Buckley the Court sustained \n     mandatory reporting of independent expenditures in excess of \n     a threshold level, the justices noted in McIntyre that the \n     independent expenditures to which the disclosure requirement \n     applied had been construed to mean only those expenditures \n     that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate.\\34\\ Thus, in Buckley there was a \n     corruption-prevention rationale to support the expenditure-\n     disclosure requirement. Such a rationale would lend only the \n     most tenuous possible support to required disclosures of \n     issue advocacy.\n       McIntyre does not purport completely to foreclose \n     disclosure or reporting requirements with respect to \n     independent expenditures. It does, however, reaffirm the \n     Court's commitment to scrutinize strictly such requirements \n     in order to preserve the right to engage in issue advocacy \n     unencumbered by regulations that burden speech without \n     producing a reciprocal benefit in corruption prevention.\n\n                                Free TV\n\n       The proposals to require broadcasters to provide ``free'' \n     TV time to federal candidates do not come under the Buckley \n     rubric. Instead, insofar as they apply to broadcasters, their \n     constitutionality is a function of the unique First Amendment \n     jurisprudence that the Court has developed for the electronic \n     media. That jurisprudence had its beginnings in Red Lion \n     Broadcasting Co. v. FCC,\\35\\ in which the Court, pointing to \n     ``spectrum scarcity,'' upheld the Federal Communication \n     Commission's rule that those attacked editorially by the \n     broadcast media had a right of reply. Thus it denied the \n     broadcasters' First Amendment claim that such an obligation \n     impinged on their editorial freedom.\n       It is clear beyond peradventure that Congress could not \n     constitutionally compel the print media to provide free space \n     to similarly situated political candidates.\\36\\ Red Lion \n     sanctioned a different set of First Amendment rules for the \n     broadcast media because the Court was persuaded that the \n     scarcity of broadcast spectrum warranted content \n     regulation of spectrum licensees' programming in the \n     interests of diversity and fairness.\n       Many commentators questioned the rationality of the \n     spectrum scarcity argument even at the time Red Lion was \n     decided.\\37\\ Regardless of whether it provided a plausible \n     rationale at that time, however, spectrum scarcity has been \n     rendered obsolete by the advent of cable and other \n     technological advances. And courts, too, have increasingly \n     criticized the argument as a justification for government \n     control of the content of broadcast programming.\\38\\\n       There is no longer a factual foundation for the argument \n     that spectrum scarcity entitles the government, in the public \n     interest, to control the content of broadcast speech. Without \n     the spectrum scarcity rationale to support it, the attempt to \n     control broadcasters' speech by requiring them to provide \n     free TV time to candidates for office would seem doomed to \n     constitutional failure. Even were the spectrum scarcity \n     rationale still viable, the Court has never held that Red \n     Lion sanctioned ``government regulations that impose \n     specifically defined affirmative programming requirements on \n     broadcasters.'' \\39\\ The Court has been suspicious of any \n     government action that ``requires the utterance of a \n     particular message favored by the Government,'' and it has \n     been alert to guard against the ``risk that Government seeks \n     not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal but to suppress \n     unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public \n     debate through coercion rather than persuasion.'' \\40\\\n       With respect to all speakers except the broadcast media, \n     and most certainly with respect to candidates for political \n     office, it goes almost without saying that any attempt by the \n     government to dictate the format or control the content of \n     speech is constitutionally suspect. In addition to commanding \n     broadcasters to donate time so that political candidates may \n     speak, the free TV proposals contemplate requiring candidates \n     themselves, and not any surrogates, to speak in the donated \n     time, thus dictating the format of their speech; and several \n     suggestions have been made that the candidates must not \n     engage in ``negative'' campaigning if they are to receive the \n     free time, thus controlling the content of their entire \n     speech. Those highly questionable aspects of the free TV \n     proposals cannot be defended on the ground that the \n     government, in pursuit of the public interest, is subsidizing \n     certain candidate speech--thus conditioning receipt of its \n     funds on the candidates' agreement to respect the contours of \n     the government program. Such was the rationale that underlay \n     the Court's holding in Rust v. Sullivan,\\41\\ where the \n     Department of Health and Human Services' ``gag rule'' \n     prohibited recipients of federal family planning funds from \n     providing abortion information. The Rust rationale could not \n     support the format and content controls envisaged by the free \n     TV proponents for the simple reason that the speech would be \n     subsidized not by the taxpayers but by the broadcasters.\\42\\\n       In fact, what the free TV time proposals contemplate seems \n     to be a bold end-run around traditional and well-established \n     First Amendment principles. The broadcasters have no First \n     Amendment right to resist compliance, proponents say, because \n     spectrum scarcity permits the government to\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\n     regulate their editorial judgments in the public interest. \n     And the candidates have no First Amendment right to resist \n     compliance with format or content controls because they are \n     being permitted to speak for free. As the analysis above has \n     demonstrated, the First Amendment stands as a more effective \n     defense of freedom than the proponents imagine, and the \n     Supreme Court would surely have little difficulty detecting \n     the constitutional shell game that the free TV proposals \n     epitomize.\n\n        Expanded Federal Election Commission Enforcement Powers\n\n       Many of the proposals for increased regulation of campaign \n     finance envision a hugely enlarged enforcement role for the \n     already overburdened and generally ineffectual Federal \n     Election Commission.\\43\\ The wisdom of imposing such a \n     monumental burden on any federal agency, much less on this \n     particular one, is questionable; but whether the enforcement \n     mechanisms that Congress devises for implementing particular \n     regulatory strategies are feasible or not does not usually \n     raise First Amendment issues.\n       One enforcement proposal does raise such issues, however: \n     the proposal to give the FEC power to seek to enjoin \n     potential offenders on the ground that ``there is a \n     substantial likelihood that a violation is about to occur.'' \n     The proposal is vulnerable to two different First Amendment \n     challenges. The first involves vagueness. Many of the \n     proposed substantive violations are themselves vague, and the \n     ``substantial likelihood'' criterion for FEC action is also \n     vague. The threat of FEC action based on either vague element \n     of that ground would not only have an unacceptable chilling \n     effect on many activities that are not violations; more \n     significantly, it would also invite precisely the kind of \n     arbitrary exercise of government power that the vagueness \n     doctrine is designed to forestall.\\44\\\n       The second First Amendment challenge to giving the FEC \n     power to enjoin campaign activity involves prior restraint on \n     speech. Prior restraints are the ``most serious and the least \n     tolerable infringement of First Amendment rights,'' \\45\\ and \n     they will not be sustained unless the Court is convinced that \n     ``the gravity of the evil, discounted by its probability, \n     justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to \n     avoid the danger.'' \\46\\ It seems unlikely that the Court \n     would hold that the mere possibility of violating campaign \n     finance regulations poses the kind of threat to the national \n     interest that would justify imposing prior restraints on \n     speech, especially since the kind of speech put at risk by \n     such an injunction--political speech during the course of an \n     election campaign--lies at the very core of the First \n     Amendment.\n\n\n            the first amendment according to the regulators\n\n       When one looks at Supreme Court precedents--in particular \n     at Buckley and its progeny--the First Amendment case against \n     current proposals for more stringent campaign finance \n     regulations appears impregnable. But, given the vehemence and \n     surety with which those proposals are advocated, perhaps it \n     is well to look more closely both at the precedents for \n     Buckley and related cases and at the conception of the First \n     Amendment the reformers embrace and how that conception \n     differs from the First Amendment that is presently embodied \n     not only in our democratic traditions but in our supreme law.\n       An important question to ask is to what extent the \n     precedents--which stand as barriers to so-called reform \n     efforts--are rooted in traditions and ideas of freedom that \n     we wish to preserve. Buckley may be the cornerstone of the \n     Supreme Court's modern campaign finance jurisprudence, but it \n     is important to appreciate that it was not a novel, isolated \n     case. Rather, it was laid upon an already existing, solidly \n     constructed First Amendment foundation. Thus, to appreciate \n     its true significance, and understand what is at stake in the \n     present debate, it helps to see Buckley as sustaining a First \n     Amendment tradition that was already deeply embedded at the \n     time the case was decided. Buckley was one in a long and \n     continuing line of cases that have articulated and upheld, in \n     a wide variety of contexts, the principles of free political \n     speech and individual political freedom that lie at the very \n     heart of the First Amendment.\n       The Constitution is the fundamental charter of our \n     representative democracy, the embodiment of our right to \n     self-government and of all our corollary liberties. The First \n     Amendment's specification that ``Congress shall make no law . \n     . . abridging freedom of speech or of the press; or of the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances'' plays a crucial \n     role in determining the character of our democracy. ``A major \n     purpose of [the] Amendment was to protect the free discussion \n     of governmental affairs.'' \\47\\ Accordingly, it guarantees \n     that individual citizens may speak, publish, and join \n     together in groups to engage in political activity to try to \n     achieve the substantive ends they deem desirable.\\48\\ They \n     may attempt to persuade others and to acquire political \n     influence, and the government may not interfere with, punish, \n     repress, or otherwise impede their efforts.\\49\\\n       That conception of the First Amendment is fleshed out in \n     Supreme Court opinions that both pre- and post-date Buckley. \n     Those opinions make it clear that implicit in the First \n     Amendment guarantee of freedom from government control over \n     what citizens may say and with whom they may associate as \n     participants in the political process is the important \n     corollary that citizens may freely contribute or expend the \n     resources at their command--their intellect, their time, \n     their talent, their organizational or rhetorical skills, \n     their money--to or on political activity.\\50\\ The government \n     may not interfere in their efforts to persuade their fellow \n     citizens of the merits of particular proposals or of \n     particular candidates,\\51\\ nor may it disrupt the free \n     communication of their views,\\52\\ nor penalize them for \n     granting or withholding their support from elected officials \n     on the basis of the positions those officials espouse.\\53\\ \n     Government may neither prescribe an official orthodoxy,\\54\\ \n     require the affirmation of particular beliefs,\\55\\ nor compel \n     citizens to support causes or political activities with which \n     they disagree.\\56\\ Government may neither punish its critics \n     nor impose unnecessary burdens on their political \n     activity.\\57\\ Those are the bedrock principles of political \n     freedom with which Buckley and its progeny are consistent; \n     those are the principles that impelled the Buckley Court's \n     conclusion that government may not restrict independent \n     political expenditures and may limit political campaign \n     contributions only in the name of preventing corruption.\n       To remain faithful to those principles, one must be \n     vigilant to detect the costs to freedom lurking in reform \n     proposals that come dressed as benign efforts to achieve a \n     healthy politics. In the course of explaining why the First \n     Amendment should be amended, House Minority Leader Richard \n     Gephardt (D-Mo.) baldly stated that formal amendment was \n     needed so that Congress could enact new and \n     stringent campaign finance restrictions because ``[w]hat \n     we have is two important values in direct conflict: \n     freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in \n     a healthy democracy. You can't have both.'' \\58\\ That \n     breathtaking assertion performs a real service. It alerts \n     us to the fact that, in the eyes of advocates of reform, \n     freedom as we know it cannot survive an ambitious program \n     of campaign finance regulations. Of equal importance, it \n     begs the all-important questions about what a ``healthy \n     democracy'' would look like and why a healthy democracy is \n     not by definition one, like ours at present, in which \n     freedom of speech reigns.\n       Nevertheless, the regulatory proposals that have recently \n     been placed on the legislative agenda do claim to embody a \n     First Amendment vision of sorts. Based not on legal precedent \n     but crafted by legal scholars and judges who adumbrated it in \n     the pages of scholarly journals and treatises, the conception \n     of the First Amendment that animates proposals for campaign \n     finance regulation bears almost no resemblance to the \n     freedom-oriented conception that actual First Amendment \n     doctrine embodies. Indeed, it distorts our traditional \n     understandings of what the very words of the amendment mean \n     and imparts an extraordinary and unprecedented significance \n     to the phrase ``freedom of speech.'' Precisely because it \n     animates the present reform agenda, however, it warrants a \n     brief summary.\n       The conception of the First Amendment that underlies the \n     regulatory agenda of proponents of campaign finance reform is \n     best understood as a rejection of the traditional \n     understanding that freedom of speech necessarily implies \n     individual political liberty and the absence of substantive \n     or qualitative regulation of political debate. Proponents of \n     reform do not perceive that they utter a contradiction when \n     they assert that freedom of speech can be ``enhanced,'' \\59\\ \n     its purposes ``furthered, not abridged,'' \\60\\ by legislation \n     that regulates and restricts political speech. That is \n     because the proponents of regulation believe that freedom is \n     a quality of political life that can be regulated into \n     existence rather than an aspect of democracy that government \n     regulation necessarily and by definition destroys. They think \n     that the guarantee of freedom of speech is in fact a grant of \n     power to, rather than a withholding of power from, the \n     government. With such power, government can control the \n     content of political debate and fix the political process so \n     that ``political reason-giving'' will prevail. Political \n     influence will be distributed equally among groups so that \n     ``people who are able to organize themselves in such a way as \n     to spend large amounts of cash [will] not [be] able to \n     influence politics more than people who are not similarly \n     able.'' \\61\\ Then money will no longer play a role in our \n     politics.\n       The regulators appear to distrust deeply the American \n     people. They unselfconsciously express the concern that \n     ``completely unregulated [i.e., free] political campaigns \n     will degenerate in such a way that the electorate would be \n     divested of its power to make a reasoned choice among the \n     candidates.''\\62\\ In other words, they believe that the \n     American people cannot be trusted with the choices and \n     political responsibilities entailed in a free political \n     system; instead, the government must regulate the political \n     process in order to help the people to make appropriate \n     decisions.\n       In the First Amendment context, three aspects of the \n     regulators' conception deserve particular emphasis. The first \n     has already been mentioned: the regulators' conception \n     perverts the meaning of the word ``freedom.''\n       Second, while decrying the polluting effect of wealth on \n     the democratic process and celebrating spending and \n     contribution restrictions purporting to keep the voices of \n     individual citizens from being drowned out, reformers exempt \n     the press from their reform proposals. In the recent debate, \n     of\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\n     course, the press has largely bemoaned the vices of the \n     current system, and ``its myth-making has been especially \n     important in the shaping of mass opinion about reform.'' \\63\\ \n     Simply by virtue of their ability to influence the public \n     agenda, the media distort debate, and the distortion of the \n     political process that results from media treatment of \n     particular candidates or issues is likely to be \n     significant.\\64\\ The Supreme Court has explicitly eschewed \n     defining the rights of the press more broadly than speech \n     rights of ordinary citizens.\\65\\ Yet under the reformers' \n     conception of the First Amendment, the media and media \n     corporations enjoy privileges not enjoyed by ordinary \n     citizens.\n       The third noteworthy aspect of the reformers' conception of \n     the First Amendment is that the agenda that conception is \n     used to promote is neither premised on empirical analysis, \n     nor derived from established postulates, nor defended in \n     terms of predictions about testable results. Rather, it rests \n     on pejorative and highly charged rhetoric, is formulated in \n     ill-defined but evocative terms, and is defended with \n     extravagant claims about benign effects. Yet upon analysis, \n     the picture the regulators paint--both of political reality \n     and of the goals of reform--is so vague that it begs all the \n     important questions.\n       Thus, when the late Judge Skelly Wright, long in the reform \n     camp, surveyed the political process, he was dismayed to find \n     ``the polluting effect of money in election campaigns.'' He \n     worried that ``[c]oncentrated wealth . . . threaten[ed] to \n     distort political campaigns and referenda,'' and he announced \n     that ``[t]he voices of individual citizens are being drowned \n     out'' by the ``unholy alliance of big spending, special \n     interests, and election victory.'' \\66\\ Similarly, Professor \n     Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago more recently \n     asserted that ```[m]any people think that the present system \n     of campaign financing distorts the system of free expression, \n     by allowing people with wealth to drown out people without \n     it. . . . [C]ampaign finance laws might be thought to promote \n     the purpose of the system of free expression, which is to \n     ensure a well-functioning deliberative process among \n     political equals.'' \\67\\\n       What do all those words mean? What does the ``pure \n     political process''--the one that is being ``polluted''--\n     actually look like? How rich are ``people with wealth''? How \n     poor are ``people without it''? Apart from one person, one \n     vote, what does it mean to be a ``political equal''? If it \n     means that one cannot legitimately attempt to acquire any \n     more political influence than anyone else has, what point is \n     there in participating in even a ``well-functioning \n     deliberative process''? And why isn't the individual \n     political freedom that is guaranteed by present First \n     Amendment doctrine the best means of securing a ``well-\n     functioning'' democracy?\n       The reason questions like those are important is that the \n     Supreme Court engages in strict scrutiny of legislation that \n     restricts campaign giving and spending. That requires the \n     Court to analyze carefully the asserted relationships between \n     ends and means--a process that can hardly go forward when the \n     ends of the legislation cannot be precisely defined and the \n     means can be rhetorically invoked but not actually spelled \n     out. Moreover, since campaign finance reforms have so often \n     turned out to have unintended--indeed perverse--consequences \n     for the political process, and since past reforms, far from \n     having leveled the political playing field, have only \n     entrenched incumbents, it appears doubly important that the \n     goals of proposed new regulations be precisely specified and \n     that the means chosen to achieve them be persuasively shown \n     to be well targeted and genuinely likely to hit their mark.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       In conclusion, current proposals for new regulation of \n     federal election campaign finance practices are \n     constitutionally indefensible. In their general conception, \n     they are nothing short of a practically complete rejection of \n     the individual and associational rights of expression and \n     political participation that the First Amendment guarantees. \n     In their specifics, the governmental interests they claim to \n     serve are neither compelling nor even legitimate. And the \n     means they deploy are neither the least restrictive nor \n     finely tailored. If they were to be enacted, and were \n     challenged in court and subjected to genuinely strict \n     scrutiny, none of the proposed regulations could survive \n     review. They could survive only if the Supreme Court decided \n     to amend the First Amendment by judicial fiat.\n\n\n                      appendix: buckley's progeny\n\n       Bellotti, widely known as the ``corporate speech'' case, \n     invalidated a Massachusetts law that prohibited banks and \n     business corporations from making expenditures to influence \n     the vote on ballot referenda that did not materially affect \n     their business, property, or assets. The Court strictly \n     scrutinized the state interests asserted in behalf of the \n     statute and the relationship between those interests and the \n     spending limitations alleged to be the means of securing them \n     and rather easily concluded that there was an insufficient \n     means-end relationship to justify the limitations.\n       Sustaining FEC limits on the amount of money that an \n     unincorporated association is permitted to give to a \n     multicandidate political committee, the Court in California \n     Medical Association v. Federal Election Commission engaged in \n     lenient review. Contributions are ``speech by proxy,'' the \n     Court declared, so limiting them did not ``restrict the \n     ability of individuals to engage in protected political \n     advocacy.'' \\68\\\n       Insisting that ``there is no significant state or public \n     interest in curtailing debate and discussion of a ballot \n     measure,'' the Court in Citizens against Rent Control v. City \n     of Berkeley \\69\\ strictly scrutinized a limitation on \n     contributions to committees formed to support or oppose \n     ballot measures. It invalidated the limitation.\n       Federal Election Commission v. National Right to Work \n     Committee was a challenge to a section of FECA that limited \n     the National Right to Work Committee to solicitation \n     of ``members.'' Declaring that it would not ``second-guess \n     a legislative determination as to the need for \n     prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil \n     feared,''\\70\\ the Court narrowly construed the section \n     and, as so construed, sustained it against a First \n     Amendment challenge.\n       But in the next case, Federal Election Commission v. \n     National Conservative Political Action Committee,\\71\\ the \n     Court reasserted its intention and authority strictly to \n     scrutinize corruption-prevention justifications, at least \n     when they were offered in support of limitations on \n     expenditures. The decision invalidated Sec. 9012(f) of the \n     Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act, which prohibited \n     political committees from making independent expenditures in \n     excess of $1,000 to support the election of a presidential \n     candidate who had opted to receive public funding. ``When the \n     First Amendment is involved,'' then-Justice Rehnquist said, a \n     ``rigorous'' standard of review is called for and deference \n     to a legislative judgment is appropriate only ``where the \n     evil of potential corruption had long been recognized.''\\72\\\n       Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for \n     Life\\73\\ was the next major campaign finance reform case. \n     Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a nonprofit, nonstock \n     corporation organized to ``foster respect for human life and \n     to defend the right to life of all human beings . . . through \n     . . . political . . . activities,'' violated FECA \n     restrictions on independent spending by corporations when it \n     financed a special edition of its newsletter in which it \n     identified and advocated the election of ``pro-life'' \n     candidates. The Court held, however, that as applied to \n     MCFL's expenditure in this case FECA was unconstitutional. \n     First, it burdened the right of the organization to make \n     independent expenditures--``expression at the core of our \n     electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms.''\\74\\ \n     Second, because ``it was formed to disseminate political \n     ideas, not to amass capital,''\\75\\ MCFL did not pose a threat \n     of ``unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes,'' \n     nor did it ``pose [a] danger of corruption.''\\76\\ Thus the \n     ``concerns underlying the regulation of corporate political \n     activity are simply absent with regard to MCFL.''\\77\\ The \n     commission's argument that it needed a broad prophylactic \n     rule like the one the Court had sustained in National Right \n     to Work Committee did not persuade the Court. National Right \n     to Work Committee involved restrictions on solicitation for a \n     political committee that made contributions to candidates, \n     whereas the regulation at issue in MCFL was a restriction on \n     independent expenditures; moreover, the administrative \n     convenience of a bright-line rule is of insufficient weight \n     to count as a compelling interest in treating two unlike \n     entities--business corporations and groups like MCFL--alike.\n       The particular restrictions on independent expenditures at \n     issue in MCFL were held unconstitutional. On the way to \n     reaching that result, however, the Court appeared to suggest \n     that if MCFL had been an ``ordinary'' corporation--one that \n     posed a threat of corruption by ``unfair deployment of wealth \n     for political purposes'' instead of one formed for the \n     particular purpose of engaging in political advocacy--the \n     case might have come out differently.\n       That suggestion bore fruit in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce,\\78\\ in which the Court sustained a state law \n     prohibiting the use of corporate treasury funds to make \n     independent expenditures in support of or in opposition to \n     candidates in elections for state office. The state defended \n     the expenditure prohibition on the ground that ``the unique \n     legal and economic characteristics of corporations \n     necessitate some regulation of their political expenditures \n     to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.'' \n     Justice Marshall's majority opinion upholding the restriction \n     accepted that formulation of the corruption-prevention \n     rationale and in doing so seemingly embraced a conception of \n     legislative power to define and prevent ``corruption'' \n     different from, more expansive than, and much less precise \n     than that which the Buckley court had endorsed. Buckley and \n     its progeny had limited legislative power to define \n     corruption by focusing on corruption's deleterious effect on \n     the integrity of elected officials. Corruption that \n     legislatures may prevent occurs only when ``[e]lected \n     officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations \n     of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or \n     infusions of money into their campaigns. The hallmark of \n     corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for \n     political favors.''\\79\\ The Austin opinion implied that \n     legislatures could choose to define ``corruption'' to include \n     imprecisely defined untoward effects that spending might have \n     not just on the behavior of elected officials but also on the \n     electoral process itself.\\80\\\n       Although it may signal a departure from Buckley's limiting \n     principles, the precise extent to which Austin undermines \n     Buckley's\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\n     constraints on legislative power to define corruption remains \n     unclear for at least two reasons. First, the Austin Court \n     made much of the fact that the restriction at issue there was \n     imposed on corporate expenditure of treasury funds, thus \n     hinting that had the prohibition applied to independent \n     expenditures by individuals, or even by separate segregated \n     corporate political action committees, the result would have \n     been different and the prohibition would have been struck \n     down. Second, Justice Marshall's opinion is obscure about \n     the meaning it ascribes to the term ``corruption.'' \n     Although the opinion is larded with prejorative and \n     evocative references to the ``influence of political war \n     chests''\\81\\ and the ``corrosive and distorting effects of \n     immense aggregations of wealth,''\\82\\ it does not describe \n     a normative baseline of legitimacy that would permit a \n     disinterested observer to detect a genuine threat of \n     ``corruption'' in any particular campaign finance \n     practice. The most the opinion does in that regard is to \n     suggest that the distortion that is a permissible target \n     of the legislature's concern stems from the fact that \n     ``the resources in the treasury of a business corporation \n     . . . are not an indication of popular support for the \n     corporation's political ideas.''\\83\\ Unfortunately, the \n     opinion fails to explain the First Amendment principle \n     that gives that fact the power to transform the most \n     highly protected category of core political speech into an \n     activity subject to complete legislative proscription.\n       The Supreme Court's most recent pronouncement on the \n     constitutionality of campaign finance regulations came in the \n     1996 case of Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, \n     in which the Court held seven to two that independent \n     expenditures by political parties cannot constitutionally be \n     limited by Congress. Two justices, Stevens and Ginsburg, \n     dissented. They signaled that they were prepared to retreat \n     from Buckley; they would have held that any spending by a \n     political party represents a contribution to a candidate and \n     can accordingly be limited, and they were prepared to defer \n     to Congress's judgment that measures to level the political \n     playing field were necessary and that there was too much \n     spending on political campaigns. The other justices stayed \n     well within the Buckley framework, and four of them would \n     have gone further to safeguard the First Amendment than did \n     Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court. Justice Kennedy, for \n     example, got the support of Chief Justice Rehnquist and \n     Justice Scalia for his position that spending by political \n     parties, even if it is coordinated with candidates, cannot be \n     restricted pursuant to the First Amendment because to \n     restrict party spending is to stifle what parties exist to \n     do. Justice Thomas, in a strongly argued opinion, endorsed \n     abandoning Buckley's dichotomy between contributions and \n     expenditures and advocated treating contribution and \n     expenditure limitations the same for First Amendment \n     purposes, subjecting both to strict scrutiny and not \n     permitting broad prophylactic corruption-preventing measures.\n\n\n                                 notes\n\n     1.

Sullivan)\n\n       [Stanley Morrison Professor of Law, Stanford University. \n     This Essay was originally the Edward L. Barrett, Jr. Lecture \n     on Constitutional Law, delivered at the University of \n     California, David School of Law on February 13, 1997.

Some find the sheer volume of money spent \n     impressive: an estimated $3 billion on all elections, $660 \n     million on electing the Congress, and $1 billion on the \n     presidential election. Others focus on the questions raised \n     about alleged fund-raising activities that are forbidden by \n     existing laws, such as contributions to political parties by \n     foreign nationals. Still others focus on ``loopholes'' in the \n     existing laws that allow their nullification as a practical \n     matter. Nearly all focus on the presumed special influence of \n     large contributors on political outcomes.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Against this backdrop has arisen a hue and cry for campaign \n     finance reform. Senators McCain and Feingold have revived a \n     proposed Senate campaign finance reform bill that withered \n     under filibuster in the 104th Congress; \\2\\ Representatives \n     Shays and Mechan have introduced comparable bipartisan \n     legislation in the House. President Clinton has endorsed \n     those bills.\\3\\ Newly retired Democratic Senator Bill Bradley \n     has called the McCain-Feingold proposal timid and advocates \n     more sweeping reforms; he favors a constitutional amendment \n     to overrule Buckley v. Valeo,\\4\\ the 1976 Supreme Court \n     decision holding that some campaign finance limits violate \n     the right of free speech.\\5\\ Other prominent advocates of the \n     overrule of Buckley include twenty-six legal scholars led by \n     Ronald Dworkin,\\6\\ and twenty-four state attorneys general \n     who argue that political money threatens the integrity of \n     elections that it is their job to defend.\\7\\ Countless \n     newspaper editorial pages have opined that the time is ripe--\n     while public outrage is high--to finally do something about \n     campaign finance reform. Voters in states such as California \n     and Oregon have adopted ballot measures imposing limits on \n     the financing of state election campaigns.\\8\\\n       In short, the view that political money should be limited \n     has become mainstream orthodoxy. Against this formidable \n     array of thoughtful opinion, I offer here a contrary view. \n     This Essay first lays out briefly the current law of \n     political money and the current landscape of proposals for \n     its reform. It then offers a critical guide to the reformers' \n     arguments by examining the political theories that more or \n     less explicitly underlie them. It concludes that the much \n     belittled constitutional case against campaign finance limits \n     is surprisingly strong, and that the better way to resolve \n     the anomalies created by Buckley v. Valeo may well be not to \n     impose new expenditure limits on political campaigns, but \n     rather to eliminate contribution limits.\n     I. The law of political money\n       In our political system, political campaigns are generally \n     funded with private money--the candidates' own resources plus \n     contributions of individuals, political parties, and \n     organized groups. The presidential campaign is an exception, \n     funded publicly since the 1976 campaign.\\9\\ In our system, \n     candidates also communicate primarily through entities that \n     are privately owned--the print and electronic press that \n     provide candidates free news coverage and opportunities for \n     paid political advertisements. One could imagine alternate \n     systems, such as public funding of parties and candidate \n     elections or public ownership of the communications media, \n     but such systems are not our own, nor likely to be our own \n     any time soon.\n       In the 1976Buckley decision, the Court held that \n     restrictions on political spending implicate freedom of \n     speech. Invalidating some portions of the post-Watergate \n     amendments to the Federal Elections Campaign Act but \n     upholding others, the Court held thatcontributions to a \n     candidate could constitutionally be limited, butexpenditures \n     could not, except as a condition of receiving public \n     funds.\\10\\ Thus, afterBuckley, candidates may spend all they \n     want, unless they are presidential candidates who have taken \n     public money; so may political parties, individuals, and \n     organized groups such as political action committees (PACs)--\n     as long as they act independently of the candidate.\\11\\ But \n     direct donations to a candidate's campaign may be limited in \n     amount. Under current federal law, an individual is limited \n     in each election to contributing one thousand dollars to a \n     candidate, five thousands dollars to a PAC, and twenty \n     thousand dollars to a national party, and must keep the grand \n     total to twenty-five thousand dollars. PACs may give only \n     five thousand dollars to a candidate, five thousand dollars \n     to another PAC, and fifteen thousand dollars to a national \n     party.\\12\\ Political parties, too, face spending limits when \n     they contribute to the campaigns of their candidates, though \n     these are higher than those for PACs.\\13\\\n       The split regime ofBuckley thus authorizes government to \n     limit thesupply of political money, but forbids it to \n     limitdemand. Why the distinction?Contributions, the Court \n     said, implicate lesser speech interests; they merely \n     facilitate or associate the contributor with speech. They \n     also raise the specter of ``corruption'' or the appearance of \n     corruption--that is, the danger of a quid pro \n     quo.\\14\\Expenditures, the Court said, are more directly \n     expressive, and involve no corruption--a candidate cannot \n     corrupt herself, and those who spend independently of the \n     candidate's campaign cannot reasonably expect a pay-back.\\15\\ \n     Nor, held the Court, could spending limits be justified by \n     the alternative rationale of equalizing political speaking \n     power, because that rationale, the Court said, is ``wholly \n     foreign to the First Amendment.'' \\16\\ Thus, the Court held, \n     the only way government may bring about political expenditure \n     limits is through a quid pro quo of its own: government may \n     induce a candidate to accept expenditures limits in exchange \n     for public subsidies.\n       Various cogent criticisms have been leveled at the \n     contribution/expenditure distinction. First, both \n     contributions and expenditures may equally express political \n     opinions. As Justice Thomas wrote last summer:\n       ``Whether an individual donates money to a candidate or \n     group who will use it to promote the candidate or whether the \n     individual spends the money to promote the candidate himself, \n     the individual seeks to engage in political expression and to \n     associate with likeminded persons. A contribution is simply \n     an indirect expenditure.'' \\17\\\n       This argues for protecting both expenditures and \n     contributions alike. Second, an ``independent'' expenditure \n     may inspire just as much gratitude by the candidate as a \n     direct contribution. This argues for regulating them both \n     alike. Finally, it has been objected, it is unclear why \n     expenditure limits may be induced with carrots if they may \n     not be compelled with sticks.\\18\\ This argues for precluding \n     private expenditure limits even as a condition of public \n     subsidies.\n       These inconsistencies arise from theBuckley Court's attempt \n     to solve an analogical crisis by splitting the \n     difference.Buckley involved nothing less than a choice \n     between two of our most powerful traditions: equality in the \n     realm of democratic polity, and liberty in the realm of \n     political speech. The Court had to decide whether outlays of \n     political money more resemble voting, on the one hand, or \n     political debate, on the other. The norm in voting is \n     equality: one person, one vote. The norm in political speech \n     is negative liberty: freedom of exchange, against a backdrop \n     of unequal distribution of resources (it has been said that \n     freedom of the press belongs to those who own one \\19\\). \n     Faced with the question of which regime ought to govern \n     regulation of political money, the Court in effect chose a \n     little of both. It treated campaign contributions as more \n     like voting, where individual efforts may be equalized, and \n     campaign expenditures as more like speech, where they may \n     not.\n     II. Leading reform proposals\n       Currently on the table are three type of reform proposals \n     to impose new restrictions on political money. One advocates \n     further limiting campaign contributions. The second proposes \n     more conditioning of benefits upon corresponding \n     ``voluntary'' limits on private spending. The third would \n     place outright restrictions on campaign expenditures. The \n     first two seek to operate within theBuckley framework; the \n     third would overruleBuckley in part.\n       The first type of reform proposal would ``close loopholes'' \n     in the existing regulatory scheme by extending the reach of \n     contribution limits. For example, there are currently no \n     restrictions on contribution ``bundling'' by intermediaries. \n     One political entrepreneur may collect several individual \n     contributions of one thousand dollars each and turn over the \n     entire sum to the candidate, PAC, or party--taking political \n     credit for a much larger amount than she personally could \n     have contributed. Some reform proposals, such as McCain-\n     Feingold, would treat such ``bundled'' contributions as \n     contributions by the intermediary, and therefore subject to \n     the otherwise applicable contribution limits.\\20\\ In other \n     words, no more bundling.\\21\\\n       Other such proposals would impose contribution limits on \n     so-called ``soft money''--\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\n     those sums that now may be given without limit by \n     individuals, PACs, and even corporations and labor unions \n     (who are forbidden to give directly to candidates) to \n     political parties for purposes of grass-roots ``party-\n     building'' activities. Since the 1988 campaign, use of soft \n     money to finance de facto campaign advertisements has \n     proliferated. Advertisements celebrating one's party, its \n     stand on issues, or the accomplishments of its leadership, \n     after all, do serve to build party loyalty; but to the \n     untutored eye, they may be difficult to distinguish from \n     campaign ads. The same is true of soft money ads attacking \n     the other party. The amount of soft money raised by the two \n     major parties combined has increased from $89 million in 1992 \n     to $107 million in 1994 to roughly $250 million in 1996.\\22\\ \n     Some reform proposals, again including McCain-Feingold, would \n     limit soft money contributions.\\23\\ The Democratic National \n     Committee has announced its intention to limit annual soft \n     money contributions from an individual, corporation, or union \n     to one hundred thousand dollars, and President Clinton said \n     that the Democratic Party would stop taking any soft money if \n     the Republicans would do the same.\\24\\\n       Would such new contribution limits be constitutional under \n     the Buckley regime? Any limit on party expenditures of soft \n     money would likely be struck down by the current Court in \n     light of its recent decision that political parties may make \n     unlimited independent expenditures on behalf of a particular \n     candidate.\\25\\ But limits on contributions, under Buckley, \n     are another matter. The Court has previously upheld ceilings \n     on individual contributions to PACs on the ground that such \n     restrictions prevent end runs around limits on contributions \n     to candidates.\\26\\ Bundling and soft money contribution \n     limits might be defended along similar lines, although they \n     also raise novel and questionable burdens on the right of \n     association.\\27\\\n       The second category of reform proposal would find new means \n     to use public funds or other public benefits to induce \n     candidates to agree to ``voluntary'' spending limits--a \n     practice that Buckley held constitutional, at least as to \n     full public financing of presidential campaigns. Extending \n     full public funding with attached spending limits from \n     presidential to congressional campaigns would be the most \n     obvious version of such reform, but is probably politically \n     infeasible. Some proposals seek to offer smaller carrots, \n     including ones that would not directly incur public expense. \n     For example, the McCain-Feingold Senate bill would extract \n     from broadcasters free and discounted broadcast time. The \n     bill would in turn give the time, as well as postage \n     discounts, to those Senate candidates who complied with \n     specified spending limits.\\28\\ California's Proposition 208 \n     would give free space in the ballot statement and allow \n     higher contributions to candidates who adopted spending \n     limits.\\29\\\n       Such proposals too raise First Amendment questions despite \n     the public funding ruling in Buckley. For example, while a \n     private funding ban might reasonably further the goal of full \n     public financing of an election--in order to level the \n     playing field--it is hardly clear that private spending \n     limits are equally justified by the relatively trivial \n     communications subsidies proposed in these bills. And of \n     course, the broadcasters might object to the extraction of \n     ``free'' air time as an unconstitutional compulsion of \n     speech.\\30\\\n       The third, most dramatic type of proposal would overrule \n     the expenditure holding in Buckley and permit spending limits \n     outright. Since the current Court seems quite uninterested in \n     overruling Buckley, the most plausible vehicle for such a \n     reform would be some type of constitutional amendment. Most \n     advocates of such a reform support an amendment authorizing \n     Congress to reimpose expenditure limits as under the pre-\n     Buckley status quo, while leaving the authority to impose \n     contribution limits intact.\n     III. The political theory of campaign finance reform, or the \n         supposed seven deadly sins of political money\n       What political theory supports arguments for campaign \n     finance reform? Arguments for greater limits on political \n     contributions and expenditures typically suggest that any \n     claims for individual liberty to spend political money ought \n     yield to an overriding interest in a well-functioning \n     democracy. But what is meant by democracy here? The answer is \n     surprisingly complex; several distinct arguments that \n     democracy requires campaign finance limits are often lumped \n     together. I will try to disaggregate them and critically \n     assess each one. The reformers might be said to have \n     identified seven, separate, supposedly deadly sins of \n     unregulated political money.\n       A. Political inequality in voting\n       The first argument for campaign finance limits is that they \n     further individual rights to political equality among voters \n     in an election. This argument starts from the principle of \n     formal equality of suffrage embodied in the one person, one \n     vote rule that emerged from the reapportionment cases.\\31\\ \n     Each citizen is entitled to an equal formal opportunity, ex \n     ante, to influence the outcome of an election. Moreover, each \n     person's vote is inalienable; it may not be traded to others \n     for their use, nor delegated to agents. Literal vote-buying \n     is regarded as a paradigm instance of undemocratic conduct. \n     We no longer countenance gifts of turkeys or bottles of \n     liquor to voters on election day, nor the counting of dead \n     souls. These qualities of voting distinguish the electoral \n     sphere from the marketplace, where goods and services, unlike \n     votes, are fungible, commensurable, and tradeable.\n       Reformers often proceed from the premise of equal suffrage \n     in elections to the conclusion that equalization of speaking \n     power in electoral campaigns is similarly justifiable in \n     furtherance of democracy. The most radical of such proposals \n     would bar expenditures of private campaign funds altogether, \n     and limit candidates to spending public funds allocated to \n     each voter equally in the form of vouchers that could be used \n     solely for election-related speech.\\32\\ The principle here \n     would be one person, one vote, one dollar.\\33\\\n       More commonly, however, the analogy to voting is meant to \n     be suggestive, not literal; few go so far as to say that \n     campaign finance limits are constitutionally compelled, as \n     equipopulous districts are. Nor do most advocates of campaign \n     finance reform argue for literal equality in electoral \n     expenditures; the asserted right to equal political influence \n     on the outcome of electoral campaigns is usually depicted as \n     aspirational. But reformers argue that the goal of equal \n     citizen participation in elections at least helps to justify \n     campaign finance limits as constitutionally permissible.\\34\\ \n     On this view, campaign finance amounts to a kind of shadow \n     election, and unequal campaign outlays amount to a kind of \n     metaphysical gerrymander by which some votes count more than \n     others in that shadow election.\n       Such arguments from formal equality of the franchise to \n     campaign finance restrictions, however, often fail to \n     articulate a crucial intermediate step: that political \n     finance sufficiently resembles voting as to be regulable by \n     the equality norms that govern voting. There is an \n     alternative possibility: that political finance more \n     resembles political speech than voting. That is the analogy \n     drawn by the Buckley Court, at least with respect to \n     expenditures. The choice of analogy is crucial. In the formal \n     realm of voting--like other formal governmental settings, \n     such as legislative committee hearings and trials in court--\n     speech may be constrained in the interest of the governmental \n     function in question. For example, at a town meeting, \n     Robert's Rules of Order govern to ensure that orderly \n     discussion may take place; at a trial, witnesses testify not \n     to all they know but to what they are asked about, subject to \n     rules of evidence and the constraints of relevant rights of \n     the parties. Likewise, one voter does not get ten votes \n     merely because he feels passionately about a candidate or \n     issue.\n       By contrast, in the informal realm of political speech--the \n     kind that goes on continuously between elections as well as \n     during them--conventional First Amendment principles \n     generally preclude a norm of equality of influence. Political \n     speakers generally have equal rights to be free of government \n     censorship, but not to command the attention of other \n     listeners. Under virtually any theory of the justification \n     for free speech, legislative restrictions on political speech \n     may not be predicated on the ground that the political \n     speaker will have too great a communicative impact, or his \n     competitor too little. Conventional First Amendment norms of \n     individualism, relativism, and antipaternalism preclude any \n     such affirmative equality of influence--not only as an end-\n     state but even as an aspiration. Indeed, such equality of \n     participation as speakers in political debate is foreign even \n     under the more collectivist approach to political speech \n     outlined by Alexander Meiklejohn, who famously noted that the \n     First Amendment ``does not require that, on every occasion, \n     every citizen shall take part in public debate. . . . What is \n     essential is not that everyone shall speak, but that \n     everything worth saying shall be said.'' \\35\\\n       A few perceptive reform advocates have noticed this problem \n     and sought to fill in the missing step--the analogy between \n     political finance and voting that would make equality norms \n     relevant to both. For example, Ronald Dworkin, who largely \n     accepts arguments for unfettered political speech in other \n     contexts, rests his argument for campaign finance limits on \n     the proposition that the right to equal participation as \n     voters must be understood to entail a corollary right to \n     equal participation as advocates in the electoral campaigns \n     that precede and determine the vote:\n       ``Citizens play two roles in a democracy. As voters they \n     are, collectively, the final referees or judges of political \n     contests. But they also participate, as individuals, in the \n     contests they collectively judge: they are candidates, \n     supporters, and political activists; they lobby and \n     demonstrate for and against government measures, and they \n     consult and argue about them with their fellow citizens. . . \n     .  [W]hen wealth is unfairly distributed and money dominates \n     politics, . . . though individual citizens may be equal in \n     their vote and their freedom to hear the candidates they wish \n     to hear, they are not equal in their own ability to command \n     the attention of others for their own candidates, interests, \n     and convictions.\\86\\\n       In other words, formal equality of voting power implies a \n     corollary right to equality in the opportunity to speak out \n     in politics--at least in the particular subset of political \n     speech that is made in connection with electoral \n     campaigns.\\87\\\n       But what are the boundaries of an electoral campaign? \n     Dworkin does not suggest that equalization of speaking power \n     is a satisfactory justification for limitations of political \n     speech in other contexts. Yet his own examples belie any easy \n     distinction between\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\n     the formal realm of electoral discourse, which he would \n     regulate, and the informal realm of ongoing political \n     discourse, which he presumably would not. For example, he \n     lists ``lobbying'' and ``demonstrations'' as examples of \n     relevant forms of citizen participation. But lobbying and \n     demonstrations could not, without great alteration in \n     ordinary First Amendment understandings, be regulated on the \n     ground that their leaders had amassed too many resources. \n     Further, elections are seamlessly connected to the informal \n     political debates that continue in the periods between them. \n     The more electoral campaign speech is continuous with such \n     ordinary informal political discourse, the less campaign \n     finance resembles voting, and the more it partakes of a realm \n     of inevitable inequality.\\88\\\n       The reformers might answer that the equality principle \n     could be confined to speech made expressly by candidates or \n     their committees during formal electoral campaigns, defined \n     by reference to some particular period in relation to \n     elections. But now practical difficulties arise even as \n     analytical difficulties subside. Such an approach would leave \n     unregulated advocacy that redounds to the benefit of \n     candidates by persons, parties, and organizations independent \n     of them. To the extent such independent speech operates as a \n     substitute for express candidate speech--even if an imperfect \n     one--the principle of equality of voter participation \n     advanced by the limits on formal campaign expenditures will \n     be undermined.\n       An alternate response by reformers might be to question \n     conventional First Amendment principles generally, and to \n     assert political equality as a justification for regulating a \n     wide range of informal political discourse. Such an approach \n     raises large questions that go beyond the topic here. The key \n     point for now is simply that, short of major revision of \n     general First Amendment understandings, campaign finance \n     reform may not be predicated on equality of citizen \n     participation in elections unless electoral speech can be \n     conceptually severed from informal political discourse. But \n     formal campaign speech has so many informal political \n     substitutes that this proposition is difficult to sustain.\n       B. Distortion\n       A second argument against unregulated private campaign \n     finance is related to the first, but focuses less on \n     individual rights than on collective consequences. This \n     argument says that the unequal deployment of resources in \n     electoral campaigns causes the wrong people to get elected, \n     distorting the true preferences of voters.\\89\\ Good \n     candidates who cannot surmount the high financial barriers to \n     entry never get to run, and the choice among those who do is \n     influenced by spending power that is not closely correlated \n     to the popularity of the candidate's ideas. On this view, \n     unequal funding leads both candidates and voters to \n     misidentify the electorate's actual preferences and \n     intensities of preference.\n       The Supreme Court has accepted such an argument as \n     sufficient to justify some administrative burdens on the \n     deployment of political money. In Austin v. Michigan Chamber \n     of Commerce,\\40\\ the Court upheld a state requirement that \n     corporations (except nonprofit corporations organized solely \n     for ideological purposes \\41\\) make political expenditures \n     solely from separate segregated political funds, not from \n     their general treasuries.\\42\\ The Court reasoned that the \n     government's interest in preventing the ``distortion'' of the \n     apparent strength.\\43\\ A corporation that spent, for \n     political purposes, money raised for investment purposes, \n     would make it appear that there was more enthusiasm for the \n     ideas it backed than was warranted. Funds raised for \n     expressly political purposes and segregated in a separate \n     political fund or corporate PAC, by contrast, would represent \n     a more accurate proxy for the popularity of the ideas they \n     supported.\n       Campaign finance reformers would extend this antidistortion \n     principle beyond the particular problems of the corporate \n     form at issue in Austin. They suggest that the ability to \n     amass political funds in general does not correlate closely \n     with voter preferences. Rather, the unequal distribution of \n     campaign resources leads to misrepresentation of \n     constituents' actual preferences and intensities of \n     preference. The wealthy (or those who are good at fund-\n     raising) can spend more money on a candidate they care \n     relatively little about than can the poor (or those who are \n     inept at fundraising) on a candidate to whom they are \n     passionately committed. To the extent such ``distorted'' \n     campaign speech influences voting, candidates will be elected \n     and platforms endorsed that differ from what voters would \n     otherwise choose.\n       This argument has both practical and conceptual \n     difficulties. First, a candidate's ability to attract funds \n     is at least to some extent an indicator of popularity.\\44\\ \n     Money may flow directly in response to the candidate's ideas \n     or indirectly in response to the candidate's popularity with \n     others as reflected in poll numbers and the like.\\45\\ To the \n     extent that fundraising accurately reflects popularity, the \n     reformers exaggerate the degree of distortion. Second, there \n     are limits to how far private funding can permit a candidate \n     to deviate from positions acceptable to the mass of \n     noncontributing voters; the free press will to some extent \n     correct information provided in the candidate's \n     advertisements, and polls will discipline the candidate to \n     respond to preferences other than those of his wealthiest \n     backers.\\46\\\n       A third and deeper problem is that the concept of \n     ``distortion'' assumes a baseline of ``undistorted'' voter \n     views and preferences. But whether any such thing exists \n     exogenously to political campaigns is unclear. Popular \n     attitudes about public policy do not exist in nature, but are \n     formed largely in response to cues from political candidates \n     and party leaders. Moreover, the institutional press--itself \n     owned by large corporations commanding disproportionate power \n     and resources--plays a large role in shaping public opinion. \n     Any attempt to equalize campaign spending would still leave \n     untouched any ``distortion'' from the role of the press.\\47\\\n       C. Corruption, or political inequality in representation\n       A third argument for limiting political contributions and \n     expenditures is often made under the heading of fighting \n     political ``corruption.'' This is a misnomer. Properly \n     understood, this argument is a variation on the political \n     inequality argument.\\48\\ But unlike the first argument above, \n     it focuses not on the unequal influence of voters on \n     elections, but on the elected legislators' unequal \n     responsiveness to different citizens once in office. The \n     charge against unregulated political money here is that it \n     makes citizens unequal not in their ability to elect the \n     candidates of their choice, but in their ability to affect \n     legislative outcomes.\\49\\\n       The Court in Buckley held contribution limits permissible \n     to prevent ``corruption'' or the appearance of corruption of \n     legislators by contributors of significant sums. Popular \n     rhetoric about political money often employs similar \n     metaphors: polls show substantial majorities who say that \n     Congress is ``owned'' by special interests or ``for sale'' to \n     the highest bidder. It is important to note, however, that \n     the ``corruption'' charged here is not of the Tammany Hall \n     variety. There is no issue of personal inurement; the money \n     is not going into candidates' pockets but into television \n     advertisements, the earnings of paid political consultants, \n     and various other campaign expenses that increase the chances \n     of election or reelection. This is true a fortiori for \n     expenditures made independent of the candidate's campaign.\n       The claimed harm here is not, as the term ``corruption'' \n     misleadingly suggests, the improper treatment of public \n     office as an object for market exchange, but a deviation from \n     appropriate norms of democratic representation. Officeholders \n     who are disproportionately beholden to a minority of powerful \n     contributors, advocates of finance limits say, will shirk \n     their responsibilities to their other constituents, altering \n     decisions they otherwise would have made in order to repay \n     past contributions and guarantee them in the future. Thus, \n     properly understood, the ``corruption'' argument is really a \n     variant on the problem of political equality; unequal outlays \n     of political money create inequality in political \n     representation.\n       Again, the difficulties with the argument are both \n     practical and conceptual. First, political money is not \n     necessarily very effective in securing political results. The \n     behavior of contributors provides some anecdotal support: \n     Many corporate PACs, to borrow Judge Posner's phrase, are \n     ``political hermaphrodites'';\\50\\ they give large sums to \n     both major parties. This hedging strategy suggests a weak \n     level of confidence in their ability to obtain results from \n     any particular beneficiary of their contributions.\n       President Clinton captured the same point at a press \n     conference where he said that he gives major donors an \n     opportunity for a ``a respectful hearing'' but not a \n     ``guaranteed result.'' \\51\\ While this comment might elicit \n     skepticism, the proposition that campaign donations are a \n     relatively unreliable investment has empirical support. \n     Various studies of congressional behavior suggests that \n     contributions do not strongly affect congressional voting \n     patterns, which are for the most part dominated by \n     considerations of party and ideology.\\52\\ Of course, such \n     evidence may be countered \\53\\ by noting that contributors \n     may be repaid in many ways besides formal floor votes--for \n     example, by relatively invisible actions in agenda-setting \n     and drafting in committees. Furthermore, the few votes \n     that are dominated by contributions may occur when there \n     is the greatest divergence between contributors' and other \n     constituents' interests. Still, the case that \n     contributions divert representative responsiveness is at \n     best empirically uncertain, and not a confident basis for \n     limiting political speech.\n       A second and deeper problem with the ``corruption'' \n     argument, once it is properly recast as an argument about \n     democratic representation, is conceptual. The argument \n     supposes that official action should respond to the interests \n     of all constituents, or to a notion of the public good apart \n     from the aggregation of interests, but, in any event, not to \n     the interests of a few by virtue of their campaign outlays. \n     But legislators respond disproportionately to the interests \n     of some constituents all the time, depending, for example, on \n     the degree of their organization, the intensity of their \n     interest in particular issues, and their capacity to mobilize \n     votes to punish the legislator who does not act in their \n     interests. On one view of democratic representation, \n     therefore, there is nothing wrong with private interest \n     groups seeking to advance their own ends through electoral \n     mobilization and lobbying, and for representatives to respond \n     to these targeted efforts to win election and reelection.\\54\\ \n     It is at least open to question why attempts to achieve the \n     same ends through amassing campaign\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\n     money are more suspect, at least in the absence of personal \n     inurement.\\55\\\n       But the question whether disproportionate responsiveness to \n     contributors is ultimately consistent with democratic \n     representation need not be answered to see the problem with \n     the reformers' argument. That problem is that selecting one \n     vision of good government is not generally an acceptable \n     justification for limiting speech, as campaign finance limits \n     do. Rather, what constitutes proper representation is itself \n     the most essentially contested question protected by freedom \n     of speech. The ban on seditious libel, the protection of \n     subversion advocacy, and the general hostility to political \n     viewpoint discrimination illustrate that free speech, under \n     current conceptions, protects debates about what constitutes \n     proper self-government from ultimate settlement by \n     legislatures. To be sure, legislatures are often permitted or \n     compelled to select among democratic theories, or to \n     privilege one version of representation over its competitors \n     in setting up the formal institutions of government. ``One \n     person, one vote,'' for example, privileges egalitarian \n     conceptions over various alternatives--such as the \n     inegalitarian representation provided by the United States \n     Senate. But the right to speak--and, it might be added, to \n     petition--includes the right to challenge any provisional \n     settlement a legislature might make of the question of what \n     constitutes appropriate democratic representation.\n       In other words, the ``anticorruption'' argument for \n     campaign finance reform claims the superiority of a \n     particular conception of democracy as a ground for limited \n     speech. As a result, it runs squarely up against the \n     presumptive ban on political viewpoint discrimination.\\56\\ \n     Campaign finance reformers necessarily reject pluralist \n     assumptions about the operation of democracy and would \n     restrict speech, in the form of political money to foster \n     either of two alternative political theories. First, they \n     might be thought to favor a Burkean or civic republican view, \n     in which responsiveness to raw constituent preferences of any \n     kind undermines the representative's obligation to deliberate \n     with some detachment about the public good. Alternatively, \n     they might be thought to favor a populist view in which the \n     representative ought be as close as possible to a transparent \n     vehicle for plebiscitary democracy, for the transmission of \n     polling data into policy. Either way, they conceive democracy \n     as something other than the aggregation of self-regarding \n     interests, each of which is free to seek as much \n     representation as possible.\\57\\ But surely the endorsement of \n     civic republicanism or populism--or any other vision of \n     democracy--may not normally serve as a valid justification \n     for limiting speech. Legislators may enforce an official \n     conception of proper self-government through a variety of \n     means, but not by prohibiting nonconforming expression.\n       Campaign finance reformers might object that, after all, \n     campaign finance limits in no way stop would-be pluralists \n     from advocating pluralism, but only from practicing it. The \n     utterances being silenced are performative, not \n     argumentative. Such a response, however, is in considerable \n     tension with a long tradition of First Amendment protection \n     for symbolic and associative conduct.\\58\\ A further objection \n     might be that this argument extends only to legislative \n     campaign finance reform, and not to a constitutional \n     amendment such as Senator Bradley and others have \n     proposed.\\59\\ That is surely correct, as an amendment could \n     obviously revise the existing First Amendment conceptions on \n     which the argument rests. But, apart from general reasons to \n     tread cautiously in amending the Constitution, it might well \n     be thought especially risky to attempt by amendment to \n     overrule a constitutional decision that is part of the \n     general fabric of First Amendment law, as the anomaly created \n     by the new amendment might well have unanticipated effects on \n     other understandings of free speech.\\60\\\n       D. Carpetbagging\n       A fourth strand of the reform argument is a variant of the \n     third, with special reference to geography. Except in \n     presidential elections, we vote in state or local \n     constituencies. The fundamental unit of representation is \n     geographic. But money travels freely across district and \n     state lines. Thus, political money facilitates \n     metaphysical carpetbagging. Contributions from or \n     expenditures by nonconstituent individuals and groups \n     divert a legislator's representation away from the \n     constituents in his district and toward nonconstituents, \n     whether they are foreign corporations or national lobbies. \n     Various reform proposals seek to limit carpetbagging by \n     localizing funding: McCain-Feingold, for example, would \n     require candidates not only to limit expenditures but also \n     to raise a minimum percentage of contributions from \n     residents of their home state in order to receive public \n     benefits, such as broadcast and postage discounts.\\61\\\n       Again, this seeks to decide by legislation a question of \n     what constitutes proper representation. To some, it might be \n     legitimate for a legislator to consider the views of national \n     lobbies. For example, those lobbies might share strong \n     overlapping interests with her own constituents. Or the \n     legislator might conceive her obligation as running to the \n     nation as well as a particular district. For the reasons just \n     given, a privileged theory of what constitutes proper \n     political representation cannot serve as an adequate ground \n     for limitation of speech, for free speech is itself the \n     central vehicle for debating that very question.\n       E. Diversion of legislative and executive energies\n       A fifth critique of the current role of political money, \n     made often by politicians themselves and sometimes elaborated \n     as an argument for campaign reform, is that fundraising takes \n     too much of politicians' time.\\62\\ Many think that incumbents \n     spend so much time fundraising that governance has become a \n     part-time job.\n       This argument supposes a sharp divide between the public \n     activity of governing and the private role of fundraising. \n     But this distinction is hardly clear. The ``marketing'' \n     involved in fundraising consists principally of conveying and \n     testing response to information about past and future policy \n     positions. How this differs from the standard material of all \n     political campaigning is unclear, and it may well be \n     continuous with governing. If the need for fundraising were \n     eliminated, legislators would still have to nurture their \n     constituencies in various ways between elections. Some might \n     think that nurturing grass roots is a more wholesome activity \n     than nurturing fat cast; but in that case, the diversion of \n     energies problem simply collapses back into the problem of \n     inequality in political representation discussed earlier.\\63\\ \n     To the extent the candidate makes secret promises to PACs or \n     wealthy individuals that would be unpopular with the mass of \n     the electorate, there are strong practical limits to such \n     strategies, such as the danger of press exposure and \n     constituent retaliation.\n       However serious the problem of incursion on the candidate's \n     time might be, one thing is clear: the split regime of \n     Buckley exacerbates it. Contribution limits mean that a \n     candidate has to spend more time chasing a larger number of \n     contributors than she would have to do if contributions could \n     be unlimited in amount. Concern about time, therefore, may \n     involve a tradeoff with concern about disproportionate \n     influence.\n       F. Quality of debate\n       A sixth critique of the unregulated outlay of political \n     money arises on the demand side rather than the supply side. \n     The problem, in a word, is television. Where does all this \n     political money go? The biggest expense is the cost of \n     purchasing advertising time on television (though \n     increasingly, political consultants take a hefty share). The \n     critics regard repetitious, sloganeering spot advertisements \n     as inconsistent with the enlightened rational deliberation \n     appropriate to an advanced democracy. It is not clear what \n     golden age of high-minded debate they hark back to; the \n     antecedent of the spot ad is, after all, the bumper sticker. \n     Nonetheless, these critics clearly aspire to something wiser \n     and better. Ronald Dworkin's lament is representative: ``The \n     national political `debate' is now directed by advertising \n     executives and political consultants and conducted mainly \n     through thirty-second, `sound bite' television and radio \n     commercials that are negative, witless, and condescending.'' \n     \\64\\ Political expenditure limits, some suggest, would cut \n     off the supply of oxygen to this spectacle and force \n     candidates into less costly but more informative venues such \n     as written materials and town hall debates.\n       To the extent this rationale for campaign finance reform is \n     made explicit, it would appear flatly precluded by \n     conventional First Amendment antipaternalism principles. \n     Permitting limitations on speech because it is too vulgar or \n     lowbrow would wipe out a good many pages of U.S. Reports. \n     Surely a judgment that speech is too crass or appeals to base \n     instincts is a far cry from Robert's Rules of Order or other \n     principles of ordered liberty consistent with government \n     neutrality toward the content of speech.\n       In any event, the indirect means of limiting expenditures \n     may not do much to solve this problem. Why not directly ban \n     political advertising on television outright? Then everyone \n     could campaign on smaller budgets. British politicians, for \n     example, are barred from taking out paid spots on the \n     airwaves. But Britain has strong parties and small districts; \n     we have neither. Banning television advertising in our \n     political culture would impair politicians', especially \n     challengers', ability to reach large masses of the \n     electorate. Banning television advertisements might make us \n     more republican, but it is hardly clear that it would make us \n     more democratic. Moreover, the special First Amendment \n     dispensation the Court has shown for broadcast regulation is \n     increasingly tenuous, and has not been extended to other, \n     increasingly competitive media. To be fully effective, a ban \n     on television advertising might have to extend to cable and \n     the internet, where the constitutional plausibility of \n     regulation is even more dubious.\n       G. Lack of competitiveness\n       Finally, a last argument would locate the key problem in \n     current campaign finance practices in the advantage it \n     confers on incumbents over challengers. Here the claim is \n     that a healthy democracy depends on robust political \n     competition and that campaign finance limits are needed to \n     ``level the playing field.'' The reformers contend that \n     unfettered political money confers an anticompetitive \n     advantage upon incumbents. This advantage arises because \n     incumbents participate in current policymaking that \n     affects contributors' interests. Thus, they enjoy \n     considerable fundraising leverage\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n     while in office, and indeed, incumbents received on \n     average four times as much in contributions than \n     challengers in the 1996 congressional election.\\65\\ This \n     incumbent advantage, reformers argue, limits turnover and \n     makes challengers less effective at monitoring and \n     checking incumbents' responsiveness. It is no accident \n     that, for such reasons, some prominent supporters of \n     campaign finance reform, such as Republican Senator Fred \n     Thompson of Tennessee, a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold \n     bill, are also prominent supporters of term limits.\n       But there is some practical reason to think this argument \n     gets the competitiveness point backwards. Campaign finance \n     limits themselves may help to entrench incumbents in \n     office.\\66\\ Incumbency confers enormous nonfinancial \n     advantages: name recognition, opportunity to deliver \n     benefits, publicity from the free press, and the franking \n     privilege. To offset these advantages, challengers must amass \n     substantial funds. Challengers' lack of prominence may make \n     it more difficult for them to raise funds from large numbers \n     of small donations. They may therefore depend more than \n     incumbents on concentrated aid from parties, ideologically \n     sympathetic PACs, or even wealthy individual private \n     backers.\\67\\ Of course, once again, contribution limits under \n     the split regime of Buckley exacerbate the problem, as \n     incumbents are more likely to be able to raise a large number \n     of capped contributions than challengers can.\n       The effect of regulation or nonregulation on the \n     competitiveness of elections is a difficult empirical \n     question.\\68\\ But any prediction that campaign regulation \n     will increase electoral competitiveness and turnover is, by \n     virtue of its very empirical uncertainty, at least a \n     questionable ground for limiting political speech.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The discussion to this point has sought to disentangle the \n     separate elements of the campaign finance reformers' \n     arguments about the evils of unregulated political money and \n     to suggest why the proposed cure for the seven deadly sins \n     might be worse than the disease, even on the reformers' own \n     assumptions.\\69\\ I have sought also to show why limits on \n     political money are in deeper tension with current First \n     Amendment conceptions than is often supposed. Buckley's \n     declaration of the impermissibility of redistribution of \n     speaking power has been widely criticized; \\70\\ the effort \n     here has been to show alternative reasons why the \n     justifications for campaign finance reform might trigger \n     First Amendment skepticism. These reasons include the \n     inseverability of campaign speech from ordinary political \n     discourse and the viewpoint basis inherent in campaign \n     finance reform's selection of one conception of democratic \n     representation over its competitors as a basis for curtailing \n     speech.\n       If these alternative reasons have any force, then it is \n     easier to see why campaign finance reform is especially prone \n     to following the law of unintended consequences: for example, \n     limits on individual contributions helped to increase the \n     number of PACs; limits on hard money contributions stimulated \n     the proliferation of soft money contributions; and limits on \n     contributions generally spurred the growth of independent \n     expenditures.\\71\\ The reason is not just that the demand for \n     political money is peculiarly inelastic and thus, like the \n     demand for other addictive substances, likely to create black \n     markets in the shadow of regulation. The reason is that grim \n     efforts to close down every ``loophole'' in campaign finance \n     laws will inevitably trench unacceptably far upon current \n     conceptions of freedom of political speech. Even if formal \n     campaign expenditures and contributions are limited, the \n     reformers' justifications attenuate as the law reaches the \n     informal political speech that serves as a partial substitute \n     for formal campaign speech. Without altering conventional \n     free speech norms about informal political discourse, there \n     are outer limits on the ability of any reform to limit these \n     substitution effects.\n       What scenario are we left with if both political \n     expenditure and contribution limits are deemed \n     unconstitutional? Will political money proliferate \n     indefinitely, along with its accompanying harms? Not \n     necessarily, provided that the identity of contributors is \n     required to be vigorously and frequently disclosed. Arguments \n     against compelled disclosure of identity, strong in contexts \n     where disclosure risks retaliation,\\72\\ are weaker in the \n     context of attempts to influence candidate elections, as the \n     Buckley decision itself recognized in upholding the \n     disclosure requirements of the 1974 FECA amendments.\\73\\ \n     Weekly disclosure in the newspapers, or better, daily \n     reporting on the internet, would be a far cry from earlier \n     failed sunshine laws. If the lists of names and figures \n     seemed too boring to capture general attention, enterprising \n     journalists could ``follow the money'' and report on any \n     suspect connections between contributions and policymaking.\n       Under this regime--in which contributions and expenditures \n     were unlimited, but the identities of contributors were \n     made meaningfully public--there would be at least three \n     reasons for modest optimism that the harms the reformers \n     fear from unlimited political money would in fact be \n     limited.\n     A. Increased supply\n       If contributions, like expenditures, could not be limited \n     in amount, the total level of contributions might be expected \n     to increase as there might be a net shift from expenditures \n     to contributions. The supply of political money to candidates \n     would be increased. This might be expected to lower the \n     ``price'' to the candidate of a political contribution. With \n     more quids on offer, a politician has less reason to commit \n     to any particular quo. In this politicians' buyers' market, \n     concerns about unequal political influence that arise under \n     the misleading ``corruption'' heading would arguably \n     attenuate, and contributors might curtail their outlays in \n     response to their declining marginal returns.\n     B. Decreased symbolic costs from subterfuge\n       If contributions could be made in unlimited amounts, would-\n     be contributors would not have to resort to the devices of \n     independent advertisements or party contributions as \n     substitutes. Public perception of a campaign finance system \n     gone out of control rests at least in part on the view that \n     politicians, parties, and donors skirt existing laws by \n     exploiting evasive ``loopholes.'' To the extent that all \n     functional contributions are made as explicit contributions, \n     the symbolic costs of the current split regime of Buckley \n     would decrease.\n     C. Voter retaliation\n       With contributions fully disclosed and their effects on \n     political outcomes subject to monitoring by the free press, \n     voters would be empowered to penalize candidates whose \n     responsiveness to large contributors they deemed excessive. \n     Voters could do retail what campaign finance reform seeks to \n     do wholesale: encourage diversification in the sources of \n     campaign funding. Political challengers could capitalize on \n     connections between political money and incumbents' official \n     actions. A striking demonstration of this point arose in the \n     1996 presidential election, when the Dole campaign's attack \n     on alleged Democratic fund-raising scandals drove President \n     Clinton's poll numbers into a temporary freefall.\\74\\ \n     Political money would itself be an election issue; a \n     candidate would have to decide which was worth more to her--\n     the money, or the bragging rights to say that she did not \n     take it.\n       Of course, the harms of political money cannot be expected \n     to be entirely self-limiting. The deregulation outlined here \n     is only partial; compelled disclosure avoids a regime of \n     absolute laissez-faire. Even this partial deregulation might \n     have unintended consequences. Some of the reformers' goals \n     are widely shared and might require market intervention. For \n     example, achieving adequate competitiveness in elections \n     might require some public subsidies for challengers who can \n     demonstrate certain threshold levels of support--floors but \n     not ceilings for political expenditures.\\75\\ But the \n     possibilities outlined here at least suggest some hesitation \n     before deciding which way the split regime of Buckley ought \n     to be resolved.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ See generally David E.

The Court does not \n     apply strict scrutiny where the government's reason for the \n     compulsion bears no relation to the content of the compelled \n     speech. See Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. \n     622, 641-42 (1994) (reviewing content-neutral law requiring \n     cable operators to carry unwanted broadcast stations under \n     intermediate scrutiny). Broadcasters, however, have been held \n     subject to compelled carriage requirements that would be \n     unconstitutional if applied to non-broadcast speakers. \n     Compare Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 400-\n     01 (1969) (upholding mandatory reply obligations applicable \n     to broadcasters), with Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. Tornillo, 418 \n     U.S. 241, 256 (1974) (invalidating mandatory reply \n     obligations applicable to newspapers). With the obsolescence \n     of the spectrum scarcity argument on which Red Lion was \n     premised, it is unclear whether broadcasters would have a \n     compelled-speech objection to the extraction of free or \n     discounted air time for candidates as a condition of their \n     receipt of public licenses.\n     \\31\\ See Reynolds v.

See id. Like Dworkin, Baker allocates \n     political finance to the formal rather than the informal \n     realm, and hence regulable by norms of equality. See id.

Bopp, Jr., who is perhaps the most experienced lawyer \nin America in this area of the law and the bane of the FEC's \nirresponsible battalion of lawyers who have made it their mission in \nlife to harass citizen groups. For that worthy accomplishment, Mr. Bopp \ndeserves special commendation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Jim Bopp's \nrecent law review article entitled, ``The First Amendment Is Not the \nLoophole,'' which he coauthored with Richard E. Coleson.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [Reprinted from University of West Los Angeles Law Review, Volume 28, \n                                 1997]\n\n The First Amendment Is Not a Loophole: Protecting Free Expression In \n                     The Election Campaign Context\n\n             (By James Bopp, Jr.* and Richard E. Coleson**)\n\n       ``Congress shall makes no law. . . abridging the Freedom of \n     Speech. . . .''\\1\\\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       The First Amendment plainly states that Congress is to \n     ``make no law'' which would ``abridg[e] the freedom of \n     speech,''\\2\\ yet Congress enacted the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended in 1974,\\3\\ precisely \n     to abridge certain forms of speech in election campaigns. In \n     the landmark case of Buckley v. Caleo,\\4\\ the United States \n     Supreme Court struck down many FECA provisions on free \n     expression grounds.\n       For the two decades since Buckley, the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC) has fought to close the perceived loopholes \n     created by Buckley in the federal election laws, so that the \n     agency could regulate all speech relating in any way to \n     federal elections. Throughout this period, the Supreme Court \n     has repeatedly proclaimed that the First Amendment is not a \n     loophole--free expression must be protected amidst the rush \n     to impose campaign finance restrictions.\n       Undeterred, the FEC has created new theories in an attempt \n     to bypass Supreme Court holdings and pursued regulation of \n     constitutionally-protected expression. On June 26, 1996, the \n     United States Supreme Court decided the case of Colorado \n     Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (Colorado \n     Republican),\\5\\ again rejecting the FEC's creative efforts to \n     regulate political speech protected by the First Amendment. \n     This article discusses the Colorado Republican case in its \n     historical context of conflict between federal court \n     protection of free expression and attempts, by the FEC and \n     various states, to regulate protected expression in the name \n     of campaign finance reform.\n       The article is written from a practical perspective, i.e., \n     what the courts have held, not what certain theoreticians \n     would like the courts to hold.\\6\\ In Part I, ``A Primer on \n     Protected Political Expression,'' the authors will summarize \n     briefly some of the key theoretical debates, but will \n     primarily focus on the principles undergirding free political \n     expression, discuss some terms of art, and explain the sorts \n     of activity over which litigation usually arises. The robust \n     First Amendment protection of issue advocacy will be the \n     topic of Part II, ``Supreme Court Defense of Issue \n     Advocacy Through Buckley,'' and Part III, ``FEC Efforts to \n     Stifle Issue Advocacy.'' Part IV will focus on ``Other \n     Protection for Free Political Expression,'' discussing (1) \n     MCFL-type organizations, (2) members, (3) anonymous \n     literature, (4) caps on contributions and expenditures, \n     (5) political committees, (6) burden of proof, and (7) \n     prior restraint of speech. In Part V, ``A Proposal for \n     Speech-Enhancing Campaign Reform,'' the article will \n     conclude with a proposal for constitutionally-permissible \n     campaign finance reforms which would enhance, rather than \n     suppress, the free flow of speech about candidates and \n     issues of public concern which is essential to our \n     democratic Republic.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     See footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n             i. a primer on protected political expression\n\n       Our political system is based on the model of an open and \n     free marketplace of ideas. The Framers of our Constitution \n     believed that good ideas will triumph over bad ideas if the \n     People are free to debate and to champion the ideas they find \n     convincing. Free speech is not only valuable intrinsically as \n     a personal liberty, but it is a necessary prerequisite for \n     limited representative government, particularly in free \n     elections.\\7\\ This has been well stated by the District of \n     Columbia Circuit: ``If popular elections form the essence of \n     republican government, free discourse and political activity \n     formed the prerequisite for popular elections. As Madison \n     wrote, a government which is `elective, limited and \n     responsible' to the people requires `a greater freedom of \n     animadversion' than one not so structured.''\n       In our day, the Supreme Court has recognized that ``debate \n     on the qualifications of candidates [is] integral to the \n     operation of the system of government established by our \n     Constitution.'' Because the electoral process plays so \n     central a role in our conception of a free government, ``it \n     can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee [of \n     the First Amendment] has its fullest and most urgent \n     application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for \n     political office.'' \\8\\\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       This effort goes by the innocuous name of campaign finance \n     reform. While ``reform'' is generally considered a salutary \n     goal, ``reform'' is not good when it is a euphemism for \n     silencing the voice of the People at election time.\n       The Supreme Court and lower courts have repeatedly had to \n     protect the First Amendment rights of the People against \n     misguided ``reform'' efforts which impinge on essential \n     liberties.\\24\\ Truly beneficial ``reform'' would enhance \n     the power of the People to communicate and promote their \n     ideas, not repress it. Proper reform would return power to \n     the People, not enhance the power of media elite, wealthy \n     candidates, and Washington insiders to influence \n     elections--which is the ultimate outcome if the People's \n     voice through their political parties and political \n     committees is muffled or silenced.\\25\\\n       Bopp writes that this fight against unconstitutional \n     political speech restrictions advanced under the guise of \n     ``reform'' is bipartisan. That may be the case in the outside \n     world but, regrettably, that is not the situation in the \n     Senate where it appears Democrats are going to join hands in \n     delivering a crushing blow to First Amendment freedom that \n     Americans have savored for two hundred years.\n       The battle to preserve free speech rights in the election \n     context is bi-partisan and non-ideological, as evidenced by \n     the existence of the Free Speech Coalition. This Coalition is \n     co-chaired by Ellie Smeal of the Fund for the Feminist \n     Majority and David Keene of the American Conservative Union \n     and is made up of approximately 50 public interest advocacy \n     groups ranging ideologically from the left to the right, from \n     environmental activist groups to pro-business organizations, \n     and from gun control enthusiasts to the National Rifle \n     Association. The broad-based agreement on protecting free \n     expression rights in the election context was symbolized \n     recently when James Bopp, Jr., General Counsel for the \n     National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and co-author of the \n     present article, presented testimony on behalf of the Free \n     Speech Coalition before the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules \n     and Administration considering campaign finance reform.\\26\\ \n     These public policy groups agree on little else, but they \n     agree that the First Amendment protects their right to \n     advocate on issues on public concern. This is the marketplace \n     of ideas at work, with opposing groups vying for the blessing \n     of public opinion on their issue. It is America working at \n     its best.\\27\\\n       This battle for First Amendment liberty is being fought \n     over several types of activities. It will be helpful to \n     consider some of them briefly and note some terms of art.\n       A ``political action committee'' (PAC) (also sometimes \n     known as a ``political committee'' in statutes) is nothing \n     more than individuals uniting to promote issues and \n     candidates more effectively than they could do on their own. \n     \\28\\ A PAC may lawfully engage in ``express advocacy,'' i.e., \n     expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate, \\29\\ and make contributions to \n     candidates. First Amendment rights do not diminish in any way \n     because persons associate to advocate for their cause more \n     effectively; in fact, the right of citizens to band together \n     in PACs is specifically protected by the First Amendment's \n     freedom of association protections.\\30\\ Thus, pejorative \n     references to PACs as ``special interests'' which need to be \n     stifled are actually misguided attacks on the core First \n     Amendment rights of free political expression and \n     association. The marketplace-of-ideas response to a PAC \n     message one opposes is not to silence PACs but to form one's \n     own association of persons to advocate an opposing message in \n     the marketplace. \\31\\ The cacophony of competing \n     communications may sometimes be deafening and disquieting, \n     but that is the way of liberty. The road to serfdom is the \n     quiet and quiescent road. Recognizing free speech as an \n     inherent good and the necessity of free political debate and \n     association in a democratic republic, the Supreme Court has \n     permitted only limited regulation of PACs. \\32\\\n       Litigation often arises over the scope of a state's \n     definition of a political committee or PAC. Often states try \n     to channel all individuals and groups, who advocate on issues \n     in a manner which would in any way ``influence'' an election, \n     into the political committee category so that they will have \n     to register and report as if they were a political committee. \n     \\33\\ However, an organization cannot constitutionally be \n     required to register and report as a political committee \n     unless it ``major purpose'' is the nomination or election of \n     candidates. Imposing the relatively burdensome reporting \n     requirements which may be imposed on PACs on issue-advocacy \n     groups is simply too heavy a burden on free expression to be \n     permitted. \\34\\ There is no compelling governmental interest \n     to justify such a burden on First Amendment rights.\n       An ``independent expenditure'' is an expenditure made for a \n     communication which contains ``express advocacy'' and is made \n     without any prior consultation or coordination with a \n     candidate. An entity which makes an independent expenditure \n     may be required to report that expenditure, even if it is not \n     required to register and report as a political committee. \n     \\35\\\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\n       ``Issue advocacy'' is advocacy of issues without engaging \n     in express advocacy. \\36\\ For example, if a pro-life group \n     publishes a newletter on the eve of an election describing \n     Candidate D as pro-life and Candidate C as pro-abortion \n     rights in an article about the two candidates, that is issue \n     advocacy, not express advocacy, because there have been no \n     explicit words expressly advocating the election or defeat of \n     a clearly identified candidate for public office. \\37\\ The \n     candidates have been clearly identified, they are running for \n     public office, but saying that Candidate D is pro-life is not \n     express advocacy, it is issue advocacy. This is so even \n     though the statement is made in a pro-life newsletter, in a \n     discussion of candidates, on the eve of an election. \\38\\\n       A ``voter guide'' is a table showing the positions of \n     candidates on various issues. If it does not expressly \n     advocate the election or defeat of any of the identified \n     candidates, the voter guide is pure issue advocacy and may \n     not be regulated by the FEC or any state. The voter guide may \n     even indicate what is the response preferred by the \n     organization publishing the guide, e.g. by indicating a \n     favorable answer (from the perspective of the publisher) with \n     a (+) and an unfavorable response with a minus (-). Or the \n     voter guide can word the questions in such a way that a \n     candidate giving favored responses will have a ``yes'' answer \n     for every question, while a candidate giving disfavored \n     responses will have all ``no'' answers.\\39\\ These voter \n     guides may be paid for and distributed by any individual or \n     organization.\\40\\\n       Because they discuss candidates, are distributed at \n     election time, and may actually influence elections, voter \n     guides have been the target of intense efforts by the \n     FEC,\\41\\ state legislatures,\\42\\ and the Democrat Party \\43\\ \n     in an effort to force voter guide activity into the \n     definition of express advocacy and, thereby, prohibiting \n     citizens groups which publish them from doing so unless they \n     register and report as political committees. Such efforts \n     have been repeatedly rejected as courts have followed the \n     bright-line express advocacy test set out by the United \n     States Supreme Court to protect issue advocacy.\n       Advocates of McCain-Feingold cling to a groundless belief \n     that the Supreme Court is going to do a 180 and suddenly \n     retreat on decades of jurisprudence blasting such gross \n     government intrusion into First Amendment speech. A notion \n     Bopp dispels.\n\n\n      II. supreme court defense of issue advocacy through buckley\n\n       The United States Supreme Court has long and carefully \n     watched over efforts to regulate political speech in order to \n     ensure that the guarantees of the First Amendment \\44\\ are \n     not denied. This is because such restrictions ``limit \n     political expression `at the core of our electoral process \n     and of First Amendment freedoms.' '' \\45\\ All political \n     speech, including communications which expressly advocate \n     election or defeat of Supreme Court has declared: ``[T]he \n     First Amendment right to `speak one's mind . . . on all \n     public institutions' includes the right to engage in `` \n     `vigorous advocacy' no less than `abstract discussion.' '' \n     Advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates for federal \n     office is no less entitled to protection under the First \n     Amendment than the discussion of political policy generally \n     or advocacy of the passage or defeat of legislation.'' \\46\\\n       Not only has the Court afforded strong constitutional \n     protection for political speech in general, but it has \n     afforded exceptionally strong constitutional protection for \n     issue-oriented speech. As a result, the Court has repeatedly \n     given a narrowing construction to statutes regulating \n     political speech, so as to permit regulation of only express \n     advocacy, in order to shield the statutes from constitutional \n     attack. Moreover, the Supreme Court has established two \n     bright-line tests to protect the advocacy of issues in the \n     election context: (1) the ``express advocacy test'' and (2) \n     the ``major purpose test.'' \\47\\ These will be discussed in \n     turn.\n\n\n                a. the bright-line express advocacy test\n\n       In a series of cases, the United States Supreme Court has \n     drawn a distinction between express advocacy, which may be \n     regulated, and issued advocacy, which may not be regulated. \n     As shall be seen, both enjoy full First Amendment protection, \n     but the compelling interest in preventing corruption (or its \n     appearance) in the election process is only sufficiently \n     compelling to warrant some regulation of express \n     advocacy.\\48\\ No governmental interest is sufficiently \n     compelling to regulate issue advocacy.\n       In 1948, the Supreme Court considered the case of United \n     States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations (C.I.O).\\49\\ \n     C.I.O. concerned a federal statute prohibiting a corporation \n     or labor organization from making ``any expenditure in \n     connection with a federal election.'' \\50\\ Under this \n     provision, an indictment was returned against the C.I.O. and \n     its president for publishing, in The CIO News, a statement \n     urging all members of the C.I.O. to vote for a particular \n     candidate for Congress in an upcoming election.\\51\\ In \n     affirming a dismissal of the indictment, the Court observed: \n     ``If Sec. 313 were construed to prohibit the publication, by \n     corporations and unions in the regular course of conducting \n     their affairs, of periodicals advising their members, \n     stockholders or customers of danger or advantage to their \n     interests from the adoption of measures, or the election to \n     office of men espousing such measures, the gravest doubt \n     would arise in our minds as to its constitutionality.'' \\52\\\n       A lengthy footnote appended to this statement set forth \n     several passages from case law wherein the Court had declared \n     the specially protected nature of free speech concerning \n     public policy and political matters:\n       ``Free discussion of the problems of society is a cardinal \n     principle of Americanism--a principle which all are zealous \n     to preserve. Penekamp v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331, 345 [(1946)].\n       ``The case confronts us again with the duty our system \n     places on this Court to say where the individual's freedom \n     ends and the State's power begins. Choice on that border, now \n     as always delicate, is perhaps more so where the usual \n     presumption supporting legislation is balanced by the \n     preferred place given in our scheme to the great, the \n     indispensable democratic freedoms secured by the First \n     Amendment. Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 529-30 [(1945)].\n       ``For the First Amendment does not speak equivocally. It \n     prohibits any law `abridging the freedom of speech, or of the \n     press.' It must be taken as a command of the broadest scope \n     that explicit language, read in the context of a liberty-\n     loving society, will allow, Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. \n     252, 263 [(1941)].'' \\53\\\n       In 1976, the Supreme Court considered a successor statute \n     to the one discussed in C.I.O., the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971, as amended in 1974.\\54\\ This new statute was \n     reviewed in Buckley v. Valeo.\\55\\\n       Buckley dealt, inter alia, with a provision which limited \n     ``any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified \n     candidate.' '' \\55\\ The provision placed a limit on the \n     amount of an independent expenditure on behalf of a \n     candidate. However, this provision was considered to be \n     unconstitutionally vague.\\57\\ Therefore, the Court construed \n     it with another provision of the same statute to require `` \n     `relative to' a candidate to be read to mean `advocating the \n     election or defeat of' a candidate.'' \\58\\\n       However, as the Buckley Court noted, this construction \n     merely refocused the vagueness problem. The real problem, the \n     Court noted, as that: ``the distinction between discussion of \n     issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of \n     candidates may often dissolve in practical application. \n     Candidates, especially incumbents, are often intimately tied \n     to public issues involving legislative proposals and \n     governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the \n     basis of their positions on various public issues, but \n     campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.\\59\\\n       Because of the problem described, the Supreme Court settled \n     on the express advocacy test as marking the line of \n     demarcation between the permitted and the forbidden. This \n     test is constitutionally mandated because only a statute \n     regulating the express advocacy of a clearly identified \n     federal candidate has a sufficiently bright line of \n     distinction to make it constitutionally defensible. The \n     Supreme Court, in Buckley, explained the problem with a \n     quotation from Thomas v. Collins: ``[W]hether words intended \n     and designed to fall short of invitation would miss the mark \n     is a question both of intent and of effect. No speaker, in \n     such circumstances, safely could assume that anything he \n     might say upon the general subject would not be understood by \n     some as an invitation. In short, the supposedly clear-cut \n     distinction between discussion, laudation, general advocacy, \n     and solicitation puts the speaker in these circumstances \n     wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding of his \n     hearers and consequently of whatever inference may be drawn \n     as to his intent and meaning. Such a distinction offers no \n     security for free discussion. In these conditions it blankets \n     with uncertainty whatever may be said. It compels the speaker \n     to hedge and trim.\\60\\''\n       Thus, the Supreme Court, in Buckley, said that ``[t]he \n     constitutional deficiencies described in Thomas v. Collins \n     can be avoided only by reading Sec. 608(e)(1) [placing a \n     ceiling on independent expenditures] as limited to \n     communications that include explicit words of advocacy of \n     election or defeat of a candidate.'' \\61\\\n       Without such a clear line of demarcation, then, a speaker \n     is forced to ``hedge and trim'' comments made on issues of \n     public importance for fear he will be charged with forbidden \n     electioneering. This is too heavy a burden on First Amendment \n     Rights to be constitutionally permitted.\\62\\\n       The Buckley Court concluded that ``[t]he constitutional \n     deficiencies'' of such unclear statutory language could only \n     be cured by reading the statute ``to apply to expenditures \n     for communications that in express terms advocate the \n     election of a clearly identified candidate for a public \n     office.'' \\63\\ The Court added that ``[t]his construction \n     would restrict the application of Sec. 608(e)(1) to \n     communications containing express words of advocacy of \n     election or defeat, such as `vote for,' `elect,' \n     `support,' `cast your ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,' \n     `vote against,' `defeat,' `reject.' '' \\64\\\n       The Buckley Court then proceeded to determine whether the \n     statute, ``even as thus narrowly and explicitly construed, \n     impermissibly burdens the constitutional right of free \n     expression.'' \\65\\ The Court determined that the government \n     could not advance an interest in support of the statute \n     sufficient to ``satisfy the exacting scrutiny applicable to \n     limitations on core First Amendment rights of political \n     expression.'' \\66\\\n       In sum, the Court established the express advocacy test as \n     a bright-line rule to distinguish political advocacy, which \n     could be regulated, from issue advocacy, which may not.\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\n                 b. the bright-line major purpose test\n\n       In Buckley, the Supreme Court also established the bright-\n     line ``major purpose'' test. In practical application, this \n     test means that government may not require an organization \n     which makes contributions and independent expenditures to \n     register and report as a political committee unless the \n     ``major purpose'' of the organization is the election or \n     nomination of candidates for political office.\\67\\ Government \n     may, however, require that the independent expenditures be \n     reported by the organizations making them and that \n     contributions be reported by the candidate receiving them. \n     However, there is no sufficiently compelling interest to \n     justify imposing the onerous burdens imposed on a political \n     committee on an issue advocacy group.\\68\\\n       This test was set forth in the Buckley Court's discussion \n     of 2 U.S.C. Sec. 434(e), which required ``[e]very person \n     (other than a political committee or candidate) who makes \n     contributions or expenditures'' aggregating over $100 in a \n     calendar year ``other than by contribution to a political \n     committee or candidate'' to file a statement with the \n     Commission. Unlike the other disclosure provisions, this \n     section does not seek the contribution list of any \n     association. Instead, it requires direct disclosure of what \n     an individual or group contributes or spends.'' \\69\\\n       ``In considering this provision,'' the Court wrote, ``we \n     must apply the same strict standard of scrutiny, for the \n     right of associational privacy developed in NAACP v. Alabama \n     derives from the rights of the organization's members to \n     advocate their personal points of view in the most effective \n     way.'' \\70\\\n       The Court continued:\n       ``When we attempt to define `expenditure' . . . . \n     [a]lthough the phrase, `for the purpose of . . . influencing' \n     an election or nomination, differs from the language used in \n     Sec. 608(e)(1), it shares the same potential for encompassing \n     both issue discussion and advocacy of a political result. The \n     general requirement that `political committees' and \n     candidates disclose their expenditures could raise similar \n     vagueness problems, for `political committee' is defined only \n     in terms of amount of annual `contributions' and \n     `expenditures,' and could be interpreted to reach groups \n     engaged in purely issue discussion. . . . To fulfill the \n     purposes of the Act they need only encompass organizations \n     that are under the control of a candidate or the major \n     purpose of which is the nomination or election of a \n     candidate. Expenditures of candidates and `political \n     committees' so construed can be assumed to fall within the \n     core area sought to be addressed by Congress. They are, by \n     definition, campaign related.\n       ``But when the maker of the expenditure is not within these \n     categories--when it is an individual other than a candidate \n     or a group other than a `political committee'--the relation \n     of the information sought to the purposes of the Act may be \n     too remote. To insure that the reach of Sec. 434(e) is not \n     impermissibly broad, we construe `expenditure' for purposes \n     of that section in the same way we construed the terms of \n     Sec. 608(e)--to reach only funds used for communications that \n     expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate.'' \\71\\\n       So construed, the reporting of independent expenditures is \n     justified by the substantial governmental interest in \n     ``sched[ding] the light of publicity on spending that is \n     unambiguously campaign related,'' \\72\\ i.e., an interest in \n     preventing corruption in the political process.\n       After the Supreme Court's 1976 Buckley decision, the \n     express advocacy test and the major purpose test were clearly \n     deployed as twin defenses against governmental encroachment \n     on issue advocacy. However, as shown in the next section, the \n     FEC and some state legislatures have spent the next two \n     decades trying to evade the Court's pronouncements.\n       Before proceeding, however, comment needs to be made on the \n     recent case of Akins v. FEC.\\73\\ That case held that the \n     major purpose test applied when an organization engaged in \n     independent expenditures, but not when it made contributions. \n     The decision, however, was wrongly decided because the court \n     did not engage in the most basic First Amendment analysis, \n     which would have led to a different result.\n       The case involved a complaint to the FEC that the American \n     Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) was a ``political \n     committee'' subject to the broad disclosure requirements and \n     limits imposed on political committees. The FEC dismissed the \n     complaint because the Committee did not met its definition \n     for a political committee. The definition required that a \n     committee (1) meet the $1,000 expenditure threshold and (2) \n     have as its major purpose the nomination or election of \n     candidates. The FEC ``determined that AIPAC likely had made \n     campaign contributions exceeding the $1,000 threshold, but \n     concluded that there was not probable cause to believe AIPAC \n     was a political committee because its campaign-related \n     activities were only a small portion of its overall \n     activities and not its major purpose.''\\74\\ The FEC argued \n     that Buckley required it to include a major purpose exception \n     for such contributions in its rules implementing 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 431(4)(A) (the definition of ``political \n     committee'').\\75\\ Ironically, as the FEC properly followed \n     and defended the Buckely major purpose test in this instance, \n     it was overruled.\n       The D.C. Circuit's analysis reviewed the language of \n     Buckley and decided that the major purpose test was only \n     established by the Court in the context of expenditures.\\76\\ \n     The Akins court similarly dismissed the language about the \n     major purpose test in MCFL \\77\\ as only applying in the \n     context of independent expenditures, so that ``the Court's \n     rationale in MCFL and Buckely is simply inapplicable to the \n     present case.'' \\78\\ The Akins court proceeded with some \n     policy arguments about how the FEC's interpretation ``would . \n     . . allow a large organization to contribute substantial sums \n     to campaign activity, as long as the contributions are \n     a small portion of the organization's overall budget, \n     without being subject to the limitations and requirements \n     imposed on political committees.'' \\79\\ Of course, that is \n     so and is as it should be. The very idea of the major \n     purpose test is that the heavy limits and disclosure \n     requirements imposed on political committees are too great \n     a burden on the First Amendment rights of organizations \n     whose major purpose is not campaign advocacy. It is \n     sufficient that the details of each independent \n     expenditure or contribution to a candidate be disclosed to \n     the FEC as matters of public record.\n       What was glaringly absent from the Akins opinion was a \n     constitutional analysis.\\80\\ A proper constitutional analysis \n     would have begun with the strong First Amendment protection \n     for all forms of political expression, including \n     contributions. Next, the analysis would have asked whether \n     there was any compelling governmental interest sufficient to \n     override the First Amendment's protection. A proper analysis \n     would have noted that the only interests found sufficiently \n     compelling by the Court are the interests in preventing \n     corruption and its appearance in the political process. The \n     analysis would have then asked whether contributions to \n     candidates from an organization whose major purpose is \n     education and lobbying posed such a threat of corruption to \n     the political system that is could only be cured by imposing \n     on the organization the heavy burdens imposed on PACs. The \n     answer, of course, would be that fully disclosed \n     contributions, which are a small fraction of an \n     organization's activities, pose not credible threat of \n     corruption or the appearance thereof. Therefore, imposing the \n     limitations and broad disclosure requirements, which are \n     placed on political committees, on an organization whose \n     major purpose is not the nomination or election of candidates \n     would violate the First Amendment in the same way that the \n     Constitution is violated in the context of such organizations \n     making independent expenditures.\n       It may safely be assumed that, at such a time as the United \n     States Supreme Court has the opportunity to review the issue \n     raised in Akins, the major purpose test will be reasserted in \n     the context of contributions, as well as independent \n     expenditures. Meanwhile, it is clearly in force with respect \n     to independent expenditures and with respect to contributions \n     in all but the D.C. Circuit. The FEC filed a petition for a \n     writ of certiorari on April 7, 1997.\\81\\\n\n\n            iii. failed fec efforts to stifle issue advocacy\n\n       The FEC apparently did not like the answers the Supreme \n     Court gave in Buckley \\82\\ because it soon began challenging \n     the decision with enforcement actions and rulemaking that did \n     not follow the express advocacy and major purpose tests. This \n     resulted in a long string of litigation, traced below, \n     highlighted by judicial rebuffs and rebukes.\n       In this twenty-year effort to suppress political speech by \n     circumventing Buckley, the FEC has treated the First \n     Amendment as a loophole in the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     which it is the FEC's duty to close, and the FEC has treated \n     United States Supreme Court decisions against it as \n     inconveniences to be overcome. As a result, the FEC has \n     engaged in a sustained and unprecedented assault on the First \n     Amendment, consuming enormous FEC resources. Rather than \n     enforce the many uncontroversial and clearly constitutional \n     provisions of the FECA, the FEC has used its limited \n     resources to launch a series of regulatory changes and \n     enforcement actions with the intent of expanding its \n     powers to regulate free speech. This effort has resulted \n     in a series of court cases striking down these regulations \n     \\83\\ and defeating the FEC's enforcement actions.\\84\\\n       The courts have, therefore, frustrated the unlawful efforts \n     of the FEC to impinge on free speech, but at an enormous cost \n     in taxpayer funds and in attorney fees for successful victims \n     of the FEC's enforcement actions. The cost to the free speech \n     of those intimidated by the heavy hand of the FEC, however, \n     cannot be calculated. Instead of enforcing the important and \n     uncontroversial provisions of the Act, the FEC has focused \n     its attention on ``grassroots groups and citizens who want to \n     take part in the political debate, too--groups far less well-\n     funded and less capable of extricating themselves from the \n     tangle of FEC regulations.'' Thus, the FEC has functioned \n     ``more and more as a censor of political expression, \n     especially by issue-oriented, grassroots activists.'' \\85\\ \n     Some of the most significant cases are reviewed below.\n\n\n                        A. FEC v. AFSCME (1979)\n\n       In FEC v. American Federation of State, County and \n     Municipal Employees (AFSCME),\\86\\ the District of Columbia \n     district court rejected the FEC's contention that a poster \n     qualified as express advocacy because it contained a clearly \n     identified candidate, ``may have tended to influence \n     voting,'' and ``contain[ed] communication on a public issue \n     widely debated during the campaign.'' \\87\\ The AFSCME union \n     had printed a\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\n     poster with a caricature of President Ford wearing a button \n     reading ``Pardon Me'' and embracing President Nixon, but it \n     did not report the expenditure as express advocacy. The \n     district court held that this was issue advocacy, not express \n     advocacy, because it contained no express words urging the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\\88\\ The \n     AFSCME court noted that ``[t]he Buckley analysis of the \n     limits of political activity is based on long recognized \n     principles: (1) political expression, including discussion of \n     candidates, is afforded the broadest protection under the \n     first amendment; and (2) discussion of public issues which \n     are also campaign issues unavoidably draws in candidates and \n     tends to inexorably exert influence in voting at elections.'' \n     \\89\\\n\n\n                        B. FEC V. CLITRIM (1980)\n\n       Undeterred, the FEC brought suit against the Central Long \n     Island Tax Reform Immediately Committee for the \n     Organization's failure to report funds expended to publish \n     and distribute a leaflet advocating lower taxes and smaller \n     government. The Second Circuit, in FEC v. Central Long Island \n     Tax Reform Immediately Committee (CLITRIM),\\90\\ adhered to \n     the express advoacy test set forth in Buckley and, therefore, \n     ruled against the FEC.\n       The first provision at issue required ``any `person . . . \n     who makes contributions or independent expenditures expressly \n     advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified \n     candidate' '' in excess of one hundred dollars to file a \n     report with the FEC.\\91\\ The second provision required ``any \n     person who `makes an expenditure for the purpose of financing \n     communications expressly advocating the election or defeat \n     of a clearly identified candidate' . . . through media, \n     advertising or mailing to state whether the communication \n     is authorized by a candidate. . . .'' \\92\\\n       The CLITRIM court noted ``the broad protection to be given \n     political expression,'' \\93\\ as indicated by the Supreme \n     Court in Buckley, and observed that: ``[t]he language quoted \n     from the statutes was incorporated by Congress in the 1976 \n     FECA amendments to conform the statute to the Supreme Court's \n     holding in Buckley v. Valeo that speech not by a candidate or \n     political committee could be regulated only to the extent \n     that the communications ``expressly advocate the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate.'' \\94\\\n       The court further observed that limiting the statutes to \n     reach only express advocacy ``is consistent with the firmly \n     established principle that the right to speak out at election \n     time is one of the most zealously protected under the \n     Constitution.'' \\95\\\n       The CLITRIM court held that: ``[t]he history of \n     Sec. Sec. 434(c) and 441d thus clearly establish that, \n     contrary to the position of the FEC, the words ``expressly \n     advocating'' mean[ ] exactly what they say. The FEC, to \n     support its position, argues that `[t]he TRIM bulletins at \n     issue here were not disseminated for such a limited purpose' \n     as merely informing the public about the voting record of a \n     government official. Rather the purpose was to unseat `big \n     spenders.' Thus, the FEC would apparently have us read \n     `expressly advocating the election or defeat' to mean for the \n     purpose, express or implied, of encouraging election or \n     defeat. This would, by statutory interpretation, nullify the \n     change in the statute ordered in Buckley v. Valeo and adopted \n     by Congress in the 1976 amendments. The position is totally \n     merit-less.'' \\96\\\n       From the CLITRIM decision, it seemed clear that the express \n     advocacy test was firmly ensconced as black-letter \n     constitutional law. Nevertheless, the FEC continued its \n     campaign to eliminate freedom of speech on issues at election \n     time.\n\n\n                        C. FEC. v. NCPAC (1985)\n\n       In 1985, the Supreme Court considered FEC v. National \n     Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC).\\97\\ This \n     case involved a declaratory judgment action seeking to have a \n     provision of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act \\98\\ \n     declared constitutional. It was originally initiated by the \n     Democrat National Committee in hopes that it could prevent \n     NCPAC and another conservative PAC (Fund For A Conservative \n     Majority) from implementing their expressed intent to spend \n     large sums of money to aid the 1984 reelection of President \n     Ronald Reagan.\\99\\\n       The disputed provision made it a criminal offense for an \n     independent political committee ``to expend more than $1,000 \n     to further [a] . . . candidate's election,'' if the \n     ``Presidential candidate elects public financing.'' \\100\\ The \n     Supreme Court declared the $1,000 cap on independent \n     expenditures unconstitutional because such independent \n     expenditures enjoyed full First Amendment protection and \n     there was no compelling state interest to override this right \n     of free expression.\\101\\\n       In NCPAC, the Supreme Court stated the only interest \n     sufficiently compelling to justify regulation of political \n     speech in the form of contributions and expenditures:\n       ``We held in Buckley and reaffirmed in Citizens Against \n     Rent Control that preventing corruption or the appearance of \n     corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government \n     interests thus far identified for restricting campaign \n     finances. . . .\n       ``Corruption is a subversion of the political process. \n     Elected officials are influenced to act contrary to their \n     obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to \n     themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns. The \n     hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars \n     for political favor.'' \\102\\\n       The Court went on to state that: ``The fact that candidates \n     and elected officials may alter or reaffirm their own \n     positions on issues in response to political message paid for \n     by PACs can hardly be called corruption, for one of the \n     essential features of democracy is the presentation to the \n     electorate of varying points of view.'' \\103\\\n       The implication of these statements should have been clear, \n     even to the FEC. For years the FEC has maintained the \n     position that it ought to be able to regulate issue advocacy \n     in the form of voter guides which tell where candidates stand \n     on issues, on the theory that issue-advocacy groups were \n     actually engaging in express advocacy or making a \n     contribution to the candidates who favored their issues.\\104\\ \n     Voter guides might have the effect, the argument would go, or \n     persuading candidates to support the organization's views on \n     an issue.\n       However, if the only compelling interest for restricting \n     speech at election time is corruption (or its appearance), \n     and if persuading politicians to a different viewpoint of \n     advocacy of issues is not corruption, then there can be no \n     compelling governmental interest which would permit \n     restriction of issue advocacy. If this is true of PACs, then \n     a fortiori there can be no corruption or appearance of \n     corruption resulting from issue advocacy by any issue \n     advocacy groups. Undeterred, the FEC rejected the clear \n     teaching of the Supreme Court in Buckley, CLITRIM, and NCPAC \n     and continued its efforts to attempt to regulate issue \n     advocacy.\n\n\n                         D. FEC v. MCFL (1986)\n\n       In 1986, the Supreme Court again considered the \n     constitutional protection afforded issue advocacy in the case \n     of FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life (MCFL),\\105\\ The \n     FEC had brought an enforcement action against MCFL, alleging \n     that the organization had violated 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b, a ban \n     on corporate expenditures ``in connection with any \n     election,'' by publishing a voter guide.\n       The voter guide, published by MCFL, was contained in a \n     ``Special Edition' newsletter which encouraged readers to \n     ``Vote Pro-Life'' and identified the pro-life \n     candidates.\\106\\ A complaint was filed with the FEC alleging \n     that MCFL had violated the ban on corporate expenditures \n     found at 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b.\\107\\ The Supreme Court decided \n     that this ``Special Edition'' did not qualify for the \n     newspaper exemption found in the FECA,\\108\\ and that MCFL had \n     engaged in express advocacy, but that the First Amendment \n     required a special exemption from Sec. 441b's prohibitions \n     for MCFL-type corporations.\\109\\\n       Under the FECA, ``expenditure'' means to provide anything \n     of value ``for the purpose of influencing any election for \n     Federal office.'' \\110\\ This ``influencing'' language was the \n     same terminology construed by the Supreme Court in Buckley to \n     mean only express advocacy, in order to save a different \n     provision of the FECA from unconstitutionality for \n     sweeping issue advocacy within its ambit.\n       In MCFL, the Supreme Court considered the contention of \n     MCFL ``that the definition of an expenditure under Sec. 441b \n     necessarily incorporates the requirement that a communication \n     `expressly advocate' the election of candidates,'' relying on \n     Buckley.\\111\\ The FEC argued that the express advocacy test \n     should not be extended to this provision barring corporate \n     expenditures.\n       The MCFL Court held, however, that the express advocacy \n     rationale must be extended to restrictions on expenditures by \n     corporations.\\112\\ The Court said that, if a ceiling on \n     independent expenditures, at issue in Buckley, had to be \n     construed to apply only to express advocacy of the election \n     or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (in order to \n     eliminate the constitutional deficiencies described in \n     Buckley), ``this rationale requires a similar construction of \n     the more intrusive provision [at issue in MCFL] that directly \n     regulates independent spending.'' \\113\\\n       The Supreme Court rejected the FEC's argument that \n     extending the express advocacy protection to corporations and \n     labor unions ``would open the door to massive undisclosed \n     political spending.'' \\114\\ Nevertheless, the FEC continued \n     to treat constitutionally-protected issue advocacy as a \n     loophole which ought to be closed because it limited the \n     FEC's ability to regulate anything that might possibly \n     influence an election.\\115\\\n\n\n                       E. FEC v. FURGATCH (1987)\n\n       In 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit decided the case of FEC v. Furgatch.\\116\\ This case \n     contained obiter dicta suggesting that the court was applying \n     a broadened express advocacy test to the FECA's requirement \n     that independent expenditures by an individual over $250 must \n     be reported to the FEC \\117\\ and must contain a \n     disclaimer.\\118\\\n       Buckley held that only ``explicit words'' ``expressly \n     advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified \n     candidate,'' constitute express advocacy.\\119\\ However, the \n     Ninth Circuit wrote that a court could look beyond the \n     explicit words of the communication to consider the context \n     in which the words were communicated.\\120\\ Furgatch \n     considered newspaper advertisements which made a number of \n     allegations about President Jimmy Carter followed by the \n     phrases, ``And we let him,'' ``And we let him do it again,'' \n     ``We are letting him do it,'' and following paragraphs:\n       ``He continues to cultivate the fears, not the hopes, of \n     the voting public by suggesting the choice is between `peace \n     and war,' `black or white,' `north or south,' and `Jew vs. \n     Christian.' His meanness of spirit is divisive and reckless \n     McCarthyism at its worst. And from a man who once asked, `Why \n     Not the Best?'\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\n       ``It is an attempt to hide his own record, or lack of it. \n     If he succeeds the country will be burdened with four more \n     years of incoherences, ineptness and illusion, as he leaves a \n     legacy of low-level campaigning.\n       ``DON'T LET HIM DO IT.''\\121\\\n       Noticeably absent from this communication are any words of \n     express advocacy. Nowhere does the communication contain \n     explicit words such as ``vote for'' or ``defeat.'' The Ninth \n     Circuit, however, decided that the context should be \n     consulted: ``We conclude that speech need not include any of \n     the words listed in Buckley to be express advocacy under the \n     Act, but it must, when read as a whole, and with limited \n     reference to external events, be susceptible of no other \n     reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote for \n     or against a specific candidates.'' \\122\\\n       Applying its contextual standard, the Ninth Circuit \n     determined that Mr. Furgatch had engaged in express advocacy.\n       Four key facts should be noted about Furgatch. First, \n     although the MCFL decision was issued on December 15, 1986, \n     and the Furgatch decision was issued just days later on \n     January 9, 1987, Furgatch made no mention of the newly \n     announced MCFL decision, which clearly reaffirmed the bright-\n     line Buckley approach. Second, as discussed below, the \n     Furgatch contextual approach has not been followed by other \n     courts and has, in fact, been expressly repudiated by \n     some.\\123\\\n       Third, the broader test was employed in a case which \n     involved only a failure to report an expenditure to the \n     FEC.\\124\\ Fourth, the Fourth Circuit has recently \n     demonstrated in a careful exegesis of Furgatch that the Ninth \n     Circuit did not go to the extreme to which the FEC has tried \n     to stretch it and that the actual holding of Furgatch \n     conforms quite closely to Buckley and MCFL.\\125\\\n       Thus, the Furgatch test was decided in, and only logically \n     applies to, the very narrow context of disclosure provisions. \n     The Furgatch court noted the Supreme ``Court's directive \n     that, where First Amendment concerns are present, we must \n     construe the words of the regulatory statute precisely and \n     narrowly, only as far as is necessary to further the purposes \n     of the Act.'' \\126\\ The court then devoted a full page to \n     discussing the importance of disclosure, the purposes served \n     thereby, and the minimal burden imposed by disclosure.\\127\\ \n     Because it concluded that disclosure ``serves an important \n     Congressional policy and a very strong First Amendment \n     interest,'' and, because the burden imposed would be \n     ``minimally restrictive,'' the Ninth Circuit adopted a \n     totality of the circumstances test.\\128\\ Therefore, if \n     Furgatch is good law, it should be limited to its context.\n       Moreover, as mentioned, the Fourth Circuit's careful \n     analysis has demonstrated that the core Furgatch holding \n     closely conforms to the Buckley and MCFL express advocacy \n     test and that any more broadly worded language was both dicta \n     and contrary to Supreme Court precedent,\\129\\ a fact the FEC \n     clearly understood at the time.\\130\\ In fact, the Fourth \n     Circuit has recently excoriated the FEC, and awarded \n     attorneys' fees against it, for bad faith prosecution in \n     duplicitous reliance on a broad interpretation of Furgatch \n     when the FEC had demonstrated its clear understanding of the \n     true narrowness of the Furgatch holding in its Brief for \n     Respondent in Opposition to Mr. Furgatch's petition for a \n     writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\131\\ The Fourth \n     Circuit's censure of the FEC for its duplicity and \n     dissembling with regard to Furgatch is discussed at greater \n     length below.\n       Nevertheless, energized by its success in opposing Supreme \n     Court review of Furgatch and preserving the broadly-worded \n     Furgatch dicta, which was useful for expanding FEC power, the \n     FEC launched a campaign to apply its totality-of-the-\n     circumstances ``express advocacy'' test in a wide range of \n     contexts.\n\n\n                          F. FEC v. NOW (1989)\n\n       In the case of FEC v. National Organization for Women \n     (NOW),\\132\\ the FEC again brought an enforcement action \n     employing its broadly defined express advocacy test. The FEC \n     charged that membership solicitation letters discussing \n     issues to pay inequality, abortion, and the Equal Rights \n     Amendment (ERA) constituted express advocacy. The letters at \n     issue expressly criticized the Reagan Administration and the \n     Republican Party, including the following phrase which the \n     FEC found damming: ``Politicians listen when they think an \n     organized group of citizens can help elect or defeat them.'' \n     Another letter criticized by name Senators Helms, Hatch, and \n     Thurmond and spoke of ``a renewed effort now being launched \n     by New Right reactionary groups in preparation for the 1984 \n     elections,'' which phrase the FEC condemned as \n     electioneering. A third letter made the case for the ERA and \n     condemned President Reagan and named several senators ``up \n     for reelection in 1984,'' who ``must be made to understand \n     that failure to pass the ERA will result in powerful \n     campaigns to defeat them''\\133\\ As a result of these \n     statements, the FEC claimed that NOW has violated the \n     corporate prohibition on candidate-related speech.\n       The NOW court referred to both the Buckley test \\134\\ and \n     the Furgatch ``broad test.''\\135\\ However, the NOW court held \n     that there simply was no express advocacy under any \n     test,\\136\\ tying its holding explicitly to the Buckley \n     principles: ``At issues in this case is political speech, \n     which lies at the core of the First Amendment. Discussion of \n     public issues and the qualifications of candidates for public \n     office is integral to a system of government in which the \n     people elect their leaders. In order to make informed choices \n     about its leaders, the citizenry needs to hear the free \n     exchange of ideas. The First Amendment affords the broadcast \n     protection to such political expression.'' \\137\\\n\n\n                        G. FAUCHER v. FEC (1991)\n\n       It should have been clear to the FEC that the Supreme Court \n     meant what it said in Buckley about issue advocacy being \n     sacrosanct when the Court reaffirmed the test in a new \n     context in MCFL. However, the FEC continued to press ahead \n     with its efforts to regulate issue advocacy. Included in its \n     effort was the promulgation of new rules regulating voter \n     guides.\n       In Faucher v. FEC,\\138\\ the First Circuit struck down the \n     Federal Election Commission's regulations of voter guides as \n     being beyond the authority of the FEC under 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 441b as interpreted by the Supreme Court in MCFL. The \n     regulation at issue, 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.4(b)(5), required \n     that a voter guide by ``nonpartisan,'' which the FEC defined \n     by reference to six factors. These factors included whether \n     ``the wording of their questions presented . . . suggest or \n     favor any position on the issues covered'' and whether ``the \n     voter guide expressed (any) editorial opinion concerning the \n     issues presented.'' \\139\\\n       The United States District Court for the District of Maine \n     struck the regulations down for trespassing upon \n     constitutionally protected issue advocacy and for reaching \n     beyond the authority of the Federal Election Commission under \n     Sec. 441b, which bars corporate political speech.\\140\\ The \n     First Circuit affirmed the decision of the District \n     Court,\\141\\ declaring that ``[t]he first amendment lies at \n     the heart of our most cherished and protected freedoms. Among \n     those freedoms is the right to engage in issue-oriented \n     political speech.'' \\142\\\n       The First Circuit expressly applied the ``bright-line'' \n     test of Buckley in accordance with the speech-protective \n     rationale of that case: ``In our view, trying to discern when \n     issue advocacy in a voter guide crosses the threshold and \n     becomes express advocacy invites just the sort of \n     constitutional questions the Court sought to avoid by \n     adopting the bright-line express advocacy test in Buckley.'' \n     \\143\\\n\n\n                h. fec v. survival education fund (1994)\n\n       In FEC v. Survival Education Fund,\\144\\ the U.S. District \n     Court for the Southern District of New York rejected an FEC \n     attempt to broaden the express advocacy test of Buckley and \n     MCFL. The case involved letters sent four months before an \n     election by Dr. Benjamin Spock that were hostile to President \n     Reagan and condemned his policies. The FEC argued that the \n     letters constituted express advocacy and, therefore, were \n     prohibited political communications by a corporation. The \n     court, however, pointed to the ``express words'' formula in \n     Buckley and held that: ``It is clear from the cases that \n     expressions of hostility to the positions of an official, \n     implying that that official should not be reelected--even \n     when the implication is quite clear--do not constitute the \n     express advocacy which runs afoul of the statute. Obviously, \n     the courts are not giving a broad reading to this statute.'' \n     \\145\\\n\n\n               i. fec v. christian action network (1995)\n\n       In FEC v. Christian Action Network,\\146\\ a Virginia \n     district court considered advertisements, run during the 1992 \n     election campaign, which the FEC considered to be express \n     advocacy of the defeat of presidential candidate Clinton. \n     Because the ads did not contain ``explicit words or imagery \n     advocating electoral action,'' the court held that they \n     constituted protected issue advocacy and not \n     electioneering.\\147\\ The Court followed the ``strict \n     interpretation'' of the express advocacy test: ``In the \n     nineteen years since the Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley v. \n     Valeo, the parameters of the `express advocacy' standard have \n     been addressed by several federal courts in a variety of \n     circumstances. * * * Acknowledging that political expression, \n     including the discussion of public issues and debate on the \n     qualifications of candidates enjoys extensive First Amendment \n     protection, the vast majority of these courts have adopted a \n     strict interpretation of the `express advocacy' standard.'' \n     \\148\\\n       On August 2, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Fourth Circuit issued a brief per curiam opinion \n     affirming the district court.\\149\\\n\n\n                         j. fec v. gopac (1996)\n\n       FEC v. GOPAC,\\150\\ the FEC's much ballyhooed enforcement \n     action against GOPAC (which Newt Gingrich served as \n     chairman), amply demonstrates the FEC's refusal to recognize \n     the constitutional protection afforded issue advocacy by the \n     bright-line express advocacy test and the major purpose test. \n     Despite the fact that GOPAC did not have as its major purpose \n     the election or nomination of candidates for federal office, \n     the FEC pushed for a test that would make an organization a \n     political committee if it ``engage[s] in `partisan politics' \n     or `electoral activity.' '' \\151\\ The court rejected this \n     approach and granted GOPAC summary judgment because the test \n     proposed was not that of the Supreme Court in Buckley.\\152\\\n\n\n                k. new fec regulations (october 5, 1995)\n\n       After the Faucher decision in 1991, which struck down FEC \n     regulations prohibiting voter guides from expressing a \n     position on an issue,\\153\\ the FEC needed to revise or delete \n     its regulation dealing with voter guides. All that was needed \n     to bring the regulation into compliance with the First \n     Amendment was a\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\n     small excision in the definition of ``nonpartisan,'' so that \n     the factors for what constituted ``nonpartisan'' would not \n     include whether a question is worded in a way that supports \n     the position of a candidate on the issue covered.\\154\\\n       The FEC took from 1991 to late 1995 to promulgate its new \n     rules.\\155\\ When the new rules were published, there was no \n     mere excision or minimal editing to fix the First Amendment \n     problem with issue advocacy. Rather, the new FEC \n     regulations were an expansive effort to bypass the First \n     Amendment jurisprudence of the federal courts. The rules \n     were a transparent attempt to incorporate the FEC's \n     interpretation of the Furgatch totality of the \n     circumstances test into the FEC rules in the hope that the \n     FEC could sell the federal courts on the notion that \n     deference should be granted to the agencies interpretation \n     in federal law in this area.\\156\\\n       If such deference were forthcoming, the FEC would have \n     accomplished by rulemaking what it had failed in years of \n     litigating enforcement actions to achieve, i.e., imposing its \n     broad interpretations of the Furgatch test in place of the \n     Supreme Court's bright-line express advocacy test. As shall \n     be seen, the deference was not forthcoming.\n       The FEC issued its copious new post-Faucher rules in two \n     sets in late 1995. The first set was to take effect on \n     October 5, 1995. The revision of the FEC voter guide \n     regulations necessitated by Faucher four years before \n     occurred in a later set of rules to take effect March 13, \n     1996.\n       The October 5 set of rules contained a new definition of \n     express advocacy, tracking the FEC's broad interpretation of \n     Furgatch:\n       ``Expressly advocating means any communication that--\n       ``(a) uses phrases such as `vote for the President,' `re-\n     elect your Congressman,' `support the Democratic nominee,' \n     `cast your ballot for the Republican challenger for U.S. \n     Senate in Georgia,' `Smith for Congress,' `Bill McKay in 94,' \n     `vote Pro-Life' or `vote Pro-Choice' accompanied by a listing \n     of clearly identified candidates described as Pro-Life or \n     Pro-Choice, `vote against Old Hickory,' `defeat' accompanied \n     by a picture of one or more candidate(s), or communications \n     of campaign slogan(s) which in context can have no other \n     reasonable meaning than to encourage the election or defeat \n     of one or more clearly identified candidate(s), such as \n     posters, bumper stickers, advertisements, etc. which say \n     `Nixon's the One,' `Carter 76,' `Reagan/Bush' or `Mondale!'; \n     or\n       ``(b) when taken as a whole and with limited reference to \n     external events, such as the proximity to the election, could \n     only be interpreted by a reasonable person as containing \n     advocacy of the election or defeat of one or more clearly \n     identified candidate(s) because--\n       ``(1) The electoral portion of the communication is \n     unmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of only one \n     meaning; and\n       ``(2) Reasonable minds could not differ as to whether it \n     encourages actions to elect or defeat one or more clearly \n     identified candidate(s) or encourages some other kind of \n     action.\\157\\''\n       While the first part of subsection (a) generally followed \n     Buckley, specifying explicit and express words of advocacy in \n     the communication itself, the second part of subsection (a) \n     added a contextual factor, relying on Furgatch. Subsection \n     (b) was wholly patterned after the FEC's broad interpretation \n     of Furgatch. Of course, such a definition of express advocacy \n     would leave the speaker uncertain whether the FEC would find \n     a communication to constitute express advocacy, consequently \n     chilling protected speech. Such a definition would abandon \n     the bright-line test Buckley said was essential to safeguard \n     protected issue advocacy in this arena, and it would afford \n     the FEC great latitude in its enforcement.\\158\\\n\n\n             L. MAINE RIGHT TO LIFE COMMITTEE v. FEC (1966)\n\n       The FEC's new express advocacy definition took effect on \n     October 5, 1995. On November 22, 1995, Maine Right to Life \n     (also a plaintiff in the Faucher case) filed a complaint and \n     motions seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\\159\\ On \n     February 13, 1996, the United States District Court for the \n     District of Maine declared the latest regulations of the FEC \n     seeking to define express advocacy\\160\\ to be ``invalid as \n     not authorized by the Federal Election Campaigns Act of 1971, \n     as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in \n     Massachsuetts Citizens for Life, and by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Faucher, because it \n     extends beyond issue advocacy.''\\161\\ The district court \n     struck down a definition of ``[e]xpressly advocating,'' \\162\\ \n     which ``comes directly from'' Furgatch.\\163\\ The district \n     court relied on the fact that, contrary to the Ninth \n     Circuit's decision in Furgatch, the Supreme Court in \n     Buckley and MCFL created a bright-line protection of issue \n     advocacy, ``even at the risk that it is used to elect or \n     defeat a candidate.'' \\164\\\n       On October 18, 1996, the First Circuit issued a brief per \n     curiam opinion affirming ``for substantially the reasons set \n     forth in the district court opinion.''\\165\\\n       The FEC, however, has obstinately taken the position that \n     these regulations are still in effect in all other \n     jurisdictions than the First Circuit, even though the action \n     was brought under the Administrative Procedure Act and the \n     First Circuit held that the FEC was without authority to \n     promulgate these regulations and, thus, they are void.\\166\\\n\n\n                M. NEW FEC REGULATIONS (MARCH 13, 1996)\n\n       After releasing the regulations which were struck down in \n     Maine Right to Life Committee, the FEC next released revised \n     rules setting forth the FEC's requirements for ``voter \n     guides'' and ``voting records.'' \\167\\ They became effective \n     on March 13, 1996.\\168\\ Under the new voter guide \n     regulation,\\169\\ the amount of contact that a corporation had \n     with a candidate regarding the voter guide severely affected \n     the content of the voter guide.\n       First, if the corporation had any oral communications with \n     a candidate regarding the voter guide, the publication of the \n     voter guide was absolutely prohibited. A prohibited oral \n     communication would even include contacting the candidate to \n     clarify a candidate's position on an issue.\\170\\ As a result \n     of the oral communication, the publication of the voter guide \n     was considered by the FEC to be an in-kind contribution to \n     the candidate and, thus, a prohibited corporate contribution \n     under Sec. 441b.\n       However, if the corporation had no oral or written contact \n     with the candidate,\\171\\ the corporation retained its right \n     to state a position on the issues of the voter guide (a First \n     Amendment right recognized in the Faucher case). Of course, \n     it is very difficult to prepare a voter guide without sending \n     a written questionnaire to the candidates asking them to \n     state their positions on the issues, so written \n     questionnaires are the common practice.\\172\\ Because the use \n     of a questionnaire is so important to an effective voter \n     guide, most organizations would feel compelled to at least \n     contact the candidate in writing, resulting in severely \n     limiting their issue advocacy.\n       If an organization had written contact with the \n     candidate,\\173\\ the content of the voter guide was severely \n     restricted.\\174\\ First, ``all of the candidates for a \n     particular seat or office shall be provided an equal \n     opportunity to respond . . . .'' \\175\\ Second, ``no candidate \n     may receive greater prominence in the voter guide, than other \n     participating candidates, or substantially more space for \n     responses.''\\176\\ Voter guides shall not contain an \n     ``electioneering message.''\\177\\ Finally, the regulation \n     mandates that a ``voter guide and its accompanying materials \n     shall not score or rate the candidates' responses in such a \n     way as to convey an electioneering message.'' \\178\\ Thus, to \n     do a voter guide after written contact with a candidate, the \n     corporation had to surrender its constitutionally-protected \n     right to engage in issue advocacy in voter guides.\n       Having been repeatedly frustrated by the courts in its \n     attempt to regulate voter guides as expenditures because of \n     the express advocacy test, the FEC based its new voter guide \n     regulations on a new ``contribution'' theory. This theory \n     attempted to avoid the express advocacy test by \n     labeling\\179\\ expenditures for a voter guide as ``in-kind \n     contributions'' to the candidate, which are also \n     prohibited by corporations under Sec. 44lb. The FEC's hope \n     was that, if an expenditure for a communication was \n     labeled as an ``in-kind contribution,'' then the courts \n     would not require that the communication contain express \n     advocacy but merely influence an election. Furthermore, \n     this theory took a very expansive view of when an \n     expenditure was requested by or coordinated with a \n     candidate, which is an essential element to make an \n     expenditure into an ``in-kind contribution.'' In both \n     respects, however, the FEC violated existing court \n     precedents.\n       The FECA made it unlawful for any corporation or union ``to \n     make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any \n     election''\\180\\ The FECA defines ``contribution or \n     expenditure'' to include ``any direct or indirect payment, . \n     . . or gift of money, or services, or anything of value . . . \n     to any candidate . . . in connection with any \n     election.''\\181\\ Of course, it was this language that the \n     Court in MCFL held must contain ``express advocacy,'' if an \n     expenditure were to be considered an independent expenditure. \n     However, the FEC is shifting from the word ``expenditure'' to \n     the word ``contribution,'' which encompasses both direct and \n     indirect contributions. A direct contribution is made by \n     actually giving money to the candidate. An in-kind \n     contribution occurs when something of value (like a mailing \n     list) is given to the candidate or when a person pays, at the \n     request of the candidate or an agent of his campaign, for an \n     expense that the campaign itself would otherwise pay (like a \n     billboard) in lieu of a direct contribution to the candidate. \n     However, Congress did not intend for ``in-kind \n     contributions'' to be a broad category. In adopting the \n     concept of an ``in-kind contribution,'' the Senate Report \n     described an ``in-kind contribution'' as ``the use of an \n     individual's resources to aid a candidate in a manner \n     indistinguishable in substance from the direct payment of \n     cash to a candidate.''\\182\\\n       Thus, an ``in-kind contribution'' has two elements. The \n     first element is the nature of the expenditure. According to \n     the courts, an expenditure for a communication must contain \n     ``express advocacy'' to be an independent expenditure. The \n     logic of the courts' analysis suggests that this extends to \n     in-kind contributions. According to the FEC, however, an in-\n     kind contribution may exist where there is only issue \n     advocacy. The second element is whether it is made with the \n     consent or in coordination with the candidate. Here, the FEC \n     also has a very expansive view of coordination.\n       Ironically, the FEC had previously adopted the correct \n     position that express advocacy is necessary in order to \n     transform a protected expenditure into a prohibited \n     contribution. In Orloski v. Federal Election Commission,\\183\\ \n     a political opponent of an incumbent Congressman challenged \n     the FEC's failure to\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\n     find ``reason to believe'' that the Act had been violated. \n     The case concerned a senior citizens' picnic at which the \n     Congressman spoke and to which several corporations had \n     provided food and services such as transportation.\n       At issue was the FEC's interpretation of what constituted a \n     corporate contribution under Sec. 441b(a). The FEC had \n     previously ``interpreted the Act to mean the corporate \n     funding of events sponsored by congressmen who are candidates \n     for reelection is not prohibited by Sec. 441(b)(a) if those \n     events are non-political.''\\184\\ In order to determine \n     whether an event is non-political, the FEC adopted the \n     following test: ``An event is non-political if (1) there is \n     an absence of any communication expressly advocating the \n     nomination or election of the congressman appearing or the \n     defeat of any other candidate, and (2) there is no \n     solicition, making, or acceptance of a campaign contribution \n     for the congressman in connection with the event.'' \\185\\\n       Because the FEC found that there was no express advocacy at \n     the picnic in question, it found that the event was ``non-\n     political'' and, thus, that it did not entail a violation of \n     the corporate contribution prohibition of Sec. 441b. As the \n     Orloski court explained: ``the mere fact that corporate \n     donations were made with the consent of the candidate does \n     not mean that a `contribution' within the meaning of the Act \n     has been made. Under the Act this type of `donation' is only \n     a contribution if it first qualifies as an `expenditure' and, \n     under the FEC's interpretation, such a donation is not an \n     expenditure unless someone at the funded event expressly \n     advocates the reelection of the incumbent or the defeat of an \n     opponent . . .''\\186\\\n       In its new regulations, however, the FEC now sought to \n     repudiate its former, reasonable position that corporate \n     expenditures are not political contributions which can be \n     prohibited under Sec. 441(b) unless they involve express \n     advocacy. The new regulations governed the \n     ``electioneering message'' of voter guides on the \n     porported authority derived from converting expenditures \n     for voter guides into contributions.\n       The new regulations also adopted an expansive view of what \n     constitutes ``coordination.'' The FEC apparently has two \n     theories: (1) the contact coordination theory, and (2) the \n     presumed coordination theory.\\187\\ The contact coordination \n     theory was employed in the new voter guide regulations. As \n     the structure of the voter guide regulation made clear, the \n     FEC viewed any contact between the corporation publishing the \n     voter guide and a candidate to constitute coordination of the \n     voter guide and the greater the contact the greater the \n     taint. Thus, oral communications resulted in an absolute \n     prohibition on publishing a voter guide; written \n     communication forfeited the corporation's right to engage in \n     issue advocacy in their voter guide.\n\n\n                        N. Clifton v. FEC (1996)\n\n       In response to these newly-issued FEC regulations \n     restricting voter guides, Maine Right to Life Committee \\188\\ \n     again filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act to \n     have the regulations declared beyond the authority of the FEC \n     under 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441(b), as construed by the Supreme Court \n     in MCFL.\\189\\ The case, Clifton v. FEC,\\190\\ challenged the \n     regulations,\\191\\ which ``restrict(ed) contact or \n     coordination between a corporation and a candidate when the \n     corporation publishes candidate voting records or voter \n     guides.'' \\192\\\n       On May 20, 1996, the district court granted Plaintiffs' \n     request for a declaration that the regulations were void as \n     beyond the statutory authority of the FEC. The district court \n     found that the voter guide regulation restricted not only \n     ``express advocacy'' but also ``issue advocacy.'' As the \n     Court stated, ``[t]he new regulations go far beyond the \n     language of section 441(b) as interpreted by MCFL. Under the \n     provisions for voter guides, the FEC test is not whether a \n     corporation is engaging in issue advocacy `on behalf of a \n     candidate' (a test which MCFL would support), but whether it \n     has had any 'contact' with the candidate. The regulations \n     permit unrestricted issue advocacy only if there is no \n     contact, oral or written in connection with a voter guide. \n     Any oral contact concerning the content of a voter guide--\n     questions to clarify a candidate's position for example--\n     results in outright prohibition of corporate issue advocacy \n     through use of the guide. Even written contact with \n     candidates results in severe constraints on issue advocacy \n     otherwise entitled to broad First Amendment protection under \n     the teachings of Buckley and MCFL.'' \\193\\\n       Also under the ostensible statutory authority of 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 441(b), the FEC promulgated 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.4(c)(4) \n     which purported to govern corporate preparation and \n     distribution of the ``voting records'' of Members of Congress \n     to the general public. That regulation provided that ``the \n     decision on content and the distribution of voting records \n     shall not be coordinated with any candidate, group of \n     candidates or political party.''\n       The district court agreed with Plaintiffs' contention that \n     the ``voting record'' regulation also impermissibly \n     restricted issue advocacy. Noting that the regulation \n     provided that the decision on ``content'' could not be \n     ``coordinated'' with a candidate, the Court asked: ``Does \n     that prohibit discussion with the candidate of what a \n     particular vote meant and a summary of the outcome in the \n     published voting record? If there are three apparently \n     inconsistent votes and the MRLC asks the candidate for a \n     explanation in the publication, is that prohibited \n     coordination of a decision on content? These are exactly the \n     types of issue advocacy undertaken by the MRLC and, as I \n     understand the FEC's counsel at oral argument, such \n     activities are indeed prohibited by the new regulations.'' \n     \\194\\\n       Because the district court found that both regulations \n     restricted issue advocacy, not just express advocacy, it held \n     that they were invalid under Faucher, MCFL and Buckley: ``It \n     is equally clear after Buckley and MCFL that corporate \n     expenditures in connection with a federal election or primary \n     cannot constitutionally be limited except when they are \n     devoted to express advocacy of the election or defeat of a \n     particular candidate or candidates.'' \\195\\\n       The FEC has appealed the decision to the First \n     Circuit.\\196\\\n\n\n        O. COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE v. FEC\n\n       While there has been a great deal of ongoing litigation in \n     state and federal courts over election laws, the 1996 case of \n     Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC \\197\\ \n     is significant as the most recent word from the Supreme Court \n     on election law issues. The case revealed steadfast support \n     on the Court for protecting First Amendment rights in the \n     election law context.\n       Significantly, the case completely undercut the FEC's \n     presumed coordination theory. Colorado Republican did not \n     involve Sec. 441(b) (barring corporate campaign expenditures \n     and contributions), but its rejection of the presumed \n     coordination theory is a clearly transferable concept \n     relevant to the FEC's efforts to regulate corporate political \n     speech under Sec. 441(b).\\198\\ Moreover, the opinions in the \n     case revealed strong support for the express advocacy test in \n     this context as well.\n       The case involved FEC allegations that the Colorado \n     Republican Party had exceeded FECA limits on what a party \n     could spend to promote a candidate in a U.S. senatorial \n     race.\\199\\ The case arose as a result of advertisements \n     purchased in April 1986 by the Federal Campaign Committee of \n     the Colorado Republican Party. The radio advertisements \n     attacked Democrat Timothy Wirth, who was then a U.S. \n     Congressman and the most likely Democrat candidate for the \n     open Senate seat.\\200\\ He had announced in January 1986 that \n     he would run for the Senate.\\201\\ At the time of the \n     advertisements, the Republican Party had not chosen its \n     nominee from among the three persons competing for the \n     nomination.\\202\\\n       The record revealed how the expenditure for the \n     advertisements was made. The GOP state chairman arranged for \n     the script on his own initiative.\\203\\ He approved it without \n     input from others.\\204\\ In sum, he did not actually \n     coordinate the expenditure with any candidate. It was what \n     normally would be considered an independent expenditure.\n       However, the FEC argued that, because of the relationship \n     between a party and its candidates, ``coordination with \n     candidates is presumed,'' \\205\\ even though there was \n     factually none in this case.\\206\\ The lead opinion of Justice \n     Breyer, joined by Justices O'Connor and Souter, rejected this \n     presumed coordination approach, declaring that, because ``the \n     record shows no actual coordination as a matter of fact,'' \n     \\207\\ ``we therefore treat the expenditure, for \n     constitutional purposes, as an `independent' expenditure, not \n     an indirect campaign contribution.'' \\208\\ This rejection of \n     presumed coordination in the context of expenditures by a \n     political party to attack an opposing candidate for office \n     makes it highly unlikely that a presumption of coordination \n     will be permitted in situations where there is less basis for \n     a presumption. Coordination will have to be actual before an \n     expenditure will be considered a contribution.\\209\\\n       Because Justices Breyer, O'Connor, and Souter rejected the \n     notion of presumed coordination, they also rejected the \n     notion that the expenditures at issue were actually \n     contributions. Therefore, they decided it would be prudential \n     not to reach the issue of whether a cap on coordinated \n     expenditures by a political party is constitutional, as urged \n     by the Colorado Republican Party. However, an opinion by \n     Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and \n     Justice Scalia, opined that the party contribution limit to \n     candidates was unconstitutional on its face, but concurred in \n     a judgment vacating the court of appeals decision and \n     remanding the case,\\210\\ as did Justice Thomas.\\211\\\n       From the Colorado Republican case, it seems clear that any \n     theory that presumed coordination can convert independent \n     expenditures into contributions must fail. Only actual \n     coordination will achieve such a result. Of course, this \n     is also true where a voter guide merely contains issue \n     advocacy.\n\n                    FEC v. Christian Action Network\n\n       After the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's \n     dismissal of FEC charges in FEC v. Christian Action \n     Network,\\212\\ the Christian Action Network filed a petition \n     for attorneys' fees and costs under the Equal Access to \n     Justice Act, which permits fee awards for enforcement actions \n     that are not ``substantially justified.'' \\213\\ The Fourth \n     Circuit determined that the FEC's enforcement in reliance on \n     its broad interpretation of Furgatch was not ``substantially \n     justified,'' but was in ``bad faith.'' \\214\\\n       The Fourth Circuit cataloged the reasons why the express \n     advocacy test, as set forth in Buckley and MCFL, was so clear \n     that failure to follow it constituted bad faith.\\215\\ The \n     court focused especially on the Furgatch decision, on which \n     the FEC had based its authority to prosecute the Christian \n     Action\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\n     Network.\\216\\ After carefully analyzing Furgatch, the Fourth \n     Circuit summarized the holding of that case: ``Indeed, the \n     simple holding of Furgatch was that, in those instances where \n     political communications do include an explicit directive to \n     voters to take some course of action, but that course of \n     action is unclear, `context'--including the timing of the \n     communication in relation to the events of the day--may be \n     considered in determining whether the action urged is the \n     election or defeat of a particular candidate for public \n     office.'' \\217\\\n       The fourth Circuit then pointed out that the FEC had fully \n     understood that explicit words expressly advocating the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate were \n     essential to ``express advocacy'' when it opposed Supreme \n     Court review of the Furgatch case:\n       ``That the commission knows well the Court's holdings in \n     Buckley and MCFL is further confirmed by the agency's \n     subsequent action in Furgatch. . . . Because Furgatch, \n     despite its narrow holding, does include broad dicta which \n     can be read (or misread) to support the FEC's expansive view \n     of its authority, the agency vigorously opposed certiorari in \n     the case.\n       ``Wishing to have the opinion preserved intact, the \n     Commission in its submissions there, in contrast to its \n     submissions before this court, quoted Buckley as `requir[ing] \n     ``explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a \n     candidate.''' The Commission even took the position that \n     Furgatch did . . . interpret the Federal election Campaign \n     Act's corporate disclosure statutes as `narrowly limited to \n     communications containing language ``susceptible to no other \n     reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote'' ' . \n     . . .\n       ``Moreover, the FEC argued to the Supreme Court that \n     Furgatch was fully consistent with Buckley and MCFL precisely \n     because the opinion focused on the specific language of \n     Furgatch's advertisement and concluded that express advocacy \n     existed only because the advertisement `explicitly exhorted' \n     voters to defeat then-President Carter. Thus, there is no \n     doubt the Commission understands that its position that no \n     words of advocacy are required in order to support its \n     jurisdiction runs directly counter to Supreme Court \n     precedent.'' \\218\\\n       The fourth Circuit took the FEC to task for ``dissembling \n     before th[e] court'' for ``quot[ing] the very sentence from \n     page 80 of Buckley in which the Court uses the phrase \n     `express advocacy,''' but leaving out ``the sentence's \n     footnote 108'' (which defined express advocacy ``to mean \n     `express words of advocacy,'') without ``any reference, by \n     parenthetical or otherwise to the fact that footnote 108 \n     appears in that sentence.\\219\\\n       The Fourth Circuit concluded that the FEC had acted in bad \n     faith by bringing an enforcement action against the Christian \n     Action network in the face of absolutely clear precedent on \n     the express advocacy test: ``In the face of the unequivocal \n     Supreme Court and other authority discussed, an argument such \n     as that made by the FEC in this case, that `no words of \n     advocacy are necessary to expressly advocate the election of \n     a candidate,' simply cannot be advanced in good faith (as the \n     disingenuousness in the FEC's submissions attests), much less \n     with `substantial justification.''' \\220\\\n       The Fourth Circuit further concluded that, even if the \n     precedent were not unequivocally clear, the court ``would \n     bridle at the power over political speech that would reside \n     in the FEC under'' the FEC's interpretation of the express \n     advocacy test.\\221\\ The FEC's interpretation, said the court \n     boils down to ``an argument that the FEC will know `express \n     advocacy' when it sees it.'' \\222\\ The court summarized the \n     clarity of the precedent and the danger of FEC's \n     overreaching as follows: ``[T]he Supreme Court has \n     unambiguously held that the First Amendment forbids the \n     regulation of our political speech under such \n     indeterminate standards. `Explicit words of advocacy of \n     election or defeat of a candidate,' `express words of \n     advocacy,' the Court has held, are the constitutional \n     minima. To allow the government's power to be brought to \n     bear on less, would effectively be to dispossess corporate \n     citizens of their fundamental right to engage in the very \n     kind of political issue advocacy the First Amendment was \n     intended to protect--as this case well confirms.''\\223\\\n       In summary, as this section has shown, there has been a \n     long and relentless effort by the FEC to close what it has \n     perceived to be a loophole with respect to issue advocacy--\n     the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's express advocacy \n     test and major purpose test remain as the twin bulwarks \n     against this encroachment of liberty.\n\n\n           iv. other protection for free political expression\n\n       In addition to its zealous safeguarding of issue advocacy \n     in the election context, the United States Supreme Court has \n     provided safeguards for other forms of speech related to \n     political matters. The seven key protections have to do with \n     (1) MCFL-type organizations, (2) members, (3) anonymous \n     literature, (4) caps on contributions and expenditures, (5) \n     political committees, (6) the burden of proof, and (7) prior \n     restraint of speech. These topics will be dealt with in turn.\n\n\n                       a. mcfl-type organizations\n\n       In FEC v. Masschusetts Citizens for Life,\\224\\ the Supreme \n     Court did two important things: (1) it reasserted the bright-\n     line express advocacy test for protecting issue advocacy, and \n     (2) it also created an exemption to the ban on corporate \n     express advocacy found in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b for nonprofit, \n     nonstock, ideological corporations. Other cases have refined \n     this test for MCFL-type organizations. As would be expected, \n     the FEC has attempted to overrule the case law with new \n     regulations, which have promptly been declared \n     unconstitutional. These developments will be considered in \n     turn.\n       Section 441b of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 \n     prohibits corporations from making ``expenditures'' in \n     connection with a federal election.\\225\\ The United States \n     Supreme Court, however, has limited the scope of Sec. 441b's \n     corporate expenditure prohibition. In MCFL, the Supreme Court \n     held that the prohibition on corporate expenditures could not \n     constitutionally be applied to certain nonprofit ideological \n     membership corporations because they did not pose a threat of \n     corruption to the political system.\\226\\\n       Specifically, the ``MCFL exemption'' from the prohibition \n     on corporate political speech applies to those nonprofit \n     corporations which were established to promote political \n     ideas, have no shareholders or members with economic \n     disincentives to disassociate with the corporation if they \n     disagree with its position on an issue, were not established \n     by a business corporation or labor union, and do not act as \n     `'conduits'' for funneling money from such organizations into \n     the political marketplace.\\227\\\n       In Day v. Holahan,\\228\\ the Eighth Circuit held that the \n     MCFL exemption applied to Minnesota Citizens Concerned for \n     Life (MCCL), despite the face that the organization received \n     some corporate contributions. The court held that MCCL was \n     the type of corporation which did not pose a threat of \n     corruption to the political marketplace and, therefore, under \n     the Constitution, was entitled to the MCFL exemption. As a \n     result, the Eighth Circuit held that a Minnesota state \n     statute that narrowed the MCFL exemption to such an extent \n     that it did not apply to MCCL was unconstitutional. This \n     case, therefore, established a de minimis test with respect \n     to MCFL-type organizations which receive some minimal \n     corporate contributions.\n       Subsequent to Day, the FEC promulgated regulations at 11 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 114.10, purporting to define the circumstances \n     under which the MCFL exemption is available to nonprofit \n     ideological corporations under the FECA. In it's \n     ``Explanation and Justification'' for the regulation, the FEC \n     explicitly admitted that its regulation was in direct \n     conflict with Day v. Holahan: ``In that case, the Eighth \n     Circuit decided that a Minnesota statute that closely tracked \n     the Supreme Court's three essential features was \n     unconstitutional as applied to a Minnesota nonprofit \n     corporation. The Commission believes the Eighth Circuit's \n     decision, which is controlling law in only one circuit, is \n     contrary to the plain language used by the Supreme Court in \n     MCFL, and therefore is of limited authority.'' \\229\\\n       Thus, the FEC promulgated 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.10 despite its \n     recognition that the regulations would directly violate the \n     Eighth Circuit's holding in Day.\n       The FEC's regulations disallowed an exemption unless, inter \n     alia, each of the following criteria were met: (1) the \n     corporation's ``only express purpose is the promotion of \n     political ideas,'' \\230\\ (2) the corporation ``cannot engage \n     in business activities,'' \\231\\ (3) the corporation has \n     ``[n]o persons who are offered or who receive any benefit \n     that is a disincentive for them to disassociate themselves \n     with the corporation on the basis of a political issue.'' \n     \\232\\ and (4) the corporation can ``demonstrate through \n     accounting records'' that it ``does not . . . accept \n     donations or anything of value from business corporations'' \n     or that it ``has a written policy against accepting donations \n     from business corporations. . . .'' \\233\\\n       The FEC regulations further required \\234\\ that a \n     corporation which is not a political committee file a \n     certification that it complied with the provisions of the \n     regulations \\235\\ and, therefore, was eligible for an \n     exemption from the prohibition on corporate expenditures. The \n     regulations also required that ``[w]henever a qualified \n     nonprofit corporation solicits donations, the solicitation \n     shall inform potential donors that their donations may be \n     used for political purposes, such as supporting or opposing \n     candidates.'' \\236\\\n       The FEC's new regulations were clearly unconstitutional. \n     They constituted another transparent effort by the FEC to \n     expand its power and to limit political speech, as set out \n     below.\n\n  1. MCFL's Test for an Exemption from Sec. 441b Must Be Read in the \n            Context of That Case's Protection of Free Speech\n\n       The Supreme Court's decision in MCFL is essentially a \n     speech-protective holding. The Court's fashioning of the \n     ``MCFL exemption'' was rooted in the very principles of \n     public policy and governance which animate the First \n     Amendment, and which bear brief reiteration. The Court stated \n     that ``[f]reedom of speech plays a fundamental role in a \n     democracy. . . .'' \\237\\ As the Court had previously stated \n     in Buckley: ``Discussion of public issues and debate on the \n     qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of \n     the system of government established by our Constitution. The \n     First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such \n     political expression in order to assure [the] unfettered \n     interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and \n     social changes desired by the people.'' \\238\\\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\n       Freedom of speech, particularly political speech, is thus \n     necessary to the functioning of a representative democracy. \n     As such, it is also ``the matrix, the indispensable condition \n     of every other form of freedom.'' \\239\\ That is, because \n     freedom of speech protects our very form of government, it \n     necessarily plays a pivotal and essential role in protecting \n     the other freedoms which are safeguarded by the Constitution. \n     Finally, as the MCFL Court pointed out, ``First Amendment \n     speech is not necessarily limited to such an instrumental \n     role.'' \\240\\ In other words, the First Amendment protects \n     speech not only because it fosters free government, but \n     because it fosters the development of the individual by \n     protecting freedom of thought and conscience. Quoting Justice \n     Brandeis, the Court stated: ``Those who won our independence \n     believed that the final end of the State was to make men free \n     to develop their faculties; and that in its government the \n     deliberative forces should prevail over the arbitrary. They \n     valued liberty both as an end and as a means.'' \\241\\\n       Thus, free speech plays a vital role in protecting \n     democracy itself, thereby making possible the other freedoms \n     we enjoy and allowing people to develop their faculties to \n     the fullest extent possible.\n       Given the centrality of free speech, it is not surprising \n     that the Supreme Court has been extremely solicitous to \n     protect it. The MCFL Court explained that, because free \n     speech is fundamental, ``we must be as vigilant against the \n     modest diminution of speech as we are against the mode3st \n     diminution of speech as we are against its sweeping \n     restriction.'' \\242\\ The Court's solicitude for free speech, \n     in turn, caused it to fashion the fundamental principle which \n     both mandates and explains the Court's holding in MCFL: \n     ``Where at all possible, government must curtail speech only \n     to the degree necessary to meet the particular problem at \n     hand, and must avoid infringing on speech that does not pose \n     the danger that has prompted regulation.'' \\243\\\n       The quoted statement is, in reality, a reformulation of the \n     ``strict scrutiny'' test (i.e., speech regulation must be \n     narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest) which \n     the Supreme Court applies in all cases where a regulation is \n     challenged as a content-based restriction on speech.\\244\\ In \n     essence, the Court was saying that, because as a Nation we \n     value free speech so highly, our government is permitted to \n     regulate it only where the government's interest is \n     compelling and only to the extent absolutely necessary to \n     achieve that interest.\n       The burden of demonstrating the existence of such an \n     interest is squarely on the government. As the Supreme Court \n     explained in First National Bank v. Bellotti, ``where, as \n     here, as a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the \n     speech is intimately related to the process of governing, the \n     State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest \n     which is compelling and the burden is on the Government to \n     show the existence of such an interest. Even then, the State \n     must employ means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary \n     abridgement. . . .'' \\245\\\n       The MCFL Court pointed out the danger which looms whenever \n     speech is sought to be regulated, i.e., the incremental loss \n     of freedom which may begin when we first allow speech to be \n     restricted in pursuit of other governmental goals. ``Our \n     pursuit of other governmental ends, however, may tempt us to \n     accept in small increments a loss that would be unthinkable \n     if inflicted all at once.'' Thus, courts should, wherever \n     possible, avoid the slippery slope of speech regulation \n     altogether--for although a particular restriction on speech \n     may appear to be ``modest,'' no restriction of speech is ever \n     ``minor.''\n       The import of the above discussion is that the specific \n     legal rules which the Supreme Court has developed (such as \n     the MCFL exemption) have not been fashioned in a vacuum. \n     Rather, they have a discernible origin in the public policies \n     which inform the First Amendment. Those policies, in turn, \n     are determinative of the rationales upon which the specific \n     holdings are based.\n       However, in fashioning its ``MCFL exemption'' regulations, \n     the FEC read MCFL as if those policies and rationales did not \n     give meaning to its holdings. The FEC, therefore, justified \n     its regulation almost completely by reference to the eight \n     sentences toward the end of the MCFL opinion which contain \n     a summary of the Court's specific holding,\\247\\ while \n     largely ignoring the lengthy discussion of the rationale \n     for the holding which comprises the previous eight pages. \n     However, it is rudimentary that ``black letter law'' \n     cannot be understood without reference to the judicial \n     reasoning which undergirds it.\n       In sum, the FEC sought a ``modest diminution'' in speech \n     based on ``government ends'' other than the protection of \n     free speech. However, the FEC has been unable to meet its \n     heavy burden of demonstrating that its asserted interests are \n     compelling and that its speech restriction is narrowly \n     tailored.\n\n    2. The Scope of Each of the MCFL Features Was Determined by the \n                     Rationales Which Underlaid It\n\n       The Court in MCFL identified ``three features essential'' \n     to its holding that MCFL could not be prohibited from \n     independent political spending: ``First, it was formed for \n     the express purpose of promoting political ideas, and cannot \n     engage in business activities. Second, it has no shareholders \n     or other persons affiliated so as to have a claim on its \n     assets or earnings. Third, MCFL was not established by a \n     business corporation or labor union, and it is its policy not \n     to accept contributions from such entities.'' \\248\\\n       As will be seen, the FEC took these ``essential features'' \n     literally and provided in its regulations that, if a \n     corporation did not have these identical features, it was \n     denied the ``MCFL exemption.'' As will be demonstrated, \n     however, each of these features was explicitly tied to a \n     rationale which both explained the feature and defined its \n     scope.\n\n a. The first MCFL feature assured that political resources reflected \n                           political support\n\n       The first feature which mandated an exemption from \n     Sec. 441(b) was that the corporation in question was ``formed \n     for the express purpose of promoting political ideas, and \n     cannot engage in business activities.'' \\249\\ As the Supreme \n     Court stated, this feature ``ensures that political resources \n     reflect political support.'' \\250\\ The underlying reason for \n     this concern was ``to protect the integrity of the \n     marketplace of political ideas'' from ``the corrosive \n     influence of concentrated corporate wealth.'' \\251\\\n       In fashioning this feature, the Court was concerned that \n     ``[d]irect corporate spending on political activity raises \n     the prospect that resources amassed in the economic \n     marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the \n     political marketplace.'' \\252\\ As the Court later clarified \n     in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the danger was not \n     simply the infusion of money into the political marketplace, \n     but infusion of funds amassed in the economic marketplace \n     which were unrelated to support for the corporation's \n     political ideas.\\253\\\n       However, as the FEC's broad prohibition of ``business \n     activities'' \\254\\ demonstrated, the FEC misconstrued this \n     rationale as prohibiting any business income by the \n     corporation. The FEC regulation reached ``any provision of \n     goods or services which results in income to the \n     corporation'' and which is not ``expressly described'' as \n     donations for political purposes, as well as any \n     ``advertising or promotional activity which results in income \n     to the corporation.'' \\255\\ The Supreme Court, however, was \n     concerned solely with the impact on the political marketplace \n     caused by the use of funds which are unrelated to the \n     corporation's political ideas.\\256\\\n       The MCFL Court recognized that Sec. 441b took account of \n     this distinction by allowing corporations to make political \n     expenditures through a separate segregated fund or PAC. \n     Expenditures by a PAC are permitted precisely because they \n     come from voluntary contributions and, therefore, reflect \n     political support: ``the money collected is that intended by \n     those who contribute to be used for political purposes and \n     not money diverted from another source.'' \\257\\ The FEC \n     failed to recognize that, just as PACs do not pose the \n     problem sought to be addressed by Sec. 441b, i.e., ``that \n     substantial general purpose treasuries should not be diverted \n     to political purposes,'' \\258\\ neither do ideological \n     corporations such as MCFL.\n       As the MCFL Court explained, ``the power of a corporation \n     may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.'' \\259\\ \n     Unlike business corporations, however, the resources of which \n     ``are not an indication of popular support,'' the resources \n     available to corporations such as MCFL exist precisely \n     because of their political support, i.e., the fact that the \n     ideas that they propound are considered to be important to \n     those who, for example, patronize its bake sales.\n       The Supreme Court could not have been clearer about its \n     rationale in this regard: ``[r]egulation of corporate \n     political activity thus has reflected concern not about the \n     use of the corporate form per se, but about the unfair \n     deployment of wealth for political purposes. Groups such as \n     MCFL do not pose that danger of corruption.'' \\260\\\n       In its ``Explanation and Justification'' for the challenged \n     regulation, the FEC demonstrated its complete \n     misunderstanding of the above-quoted language: ``[i]n order \n     to pose no such threat, a corporation must be free from \n     resources obtained in the economic marketplace. Only those \n     corporations that cannot engage in business activities are \n     free from these kinds of resources.'' \\261\\ However, as \n     demonstrated, the Court's rationale in this regard did not \n     constitute a condemnation of the political use of ``resources \n     obtained in the economic marketplace''; rather, it was only \n     concerned with the diversion of funds acquired in the \n     economic marketplace to the political marketplace where those \n     funds were acquired in a manner which was unrelated to the \n     political purposes of the corporation.\n       Groups such as MCFL, however, do not pose a threat of the \n     danger that funds unrelated to the corporation's political \n     goals will be funneled into the political marketplace of \n     ideas. This is so because ``[t]he resources it has available \n     are not a function of its success in the economic \n     marketplace, but its popularity in the political \n     marketplace.''\\262\\ Contributors give money to such groups \n     precisely because they wish to further the groups' political \n     goals, i.e., ``because they regard such a contribution as a \n     more effective means of advocacy than spending the money \n     under their own personal direction.''\\263\\ Likewise, a person \n     who engages in ``business activities'' with such an \n     organization does so with the same underlying motivation. He \n     does not spend money at a bake sale or a flower sale \n     primarily to get cookies or carnations. Rather, he does so to \n     benefit the organization and to further its political goals, \n     which he realizes are better served by concerted action than \n     by his individual efforts. Thus, the money which changes \n     hands is directly related to the political purposes of the\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\n     organization and does not come within the permissible \n     rationale for restricting all corporate expenditures.\n       The FEC, however, ignored the distinction between business \n     activities which are unrelated to political ideas and those \n     which are related to political ideas in their regulations. \n     Through its denial of the exemption to any corporation which \n     engages in any ``business activities'' (so broadly defined as \n     to include such insensibly politically-motivated transactions \n     as purchases made at bake sales and sales of an ad in a \n     newsletter), the FEC had extended its regulation to ``speech \n     that does not pose the danger that has prompted \n     regulation.''\\264\\\n\n   b. The Second MCFL Feature Assured That Members Would Not Have a \n    Disincentive to Disassociate With a Corporation With Which They \n                                Disagree\n\n       The second MCFL feature was that a corporation ``has no \n     shareholders or others associated so as to have a claim on \n     its assets or earnings.''\\265\\ Like the other MCFL features, \n     this one cannot be understood apart from the rationale for \n     its formulation. The Supreme Court explained that the absence \n     of such persons ``ensures that persons connected with the \n     organization will have no disincentive for disassociating \n     with it if they disagree with its political activity.''\\266\\ \n     In developing this feature, the Supreme Court was concerned \n     with situations which may arise with respect to the ordinary \n     business corporation or labor union. It is conceivable that \n     people who are associated with such entities would not want \n     their dues or investment funds used for political purposes. \n     As the Court explained: ``such persons . . . contribute \n     investment funds or union dues for economic gain, and do not \n     necessarily authorize the use of their money for political \n     ends. Furthermore, because such individuals depend on the \n     organization for income or for a job it is not enough to tell \n     them that any unhappiness with the use of their money can be \n     redressed simply by leaving the corporation or the \n     union.''\\267\\\n       Based on this reasoning, the MCFL Court concluded that, \n     although it was reasonable for Congress to require the \n     establishment of separate segregated funds to which such \n     persons could make voluntary contributions, ``[t]his \n     rationale for regulations is not compelling with respect to \n     independent expenditures by [MCFL].''\\268\\ This is because, \n     as explained above, MCFL had no stockholders or members who \n     could share in the corporation's assets or earnings.\n       In fashioning its new regulation, however, the FEC again \n     failed to take account of the underlying rationale and how it \n     affects the scope of the feature. In denying the exemption to \n     corporations who offer any benefit, no matter how de minimis \n     to its members,\\269\\ the FEC failed to recognize that the \n     primary purpose of the feature was to protect those who \n     ``depend on the organization for income or for a job,'' that \n     is, those who may have a ``claim on its assets or \n     earnings.''\\270\\ Thus, as with the first MCFL feature, the \n     scope of this feature can only be understood by reference to \n     the rationale for its creation.\n\nc. The Third MCFL Feature Assured That Exempt Corporations Did Not Act \n   as Conduits for the Type of Spending That Created a Threat to the \n                         Political Marketplace\n\n       The third MCFL feature concerned the fact that ``NCFL was \n     not established by a business corporation or labor union, and \n     it was its policy not to accept contributions from such \n     entities.''\\271\\ In Austin, the Court described this feature \n     as ensuring ``the organization's independence from the \n     influence of business corporations.''\\272\\ The rationale for \n     this feature is that such independence ``prevents such \n     corporations from serving as conduits for the type of direct \n     spending that creates a threat to the political \n     marketplace.''\\273\\\n       In its regulation, however, the FEC not only required that \n     corporations be in fact independent of the influence of \n     business corporations, but also that they either have a \n     policy against accepting any donations from business \n     corporations or do not accept, either directly or indirectly, \n     donations from business corporation. As the Second Circuit \n     recognized in FEC v. Survival Education Fund (SEC),\\274\\ \n     however, the rationale of this feature does not depend on \n     whether a corporation has a policy against accepting \n     corporate donations, but upon whether it is, in fact, \n     independent of the influence of corporate donations. That \n     Court explained:\n       ``To be sure, an express policy against accepting corporate \n     or union contributions is clear proof that no such danger \n     exists, as the Court in MCFL duly found. But a nonprofit \n     political advocacy corporation, which in fact receives no \n     significant funding from unions or business corporations, \n     does not surrender its First Amendment freedoms for want of \n     such a policy.\n       ``Under MCFL, a nonprofit political advocacy corporation \n     having no shareholders or members with financial \n     disincentives to disassociate from the corporation if they \n     disagree with its views is exempt from Sec. 441b as long as \n     it is independent in fact from significant business or labor \n     influence. The existence of a policy against accepting \n     contributions from business corporations or unions is \n     relevant to, but not dispositive of, the issue of \n     independence.''\\275\\\n       In addition, it is not necessary that the corporation \n     receives no business contributions. As the court in Day v. \n     Holahan found, ``the key issue here is the amount of for-\n     profit corporate funding a nonprofit receives, rather than \n     the establishment of a policy not to accept significant \n     amounts.''\\276\\\n       Thus, the Eight Circuit in Day recognized, like the Second \n     Circuit in SEF, that ``the factual findings of MCFL [did not] \n     translate into absolutes in legal application.''\\277\\ The \n     scope of each of these features can be understood only by \n     understanding the particular evil that the Supreme Court in \n     MCFL sought to avoid. For that reason, governmental \n     regulation is permissible only to the extent ``necessary to \n     meet the particular problem at hand,''\\278\\ However, the FEC \n     overstepped the zone of permissible regulation and has sought \n     to regulate speech which is protected by a proper \n     understanding of the purposes and rationales which account \n     for the MCFL exemption.\n\n3. Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life v. FEC Held the FEC's New MCFL \n                          Regulations Unlawful\n\n       A challenge, under the Administrative Procedures Act, to \n     the new FEC regulations of MCFL-type organizations was \n     brought in the Eighth Circuit case of Minnesota Citizens \n     Concerned for Life v. FEC.\\279\\ The district court declared \n     the new regulations void as beyond the statutory authority of \n     the FEC as construed by the federal courts.\n       The court based its rejection of the regulations on the \n     ``functional interpretation'' of Day rather than the ``formal \n     interpretation'' of the FEC.\\280\\ In examining the \n     regulations, the District Court specifically found that the \n     ``prohibition against any `business activities' '' and the \n     ``prohibition against the receipt of corporate donations \n     [are], unquestionably, too restrictive.'' \\281\\\n       In addition, the district court also implied that the third \n     and fourth provisions were of questionable validity under the \n     approach taken by the Eight Circuit in Day. As the district \n     court states, ``Day rejected a `bright-line' approach to \n     implementing the MCFL exemption, and instead looked to the \n     particular characteristics of the nonprofit as they relate to \n     the purpose of Sec. 441(b) and the members' First Amendment \n     rights. Thus, Day casts serious doubt on Sec. 114.10(c)(1)'s \n     requirement that a qualified nonprofit's `only' express \n     purpose be the expression of political ideas and \n     Sec. 114.10(c)(3)(ii)['s] requirement that a qualified \n     nonprofit not have members which receive `any' benefit which \n     is disincentive to associate themselves from the \n     corporation.'' \\282\\\n       The FEC appealed the decision to the Eighth Circuit, which \n     decided Day, apparently on the hope that the circuit would \n     change its mind about its understanding of the MCFL \n     exemption.\\283\\ On May 7, 1977, the Eighth Circuit affirmed \n     the decision of the district court.\\284\\\n\n\n                               B. MEMBERS\n\n       Another protection for speech about political matters by \n     organizations is the First Amendment guarantee that \n     organizations may communicate with their members unencumbered \n     by governmental regulation. This protection was recognized in \n     1948 by the Supreme Court in United States v. Congress of \n     Industrial Organizations (CIO).\\285\\ As noted earlier in this \n     article, this case involved a prohibition on ``any \n     expenditure in connection with a federal election'' by a \n     corporation or labor organization.\\286\\ Charges were brought \n     against the CIO for publishing in its membership newsletter a \n     statement urging members to vote for a particular federal \n     candidate.\\287\\ The Court cited several authorities about the \n     sacrosanct nature of free expression and dismissed the \n     indictment, stating that: ``If Sec. 313 were construed to \n     prohibit the publication, by corporations and unions in the \n     regular course of conducting their affairs, of periodicals \n     advising their members, stockholders or customers of danger \n     or advantage to their interests from the adoption of \n     measures, or the election to office of men espousing such \n     measures, the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to \n     its constitutionality.'' \\288\\\n       In 1982, the Supreme Court revisited the subject in FEC v. \n     National Right to Work Committee (NRWC).\\289\\ This case \n     involved solicitation by NRWC to ``some 267,000 persons for \n     contributions to a separate segregated fund [a PAC] that it \n     sponsored.'' \\290\\ NRWC was a nonstock corporation.\\291\\ The \n     issue was whether NRWC had limited its solicitations to \n     ``members'' within the meaning of 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 441b(b)(4)(A) and (C), which provide that a \n     nonstock corporation may solicit contributions to its PAC \n     only from ``members'' of the corporation.\\292\\ The organic \n     documents of NRWC stated that it would have no members.\\293\\ \n     Although NRWC had mailed millions of letters promoting its \n     opposition to compulsory unionism and soliciting donations, \n     none mentioned membership.\\294\\ When NRWC created its PAC \n     (because corporations could not contribute to candidates \n     under 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441(b)), it solicited persons who had \n     made donations to NRWC. Upon examining the brief legislative \n     history of Sec. 441(b), the Supreme Court decided that the \n     congressional intent was ``that some relatively enduring and \n     independently significant financial or organizational \n     attachment is required to be a `member' under \n     Sec. 441b(b)(4)(C).'' \\295\\ As a consequence, the Court \n     held that NRWC did not have members ``under any reasonable \n     interpretation of the statute.'' \\296\\ The Court \n     reiterated the high constitutional protection accorded \n     associational rights,\\297\\ holding that, in this case, \n     ``the associational rights asserted by respondents may be \n     and are overborne by the interests Congress has sought to \n     protect in enacting Sec. 441(b).'' \\298\\\n       Not content with the statutory definition of ``member,'' \n     with the new gloss of NRWC,\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\n     the FEC set about to define ``member'' in new regulations. As \n     usual, the FEC pursued a speech and association suppressing \n     approach, attempting to define ``member'' as narrowly as \n     possible in order to limit as much as possible the class of \n     persons to whom the corporation may communicate its political \n     messages and from whom it may solicit PAC funds.\n       An older definition of ``member'' had been promulgated by \n     the FEC in 1976. The regulation defined the term as: ``all \n     persons who are currently satisfying the requirements for \n     membership in a membership organization, trade association, \n     cooperative, or corporation without capital stock. . . . A \n     person is not considered a member under this definition if \n     the only requirement for membership is a contribution to a \n     separate segregated fund.'' \\299\\\n       The new definition of ``member,'' promulgated in 1993, \n     defined the term much more restrictively:\n       ``Members means all persons who are currently satisfying \n     the requirements for membership in a membership association, \n     affirmatively accept the membership association's invitation \n     to become a member, and either:\n       ``(i) Have some significant financial attachment to the \n     membership association, such as a significant investment or \n     ownership stake (but not merely the payment of dues);\n       ``(ii) Are required to pay on a regular basis a specific \n     amount of dues . . . and are entitled to vote directly either \n     for at least one member who has fully participatory and \n     voting rights on the highest governing body of the membership \n     association, or for those who select at least one member . . \n     .; or\n       ``(iii) Are entitled to vote directly for all those on the \n     highest governing body of the membership association.'' \\300\\\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Medical \n     Association were both affected by the new regulation and \n     ``ceased making their traditional political solicitations'' \n     to persons they had considered their members.\\301\\ They filed \n     suit seeking a declaration that the FEC had violated their \n     First Amendment rights by ignoring the disjunctive ``or'' in \n     the Supreme Court's statement quoted above,\\302\\ treating it \n     rather as a conjunctive ``and.'' \\303\\\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit found fatal flaws in the new FEC \n     regulations. The court faulted the notion that dues to a \n     nonstock corporation were less of a financial attachment to \n     the organization than was ownership of a single share of \n     stock in a public corporation.\\304\\ The court also faulted \n     the requirement that a ``member'' who paid dues must vote \n     directly for a member of the highest governing body, noting \n     that this excluded without justification many hierarchical \n     organizations.\\305\\ As a result, the court declared the \n     regulations void under the Administrative Procedures Act.\n       Based on the case law, therefore, to be a ``member'' of a \n     nonstock organization to receive a corporation's or labor \n     union's political communications and to be solicited for PAC \n     purposes, one must have some financial connection with the \n     organization (usually done with dues payments) and have a \n     right to vote at least at a local level for persons who will \n     chose the voting representative of a local organization to \n     the larger governing body of the organization (typically done \n     by allowing local members to vote for the local delegate to \n     the state-wide governing body of the organization.\\306\\\n\n\n                        C. ANONYMOUS LITERATURE\n\n       In McIntyre v. Ohio Election Commission,\\307\\ the United \n     States Supreme Court declared that a broadly worded \n     requirement that there be a mandated disclaimer identifying \n     the author or any writing intended to ``influence'' an \n     election is unconstitutional. Indeed, the Supreme \n     Court upheld the right of an individual or organization to \n     publish anonymously concerning the advocacy of political \n     causes.\n       In McIntyre, the Court considered an Ohio election \n     practices statute in the context of an enforcement action \n     against a woman, Margaret McIntyre, who distributed flyers \n     generated on a home computer and printed at her own expense \n     relating to a referendum on a proposed school tax levy.\\308\\ \n     Some of her handbills identified her as the author, while \n     others contained the identifier ``CONCERNED PARENTS AND TAX \n     PAYERS.'' \\309\\ Margaret was fined $100 by the Ohio Election \n     Commission for failure to use the required disclaimer.\\310\\ \n     On appeal of the case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the \n     Ohio statute imposing a state-mandated disclaimer on \n     literature intended to ``influence the voters in any \n     election.'' \\311\\\n       Noting that the statute was a content-based ``limitation on \n     political expression'' at ``the core of the protection \n     afforded by the First Amendment,'' the Court applied \n     ``exacting scrutiny.'' \\312\\ The Court noted that in addition \n     to ``exacting scrutiny'' such a restriction on ``core \n     political speech'' must be ``narrowly tailored to serve an \n     overriding state interest.'' \\313\\\n       Ohio asserted two interests to justify its disclaimer: (1) \n     an ``interest in preventing fraudulent and libelous \n     statements'' and (2) an ``interest in providing the \n     electorate with relevant information.'' \\314\\ The High Court \n     noted that free expression includes the right to release what \n     information one desires and that the name of a private \n     citizen would be meaningless to most readers anyway with \n     regard to the reader's ability to evaluate the message.\\315\\ \n     The Court dismissed the interest in informing the public as \n     ``plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of \n     its disclosure requirements.'' \\316\\\n       The Court gave more weight to Ohio's interest in preventing \n     fraud and libel, noting that this interest ``carries special \n     weight during election campaigns when false statements, if \n     credited, may have serious adverse consequences for the \n     public at large.'' \\317\\ The Court, noted, however, that Ohio \n     had a statute setting forth penalties for false statements \n     during political campaigns, so that the disclaimer provision \n     was ``not its principal weapon against fraud.'' \\318\\ The \n     Court noted that the disclaimer provision served as an ``aid \n     to enforcement'' and a ``deterrent to the making of false \n     statements by unscrupulous prevaricators,'' but these \n     ``legitimate'' benefits did not justify the ``extremely \n     broad'' disclaimer mandate.\\319\\\n       This is so the Court said, inter alia, because the broad \n     prohibition ``encompasses documents that are not even \n     arguably false or misleading. It applies not only to the \n     activities of candidates and their organized supporters, but \n     also to individuals acting independently and using only their \n     own modest resources. . . .'' \\320\\\n       The Court distinguished its upholding in Buckley of a \n     requirement that expenditures in excess of a certain amount \n     be reported to the FEC, declaring that the Ohio disclaimer \n     requirements is ``more intrusive than the Buckley disclosure \n     requirement'' and ``rests on different and less powerful \n     state interests.'' The Court noted that the FECA ``regulates \n     only candidate elections, not referenda or other issue-based \n     ballot measures; and we construed `independent expenditures' \n     to mean only those expenditures that `expressly advocate the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.' '' \n     \\321\\\n       Reporting requirements, like disclaimers, are a type of \n     disclosure mechanism.\\322\\ Buckley approved reporting \n     requirements for express advocacy; it did not approve \n     disclaimers on this type of speech. Indeed, McIntyre \n     recognized that Buckley did not even address the issues of \n     disclaimers or anonymous speech: ``Ohio vigorously argues \n     that our opinions in First National Bank of Boston v. \n     Bellotti, . . . and Buckley v. Valeo, . . . amply support the \n     constitutionality of its disclosure requirements [i.e., \n     disclaimer]. Neither case is controlling: . . . [Buckley] \n     concerned mandatory disclosure of campaign-related \n     expenditures [i.e., reporting requirements]. Neither case \n     involved a prohibition of anonymous campaign literature. \n     ''\\323\\\n       McIntyre went on to recognize that Buckley upheld reporting \n     requirements for express advocacy, and unlike disclaimers, \n     such requirements advance the interest in obtaining \n     information without unduly impinging upon protected speech: \n     ``True, in another portion of [Buckley] we [approved] a \n     requirement that even independent expenditures in excess of a \n     certain threshold level be reported. * * * But that \n     requirement entailed nothing more than an identification * * \n     * of the amount and use of money expended in support of a \n     candidate [through a report]. Though such mandatory reporting \n     undeniably impedes protected First Amendment activity, the \n     intrusion is a far cry from compelled self-identification \n     [i.e., disclaimers] on all election-related writings.'' \\324\\\n       The Court concluded that ``the Ohio statute's infringement \n     on speech [disclaimers,] [is] more intrusive than the Buckley \n     disclosure requirement [reporting].'' \\325\\ Both means \n     provide the State with information; however, reporting \n     requirements are more narrowly tailored to do so.\\326\\\n\n\n                   d. contribution & expenditure caps\n\n       Another protection afforded political speech by the First \n     Amendment and recognized by the United States Supreme Court \n     is the limitation on the extent to which government may place \n     caps on contributions and expenditures. While the Court \n     permits some caps on contributions, there are limits as to \n     how low the caps may go. No caps are permitted on independent \n     expenditures.\n       Buckley's point of departure is the principle that any \n     restriction of the amount of money that can be spent in \n     campaigns is suspect. The Supreme Court stated that [a] \n     restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting \n     the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \n     exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\\327\\\n       Thus, a regulation which seeks to regulate political \n     spending is subject to a presumption of invalidity. In \n     Buckley, the Supreme Court did, however, enunciate a \n     constitutional distinction between ``expenditures'' and \n     ``contributions.'' The Court stated that: ``although the \n     Act's contribution and expenditure limitations both implicate \n     fundamental First Amendment interests, its expenditures \n     ceilings impose significantly more severe restrictions on \n     protected freedoms of political expression than do its \n     limitations on financial contributions.'' \\328\\\n       Expenditures could not be regulated unless they constituted \n     ``express advocacy'' of the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate (and if they were ``independent \n     expenditures'' they could not be limited even if they did \n     constitute express advocacy).\\329\\ On the other hand, \n     contributions were, under the reasoning of Buckley, more \n     susceptible of regulation.\n       The Court's reasons for making a distinction of \n     constitutional dimension in this regard were essentially \n     twofold. First, the Court found that contribution limitations\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\n     did not place significant burdens on protected speech and \n     associational freedoms. Second, the Court found that \n     contributions could be limited because, unlike expenditures, \n     they posed the danger of quid pro quo corruption (and the \n     appearance thereof) to the political system. Unless both of \n     these rationales are satisfied, contributions cannot be \n     limited.\n\n I. Contributions Can Only be Limited Because They Threaten Corruption \n                        to the Political System\n\n       As noted above, the Buckley Court began its analysis with \n     the proposition that limits on spending in connection with \n     campaigns are presumptively invalid. It did, however, permit \n     the government to limit contributions to candidates or \n     campaigns. One of the two fundamental rationales for allowing \n     such restrictions was that, unlike expenditures, \n     contributions pose a threat of corruption to the political \n     system. The Court stated that ``[t]o the extent that large \n     contributions are given to secure a political quid pro quo \n     from current and potential office holders, the integrity of \n     our system of representative democracy is undermined.'' \\330\\\n       In addition, the Court was concerned with ``appearance of \n     corruption stemming from public awareness of the \n     opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large \n     individual financial contributions.'' \\331\\ Therefore, the \n     Court permitted governmental limitations on contributions \n     \\332\\ because of the governmental interest ``in the \n     prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption \n     spawned by the real or imagined influence of large \n     financial contributions on candidates' positions and on \n     their actions if elected to office.'' \\333\\\n       The Supreme Court in Buckley then proceeded to approve an \n     aggregate contribution cap of $1,000 for each election by any \n     person to any candidate for federal office.\\334\\ The Court \n     found that the interest in limiting ``the actuality and \n     appearance of corruption resulting from large individual \n     financial contributions'' justified ``the limited effect upon \n     First Amendment freedoms caused by the $1000 contribution \n     ceiling.'' \\335\\ More precisely, the Court found that in 1976 \n     a $1,000 limit on contributions was sufficiently high to be \n     narrowly tailored to limit corruption, while allowing \n     individuals and organizations to assist to a ``substantial \n     extent in supporting candidates and committees with financial \n     resources.'' \\336\\\n       However, contribution caps are not one of those things \n     where, if a little is good, more is better. Efforts to set \n     lower limits have been routinely struck down. In several \n     post-Buckley decisions, courts have upheld contribution \n     limits above $1,000,\\337\\ but have struck down those below \n     it. In Carver v. Nixon,\\338\\ the Eighth Circuit struck down a \n     $300 limit on direct contributions in state elections on the \n     ground that it was not narrowly tailored to advance the \n     state's interest in combating corruption.\\339\\ It noted that \n     Buckley upheld a $1,000 limit twenty years ago because such a \n     limitation focused precisely on the problem with large \n     campaign contributions without unduly impinging on protected \n     speech, i.e., it was narrowly tailored to achieve its \n     goal.\\340\\ Similarly, in Day v. Holahan,\\341\\ the Eighth \n     Circuit struck down a $100 limit on contributions to and from \n     political committees.\\342\\\n\n 2. Expenditures, However, Cannot be Limited Because Doing So Imposes \n  Restrictions on the Freedoms of Speech and Association That are Not \n                   Justified by a Compelling Interest\n\n       As the Buckley Court explained, independent expenditures \n     are entitled to full constitutional protection: ``Advocacy of \n     the election or defeat of candidates for federal office is no \n     less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than \n     discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of the \n     passage or defeat of legislation.'' \\343\\\n       In contrast to contributions, however, ``expenditures'' \n     which are not coordinated with a candidate or campaign do not \n     pose a danger of corruption or its appearance. Thus, there is \n     no compelling interest in their limitation. This is so \n     because a candidate does not necessarily benefit from (and \n     may well even be harmed by) an expenditure which is made \n     independently of his campaign. As the Supreme Court \n     recognized, ``[u]nlike contributions, such independent \n     expenditures may well provide little assistance to the \n     candidate's campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive. \n     The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an \n     expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only \n     undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but \n     also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as \n     a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.'' \n     \\344\\\n       Thus, because as a practical matter the candidate may well \n     not benefit from an expenditure made without coordination, \n     the danger of quid pro quos is obviated. This results not \n     only in alleviating the danger of corruption, but the \n     appearance of corruption as well.\n       In addition, in contrast to limits on contributions that \n     ``entail[s] only a marginal restriction on the contributor's \n     ability to engage in free communication,'' \\345\\ the Court \n     reasoned that, ``because virtually every means of \n     communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the \n     expenditure of money,'' the ``expenditure limitations \n     contained in the Act represent substantial rather than merely \n     theoretical restraints on the quantity and diversity of \n     political speech.'' \\346\\ Whereas a contribution to a \n     candidate merely ``serves as a general expression of \n     support for the candidate and his views, but does not \n     communicate the underlying basis for the support,'' \\347\\ \n     ``a restriction on the amount of money a person or group \n     can spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quality of expression by \n     restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of \n     their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.'' \n     \\348\\\n       As a result, the Court has struck down limits on \n     independent expenditures by individuals \\349\\ and political \n     committees.\\350\\\n\n\n                        e. political committees\n\n       As noted by the Court in Buckley,\\351\\ ``the First \n     Amendment protects political association as well as political \n     expression.'' As a result, citizens have the ``freedom to \n     associate with others for the common advancement of political \n     beliefs and ideas.'' \\352\\ ``Governmental action which may \n     have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is \n     subject to the closest scrutiny.'' \\353\\\n       Political action committees (PACs) are associations \n     organized to enhance the political expression of citizens by \n     joining individual contributions with those of others so that \n     they may more effectively participate in political \n     speech.\\354\\ As a result, the Supreme Court has ``reject(ed) \n     the notion that the PACs form of organization or method of \n     solicitation diminishes their entitlement to First Amendment \n     protection,'' \\355\\ and expressly held that they are \n     protected by the First Amendment freedom of association.\\356\\ \n     Furthermore, any disparate treatment of a political \n     committee, such as lower contribution limits for PACs as \n     opposed to individuals, would violate the PACs freedom of \n     association.\\357\\\n\n\n                           f. burden of proof\n\n       A final protection for free political speech and \n     association is the burden of proof placed on legislatures \n     which enact a ``law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.'' \n     \\358\\ Because free expression and association are such \n     cherished American rights, they are protected as fundamental \n     rights against infringement. To be valid, a law burdening or \n     chilling these rights must serve a compelling interest and be \n     narrowly tailored to effect only that interest.\\359\\\n       Once a plaintiff has demonstrated that a statute infringes \n     the exercise of his or her First Amendment rights, the burden \n     is on the state to justify this infringement. As the United \n     States Supreme Court declared in 1978: ``The \n     constitutionality of Sec. 8's prohibition of the `exposition \n     of ideas' [a ban on corporate contributions or expenditures \n     to influence the outcome of a referendum] by corporations \n     turns on whether it can survive the exacting scrutiny \n     necessitated by a state-imposed restriction of freedom of \n     speech. Especially where, as here, a prohibition is directed \n     at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the \n     process of governing, `the State may prevail only upon \n     showing a subordinating interest which is compelling' `and \n     the burden is on the Government to show the existence of such \n     an interest.' Even then, the State must employ means `closely \n     drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment. . . .' '' \\360\\\n       The state's effort to carry its burden must be done under \n     ``the closest scrutiny.'' \\361\\ As the U.S. Supreme Court has \n     stated: ``When the government defends a regulation on speech \n     . . . it must do more than simply ``posit the existence of \n     the disease sought to be cured.'' . . . It must demonstrate \n     that the recited harms are real, . . . and that the \n     regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and \n     material way.'' \\362\\\n       In Carver v. Nixon,\\363\\ a case involving campaign \n     contribution caps, the Eighth Circuit declared that the \n     government must produce ``evidence to demonstrate that the \n     limits were narrowly tailored to combat corruption or the \n     appearance of corruption. . . .'' \\364\\ ``The record is \n     barren of any evidence of a harm or disease that needed to \n     be addressed,'' the court proclaimed.\\365\\\n       In Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Maupin,\\366\\ the U.S. \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri observed \n     that ``[d]efendants wholly failed to adduce any evidence of \n     actual corruption taking place. . . . The harm that the \n     defendants seek to eradicate must exist and its cure must \n     specifically be directed toward the elimination of that harm. \n     . . . . The defendants fail to point to one incident wherein \n     a[n] . . . official . . . has cast a vote or agreed to \n     influence a vote, during the general assembly's regular \n     session, in exchange for a contribution. As for the \n     appearance of corruption, the defendants' two witnesses \n     testified in general terms of their belief that the public \n     perceives the acceptance of contributions during the \n     legislative session as ``inappropriate''. No factual basis \n     was given for these witnesses' perception that the electorate \n     believes that contributions accepted during the general \n     assembly's regular session reflect corruptive deal-making.'' \n     \\367\\\n       In sum, when the government makes a law abridging free \n     speech, it has an extremely heavy burden of proof that there \n     is a compelling interest, and this burden must be met with \n     the clearest of facts carefully established, not with mere \n     speculation about possible corruption. There are two obvious \n     reasons for this.\n       First is the premier protection given to free speech and \n     free association rights in our constitutional system. Because \n     of the supreme importance of free political speech and \n     association to the very democratic foundations of our \n     Republic, government should\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\n     make no law abridging these expressly protected activities on \n     the basis of unproven speculation about corruption.\n       Second is the fact that the legislation abridging political \n     speech is being enacted by incumbent politicians. Justice \n     Thomas in his concurrence in Colorado Republican put the \n     matter well when he referred to the notion of according \n     special deference to congressional judgments about campaign \n     finance as ``letting the fox stand watch over the henhouse.'' \n     \\368\\ He added, ``What the argument for deference fails to \n     acknowledge is the potential for legislators to set the rules \n     of the electoral game so as to keep themselves in power and \n     to keep potential challengers out of it.'' \\369\\\n       This warning has been echoed by various commentators. For \n     example, Lillian BeVier points out the importance of three \n     scope-of-review issues in protecting constitutional rights in \n     the political speech area: (a) courts must ``insist on a \n     rigorous definition of `corruption' as well as an \n     intelligible description of both empirical counterparts of \n     this corruption and the purified political order it hopes to \n     attain'' \\370\\; (b) courts ``should adopt a `premise of \n     distrust' with respect to legislative means'' \\371\\; and (c) \n     courts should take note of the realities of campaign finance \n     reform--such as ``unintended consequences'' and ``at least \n     temporary reallocations of political advantage'' and sanction \n     ``only reforms that are practically guaranteed to achieve a \n     clearly specified and unquestionably legitimate corruption-\n     prevention goal.'' \\372\\ Similar warnings have come from John \n     Hart Ely \\373\\ and Ralph Winter,\\374\\ among others.\n       Thus, the burden is on the government to establish by clear \n     evidence the compelling interest in corruption or its \n     appearance which it proposes as supporting its decision to \n     make a law abridging free expression in the vital realm of \n     political speech.\n\n\n                      G. PRIOR RESTRAINT OF SPEECH\n\n       The United States Supreme Court has long held that ``the \n     loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of \n     time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.'' \\375\\ \n     This is particularly true with political speech since \n     ``timing is of the essence . . . when an event occurs, it is \n     often necessary to have one's voice heard promptly, if it is \n     to be considered at all.'' \\376\\ Therefore, a prior \n     restraint, even for ``a day or two'' may be intolerable when \n     applied ``to political speech in which the element of \n     timeliness may be important.'' \\377\\\n       As set forth above, the First Amendment protects, as \n     political speech, both political contributions and political \n     expenditures, including both issue advocacy and independent \n     expenditures. Unfortunately, injunctions have been sought \n     and, on occasion, issued by lower state courts for alleged \n     ``violations'' of state election law.\\378\\ These injunctions \n     were sought to restrain the distribution of voter guides and \n     were overturned on appeal,\\379\\ but the damage to First \n     Amendment rights still occurred.\n\n\n           v. a proposal for speech-enhancing campaign reform\n\n       While most efforts at campaign finance reform have been \n     misguided and based on flawed assumptions, there is room for \n     speech-enhancing reform. Key to any reform to be attempted is \n     the need to protect and enhance constitutionally guaranteed \n     free expression. The case law is clear that such speech is \n     constitutionally protected, and, as set forth above, the \n     United States Supreme Court has shown no sign whatsoever that \n     it is prepared to back away from ensuring full First \n     Amendment protection to the political speech involved in \n     campaigns.\n       This section will summarize the flawed premises on which \n     most efforts at campaign finance reform are based, and set \n     out some proposals for speech-enhancing reform.\n\n\n                    A. FAULTY PREMISES TO BE AVOIDED\n\n       Recent campaign finance proposals \\380\\ in the U.S. \n     Congress have been based on certain premises that have been \n     thoroughly rejected by the United States Supreme Court in the \n     seminal election law case of Buckley,\\381\\ and its progeny. \n     As a result of these faulty premises, the proposals \n     themselves are fundamentally flawed and have diverted \n     attention from reform measures that would survive \n     constitutional scrutiny and that would correct current \n     perceived problems in the political system. These faulty \n     premises are as follows.\n\n1. (Faulty Premise #1) The First Amendment Is a Loophole in the Federal \n    Election Campaign Act (FECA) Which Should Be Narrowed or Closed\n\n       As set forth in detail above, the First Amendment protects \n     political freedoms that are vital to our representative \n     democracy. To limit these freedoms is to fundamentally \n     undermine the ability of our citizens to freely select their \n     representatives and to hold them accountable for their \n     governance. As has been shown, there is no indication \n     whatsoever that the courts are prepared to cooperate in any \n     endeavor to limit First Amendment freedoms in this area.\\382\\\n\n 2. (Faulty Premise #2) The Political System Is Only about Elections, \n Not about Political Ideas and the Accountability of Elected Officials \n              to the Public for Their Positions on Issues\n\n       The debate about campaign finance reform seems to focus \n     only on elections on the assumption that the political \n     process is only about elections. However, elections are only \n     a part of the political process. More importantly, elections \n     are simply a part of our system of democratic representative \n     government which fundamentally depends on ``the free \n     discussion of governmental affairs.'' \\383\\ Thus, issue \n     advocacy during an election, even though it may influence the \n     election, is also about the discussion of issues of public \n     concern and about holding public officials accountable for \n     their positions on these issues. Representative government \n     cannot survive without this ``free discussion of governmental \n     affairs.''\n\n3. (Faulty Premise #3) The Rising Cost of Political Campaigns Justifies \n              Severe Government Restrictions on Campaigns\n\n       Some promoters of campaign finance reform assert that the \n     rising cost of elections and the growing size of special \n     interest donations has corrupted the democratic process. On \n     that basis, they believe that severe limitations on campaigns \n     imposed by government are justified.\n       However, the United States Supreme Court has made it clear \n     that it is up to the people, not the government, to determine \n     what is spent on political campaigns. As the Court stated in \n     Buckley: ``In any event, the mere growth in the cost of \n     federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no \n     basis for government restrictions on the quantity of \n     campaign spending and the resulting limitation on the \n     scope of federal campaigns. The First Amendment denies \n     government the power to determine that spending to promote \n     one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. \n     In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not \n     the government, but the people--individually as citizens \n     and candidates and collectively as associations and \n     political committees who must retain control over the \n     quantity and range of debate on public issues in a \n     political campaign.'' \\184\\\n\n   4. (Faculty Premise #4) The Only Way to Redress the Balance Is to \n      Stifle the Speech of Some Rather than to Enhance it for All\n\n       Some promoters of campaign finance reform believe that the \n     system needs to change because it has eroded the power of \n     individual voices and amplified the voices of special \n     interests. In pursuit of equalizing speech, they take the \n     approach of limiting, penalizing, and prohibiting speech of \n     some in order to enhance it for others.\n       However, the United States Supreme Court has expressly \n     rejected this proposition in Buckley: ``the concept that \n     government may restrict the speech of some elements of our \n     society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is \n     wholly foreign to the First Amendment.'' \\385\\ Thus, this \n     approach is fundamentally flawed.\n       But even more tragically, the ``solution'' of stifling \n     speech diverts attention away from positive, constitutional \n     measures which would redress the imbalance in the current \n     system by enhancing the speech of citizens and issue advocacy \n     groups. These speech enhancing measures would restore a \n     proper balance between the voices of ``special interests'' \n     and the voices of individual citizens.\n       Some campaign finance reform advocates believe that the \n     only way that meaningful reform will be enacted is for \n     members to put aside partisan differences and work together \n     to make it happen. While this may be one necessary \n     precondition to reform, it is not the fundamental one. For \n     meaningful reform to occur, Congress must abandon the notion \n     that it is empowered to limit free speech in order to redress \n     any imbalance in speech and instead find ways to level the \n     playing field by enhancing the speech of citizens and issue \n     advocacy groups.\n\n\n          B. POSITIVE PROPOSALS FOR REFORM BY ENHANCING SPEECH\n\n       In contrast to the serious constitutional obstacles to \n     efforts to curtail speech, Congress is free to adopt measures \n     that will enhance and encourage speech. As the Buckley Court \n     explained, in upholding the provision of the FECA providing \n     public funds for elections: ``Although `Congress shall make \n     no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the \n     press.' [public funding of elections] is a congressional \n     effort, not to abridge, restrict, or censor speech, but \n     rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public \n     discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals \n     vital to a self-governing people. Thus, [the provision] \n     furthers, not abridges, pertinent First Amendment values.'' \n     \\386\\\n       But public funding of campaigns is only one way for \n     Congress to ``facilitate and enlarge public discussion and \n     participation in the electoral process.'' The best antidote \n     to the ``undue influence of special interests'' is to \n     encourage citizens to take a more active part, as individuals \n     and in association with others, in the political process.\n       In addition, Congress should act to reign in the FEC's \n     effort to expand its power and regulate issue advocacy. The \n     incorporation of the Court's speech protective holdings in \n     appropriate provisions of the FECA and the adoption of \n     certain administrative reforms of the FEC itself are \n     necessary to accomplish this task. The following measures are \n     designed to do just that.\\387\\\n\n     1. Section 441b of the FECA Should Be Amended to Reflect the \n Protections of Issue Advocacy and of the Political Speech of Not-for-\n                          Profit Corporations\n\n       Section 441(b) of the FECA makes it unlawful for any \n     corporation ``to make a contribution or expenditure in \n     connection with any [federal] election.'' However, as set \n     forth\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\n     above, the United States Supreme Court in MCFL,\\388\\ imposed \n     two significant limitations on this prohibition.\n       First, the Court interpreted Sec. 441b to be limited to \n     expenditures for ``express advocacy.'' Second, the Court held \n     that the prohibition on corporate expenditures was not \n     applicable to certain not-for-profit corporations. These \n     limitations should be incorporated by Congress in Sec. 441(b) \n     by amending it.\n       After Buckley, Congress amended the FECA to incorporate \n     changes in the statute required by the Court. For instance, \n     Congress amended Sec. 434(c) to reflect that disclosure of \n     expenditures by organizations that were not political \n     committees were limited to ``independent expenditures'' and \n     adopted a definition of ``independent expenditure'' in \n     Sec. 431(17).\n       Similarly Congress should amend Sec. 441(b) to incorporate \n     the holdings of MCFL by providing that it is unlawful for any \n     corporation ``to make a contribution or to make an \n     expenditure which expressly advocates the election or defeat \n     of a clearly identified candidate.''\n       In addition, Sec. 441(b) should be amended to add a new \n     subsection which provides that the prohibition on a \n     corporation making an expenditure which expressly advocates \n     the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate does \n     not apply to a not-for-profit membership corporation which \n     (1) does not engage in substantial business activities, other \n     than traditional fundraising activities of not-for-profit \n     organizations, that are unrelated to the charitable, \n     educational or political activities of the organization, (2) \n     has no shareholders or other persons affiliated so as to have \n     a claim on its assets or earnings, and (3) was not \n     established by a business corporation or a labor union and \n     does not receive a substantial portion of its contributions \n     from such entities.\n       These changes would conform with the Court's decision in \n     MCFL, and would signal the willingness of Congress to abide \n     by this important issue advocacy protecting decision. \n     Furthermore, incorporating these changes in the statute will \n     make it readily apparent to all that this provision is narrow \n     on its face; where now one has to read the United States \n     Reports to know about this significant limitation.\n\n2. The Definition of Contribution Should Be Amended to Clarify that It \n                    Does Not Apply to Issue Advocacy\n\n       The Federal Election Commission's effort to regulate and \n     restrict issue advocacy by claiming that it is a contribution \n     to a candidate and subject to the contribution limits if the \n     expenditure for the issue advocacy was coordinated with a \n     candidate should also be addressed. There is no justification \n     for issue advocacy losing its protected status just because \n     it has been communicated to a candidate.\n       This misguided attempt to circumvent the protection of \n     issue advocacy in Buckley can be prevented by adding to those \n     items listed in Sec. 431(8)(B) as not being included in the \n     definition of ``contribution'' ``any expenditure for a \n     communication which does not expressly advocate the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.''\n\n 3. The Definition of Political Committee Should Be Amended to Reflect \n                     the Court's Major Purpose Test\n\n       The Court in Buckley held that an organization cannot be \n     considered a ``political committee'' unless the organization \n     is ``under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of \n     the organization is the nomination or election of a \n     candidate.'' \\389\\ Unfortunately, when Congress amended the \n     FECA after Buckley, this limitation was not included.\n       The effect of Congress's failure to modify the definition \n     of ``political committee'' \\390\\ to meet Buckley's \n     requirements has been to encourage the FEC to run amuck \n     trying to impose on issue advocacy groups the requirements \n     for PACs in the FECA.\\391\\ This has had the effect of \n     chilling the legitimate issue-oriented activities of such \n     groups and has imposed substantial costs on them in their \n     efforts to resist such unconstitutional impositions. Congress \n     should make this change now by amending Sec. 431(4)(a) by \n     adding at the end ``and which is under the control of a \n     candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or \n     election of a candidate.''\n\n 4. Congress Should Allow Certain Not-for-Profit Corporations to Make \n                  Contributions to Federal Candidates\n\n       Since the Supreme Court held in MCFL that certain not-for-\n     profit corporations do not pose any threat to corrupt the \n     electoral process, because contributions to them are \n     generated by their advocacy of political ideas, and they are \n     thus free to make independent expenditures, there is no \n     justification to prohibiting them from also making \n     contributions to federal candidates.\\392\\\n       This change would expand the pool of possible contributors \n     to candidates and, since these nonprofit organizations often \n     promote important political ideas, rather than narrow \n     economic interests, their addition to the pool of possible \n     contributors would help offset these ``special interests.''\n       This change could be made by modifying the new subsection \n     proposed for Sec. 441(b) in Section 1, supra, by providing \n     that the prohibition on a corporation making a contribution \n     or an expenditure which expressly advocates the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate does not apply to \n     the not-for-profit membership corporations described therein.\n\n5. Certain Not-for-Profit Corporations Should Be Allowed to ``Bundle'' \n                 Individual Contributions to Candidates\n\n       Bundling of individual contributions to candidates is \n     currently limited to PACs. Even if certain not-for-profit \n     corporations are not allowed to contribute to candidates, \n     Congress should allow them to solicit from their members \n     individual contributions to candidates that are then \n     ``bundled'' and given to the candidate. This could be \n     accomplished by specifically allowing this activity in the \n     amendment to Sec. 441(b) proposed above.\n       Providing this new method of encouraging individual \n     contributions will enhance political giving by individual \n     citizens, diminishing the relative influence of PACs and \n     ``special interests.'' This ``bundling'' activity should be \n     reported by amending Sec. 434(c) to so provide.\n\n6. The Individual Contribution Limit Should be Increased to $2,500 and \n                    the Aggregate Limit to $100,000\n\n       The individual contribution limit of $1,000, found in \n     Sec. 441(a)(a)(1) (A), and the aggregate contribution limit \n     of $25,000, found in Sec. 441(a) (a)(3), has been in effect \n     since 1974. While a $1,000 contribution represented a large \n     contribution in 1974, it does not today.\\393\\ Furthermore, \n     allowing individuals to make larger contributions will \n     enhance the ability of individual citizens to influence the \n     political process while helping to offset the influence of \n     ``special interests'' and PACs. The individual contribution \n     limit should be raised to $2,500 and be indexed for \n     inflation.\n       Furthermore, to accommodate the increase in individual \n     contributions to candidates and to political parties, \n     suggested below, the aggregate individual contribution limit, \n     found in Sec. 441(a)(a)(3), should be increased to $100,000.\n\n 7. The Individual Contribution Limit to Political Parties Should Also \n                               Be Raised\n\n       Individual contributions to any national political party \n     are limited to $15,000 per year by Sec. 441(a)(a)(2)(B). This \n     limitation has diminished the relative influence of political \n     parties and encouraged them to seek soft money. Increasing \n     the individual contribution limit to $50,000 would help \n     strengthen parties that can provide an effective \n     counterweight to ``special interests.'' \\394\\ Furthermore, \n     most agree that political parties serve a beneficial \n     mediating role in the political process that should be \n     enhanced. Both of these benefits would be derived by \n     increasing the contribution limit to political parties.\\395\\\n\n 8. The Amount Political Parties Can Spend in Coordinated Expenditures \n            with Federal Candidates Should Also Be Increased\n\n       With the increase in the individual contribution limit to \n     political parties, Congress should increase the coordinated \n     expenditure limits provided in Sec. 441(a)(d). These limits \n     have also been in existence since 1974 and were not indexed \n     for increases in the consumer price index as were the \n     expenditure limits on presidential campaigns.\\396\\ Because of \n     the increase in the cost of federal campaigns, the influence \n     of political parties has diminished. Congress should restore \n     this balance and also index the new limits to inflation.\\397\\\n\n9. The FEC Should be Mandated, in its Regulatory Activities, to Observe \n               the Limits Imposed by the First Amendment\n\n       Since the admonitions of the courts have left the FEC \n     unchastened in its regulatory efforts to contain issue \n     advocacy, Congress should mandate that, in its regulatory \n     activities, the FEC should act in a manner that will have the \n     least restrictive effect on the rights of free speech and \n     association protected by the First Amendment. To give this \n     provision some teeth, a reviewing court should be authorized \n     to hold unlawful and set aside any action of the Commission \n     that did not use the least restrictive means available.\n\n 10. Reasonable Attorneys Fees Should Be Authorized by Congress if any \n Provision of the FECA of Action of the FEC Violates Constitutionally \n                            Protected Rights\n\n       The provisions of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988, authorizing an award \n     of attorney fees to prevailing party who vindicates \n     constitutional rights as against a state, are a substantial \n     deterrent to states violating the guarantees of federal law. \n     While federal law currently allows for an award of attorney \n     fees against federal agencies in limited circumstances,\\398\\ \n     the broader guarantees provided in Sec. 1988 are justified in \n     this case for two reasons.\n       First, the FECA uniquely involves the attempt by government \n     to regulate vital First Amendment rights that are \n     ``indispensable democratic freedoms.'' Particularly in light \n     of the efforts by some to pass provisions know to be \n     unconstitutional, a provision that allows an award of \n     attorney fees for a successful effort to strike down a \n     portion of the FECA is warranted.\\399\\\n       Second, the FEC has a sorry history of repeated attempts to \n     unconstitutionally expand its powers to regulate issue \n     advocacy. A significant deterrent to such intransigence, and \n     a justified effort to compensate the victims of it, would be \n     to award attorney fees to those private parties that prevail \n     in FEC enforcement actions or against new FEC regulations.\n\n 11. The Act Should Establish Term Limits for FEC Commissioners, Staff \n                     Director, and General Counsel\n\n       The six commissioners of the FEC are currently appointed \n     for six year terms and are\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\n     eligible for reappointment.\\400\\ The FEC is administered by a \n     staff director and general counsel appointed by the \n     Commission.\\401\\ Because of the strong institutional bias \n     toward regulating free speech in the FEC, fresh blood is \n     needed at the higher echelons of the Commission. This could \n     be established by providing term limits for the \n     Commissioners, staff director, and the general counsel.\n\n12. The Tax Credit for Small Political Contributions Should Be Restored\n\n       The 1974 amendments to the FECA contained a 50% individual \n     tax credit for political contributions up to $100. This tax \n     credit provided a substantial incentive for small political \n     contributions. This incentive should be restored to encourage \n     small contributions from a greater number of citizens.\n\n  13. Limits on Issue Advocacy for Tax Exempt Groups in the Internal \n                   Revenue Code Should Be Eliminated\n\n       The Internal Revenue Code imposes limits on issue advocacy \n     for tax exempt organizations. Specifically, the Internal \n     Revenue Code prohibits groups exempt under Sec. 501(c)(3) \n     from ``participat[ing] in, or interven[ing] in [including the \n     publishing or distributing of statements], any political \n     campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office.'' \n     Organizations that are exempt under Sec. 501(c)(4) may engage \n     in political activity but such activity must be \n     ``insubstantial'' and is subject to a tax under Sec. 527.\n       Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service has given this \n     provision a very expansive interpretation which clearly \n     encompasses issue advocacy. For instance, in Revenue Ruling \n     78-248, the IRS interpreted this provision to include voter \n     guides, even though they only contained issue advocacy and \n     did not contain any ``express advocacy.'' As a result, not-\n     for-profit groups have been chilled in the exercise of their \n     constitutional right to issue advocacy.\n       Congress should correct this clear violation of First \n     Amendment speech by bringing this provision into compliance \n     with Buckley. This provision should be amended to read that \n     this exemption is available to Sec. 501(c)(3) organizations \n     that ``do not contribute to any political candidate, \n     political committee, or political party and do not make any \n     expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate for political office.'' \n     Furthermore, Congress should make it clear in the statute \n     that Sec. 501(c)(4) organizations are not subject to a tax \n     except on any contribution to a political candidate, \n     committee, or party and on any independent expenditure \n     expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified federal candidate.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       As the U.S. Congress considers campaign finance reform, it \n     has a unique opportunity to make significant changes that \n     will improve our electoral process. There are two paths that \n     beckon. One to limit, stifle, punish and penalize speech is \n     doomed to failure at the doorstep of the United States \n     Supreme Court. The other to encourage, promote and enhance \n     speech will not only pass constitutional muster but will \n     restore the balance that many believe is critically needed.\n       Moreover, the FEC must be reigned in to protect the \n     constitutional rights of the people. The FEC is an agency out \n     of control. Instead of carrying out its legitimate \n     administrative role, it has expended considerable resources \n     seeking to restrict, stifle and punish constitutionally \n     protected free speech. Congress has an urgent duty to reorder \n     the priorities of the FEC in order to protect citizens and \n     grassroots organizations from the heavy hand of the censors \n     at the FEC. Until the FEC has demonstrated a proper \n     sensitivity for First Amendment rights, it should not be \n     entrusted with further authority to intrude into the vital \n     workings of our representative democracy.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     *James Bopp, Jr., B.A., Indiana University, 1970; J.D., \n     University of Florida, 1973; Attorney, Bopp, Coleson & \n     Bostrom, Terre Haute, Indiana; General Counsel, National \n     Right to Life Committee, Inc.; Vice Chairman, Free Speech and \n     Election Law Practice Group of the Federalist Society; \n     Editor-in-Chief, Issues in Law & Medicine.\n     **Richard E.

Massachusetts Citizens \n     for Life (MCFL):\n     ``[w]hile this market metaphor has guided congressional \n     regulation in the area of campaign activity, First Amendment \n     speech is not necessarily limited to such an instrumental \n     role. As Justice Brandeis stated in his discussion of \n     political speech in his concurrence in Whitney v. California, \n     274 U.S. 357, 375 . . . (1927):\n     ``Those who won our independence believed that the final end \n     of the State was to make men free to develop their faculties; \n     and that in its government the deliberative forces should \n     prevail over the arbitrary.

The Supreme \n     Court has always held that certain categories of speech did \n     not have First Amendment protection, e.g., slander, libel, \n     fraud, fighting words, obscenity, criminal conspiracy or \n     incitement, treason, and communicating national security \n     secrets. See e.g., John E. Nowak, Ronald D.

Most notable among these has been Buckley itself, which \n     struck down several provisions of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-443, 88 Stat. \n     1263.\n     25. Bradley Smith makes a convincing case that campaign \n     finance reform as it has been practiced has led to \n     undemocratic consequences by entrenching the status quo, \n     promoting influence peddling, reducing accountability, and \n     empowering social elites (such as news reporters and wealthy \n     candidates) at the expense of grass-roots, populist efforts. \n     Bradley A. Smith, 105 Yale L.J. at 1071-84. In Day v. \n     Holahan, the United States Court of Appeal for the Eighth \n     Circuit noted one example of incumbent self-protection: ``It \n     appears that the legislators who enacted the $100 limit on \n     contributions to political committees and funds, and the \n     governor who signed the limit into law, approved limits on \n     election-year contributions to themselves that were many \n     times higher than the $100 limit on contributions to \n     committees and funds.'' Day v. Holahan, 34 F.3d 1356, 1365 \n     N.8 (8th Cir. 1994).\n     26. Campaign Finance Reform: Hearings before the United \n     States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration (Mar. 13, \n     1996). The proposals in Section V of this article are largely \n     based on the recommendations made in this testimony.\n     27. Similarly, in the November 1996 election, national labor \n     unions spent $35 million dollars (by their own account) in \n     the weeks before the November 1996 election for \n     advertisements attacking targeted U.S. congressional \n     candidates on various issues. Apart from questions raised \n     about the accuracy of some of the advertisements (some have \n     been refused by broadcasters on accuracy grounds) and the \n     voluntariness of the use of union member's dues for pro-\n     Democrat attack ads, such issue advocacy is an appropriate \n     part of the American political system. The present authors \n     and the First Amendment strongly support the right of the \n     labor unions to engage in robust issue advocacy, even at \n     election time. The solution for those opposed to such issue \n     advocacy is not to silence the labor unions but to mount an \n     effective counter-attack. However, concomitant efforts by the \n     FEC to intimidate the Christian Coalition (and thereby \n     similar groups) from advocating essentially opposing issues \n     through voter guides, is abhorrent to First Amendment \n     principles.\n     28. ``Effective advocacy of both public and private points of \n     view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced \n     by group association.'' MCFL, 479 U.S. at 264 (quoting NAACP \n     v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958)).\n     29. Express advocacy consists of explicit words of advocacy, \n     such as ``vote for Candidate X'' or ``defeat Candidate Y.'' \n     Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44.\n     30. Federal Election Commission v. National Conservative \n     Political Action Committee, 470 U.S. 480 (1985).\n     31. The public policy struggle over abortion rights is a good \n     example of the checks and balances in the free marketplace of \n     ideas. Abortion-rights advocates promote their favored \n     candidates by making donations through PACs such as Emily's \n     List, while pro-life advocates contribute to PACs such as the \n     National Right to Life Political Action Committee.\n     32. The Court, for instance, has approved statutory \n     requirements that PACs register and report their financial \n     activities. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 60-68.\n     33. See e.g., West Virginians for Life v. Smith, 919 F. Supp. \n     954 (S.D.W.V. 1996). Co-author James Bopp, Jr. was lead \n     counsel representing the Plaintiffs in this case.\n     34. The heavy burden imposed on PACs was well-described with \n     respect to federal PACs in FEC v. Machinists Non-Partisan \n     Political League, 655 F.2d 380, 392 (D.D.C. 1981), cert. \n     denied, 454 U.S. 897 (1981), which noted that, once an \n     organization is labelled a ``political committee,'' it must \n     ``then submit to an elaborate panoply of FEC regulations \n     requiring the filing of dozens of forms, the disclosing of \n     various activities, and the limiting of the group's freedom \n     of political action to make expenditures or contributions.''\n     35. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 74-82.\n     36. Id.\n     37. Of course, if the pro-life newsletter were to combine in \n     its election issue the words ``vote pro-life'' and the words \n     ``Candidate D is pro-life,'' the communication contains \n     express advocacy. MCFL, 479 U.S. at 249-50. This is based on \n     the unremarkable algebraic formula that, if a=b and b=c, then \n     a=c.\n     38. This is so because the Supreme Court has insisted that \n     the bright-line express advocacy test must govern any effort \n     to bar or restrict communications about candidates, parties, \n     and ideas in the election context. The Court has done so \n     because America believes in free expression on issues of the \n     day, even at election time, or, more correctly, especially at \n     election time. What good would a First Amendment be if it did \n     not protect communicators at precisely the time when free \n     speech would be most effective and is most important? The \n     fact that issue advocacy might affect an election is \n     constitutionally inconsequential because the First Amendment \n     right of issue advocacy must be preserved. In fact, to the \n     Framers of the Constitution and the First Amendment, the \n     constitutional protection of free expression was precisely to \n     protect the advocacy of issues and ideas in the political \n     context. ``Freedom of speech plays a fundamental role in a \n     democracy . . . [I]t `is the matrix, the indispensable \n     condition of nearly every other freedom.' '' MCFL, 479 U.S. \n     at 264 (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937)). \n     ``[T]he right of free public discussion\n\n[[Page S10374]]\n\n     . . . [is] a fundamental principle of the American form of \n     government.''

Discussions \n     of those issues, and as well more positive efforts to \n     influence public opinion on them, tend naturally and \n     inexorably to exert some influence on voting at elections.'' \n     Id. at 42 n.50 (quoting, Buckley, 171 U.S. App. D.C. 172, \n     226, 519 F.2d 821, 875 (D.C.

There are strong arguments that a person wishing to \n     express an opinion on any candidate to print and distribute \n     flyers opposing or supporting candidates, or to give a \n     donation to a campaign, should not have to think at all about \n     possible laws restricting his or her speech in America. That \n     is the spirit of the First Amendment, which says that \n     ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech . . . .'' U.S. Const. amend. I (emphasis added). That \n     one could today suffer penalties for political speech which \n     is not libelous or fraudulent would, no doubt, be astounding \n     and disconcerting to the Framers of the First Amendment.\n     However, the Supreme Court has said that, at a minimum, one \n     should not have to think twice about speaking out on issues \n     of public concern for fear of violating some law. The result \n     of laws which limit speech in the campaign arena is to chill \n     speech by individuals and grassroots citizen groups and to \n     enhance the speech of organized advocacy interests who can \n     afford to hire lawyers to watch over all their publications \n     and expenditures.

The Fair Government Foundation's special report, The \n     FEC's Express War on Free Speech 18 (1996), sums up some of \n     the evidence of the FEC's hostility to the Supreme Court's \n     bright-line protection of issue advocacy in Buckley and MCFL:\n     ``That the Commission dragged its feet in revising its rules \n     to conform them with the Supreme Court rulings suggests that \n     the FEC sought to prolong its concession to the Supreme Court \n     in the hope of changing the high court's mind. . . . During \n     an open meeting of the FEC, Commission chairman Trevor Potter \n     . . . expressed concern whether the Commission was remaining \n     faithful to Supreme Court precedent. Potter questioned \n     whether `enforcing the law in specific matters and then in \n     drafting a definition in general, is consistent with the very \n     narrow language' of Buckley. [End note: `Federal Election \n     Commission Open Meeting (Aug. 11, 1994) (taped transcript \n     available at Commission).']\n     ``In the end, the Commission simply would not accept the \n     plain meaning of the Buckley decision because it so \n     conflicted with a majority of commissioners' fervently held \n     regulatory beliefs. Beliefs that were less a product of the \n     FECA or court cases than a personal philosophical \n     disposition.\n     ``Comments of the FEC's chairman during consideration of the \n     proposed rules reveal what in retrospect must seem like \n     inadvertent candor, as they demonstrate a willful disregard \n     of the Supreme Court's commands. Chairman Trevor Potter, who \n     cast the decisive fourth vote to approve the revised rules, \n     unabashedly revealed that the Commission is `close to being \n     on a different planet from the Supreme Court in terms of what \n     we are looking at.' In Chairman Potter's mind, `the [Supreme] \n     Court doesn't understand[.]' as its rulings are `directly \n     contrary to what the Commission understands the purpose of \n     the Act [FECA] to be . . . . ' Id.\n     ``Commissioner Danny Lee McDonald, who also voted for the \n     revised rules, was similarly dismissive of the Supreme \n     Court's edicts.

It is difficult to imagine how an organization could \n     prepare a voter guide which would be helpful to the voters \n     without contacting the candidates and asking for responses to \n     a survey form. The organization would be left to glean \n     candidate views from campaign literature, news accounts, and \n     the like. Information from such sources would often be \n     inaccurate, incomplete, or subject to the ``spin'' supplied \n     by a campaign strategist or reporter.

In fact, a prohibition of contributions by certain not-\n     for-profit corporations is currently being tested before the \n     6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Kentucky Right to Life v. \n     King, No 95-6581 (6th Cir. 1996) (oral arguments conducted \n     November 13, 1996). Co-author James Bopp, Jr. is lead counsel \n     representing Plaintiffs in this case.\n     393. In fact, based on figures from the Consumer Price Index, \n     $1,000 in 1974 was worth $2,604.57 in 1994.\n     394. See e.g., Colorado Republican, 116 S.Ct. at 2317 (``If \n     anything, an independent expenditure made possible by a \n     $20,000 donation (by an individual), but controlled and \n     directed by a party rather than the donor, would seem less \n     likely to corrupt than the same (or a much larger) \n     independent expenditure made directly by that donor.'').\n     395. Efforts to limit soft money contributions to political \n     parties have the opposite effect. If political parties must \n     use hard money for administration, legal and accounting \n     services, and generic, rather than candidate specific, voter \n     registration and get-out-the-vote activities, then their \n     relative influence with candidates is diminished and the \n     influence of ``special interests,'' is increased.\n     396. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441a(c).\n     397. Indeed, Congress should index all expenditures and \n     contributions limits to inflation in order to maintain the \n     balance between them struck by Congress in any new law.\n     398. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2411(d)(1)(A) allows for an award of \n     attorneys fees against a federal agencies for its actions, \n     ``unless the court finds that the position of the United \n     States was substantially justified or that special \n     circumstances make an award unjust.'' However, the amount of \n     the attorneys fees is limited to $75 an hour and only private \n     parties with modest assets are eligible for the award. Id. at \n     Sec. 2411(d)(2)(A) and (B). There are no similar limitations \n     on award of attorneys fees for prevailing private parties \n     under Sec. 1988.\n     399. Current federal law does not allow an award of attorney \n     fees against the United States for the striking down of a \n     federal statute for violation of constitutional protections.\n     400. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437c(a)(2).\n     401. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437c(f).\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Brad Vynalek, \nwho is a legal intern on my staff, be granted full privilege of the \nfloor during consideration of S. 25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before Senator McConnell leaves the floor, I want to \nthank him for again the dialog that has taken place during this debate, \nand I look forward to its finality.\n  I also urge his consideration, since he has included in the Record so \nmany articles, the piece that was in the Washington Post yesterday by \ntwo fairly well known Americans, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and \nGerald Ford, who have said:\n\n       In order to accomplish this goal--\n\n  Talking about it is particularly important now to seize this \nopportunity of reform now so that it can improve the next Presidential \nelection.\n\n       In order to accomplish this goal, both parties must lay \n     down their partisanship and rise to meet this challenge \n     together. Leaders of both parties have demonstrated their \n     ability to work together on crucial and contentious issues to \n     do what is right for the country. There is another such issue \n     where cooperation is the only road to results. It is \n     impossible to expect one side to disarm unilaterally in this \n     massive arms race for funds. Rather, both sides must agree \n     that bilateral limits are the only rational course of action \n     to preserve the moral integrity of our electoral system. One \n     item that we should all agree on is a banning of so-called \n     soft money for national parties and their campaign \n     committees. Soft money was initially intended exclusively for \n     party building activities but has metamorphosed into a \n     supplemental source of cash for campaigns and candidates. It \n     is one of the most corrupting influences in modern elections \n     because there is no limit on the size of donations, thus \n     giving disproportionate influence to those with the deepest \n     pockets.\n\n  And they conclude, Mr. President, by saying:\n\n       We must demonstrate that a government of the people, by the \n     people and for the people is not a thing of the past. We must \n     redouble our efforts to assure voters that public policy is \n     determined by the checks on their ballots rather than the \n     checks from special interests.\n\n  Mr. President, I would note that although former President Bush's \nname is not on that op-ed piece, former\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\nPresident Bush joined former President Carter and former President Ford \nin a letter asking for the outlawing of soft money.\n  Why should three former Presidents join in such an almost \nunprecedented statement?\n  Let me start from the beginning, in the 1991-92 election cycle. There \nwas $85 million in the 1991-92 cycle--$85 million. In the 1995-96 \nelection it is now up to $250 million. And the information that we \nhave, disturbingly, is that it is growing exponentially, again, in the \nyear 1997.\n  So here is the point. It is out of control, as I have said. And the \nsecond point is that it was not always like this. Campaigns were not \nalways financed by these massive amounts of soft money. They were not. \nIn fact, after we reformed the campaign system in 1974, there was a \ndramatic improvement.\n  Campaign spending by Presidential candidates, 1976-96, over the last \n20 years. If you look down here, these total figures were a little over \n$100 million in 1976 and now are approaching $400 million in 1996. \nRemember that this was after we passed laws that were supposed to \nrestrain the expenditures in a Presidential campaign. Let me just point \nout again, this far exceeds inflation--far, far exceeds inflation.\n  House and Senate campaign expenditures have followed roughly the same \ntrack, only more dramatically. From roughly $300 million in the total \nspent on House and Senate campaigns in 1976, there was a drop in the \n1986 election but, aside from that, it has been an inexorable rise to \nwell in excess of $700 million, nearly $800 million.\n  The soft money has grown and grown and grown and grown. In 1992, the \nRepublican Party raised nearly $50 million in soft money; the Democrat \nParty, around $36 million. In 1994 it went up to the point where, in \n1996, the Republican Party raised $138 million in soft money and the \nDemocrat Party, $123 million in soft money--all of them exponential \nincreases, only over a 4-year period.\n  Again, I want to emphasize for those who say the system has always \nbeen the same and we have always had to contend with these massive \namounts of money, the figures do not indicate that. I might add, this \ndoes not indicate what, of course, labor did, which was very, very \nsignificant in the campaign of 1996.\n  Senate candidates, dollars raised, and here is the problem. Here is a \nsignificant problem because it shows, also, why it is going to be so \ndifficult for Members of this body to vote to change this system. I \nwant to emphasize, these numbers show why it is so difficult in the \nface of overwhelming numbers of Americans who want us to fix this \nsystem. In 1996, the incumbents in the Senate races raised $96 million \nin PAC funds. The challengers raised $43 million. In the House the \nnumbers are dramatically more different, in fact dramatically, \nsignificantly more in favor of the incumbents, $282 million, with $97 \nmillion in PAC funds; in the case of challengers, $75 million they \nraised, and $14 million in PAC funds. So you had, in this present \nscheme, the present way that campaigns work--you had $282 million \nraised by incumbents, $75 million raised by challengers, and of course \nabout a 5- or 6-to-1 advantage in PAC money as well.\n  Which of these statements comes closer to your point of view? Some \ncampaign finance reform is needed? Mr. President, 77 percent of the \nAmerican people; some campaign finance reform is not needed, 18 \npercent; and don't know, 5 percent. I have a more and more difficult \ntime finding people who are in that 18 percent bracket. Because, as \nevery scandal unfolds, as every new revelation is exposed to us in the \nmorning paper and over radio and over television, there are more and \nmore Americans who are joining that already huge 77 percent, who are \nsaying we need to change the system.\n  I don't expect the American people to know the difference between \nhard money and soft money. I don't expect them to know how much money a \nPAC has raised versus that number, and I don't expect them to have read \nevery fundraising letter that has gone out. I wish they had. I wish \nthey had because then that 18 percent would literally disappear. But \nwhat they do know is that something is wrong. There is really something \nseriously wrong here and they believe, as I do, that it needs to be \nrepaired and it needs to be repaired soon.\n\n  I want to go back to a recurring theme that I have articulated \nthroughout--not only this debate but for the last couple of years. If \nyou think, as 77 percent of the American people do, that we need to fix \nthis system, then let's sit down and reason and talk together. Let's do \nthat. OK? If you don't think so, then obviously we will engage in \nvigorous debate. But please don't use the excuse or the rationale that \nyou are for campaign finance reform but not this kind. Because Senator \nFeingold and I have made it very clear, we will discuss any aspect, any \nand all aspects of the campaign abuses that exist today and ways to fix \nthem. We are willing to sit down and agree and compromise. That has \nbeen the path we have taken on numerous other reform issues ranging \nfrom the line-item veto to the gift money to Ramspeck repeal to putting \nCongress under the laws that apply to the American people, and a \nvariety of other issues--repeal of the earnings test--many others. \nPlease, let's not hear the excuse that, Yes, the system is broken. Yes, \nit needs to be fixed, but that is not my solution. If you have a better \nsolution, let me hear it because I would love to join it.\n  A couple of months ago--in fact February 1997, more than a couple of \nmonths ago--there was a Fox poll, Fox News poll. It says the following, \n``Which of the following phrases better describes most politicians?'' \nMr. President, 36 percent, ``dedicated public servant,'' 36 percent of \nthe American people believe that most politicians are dedicated public \nservants; 44 percent, ``lying windbag,'' lying windbag. Maybe there is \na number of reasons why 44 percent of the people contacted in this poll \nbelieve that their politicians, their elected representatives, are \nlying windbags, and those reasons may be a little hard to define, all \nof them. And all of those reasons--at least some of those reasons may \nbe in the eye of the beholder. But I don't think anybody could deny \nthat one of the major reasons--the major reason why the American people \nhave such a low opinion of their elected representatives is because of \ncampaign finance reform and the system with which we elect our people, \ntheir representatives, and perhaps more important how their elected \nrepresentatives behave once in office and what they do to stay in \noffice.\n  All of us should be disturbed at polling numbers like this, all of us \nwho believe, as we all do, public service is the most honorable of \nprofessions. All of us should be disturbed about it, try to find the \nreasons for it, and solve it. I would argue, again, that campaign \nfinance reform is a way to solve it.\n  On ``Late Edition,'' in March 1997 a lady from Bartlesville, OK, \ndescribed it best. She said, ``* * * I'm a Republican supposedly. I'm \nmore Independent than anything else. But I want to ask you something. \nAt $735 a month, how much freedom of speech do I have? I cannot \ncontribute to these big campaigns.'' The lady from Bartlesville, OK, \nMr. President, I think, described the problem in her own very \ncompelling fashion.\n  I paid attention to Senator McConnell, as I always do, and listened \nto him and saw the learned treatises that he put down by various \nspecial interest groups, most of them headquartered here in Washington, \nappealing why we can't abandon soft money, why we can't reform the \nsystem, why the status quo is the only constitutional path we could \npursue. We have spent a lot of time on the floor here with dueling \nconstitutional lawyers. I still think Senator Feingold and I, with 126, \nhave the overwhelming advantage.\n  And, you know, that is kind of fun. But the reality is no matter what \nwe enact it will be challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court. It will be \nchallenged even if all of us were in total agreement that whatever we \nenacted was constitutional. But the fundamental point here is that if \nthe American people believe that $735 a month doesn't buy them much \nfreedom of speech, then it seems to me we ought to do what we can to \nrestore their confidence and their faith in their ability.\n  Mr. President, there is a book written by Mr. Michael Louis called \n``Trail Fever.'' It is really an enlightening book. I enjoyed reading \nit very much. I commend it to anyone who is interested in the 1996 \ncampaign.\n\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\n\n       Political ads fall broadly into two categories: those \n     designed to inflate the candidate's appeal and those intended \n     to destroy the candidate's opponent. The Clinton ads, which \n     the president himself helped to write, were mainly of the \n     second type. The bulk of them were directed at the elderly \n     and designed to prey on their natural fear of abandonment. \n     The message they conveyed could be summarized in a sentence: \n     If you are over sixty years old and the Republicans gain \n     control of the White House, you will lose your health care. \n     Vote for your life! It was a wild and wonderful distortion of \n     the truth--\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The press was the enemy that muddied the message you were \n     trying to deliver. Morris argued that all the old nostrums \n     about needing the media no longer applied, that Americans \n     were so cynical about everything that they no longer believed \n     in anything as naive as the Simple Truth. He believed, for \n     instance, that voters did not distinguish in any meaningful \n     way between paid ads and the free press. ``I don't think \n     people are any more cynical about ads than they are about the \n     press,'' he said. ``One is what the candidate wants you to \n     know. The other is what the media want you to know.''\n       Really, it was an extraordinary turn of strategic thinking, \n     especially for a sitting Democratic president, who might \n     rightfully expect a little help from his soul mates in the \n     newsrooms and on the editorial boards. It was one thing to \n     speak through political ads; it was another to speak only \n     through political ads. But that is exactly what Morris \n     proposed, and Clinton accepted. ``Dick wanted to spend every \n     * * * dollar on ads,'' said Harold Ickes. ``He thought TV was \n     the only way to communicate.'' The more airtime Clinton \n     bought, the less need he had to appear live before the \n     cameras--and the more he could simply ignore the trail. With \n     Morris's help Clinton created his own metaphysical trail. \n     Right through to the Democratic convention and beyond, the \n     Clinton campaign remained a specter, a flickering cathode ray \n     in the suburbs of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Toledo, Ohio.\n\n  I think that is an accurate description of what happened in 1996. I'm \nnot saying that the outcome would have been any different, but none of \nthat could have happened without soft money. And none of the things \nthat happened--it funded many of the political campaigns, most of them \nnegative--could have happened without soft money. I believe for us to \nallow this as well as other aspects of the system to careen further out \nof control, as it is now, is an abrogation of our responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I will also gather up many documents and papers in \nsupport of Senator Feingold's position, and my position. I do believe \nperhaps most Americans would pay attention to former Presidents of the \nUnited States, as I entered in the Record earlier, not just, with due \nrespect, some pundits who either live inside the beltway or are called \nupon as well-known political analysts--by the way, whose views I \nrespect. But the fact is, what this really boils down to is whether we \nare going to restore our credibility to the American people in this \nbody and the way we are elected.\n  Finally--I see the distinguished Democratic leader on the floor, as \nwell as my friend and colleague, Senator Feingold--let me emphasize \nagain, as I have throughout to the point where it is getting \nmonotonous, we want to negotiate a reasonable settlement amongst both \nparties that is fair to both parties, that the American people believe \nis equitable, and that the American people believe is progress. We urge \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enter into that dialog so \nwe can reach some consensus and move forward so we can address the \nimportant issues facing the Senate, the Congress, and the people of the \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me compliment the Senator from \nArizona for his extraordinary statement, for his compelling speech just \nnow, and for the statesmanship he has shown all the way through this \ndebate. I also thank the Senator from Wisconsin for the partnership he \nhas shown on this effort from the very beginning.\n  The New York Times, I thought, described it quite well today in \narticulating what most of us perceive about both of these Senators. \nThey are bipartisan, they seek bipartisan solutions. They recognize the \nimportance of working through these issues, not in a confrontational \nway, but in a way that builds consensus rather than tears it down. The \nlast offer of the Senator from Arizona, once more, to work with both \nsides to find a way with which to deal with this issue constructively, \nis yet another example of that manner.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close the debate on S. 25, as modified, the campaign finance reform \nbill:\n\n         Thomas A. Daschle, Carl Levin, Joseph I. Lieberman, \n           Wendell Ford, Byron L. Dorgan, Barbara Boxer, Jack \n           Reed, Richard H. Bryan, Daniel K. Akaka, Christopher J. \n           Dodd, Kent Conrad, Robert G. Torricelli, Charles S. \n           Robb, Joe Biden, Dale Bumpers, Carol Moseley-Braun, \n           John Kerry.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is our desire to offer a cloture \nmotion each day this week in an effort to bring to closure the debate \non this bill. Now, obviously, it is within the majority leader's right \nto pull the bill to avoid having the cloture votes on the legislation \nitself. That certainly is his prerogative. I have indicated that it \nwould be our intention, should that occur, on those legislative \nvehicles that are not appropriations bills, that we would offer the \nMcCain-Feingold bill to each and every one of them. It really doesn't \nmatter what legislation comes before the Senate, that would be our \nintention.\n  So I want to put our colleagues on notice that it is our strong \ndesire to finish this debate in a constructive and in a successful way, \nregardless of whatever pieces of legislation may be brought before the \nbody.\n  Let me also reiterate an offer that I made last week. Last week, I \nsaid we would be prepared to take up S. 9, the Lott amendment, \nindependent of this legislation. He has, in the parliamentary usage of \nthe term, filled the tree. He has precluded our opportunity to offer \namendments, to have a constructive and a real debate. All we have done \nso far is debated the overall concept of campaign reform without having \nhad the opportunity to talk about the details and whether or not there \nmay be ways in which to improve it or deal with it in whatever \nlegislative capacity we may so choose. That, in my view, is the essence \nof a good debate. If you can't offer amendments, you can't really have \na good debate about the bill. So we are denied that right.\n  So no one should be mistaken here; we are spending time on the bill, \nbut we are not spending time on quality debate. We are not spending \ntime in a way that will allow us to exchange views on issues that could \nbe the subject of amendment, and until we are, we are forced into a \nposition of having to amend this legislation in other forms and in \nother scenarios legislatively.\n  Again, I offer that same opportunity to the majority leader that I \noffered last week. Let's bring up the so-called Lott amendment \nfreestanding. Let's have an opportunity to debate it. Let's offer \namendments to it. We have offered that opportunity with the hope that \nwe could break this logjam. We have offered a suggestion along with a \npromise not to filibuster, not to extend the debate on the so-called \nLott amendment. We would be willing to schedule it at a time certain. \nSo there should be no question that, if under those conditions our \nRepublican colleagues choose not to allow us to go to the bill to offer \namendments, everyone will see this amendment for what it really is; \nthat is, a poison pill designed to kill campaign reform--nothing else.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has been very open about his willingness to \nkill the bill, his commitment to do that, and he has every right to \nemploy this tactic. All I am saying is that there is a difference \nbetween winning the battle and winning the war.\n  Ultimately, if we spend time on nothing else than campaign finance \nreform for the remainder of this Congress, we will have other occasions \nto have a good and meaningful debate about campaign finance reform.\n  So, as I said, we would be voting on cloture now on Wednesday. If the \nbill is still pending, we will have a vote on Thursday, and we will \ndetermine the schedule for the remainder of the time we are in session \nat a later date. But there should be no mistake, we will continue to \nfight for this bill and continue to ensure that we reach out to our \nRepublican colleagues to break the logjam in as meaningful a way as we \ncan. I am hopeful that that effort will be successful, and I am hopeful \nthat at\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\nsome point we can come to some understanding about how that gets done. \nI yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am not the majority leader, but I \nwanted to make a couple observations about the comments of the \nDemocratic leader. First of all, paycheck protection is not a poison \npill; it is an important piece of legislation. It was in the top 10 \npieces of legislation, I say to my friend from South Dakota, that we \nintroduced at the beginning of this year on this side of the aisle. It \nhas probably as many supporters as McCain-Feingold does. So it is \ncurious to me that paycheck protection, when linked up with McCain-\nFeingold, is a poison pill but the converse apparently isn't true.\n\n  So, again, I am not the majority leader, but I will say it is my \nintent to bring up paycheck protection any time any effort was made to \ntry to force through McCain-Feingold.\n  But what the majority leader has done here is offer an opportunity \nwith a very good debate. I disagree with my friend from South Dakota; I \nthink it is a good debate. I wish he had had a chance to listen to more \nof it. He might have changed his position. We are going to have a good \ndebate this afternoon. A number of Senators want to speak.\n  Let me be very clear, at least as far as this one Senator is \nconcerned, there is no campaign finance reform without paycheck \nprotection. They are the Siamese twins, Mr. President, the Siamese \ntwins of this discussion. So paycheck protection will, indeed, be back \nas well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I first thank my leader, Senator \nDaschle, not only for his kind words but for his important reiteration \nof the offer he has made. It is an unusual offer. The offer is to have \nS. 9, the so-called Paycheck Protection Act, come up as its own bill \nand relinquishing the right that Senators always have, which the \nSenator from Kentucky knows very well, to filibuster. In other words, \nit would be guaranteed an up-or-down vote. I think that is a \nsignificant offer that raises the real issue of whether we are talking \nabout something that is, in fact, an attempt to destroy this McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance reform bill, which I think it clearly is.\n  Mr. President, I would like to also put a few items in the Record, as \nthe Senator from Kentucky has done. First of all, you see a lot of \nheadlines when you work on an issue like this. Some are good; some are \nbad. Sometimes you see ``McCain-Feingold bill is dead.'' That was the \nlitany for some time. Once in a while you see a headline you almost \nlike, even though it isn't intended to be favorable. This one I like \nfrom The Hill, a Capitol Hill publication, of the other day, October 1, \nwhich informs us ``Most Lobbyists Oppose McCain-Feingold Bill.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article by Mary Lynn F. Jones be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Hill, October 1, 1997]\n\n               Most Lobbyists Oppose McCain-Feingold Bill\n\n                        (By Mary Lynn F. Jones)\n\n       As the Senate debates the McCain-Feingold campaign finance \n     reform bill this week, Washington lobbyists are hoping that \n     the deadlock will continue.\n       ``The professional lobbying community, if they had their \n     druthers, would do nothing,'' noted Ronald Shaiko, academic \n     director of the Lobbying Institute at American University. \n     Since they cannot actively oppose the bill, ``they hide \n     behind the cause of the First Amendment.''\n       Lobbyist Timothy W. Jenkins, a partner at the lobbying shop \n     of O'Connor & Hannan, agreed. ``It's definitely of interest \n     to anyone with inside-the-Beltway'' issues, said Jenkins. \n     ``It's a system we all participate in and lobbyists [donate] \n     personal money and [many of] our companies are active'' in \n     the political action committee (PAC) community.\n       Martin B. Gold an attorney at Johnson, Smith, Dover, \n     Kitzmiller & Stewart, added, ``Once you open the subject of \n     campaign finance, one never knows what kind of subjects will \n     be raised.''\n       The bipartisan bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain (R-\n     Ariz.) and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), would kill ``soft money'' \n     contributions to political parties, require greater campaign \n     finance disclosures, restrict parties from supporting \n     candidates who bankroll their campaign with more than $50,000 \n     of personal funds and allow union members to receive refunds \n     for compulsory dues spent for political purposes.\n       Although most lobbyists are tracking the bill closely, \n     those who represent unions and interest groups are \n     particularly concerned, especially since Senate Majority \n     Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) offered an amendment on Monday \n     requiring unions to obtain prior permission from members \n     before backing candidates financially.\n       And while PACs are limited to a $10,000 contribution per \n     candidate per cycle, groups can circumscribe campaign finance \n     laws by donating unrestricted money to political parties for \n     get-out-the-vote drives, issues advertising and other \n     activities that do not directly support a specific candidate.\n       ``Ninety-five percent of the attention is going to issue \n     advocacy and soft money,'' added O'Connor & Hannan's Jenkins, \n     ``because that's where 95 percent of the dollars are.''\n       ``PACs limit corporations and how much they spend in \n     elections,'' said Shaiko of American University. ``Their \n     loophole is soft money. If you take that out, it limits their \n     voice in the electoral'' process.\n       In 1996, for example, the AFL-CIO spent about $35 million \n     on issue advocacy advertising, according to an Annenberg \n     Public Policy Center report, and a group of 32 businesses, \n     called ``The Coalition,'' spent $5 million.\n       Jenkins said, ``Some people have the view that this is \n     government regulating the most sacred of speech, that this \n     shouldn't be about the candidates but about the public who \n     wants to participate in elections.''\n       Issue advocacy and soft money raise difficult issues, \n     primarily because of the Supreme Court's landmark 1976 \n     decision, Buckley v. Valeo. The court equated money with free \n     speech in that decision, ruling that campaign expenditures \n     cannot be restricted.\n       By most lobbyists and analysts doubt the bill, which is \n     staunchly opposed by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and do not \n     have enough votes to fend off an expected filibuster, will \n     pass.\n       ``The power of McConnell and others in the Senate to stymie \n     it--you can't discount that,'' said Shaiko.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I guess I am delighted to see this kind \nof a headline, because I am not surprised. Most lobbyists do oppose \ncampaign finance reform and the McCain-Feingold bill, because these \nfolks are the folks I have come to regard, not as bad people, many of \nthem are very good people, but as people who have basically become the \nWashington gatekeeper. They are the ones that control the campaign \ncontributions now. If a local individual, if a local organization back \nhome wants to contribute to your campaign or give you support, when \nthey are part of this organization that has a lobbyist in Washington, \nthey need to call Washington.\n  So it is no surprise that the lobbyists oppose our bill. They are one \nof the most important forces against our bill, besides the unfortunate \nfact, of course, that every single Member of the Congress was elected \nunder the current system.\n  But even some of these groups that are represented by lobbyists have \nchanged their minds. The Senator from Kentucky has made a great deal of \nthe fact that the National Education Association, he has said, opposes \nMcCain-Feingold. There was a time when their leadership did appear with \nSenator McConnell and indicate some opposition to some aspects of the \nbill. But as Senator McCain and I said from the beginning, we want to \naddress various concerns of other Senators and organizations, and we \nhave made some changes. Our bill is now supported by the National \nEducation Association.\n  I would like to have printed in the Record a letter of October 1, \n1997, from Bob Chase, the president of the National Education \nAssociation, in which he states:\n\n       On behalf of the 2.3 million member NEA, we urge you to \n     support real campaign finance reform and to reject \n     legislative attacks on unions that are currently being \n     presented in the guise of reform. NEA is supportive of the \n     revised McCain-Feingold bill that was offered on the Senate \n     floor on September 29.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\n\n\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 2.3 million member National \n     Education Association (NEA), we urge you to support real \n     campaign finance reform and to reject legislative attacks on \n     unions that are currently being presented in the guise of \n     reform. NEA is supportive of the revised McCain-Feingold bill \n     that was offered on the Senate floor on September 29. We are \n     strongly opposed to the Lott amendment that would unfairly \n     curb the advocacy rights of unions, including the NEA.\n       While NEA favors a broad package of reforms that would \n     include voluntary spending limits coupled with partial public \n     financing, the McCain-Feingold bill is an important first \n     step. First and foremost, it would ban the unregulated and \n     excessive ``soft money'' donations that have undermined the \n     integrity of our political system. Further, it contains \n     important provisions to ensure greater disclosure and \n     stronger election laws. We are particularly pleased that the \n     revised proposal drops any limitation on contributions by \n     political action committees (PACs). NEA believes that small-\n     donor PACs level the playing field and allow working \n     Americans to have a more effective voice in politics.\n       NEA is supportive of full disclosure provisions affecting \n     issue advertising. We do, however, have concerns about \n     McCain-Feingold's provisions that would curb issue \n     advertising in the 60 days prior to elections. These \n     provisions are ill-defined and overly restrictive of \n     legitimate legislative advocacy, and would inhibit the \n     ability to speak freely on issues while they are being \n     debated and decided in Congress. Despite this caveat, we \n     believe that McCain-Feingold merits your support.\n       The Lott amendment is clearly intended not to advance the \n     important cause of campaign finance reform, but to subvert \n     it. The amendment is based on the false premise that members \n     of unions do not join voluntarily; in fact, membership is \n     voluntary. Further, unions in general, and the NEA in \n     particular, operate under democratic decision-making \n     processes. The annual NEA Representative Assembly, which \n     determines the Association's policy and sets the legislative \n     program, is the largest democratic decision-making body in \n     the world.\n       On the other hand, the Lott amendment raises serious \n     constitutional issues of free speech and association. It is a \n     transparent attempt to curb the rights of unions to engage in \n     not only political but legislative advocacy at the federal \n     and state levels. The NEA strongly opposes this measure, \n     since it would cripple our ability to advocate on behalf of \n     our membership on the many important issues affecting \n     children and education that come before Congress.\n       It is patently unfair for the Lott amendment to single out \n     the voluntary dues of unions for this restrictive treatment, \n     while allowing a host of other groups across the political \n     spectrum (such as the Christian Coalition and the National \n     Rifle Association) to continue to collect voluntary dues to \n     fund their lobbying and advocacy efforts. The same double \n     standard is applied to corporations, since the Lott amendment \n     would not require businesses to effectively seek the approval \n     of stockholders before using their funds for political \n     activities.\n       In summary, we urge you to support McCain-Feingold and \n     oppose the Lott amendment. This is an important turning point \n     for the American political system, and it is critical that \n     the congress take action that will foster, not hamper, the \n     participation of working Americans in our democracy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Bob Chase,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the Senator, is it not true in the letter--he is \ncorrect that the National Education Association, which opposed the PAC \nban, has now written a letter saying they support the bill. But I refer \nmy colleague from Wisconsin to the third paragraph of that letter. Is \nit not correct that they also say:\n\n       We . . . have concerns about McCain-Feingold's provisions \n     that would curb issue advertising in the 60 days prior to \n     elections. These provisions are ill-defined and overly \n     restrictive of legitimate legislative activity, and would \n     inhibit the ability to speak freely on issues while they are \n     being debated and decided in Congress.\n\n  Am I reading that right?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes. The next sentence says:\n\n       Despite this caveat, we believe that McCain-Feingold merits \n     your support.\n\n  The fact is, even though they have some concerns about this item, \nwhich I am sure any organization involved in this kind of ad may have, \ntheir conclusion, Mr. President, the conclusion I urge on the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, is that overall, they believe the bill merits support, \nwhich, of course, is the direct opposite of what the Senator from \nKentucky has said for months, both on the floor and----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Was it not the case prior to this letter NEA was \nopposing McCain-Feingold?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Of course, I am not suggesting the Senator is \nmisrepresenting anything. I am showing a change in position by an \norganization which the Senator from Kentucky has placed great reliance \non. I am not suggesting for 1 minute that the Senator has \nmischaracterized the position.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did the Senator from Kentucky just say their principal \nreason for opposing the bill was the PAC ban and that when you dropped \nthe PAC ban----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, Mr. President. My point exactly. We have tried to \nadjust this bill to address the concerns of organizations and groups \nthat the Senator from Kentucky has identified. That is our point. \nSenator McCain and I don't believe we have all the answers. In fact, \nneither of us love the bill. That is how we were able to come up with a \ncompromise. We heard the concerns of the NEA. We addressed their \nconcerns. They support us now. They no longer support the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  A further attempt that has been made on this issue is to suggest that \nthe American people don't care about this issue, if you look at a poll \nor any other measure of public opinion that this isn't important to \nthem that we change this big money system. The Senator from Arizona has \nalready done a fine job today of helping to dispel that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a publication from the \nvery conservative publication the Weekly Standard from September 22, \n1997, entitled ``Republicans Get Some Very Bad News.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, Sept. 22, 1997]\n\n                   Republicans Get Some Very Bad News\n\n       Republican senators got an unwelcome jolt last week at one \n     of their usually uneventful Tuesday lunch meetings--a poll \n     that showed they were in deep trouble. The poll, conducted by \n     the Republican National Committee during the first week of \n     September, gave the president his highest positive rating \n     ever--almost 65 percent. For the first time in Clinton's \n     presidency more Americans ``strongly approved'' of his \n     performance than ``strongly disapproved.''\n       That was not the worst of it. For the first time this year, \n     the numbers showed that more Americans wanted Democrats to \n     control Congress than Republicans, and that Democrats were \n     ahead on the ``generic ballot'' for November 1998. But what \n     really rattled the senators was that, when asked what issues \n     they cared most about, Americans had moved one new item into \n     the first tier along with the old standbys of crime, \n     education, and the like. The new issue: campaign-finance \n     reform, which had moved from 2 or 3 percent in previous polls \n     to double digits as the number one issue of concern.\n       With John McCain ready to force a confrontation on campaign \n     reform in the Senate against the wishes of most of his GOP \n     colleagues, there was a fair amount of senatorial murmuring \n     about looking for a way to avoid being cast as simple \n     defenders of the status quo. The politics of campaign-finance \n     reform could be more interesting over the next few weeks than \n     most pundits currently expect. And more damaging, considering \n     that McCain's proposal is a constitutional catastrophe.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to highlight what \nwas said in here. It indicates----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for one other question with \nregard to the Weekly Standard?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Wisconsin referred to a statement in \nthe Weekly Standard with regard to, what was it as he put it?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I was about to read into the Record the statement from \nthe Weekly Standard which I wanted to highlight.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. When the Senator is finished, I would like to have \nprinted in the Record a letter from Jim Nicholson, chairman of the RNC, \nindicating that the polling data carried in that article is simply \nincorrect.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As soon as I am done, I will be happy to yield \nmomentarily to let that happen.\n  Let me quote what was said by this publication that is certainly no \nfriend of the McCain-Feingold bill and, frankly, no friend of campaign \nfinance reform. The article indicated that:\n\n       Republican senators got an unwelcome jolt last week at one \n     of their usually uneventful . . . lunch meetings--a poll that \n     showed they were in deep trouble. The poll, conducted by\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\n     the Republican National Committee during the first week of \n     September, gave the president his highest positive rating \n     ever--almost 65 percent.\n\n  And then it goes on to state:\n\n       That was not the worst of it. For the first time this year, \n     the numbers showed that more Americans wanted Democrats to \n     control Congress than Republicans, and that Democrats were \n     ahead on the ``generic ballot'' for November 1998.\n\n  The point I want to emphasize is the following statement:\n\n       But what really rattled the Senators was that, when asked \n     what issues they cared most about, Americans had moved one \n     new item into the first tier along with the old standbys of \n     crime, education, and the like. The new issue: campaign-\n     finance reform, which had moved from 2 or 3 percent in \n     previous polls to double digits as the number one issue of \n     concern.\n\n  Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Kentucky wants to dispel \nthis poll. I will yield to him in a moment to do so. But I just want to \nemphasize, in addition to the more independent polls that the Senator \nfrom Arizona has already cited today, that even a poll that was \npresented to the Republican National Committee indicates that campaign \nfinance reform is a matter of very top concern to the American people \nat this time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The question is, whether the Senator wants to--I am \nsure he does not want to put an item into the Record that is simply \ninaccurate. What I would hope the Senator would permit me to do, even \nthough he has the floor and it is his insert, is to include into the \nRecord a letter from Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican \nNational Committee, simply correcting that story. It was simply \ninaccurate. And obviously the Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  It seems to me that for those who might be reading the Congressional \nRecord it would be best to have the correct data inserted at this time. \nBut I will be happy to do it later if the Senator from Wisconsin feels \nbetter.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Without conceding that the information from the Senator \nfrom Kentucky is the correct information, I have no objection to the \nletter of Mr. Nicholson being inserted at this time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was an RNC poll that the Weekly Standard was \nreferring to. And the chairman of the national committee is simply \nreferring to the poll that his organization took and clearing up the \narticle that was in the Weekly Standard which was simply inaccurate. So \nI ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that this letter from Jim \nNicholson be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Republican National Committee,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1997.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I want to take this opportunity to \n     clarify to you recent RNC polling data in light of \n     misinformation reported in a September 22, 1997 Weekly \n     Standard article entitled, ``Republicans Get Some Very Bad \n     News.''\n       The Standard piece erroneously claimed that a recent RNC \n     national poll illustrated that Americans were increasingly \n     supportive of campaign finance reform, listing it as an issue \n     of chief concern.\n       Let me be clear--the Weekly Standard was wrong. In fact, \n     the September poll discussed never contained a direct \n     question about campaign finance reform.\n       Here is a synopsis of what we have found in our polling to \n     date:\n       In an open-ended question from our September survey of \n     1,000 likely voters, not one individual surveyed identified \n     campaign finance reform as the most important problem facing \n     the U.S. today.\n       In a question offering a short list of potential concerns \n     from our June 1997 poll, only 2% of Americans said that ``the \n     way political campaigns are financed'' would be the most \n     important issue to them in deciding how to vote for congress.\n       In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, only 5% \n     surveyed found that ``reforming the way political campaigns \n     are financed'' deserved the greatest attention from the \n     Federal government at the present time (from a list of seven \n     issues.)\n       I hope this information proves useful to you as the Senate \n     continues debate on the McCain-Feingold bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jim Nicholson,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I understand that some would feel that \nthe poll was inaccurate, and that is what the RNC says. I also know \nthey would have a strong desire at this point to----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. When the Senator from Kentucky was putting items in the \nRecord, I was letting him go. I will be available for questions in a \nmoment.\n  All I can say, Mr. President, is this is not the only measure we put \nin the Record. What is striking is that even the Weekly Standard \nbelieves that this issue has gone very high on the list of issues. \nEvery measure that is being taken now does indicate a tremendous growth \nin the concern about this issue.\n  I would be fascinated to hear more about exactly why the RNC changed \nits data on this. I will try to take a look at it later. I do not know \nwhy they indicated that it was incorrect. Somehow the Weekly Standard \ngot the impression that this issue was on the move. On that point they \nare right.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to note with regard to the statement \nof the Senator from Kentucky about the American Civil Liberty Union's \nposition on this bill, yes, the American Civil Liberties Union has \nexpressed concerns about the bill.\n  I want to remind the Senator from Kentucky that the ACLU was wrong \nwhen they litigated the Buckley versus Valeo case. They did not win all \nthe points that they litigated in that case. In fact, some of the \nindividuals that the Senator from Kentucky has just cited were among \nthose who litigated that case and lost. So, yes, they litigated it. \nThey had their day in court. And they were wrong.\n  In fact, the ACLU, an organization which sometimes I am criticized \nfor agreeing with, happens to be dead wrong with regard to a release \nthat they just put out entitled ``Revised McCain-Feingold Legislation \nWould Trample on Americans' First Amendment Rights.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to just quote a sentence from that \nrelease to show how reckless some people are being about describing \nthis bill. The quote says this:\n\n       McCain-Feingold imposes a 2-month, 60-day blackout before \n     any Federal election on any radio or television advertisement \n     that mentions any candidates for Federal office.\n\n  Mr. President, that is not true. The bill does ask that certain rules \napply during that 60-day period that do not apply outside of that \nperiod, and the rules are that you must use hard money limits and \ndisclosure in order to do it, but there is no blackout, there is no \nprohibition.\n  Mr. President, there isn't a single advertisement that you could \npossibly come up with that is barred by this bill. That is not what the \nbright line test is. In fact, it is very troubling to see an \norganization for which I have such high regard in terms of their \nprofessionalism, in terms of their ability to mount legal arguments, to \nsee somebody actually say that the bill does something it clearly does \nnot do.\n  You cannot prohibit advertisements. You cannot say that people cannot \nsay things. What you can do, I believe, and I believe the Supreme Court \nwill support this, is during the electioneering period, which the \nSupreme Court has talked about, you can require that certain kinds of \nmessages be disclosed in terms of who is making them and also that the \nmoney that is used and raised for it be under certain kinds of limits. \nThat is all it does. I think the ACLU is in error with regard to that \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to place in the Record at this time \nSenate bill 143 from the 102d Congress. The other day there was a \nspirited conversation between my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, and \nthe Senator from Arizona which centered around the fact that the \nSenator from Kentucky has cosponsored legislation that did a couple of \nthings that he has now said on the floor are unconstitutional.\n  In particular, Mr. President, the point was made by the Senator from \nArizona that the Senator from Kentucky had cosponsored a bill that bans \nsoft money. The Senator from Kentucky responded by saying: Well, you \nknow, sometimes you sign on to a bill that you're not comfortable with, \nand you want to participate in a joint effort.\n  I understand that. Some of that experience has occurred for me with \nregard\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\nto this bill where I am not happy with every provision. But I do need \nto have printed in the Record, Mr. President, Senate bill 143. I ask \nunanimous consent that that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 143\n\n                            [102d Congress]\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Senate bill 143 from the 102d Congress was offered by \nthe Senator from Kentucky. It was not a group of people that had to \nsort of pull together to support the leader on this. Mr. McConnell, the \nSenator from Kentucky, was the lead author, and then other Senators, \ndistinguished Senators, agreed with him--Senator Dole, Senator Simpson, \nSenator Packwood, Senator Cochran, Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Roth, and Senator Hatfield; but the lead author of the bill was \nthe Senator from Kentucky. And the bill banned soft money.\n  Mr. President, it specifically provides for the ban of soft money \nwhich the Senator from Kentucky has denounced as an unconstitutional \npart of the McCain-Feingold bill. So this notion that somehow the \nSenator from Kentucky was not supportive of this kind of concept, at \nleast at that time, does not seem to withstand scrutiny.\n  Mr. President, I would also like at this time to spend a few moments \ntalking a little bit about a very important item, and that is the \nproposal before us offered by the majority leader. That represents, to \nme, an attempt to put the onus of the entire campaign finance issue \njust on organized labor. That is the substantive impact of this \nproposal.\n  But I am afraid the proposal is, in the end, going to serve a larger \npurpose, if it prevails. The majority leader made it pretty clear that \nwas his purpose. The purpose of the proposal, it seems to me, is to \nkill the McCain-Feingold bill. I know the majority leader has said that \nthat is not the case. But I am not the only one who believes this is a \npoison pill. Just about everyone who has looked at this feels this is \nan attempt to kill this bill by insisting that Senate bill 9 be brought \nup at this time.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said that Senate bill 9 was a very \nimportant bill; that is why it was No. 9. I understand the rules around \nhere. The leaders get to introduce about five bills each they consider \nto be a top priority. Senate bill 9 was one of those top priorities of \nthe Republican leadership.\n  Why then, if it was such a top priority, did they wait almost until \nthe end of this entire year, the end of this entire session, to bring \nit up? If it was so important, why wasn't it given the importance that \nit supposedly had? Others agree.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the \nNew York Times entitled ``The Swing Senators'' of October 5, 1997, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 5, 1997]\n\n                           The Swing Senators\n\n       It takes many routine votes to build and sustain a Senate \n     career, but one memorable vote can destroy a reputation. For \n     a handful of Republican senators who have championed campaign \n     finance reform, that fatal vote could come on Tuesday if they \n     kill the McCain-Feingold bill. It is hard to imagine how \n     Olympia Snowe of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont and John \n     Chafee of Rhode Island can face their constituents if they \n     bury the best chance in a generation to fashion a more \n     rational system of financing Presidential and Congressional \n     campaigns.\n       That is the simple, unforgiving logic of Tuesday's vote. \n     Trent Lott, the majority leader, has scheduled a showdown on \n     the McCain-Feingold bill, which would curb the unlimited \n     donations to political parties that have been at the heart of \n     the scandals this year. The bill would also restrict the \n     ability of independent groups to raise money from rich \n     individuals, corporations and labor unions to broadcast \n     candidate attack ads masquerading as issue ads two months \n     before an election. To kill the legislation, Mr. Lott has \n     made the first order of business a vote on an amendment he \n     knows Democrats do not support. It would limit the ability of \n     labor unions to raise and spend money on elections. If the \n     amendment is approved, the overall bill will die.\n       All 45 Democrats are prepared to vote against Mr. Lott's \n     amendment, so just five Republicans are needed to defeat it. \n     Senator John McCain of Arizona, a conservative who would \n     otherwise support the Lott amendment, will vote against it \n     because he knows it will strangle reform. Fred Thompson of \n     Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine and Arlen Specter of \n     Pennsylvania, all supporters of McCain-Feingold, seem likely \n     to join Mr. Cain.\n       Senator Snowe has sponsored campaign finance reform \n     legislation in the past and Maine, her home state, last year \n     overwhelmingly approved a referendum that established public \n     financing of campaigns and limits on contributions and \n     candidate expenditures. She would betray her own record and \n     her state if she supported Mr. Lott's effort to torpedo the \n     McCain-Feingold bill.\n       Since entering the Senate in 1989, Mr. Jeffords has been \n     among the most articulate backers of campaign finance reform. \n     In 1992, he voted to override a veto by President\n\n[[Page S10390]]\n\n     Bush of legislation imposing spending and contribution \n     limits. Senator Chafee has also consistently favored reform \n     over the years.\n       Another swing vote this week ought to come from Alfonse \n     D'Amato of New York. Mr. D'Amato is up for re-election next \n     year and is counting on labor support. In the past he has \n     opposed the kind of labor fund-raising curbs now pushed by \n     Mr. Lott. He was even quoted recently as saying he favored a \n     ban on unlimited donations to campaigns. Mr. D'Amato could \n     enhance his standing among moderate Republicans and \n     independents by rallying behind the McCain-Feingold bill.\n       If Mr. Lott prevails, supporters of campaign reform must \n     not give up. Senator McCain has promised to attach his bill \n     to every piece of legislation before the Senate in the coming \n     weeks. That strategy worked last year for raising the minimum \n     wage. After a year of scandal and abuse, there is no greater \n     priority for Congress than removing the stain of corruption \n     from American politics. The public's desire for reform \n     demands nothing less. If Senators Snowe, Jeffords and Chafee \n     would vote on principle rather than blindly following Mr. \n     Lott, the Senate could approve reform this week.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that editorial identifies clearly the \nbelief of most Americans that the purpose of this amendment is not \nnecessarily to simply resolve this issue, although I am sure Members on \nthe other side of the aisle, many of them, feel strongly about it, but \nit is to kill the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that an editorial from \nthe USA Today, dated October 6, 1997, entitled ``Squabble over union \ndues a pretext to stop reform'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Squabble Over Union Dues a Pretext to Stop Reform\n\n       Our View--As in the past, those in power are trying to kill \n     campaign-finance reform without taking the rap.\n       For 20 years, Congress has mounted pieties about cleaning \n     up the swamp of special-interest money in politics, while \n     making quite sure nothing gets done about it.\n       Year after year, stalling, stalemate and deception have \n     been weapons of choice for those who have mastered the system \n     to get elected and have little interest in change. This week, \n     masked in a contrived debate over union dues, it may happen \n     again.\n       After finally agreeing to debate campaign-finance reform, \n     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has made the first order of \n     business his own amendment requiring that union members give \n     written permission before their dues can be used for \n     political purposes.\n       Sounds noble, but it's a phony. The campaign-reform bill \n     already includes provisions effectively barring union \n     treasuries from making political contributions.\n       It closes the so-called ``soft money'' loophole which has \n     allowed massive, unregulated contributions to parties by both \n     unions and business interests.\n       It brings ``independent expenditure'' and ``issue \n     advocacy'' ads that target candidates under the same \n     regulations as campaign contributions. That makes them a no-\n     no for both unions and business.\n       Limited contributions from union political actual \n     committees would remain legal, but PACs already must obtain \n     sign-offs from contributors. Further, union members unhappy \n     with the use of their dues already have a right to quit the \n     union.\n       But the amendment is a useful vehicle for Lott and fellow \n     Republicans to posture for the favor of employers whose \n     contribution they seek--and to make retaliatory mischief for \n     the unions, which spend $35 million attacking Republicans \n     last year. And while they moan about it, the debate gives \n     Democratic opponents a chance to preen as friends of the \n     union leaders.\n       Unfortunately, the amendment also carries the risk of \n     fracturing the fragile coalition pushing for much-needed \n     change. Lott has as good as said that is its real purpose.\n       It's an old story. In 1990, the House and Senate actually \n     passed somewhat similar campaign-reform bills, but the \n     conferees appointed to iron out the differences never got \n     around to meeting. In 1994, a slightly different scenario \n     brought a similar result.\n       In 1988, a reform bill was killed by a filibuster. In 1992, \n     a bill passed but was vetoed; the votes to override weren't \n     there. Repeatedly, representatives and senators who want to \n     get on record as reformers have been able to do so--but with \n     little risk of change actually becoming law.\n       Now, despite a $260 million flood of unregulated campaign \n     contributions in 1995-96, despite $3 million in illegal or \n     questionable contributions, despite an unseemly money chase \n     by the president and vice president that has prompted Justice \n     Department and congressional investigations, reform is again \n     at risk of being sidetracked.\n       Another modest effort to get at the mess of money in \n     politics would be dead, with few fingerprints at the scene of \n     the crime. Just stalemate and deception as usual.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The article, of course, lays out the arguments about \nthe issue of union dues. In fact, as is the practice of USA Today, they \ngive an opportunity to the majority leader to respond within the \narticle. But the subheadline sort of says it all. ``As in the past, \nthose in power are trying to kill campaign-finance reform without \ntaking the rap.''\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an article from the Washington Post by David S. Broder \nentitled ``Campaign Finance: A `Poison Pill'* * *.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 5, 1997]\n\n                Campaign Finance: A ``Poison Pill''. . .\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       From Capitol Hill to California, conservatives claim to \n     have found a new weapon for their arsenal--a device to disarm \n     labor unions and put Democrats on the defensive. But it is a \n     weapon that can produce a dangerous backlash.\n       The devicde is wonderfully simple: a legal requirement that \n     workers give written permission before unions can use their \n     dues for political purposes.\n       In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) \n     this week will try to attach such an amendment to the pending \n     campaign finance reform bill. He calls its approval ``the \n     price of admission'' to every other aspect of the debate \n     Democrats call it a ``poison pill'' and say if it passes, \n     they will filibuster to protect their union allies--which \n     would allow Lott to blame them for sinking the overall reform \n     package that he despises.\n       In California, where I was reporting last week, Republican \n     Gov. Pete Wilson announced that he will lead an effort for a \n     1998 ballot initiative to enact a similar requirement. At the \n     Republican state convention in Anaheim, Wilson, drew a \n     standing ovation by declaring that ``union members shouldn't \n     be forced to have their pockets picked for candidates or \n     causes they don't support.''\n       This ``payroll protection'' drive, as proponents call it, \n     is the handiwork of J. Patrick Rooney, an Indianapolis \n     insurance tycoon who previously put millions into making \n     medical savings accounts and school vouchers part of the \n     national Republican agenda.\n       Rooney told me that, through the Evergreen Freedom \n     Foundation in Seattle he is financing lawsuits by teachers \n     against the Washington Education Association for allegedly \n     violating a 1992 state initiative that is the model for the \n     Lott and Wilson proposals.\n       The California initiative ``was going to stall out for lack \n     of money,'' Rooney told me, ``so I got involved,'' and became \n     chairman of a signature drive that seems likely to put the \n     issue on next June's ballot. But that is not the end of it, \n     Rooney said he and Grover Norquist, another conservative \n     activist, have enlisted Wilson to take the proposal to next \n     month's meeting of all Republican governors and urge them to \n     do the same thing in their states. A parallel bill has \n     attracted more than 160 co-sponsors in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Polls show the idea of letting union members control how \n     their dues are spent is popular with voters. As a device for \n     limiting labor's voice, it is devastatingly effective. ``It \n     has had a dramatic, negative impact on us,'' by drying up \n     funds and bringing on a lawsuit by the state attorney \n     general, Trevor Neilsen, spokesman for the Washington \n     teachers' union, told me. At the state employees' union, \n     officials have reported that authorizations for payroll \n     deductions for its political operations had been signed by \n     only 82 of its 2,500 members.\n       In 1988, the Supreme Court ruled in Teamsters v. Beck that \n     workers in a unionized company must be allowed the option of \n     reclaiming the portion of their dues used for political \n     purposes. But the Beck decision has not been enforced. Most \n     employers are reluctant to risk union trouble by encouraging \n     dissidents. In 1992, President Bush, responding to \n     conservative pressure, issued an executive order requiring \n     government contractors to inform employees of their Beck case \n     rights. But President Clinton rescinded it on taking office, \n     as a boon to unions and because, a White House official said, \n     ``he thought it was one-sided.\n       Sens. John McCain and Russ Feingold, sponsors of the main \n     Senate campaign finance bill, have included a codification of \n     the Beck  decision in their measure. But Lott and Wilson and \n     Rooney would go much further by requiring written permission \n     from workers each year for political use of their dues. \n     Feingold and other opponents say that is unfair, noting that \n     it would leave corporations free to continue making soft \n     money political contributions without permission of \n     stockholders who might hold opposing views. And the pending \n     initiatives do not affect hundreds of other mass-membership \n     organizations such as the National Rifle Association and the \n     American Association of Retired Persons, which are also hip-\n     deep in politics.\n       Whether this is a political masterstroke for Republicans \n     remains to be seen. In 1958, conservatives promoted right-to-\n     work initiatives, barring union shop contracts, in six \n     states. They lost everywhere but in Kansas. In California and \n     Ohio, the two biggest targets, labor's mobilization fueled \n     Democratic victories that devastated the GOP.\n       California unions are threatening to retaliate against the \n     Rooney-Wilson initiative by\n\n[[Page S10391]]\n\n     placing on the ballot a measure that would ``sunset'' every \n     existing corporate tax break not approved by two-thirds vote \n     of the people and redistribute the estimated $8 billion to \n     $12 billion a year of revenue in $1,000-a-person tax rebates.\n       Conservatives may learn that if you play with fire, you can \n     be burned.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is fond of \nquoting Mr. Broder, a leading columnist and expert on these kinds of \nissues in the country. But he lays out pretty clearly the fact that \nthis is not simply another piece of legislation that happens to come up \nas the first and potentially only amendment on the campaign finance \nreform bill. He clearly lays out some of the political and other \nconsiderations that are involved in bringing up such a poison pill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial dated \nOctober 1, 1997, from the New York Times entitled ``Trent Lott's Poison \nPill,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Trent Lott's Poison Pill\n\n       Trent Lott, as expected, has come up with a perverse \n     stratagem to kill campaign finance reform this year. The \n     Senate majority leader would add a provision to the McCain-\n     Feingold bill requiring unions to get approval from workers \n     before using their dues or fees for political purposes. The \n     idea might deserve consideration another day, but Mr. Lott's \n     purpose today is to scuttle the bill by making it \n     unacceptable to Democrats.\n       After months of disclosures about excesses in both parties, \n     all 45 Senate Democrats have joined 4 Republicans to support \n     the McCain-Feingold legislation, which would prohibit \n     unlimited donations to the parties by wealthy individuals, \n     labor unions and corporations. These contributions were at \n     the heart of the access-buying scandals of the Clinton \n     campaign, and they figure in the influence of money from \n     tobacco and other industries on Capitol Hill. Mr. Lott knows \n     there are nearly enough senators to approve the bill, so he \n     wants a poison pill to repel Democrats and shatter its \n     bipartisan support.\n       Only one additional Republican would be needed to join \n     other Republican backers of reform to block Mr. Lott's plan. \n     But it will not be easy for Republicans to resist his \n     seductive amendment. Even two reformers, Senators John McCain \n     of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, support the principle \n     behind the amendment, though they have said they oppose the \n     amendment itself as a threat to reform at this crucial point. \n     Many other Republicans would like to vote for something that \n     would punish labor for its recent campaign spending, \n     particularly the $35 million that paid for attack ads \n     directed at Republican candidates in 30 Congressional races \n     last year.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill would codify a nine-year-old \n     ruling of the Supreme Court holding that non-union members \n     who pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment are \n     entitled to demand that the fees not be used for political \n     purposes. If Republicans want to vote on a broader provision \n     giving that right to all union members, they should accept \n     the Democratic offer to consider it on another day without \n     the threat of a filibuster. It would only be fair to consider \n     a similar curb requiring corporations, which outspent unions \n     nearly 9 to 1 on politics last year, to get approval from \n     shareholders when making political expenditures.\n       If the four Republican supporters of McCain-Feingold stand \n     firm, only one other Republican will be needed to defeat Mr. \n     Lott's disingenuous amendment. Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New \n     York, no particular champion of campaign reform in the past, \n     is in for a tough re-election fight next year and has always \n     had the backing of at least some labor unions. Senator Jim \n     Jeffords of Vermont, a long-time champion of campaign reform \n     should see the wisdom of standing up now. Senator Olympia \n     Snowe of Maine, where campaign finance reform has been \n     approved locally, can join with Senator Collins to save the \n     reform legislation.\n       Other senators who have shown independence on this issue in \n     the past, like John Chafee of Rhode Island, should also come \n     to the rescue. Down the road, still more Republicans will be \n     needed to save the bill, because it will take 60 votes to \n     thwart a promised filibuster. For now, they should realize \n     that if they let Mr. Lott kill the bill by subterfuge, their \n     criticism of Democratic excesses will be mere opportunism and \n     hollow rhetoric.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this again is another editorial \nindicating that people around this country know very well that what is \ngoing on here is not an opportunity to freely and fully debate and \namend this bill but an attempt to narrow it down to one issue--and I am \nnot saying it is not an important issue--but to narrow this whole issue \ndown to one issue having to do with union dues, which could be easily \nresolved.\n  If everybody took a look at the McCain-Feingold provision, a \nprovision that codified the Beck decision, a provision we placed in the \nbill after much negotiation, it says if you are a nonunion member and \nyou do not want your dues to go to a political campaign, we can refund \nthat. We codified what the Supreme Court said in that.\n  Our concern is that the majority leader's amendment goes well beyond \nthat, knowing full well it would make it impossible for a real \nbipartisan bill to come out of this body.\n  Mr. President, if this were a proposal offered by a Democrat, and it \nhad as its central premise the idea that the Federal Government should \nbe regulating the internal functions of a voluntary organization, such \nas the Christian Coalition or the National Rifle Association, you can \nbet those on the other side would be beside themselves.\n  Mr. President, that is what a labor union is. In fact, if you read \nthe Beck decision, as I did again today just to be sure, that whole \ndecision is about the fact that the Taft-Hartley Act said they were not \ngoing to permit any more closed shops in America. So if you do not want \nto be a member of a union, you do not have to be but there would still \nbe union shops. And that is because under that legislation, under that \nlaw, a union is a voluntary organization.\n  If members of a labor union do not approve of the collective \nbargaining activities or the political activities or any other \nactivities of the union, they have the right to use the democratic \nprocess to change those activities. They can run for office within the \nunion. They can build coalitions and seek leadership posts. And of \ncourse, Mr. President--and this is a point that has been glossed over \nfar too often in debate--if the individual wants absolutely nothing to \ndo with the union, he or she has the option of quitting or not joining \nthe union in the first place.\n  Union membership is not mandatory. It is voluntary. But as the \nDemocratic leader has pointed out, this provision, this amendment is \nnot about reform. I am afraid it is a little more about the last \nelection.\n  The sponsors of this proposal have come to the conclusion that all of \nthe problems in our campaign system can be traced to the political \nactivities of just labor unions. Who believes that? Clearly, labor \nunions are participants, but they are only one kind of participant and \nby no means the greatest participant when it comes to the kind of money \nthat has been spent in recent elections.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I have come to a different conclusion. I \nknow the Senator from Arizona believes passionately that the spending \nby organized labor has to be controlled with regard to elections, but \nhe and I have come to the conclusion that to simply say that unions \nalone are the problem does not really measure the problem.\n  We have concluded we should craft a reform proposal that affects both \nparties--that affects both parties--in a fair and equal manner. We have \nconcluded that corporate America is just as much to blame for our \ncampaign system as labor unions or anyone else. That is the point here. \nThere is plenty of blame to go around for everybody. Democrats are \nresponsible, Republicans are responsible, corporations are responsible, \nlabor unions are responsible, groups that are trying to divide us in \nthis country are responsible. Everybody can and should accept part of \nthe blame for this disastrous system.\n  What we are trying to do, what the Senator from Arizona and I are \ntrying to do, is to get this nonsense to come to an end. Instead, we \nare being told by the supporters of the Lott amendment, apparently that \nwhen the Ford Motor Co. takes the money of its shareholders and makes a \n$500,000 soft money contribution to a political party, that is \nperfectly fine; but if the United Auto Workers makes a similar soft \nmoney contribution to a political party, that is not OK. That has to be \nwhat the authors of this amendment are suggesting because they are not \nsuggesting that we treat them in the same way.\n  Of course, the other problem with the amendment is that it appears to \nbe offered under the mistaken assumption that the underlying McCain-\nFeingold proposal would have no impact on labor unions. Mr. President, \nthat is just false. The Senator from Arizona and I have worked hard to \nmake sure that in a fair manner the activities of unions and other \norganizations that\n\n[[Page S10392]]\n\nseem to distort the political process are affected.\n  First of all, the bill bans all union and corporate soft money \ncontributions to the parties. We ban it across the board. That includes \nall union soft money. But it also includes if it is done by the Ford \nMotor Co. In short, Mr. President, under McCain-Feingold it will be \nillegal--illegal--for a labor union to use the dues of its members or \nnonmembers--members or nonmembers--to make a soft money contribution to \npolitical parties.\n  So what is the problem if the dues can't be used for soft money, I \nsay to my colleagues, whether union member or nonunion member? Where is \nthe evil that we are not correcting?\n  Second, the McCain-Feingold bill provides that no organization, \nwhether it is a labor union, a corporation or any other organization, \ncan use unregulated soft money to fund those phony attack ads against \ncandidates that are disguised as so-called issue ads. That is because \nof our concern that if we only ban soft money, all the money will flow \ninto phony issue ads and you will end up with the same situation. That \nis a very significant restriction on the way in which unions \nparticipated in the last election, probably even more significant in \nterms of dollars than the soft money restrictions.\n  Again, it would be illegal, Mr. President, illegal under McCain-\nFeingold for a union to use the dues of its members or nonmembers, \neither one, to run those political ads attacking or supporting \ncandidates that are not raised using hard money and properly disclosed \nduring the 60-day period.\n  Mr. President, the third provision in this bill is one that is \nactually aimed only at labor unions. The other two really take care of \nthe problem. The issue of phony issue ads and soft money are the big-\nticket items with regard to union or corporate spending, but the third \nprovision is aimed directly only at labor unions. Mr. President, it \ndoes exactly what the folks on the other side of the aisle have been \ncalling for for years. It codifies the decision of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in the Beck decision.\n  This provision requires unions to notify nonunion members that those \nindividuals are entitled to have their agency fees reduced by the \namount the union spends on political activities. Mr. President, as you \ncan see, the unions have every right to participate in our political \nsystem, and are taking a number of hits already under this bill. Our \npoint is they should not be singled out as the only ones to be limited \nin this regard. Unfortunately, that is not enough for the sponsors of \nthis proposal. I fear they want to cut unions out of our political \nprocess completely.\n  Some Senators have said they do not believe anyone in America should \nhave to contribute involuntarily, Mr. President, to any political \ncampaign. But what would happen if you applied that principle to \ncorporations and other organizations, as well? Say I am living in Eau \nClaire, WI, and I own several shares of stock in AT I assume that \nmoney I have invested in that corporation was being used to grow that \ncompany and improve its market share. That is what I would hope the \ncompany would do to protect my dollar, to do their fiduciary duty to \ntheir stockholders. Would I be surprised to learn my money is being \nused to finance a $500,000 soft money contribution to a national \npolitical party? Sure I would. Would I be informed of \nthat contribution? Would AT have to get my permission before they use \nmy money for that purpose under the Lott amendment? Absolutely not. \nUnions have to do it but AT doesn't have to do it. So much for \nfairness under this amendment.\n\n  Another telling indicator of the true purpose of this proposal, I am \nafraid, is the timing. If these union activities are such an affront to \nour democratic system, I want to repeat, why wasn't S. 9, a bill \nintroduced on the first week of our Congress, brought to the floor \nbefore this point? The senior Senator from Oklahoma introduced this \nbill on this matter on the very first day of the session back in \nJanuary. It was one of the highest priorities of the Republican \nleadership. Why hasn't it been marked up, even in committee? The answer \nis clear. It is serving a different function. Its function here is to \nfill up the tree, as we say, and prevent other amendments and perhaps \nto kill the bill. Mr. President, I am afraid this is not about the role \nof labor unions. It is too much about partisanship.\n  The majority leader stated a week ago Friday his intention was to \ncreate a situation where the Democrats would be forced to filibuster \ncampaign finance reform. Those on the other side know that the passage \nof this amendment will trigger such opposition. I am disappointed that \nsome have concluded that the purpose of this debate should be to see \nwhich party can get the other one to kill campaign finance reform. The \nSenator from Arizona and I have been working hard on ensuring that this \nproposal is fair to both parties. We have made compromises. We have \nattempted to craft a bill that would give both parties credit, \ntogether, for passing campaign finance reform.\n  Make no mistake, whether it was truly intended to do this or not, the \nproposal before the Senate today in the form of the Lott amendment \nwould kill campaign finance reform. The vote on this proposal would be \nthe vote to determine if we pass meaningful campaign finance reform \nthis year or not. We know the vote will be close. We know it will come \ndown to one or two Senators. So I hope, regardless of every Senator's \npersonal feelings about how much we should do with regard to unions \nspecifically, my colleagues will recognize this is not a vote about \nrestricting labor unions but a vote to kill campaign finance reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nLott amendment and in opposition to the McCain-Feingold bill. It is not \nwithout some reservation that I take that position. I have the greatest \nesteem and respect for the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from \nArizona. I know their motives in all of this are good and honorable.\n  I just happen to come from a State, however, where we enacted a bill \nnot dissimilar--not identical, but not dissimilar--to the McCain-\nFeingold bill. My State legislative process went through an entire \ncycle with Byzantine kinds of rules applied before our State supreme \ncourt, a very liberal supreme court, threw it all out as \nunconstitutional, as violating the right of freedom of speech.\n  Now, Oregon is a State that is known for good clean government, good \nclean many things. We have in our State no allegations of corruption, \nor frankly they are very infrequent. We have voter turnout that often \nexceeds 80 percent. We have a very healthy democratic system in my \nState.\n  Notwithstanding that, in 1994 there was an initiative that came to \nour ballot, very similar to McCain-Feingold, that applied to State \nlegislative and gubernatorial races. I will admit that it passed by a \nlarge margin. I said to myself, why would it pass by a big margin if we \nhave a good thing going here, frankly, good government in our State? I \nthink it is simply because people don't like to be inconvenienced by \ndemocracy sometimes, and I know how they feel. I don't like to see \nnegative ads and I don't like to be imposed upon sometimes, but \nfrankly, democracy sometimes is uncomfortable. It is sometimes messy.\n  On first blush it appeared to be a very good bill. However, when it \ncame to its enactment, our secretary of state tried to explain it to \nall the legislative candidates. Everyone was wondering how you can run \nfor public office. There were limits placed upon what a candidate could \nraise. There were limits placed upon what a citizen could contribute of \n$100. And the net effect of it all is that a State legislative office \nseeker could raise about $20,000 to $30,000, and that would buy maybe a \ncouple cracks at communicating with his constituents.\n  The interest in the process didn't leave. It just simply vacated the \nopen air of democracy and went back into the smoke-filled room. I am \ntalking about organized labor and I am talking about big business. \nThey, then, ran campaigns about candidates in the most slanderous and \nscurrilous of ways. For those campaigns, no one was accountable, no one \nwas responsible. And in the end, I believe our democracy in the 98th \ncycle was dumbed down and disserved. Importantly, our\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\nSupreme Court, as I mentioned, declared it all unconstitutional. They \ndid so correctly.\n  Now, when I ran for the U.S. Senate I ran in a special election \nagainst my friend, now my colleague, my former competitor, Ron Wyden, a \nMember of this Chamber. He and I became the focus of the entire country \nin contesting for the seat formally held by Bob Packwood. Let me tell \nyou what happened. Both of us were running hard-hitting campaigns. Then \nwe became the victims, and I believe myself especially, by what I term \n``drive-by shooting'' on our democratic process. I had, in the course \nof several weeks time, $1 million of the most scurrilous kinds of ads \nrun against me and I hated what they said.\n  I remember my little boy sitting watching television when I happened \nto be there and seeing one of the ads that they ran, and he turned back \nto me with wide eyes and tears in his eyes and he said, ``That was a \nvery bad ad, Dad,'' and it was.\n  You might think because of that I would want to shut down the ability \nof the unions to participate I don't want to do that, but I don't want \nto shut down the right of people like me and you to respond to these \nkinds of attacks. That is what these kinds of limits will do.\n  I truly believe that banning soft money is unconstitutional for many \nof the same reasons our State supreme court found it unconstitutional. \nI believe the U.S. Supreme Court would find such attempts here to be \nunconstitutional. Limit it--you may be able to do. But if you limit it, \nand I may even be able to vote for some form of limitation as we apply \nlimits on contributions directly to candidates, perhaps there can be \nsome constitutional limit on soft money. But if you do that, then there \nshould be no more compulsory element left in this process.\n  Frankly, the huge loophole is this loophole provided by compulsory \nunion dues. Unless the Lott amendment passes, I can't go any farther, \nbecause I saw what happened. It happened to me, and it happened to \nRepublicans and Democrats alike in the State of Oregon. They had \ncampaigns run about them and they were grossly unfair. I don't want to \nsupport campaign finance reform that will dumb down our democracy in \nthat way. Indeed, I believe some of the best things that we could do \nare to require voluntarism in this process and then to put some \nreasonable spending limits or caps on soft money contributions and then \nto require candidates to disclose on a daily basis the source of their \ncontributions 3 months out from a campaign so that the public knows if \none candidate is getting too much from business or another candidate is \ngetting too much from labor. Then they can decide whether that is \nsignificant to them when they cast their sacred vote.\n  In my view, the cure for bad democracy is not less of it but more of \nit and more open. I don't see that we provide for that in the McCain-\nFeingold bill. I see many things resulting, as they did in Oregon, \nwhich left my State in one election cycle, I believe, poorer for it.\n  So I plead with my colleague, vote for the Lott amendment, and then \nlet's talk seriously about some things that we can do to make this \nwhole process fair for both sides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbipartisan campaign finance reform legislation offered by my \ncolleagues, Senator Feingold and Senator McCain. I am pleased to join \nwith all 44 of my Democratic colleagues, as well as Senators McCain, \nThompson, Collins, and Specter. I hope during the course of this debate \nothers will join us in this first step in campaign finance reform that \nwe so desperately need.\n  Campaign finance reform is an issue that deserves our full \nconsideration and one that must be voted on this year, whatever time it \ntakes. Mr. President, I would like to, at the outset, commend Senators \nFeingold and McCain for their thoughtful and careful bipartisan \napproach in crafting a piece of campaign finance reform that, although \nI believe it to be modest--more modest than I would have preferred--\nnevertheless marks a beginning.\n  The integrity of our political system is threatened by the tremendous \namounts of money required to run for public office. The Members in this \nChamber know it, political scholars know it, and the American people \nknow it.\n  Mr. President, I first sought elective public office in 1968 as a \ncandidate for my State legislature. Then and now, some money was \nrequired in order to put together a campaign, to prepare the necessary \nkinds of materials, and to make sure the constituents that one sought \nto persuade knew what your message was. Over the intervening years, I \nhave had occasion to run for State elective office on four different \noccasions and have had an opportunity to run for the U.S. Senate twice \nnow. There is no question, from any perspective, any point of view, \nthat the amount of money that is involved today in the American \npolitical system far exceeds, by any measure, any growth that may be \nattributed to inflation or any other reasonable consequence, including \nthe growth of the population in my own State and generally across the \ncountry.\n  There has been, during that intervening nearly 30 years since the \ntime I have been involved in the elective political system, a marked \ndecline in voter participation in this system. This is an alarming \ntrend. It does not bode well for Democrats or Republicans or \nIndependents, nor does it bode well for the future of democratic \ninstitutions.\n  Mr. President, I believe that there is an absolute correlation \nbetween declining voter interest and the ever larger sums of money \nbeing raised to fuel the money chase. Nearly $2.7 billion was spent on \ncampaigns in the last election cycle. Every year the expense of \ncampaigning climbs higher and higher, and the pressure to seek \nfinancial support for those who seek public office intensifies \naccordingly.\n  I know that some contend there is not enough money being spent in the \nAmerican political system. I respectfully disagree with that opinion, \nand I believe that the great majority of the American public disagrees \nas well.\n  A full 92 percent of Americans believe that too much money is spent \non campaigns. The Wall Street Journal poll of December of last year \nreflects that number. Indeed, money has become a dominant factor in \nAmerican politics as to who runs and who wins. As a consequence, our \npolitical system is on a downward spiral that will continue to spin out \nof control unless we have the courage to take the steps necessary to \nstop it. There is a sense of irony, Mr. President, that the institution \nthat benefits the most from the current system is the only one that can \nreform it. But we must put the interest of country ahead of our own \npolitical success and ahead of party interests.\n  The revised McCain-Feingold bill is, as I have said, a very modest \nproposal; nevertheless, it is a first step in reforming a campaign \nfinancing system that cries out for change. It just might begin to \nrestore the people's trust in the ability of their elected officials to \nstop the hemorrhaging of the political system and to allow the healing \nprocess to begin. As I said, I would have preferred a more \ncomprehensive approach, but that is not to be. However, this is an \neffort which may have a chance to attract more support and thus has a \nchance of becoming law. Senators Feingold and McCain have carefully \nreshaped their original bill as a compromise with the hope of \nattracting additional Republican votes, which will be needed for its \npassage.\n  First, the McCain-Feingold legislation bans the use of so-called soft \nmoney by the national political parties from corporations, labor \nunions, and wealthy individuals. State parties would be banned from \nspending soft money on activities related to Federal elections.\n  The creative expanded uses by both political parties of soft money \nhas significantly increased the demand for campaign contributions. This \npast 1996 election year was the costliest ever in our Nation's history. \nBoth parties raised overall $881 million for the election--a 73 percent \nincrease over the amount of the preceding 4 years when the parties \nraised $508 million. In soft money alone, Democrat and Republican \nparties raised $263.5 million. That is nearly three times the amount \nthat was raised in the preceding 4-year cycle. From 1988 to 1996, the \namount of soft money raised by the parties has increased by nearly 600 \npercent.\n\n  What needs to be done? The American people have been asked what they\n\n[[Page S10394]]\n\nthink needs to be done to reform the political process in this country. \nFrom the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey of June 1997 when that question \nwas propounded, the American public is not confused. Perhaps some \nMembers of Congress are confused, but the American public is not \nconfused.\n\n       Reduce the amount that candidates can accept from political \n     action committees, impose overall spending limits on \n     campaigns, eliminate large contributions to political \n     parties, and provide some financial incentives to candidates.\n\n  Sixty-two percent of the American people believe that is what ought \nto be done.\n  Among the other options that were discussed were:\n\n       Remove all limits on contributions so people can give as \n     much money as they want, but require more timely disclosure \n     of these donations.\n\n  Some of our colleagues believe that we ought to be spending more \nmoney in running for public office. The American public disagrees \noverwhelmingly. Only 18 percent favor the removal of limits on \ncontributions.\n\n       Leave the current campaign financing system intact.\n\n  Only 14 percent favor that course of action.\n  Now, I understand that the debate and the argument is that campaign \nspending is a form of free speech and therefore cannot be regulated in \nany form. The American people, when asked that question, conclude \nthat--18 percent of them--as a form of free speech, that cannot be \nregulated; and 74 percent believe campaign spending has nothing to do \nwith free speech and that spending limits should be imposed. That data \nis also from the previously cited 1997 NBC News/Wall Street Journal \nsurvey.\n  Mr. President, I understand, having had occasion to practice law and \nhaving served as the attorney general of my State, that the \nconstitutionality of an issue cannot be determined simply by a majority \nof public opinion at any one time. I certainly do not argue that to be \nthe case because constitutional principles rise to a higher level than \nwhat a majority at any given point in time might favor. Nevertheless, \nduring the course of debate on this and other legislation, critics of \nproposed legislation frequently invoke the contention that the \nlegislation as drafted is unconstitutional. That debate has occurred in \nthe context of this bill. The able and distinguished Senator from \nKentucky has cited a number of constitutional scholars who weighed in \nin favor of the proposition that this legislation, in its attempt to \nlimit soft money and other restrictions, is unconstitutional. On the \nother side of the constitutional divide, an equal body of distinguished \nscholars have weighed in on behalf of the proposition advocated by \nSenators Feingold and McCain and have asserted that these provisions \nare indeed constitutional.\n  My point in mentioning this is that we in this Chamber are not going \nto be able to decide that issue. We will not be able to resolve it. \nThat is not our function. The function of the legislative branch of the \ntwo Houses of Congress is to enact legislation and, indeed, if the \nlegislation that we have enacted is in any way constitutionally flawed, \nthe courts--ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States--will \nmake that decision, and the courts have done so when they believe that \nwe have overstepped the constitutional limits in imposing restrictions \non our campaign financing system.\n  Mr. President, we ought to allow the courts to make that \ndetermination and to move this legislation forward so that those who \nseek to challenge it have an opportunity to do so in the only \nmeaningful forum in which this issue can be resolved on a \nconstitutional basis, and that is in the judicial arena.\n  Mr. President, unless we have the good sense to change the rules of \nthe game, candidates and their political parties will continue to \npursue the money chase and the amount of money involved in future \ncampaigns will continue to grow rapidly. I frequently tell the \nconstituents in my own State that this fatally flawed campaign system \nthat is involved has locked good people into a bad system in which, \nalmost from the moment of our election, it is impressed upon us that \nthe next campaign, if we choose to run for reelection, will be more \ncostly than the previous one, and our focus almost immediately is upon \nhow much money will I have to raise each week that I serve, each month \nthat I serve, if I choose to seek reelection.\n  The amount of money has increased, as I have indicated, not just \narithmetically based upon factors of inflation and the growth that is \noccurring in the populations of our respective States, but they have \ngrown exponentially, and it might constitute the gravest threat to the \nintegrity of the political system in America.\n  This bill proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold would do several \nthings. In addition to the ban on soft money, the bill places a \nrestriction on issue ads by independent special interests. If a Federal \ncandidate's name is mentioned in any broadcast television or radio \ncommunication within 60 days of an election, for example, then this \ncandidate-related expenditure will be subject to Federal election law \nand must be disclosed and financed with so-called hard dollars.\n\n  The Supreme Court has ruled that only communications that contain \nexpress advocacy of candidates are subject to Federal disclosure \nrequirements and restrictions. This proposal would extend to include \nissue ads running 60 days prior to the election in which the individual \ncandidate's name is mentioned in those ads.\n  Third, the legislation increases disclosure requirements and requires \nthe Federal Election Commission to make campaign finance records \navailable on the Internet within 24 hours of their filing. It requires \npolitical ads to carry a disclaimer identifying who is responsible for \nthe content of the ad. Simply put, disclosure requirements would bring \nmore accountability and responsibility to our political process.\n  Fourth, the bill prohibits political parties from making coordinated \nexpenditures on behalf of Senate candidates who do not agree to limit \ntheir personal spending to $50,000 per election. This provision, in my \nopinion, will help to level the playing field between wealthy \ncandidates and those candidates who do not have deep financial pockets.\n  Fifth, this bipartisan legislation prohibits anyone who is not a U.S. \ncitizen from making financial contributions.\n  Finally, and what has become a central focus of this issue in recent \ndays, McCain-Feingold requires that labor unions notify nonunion \nmembers that they are entitled to have their agency fees reduced by an \namount equal to the portion of the fees used for political purposes if \nthey file an objection to the use of those fees--a so called opt-out \nsystem in which the member can notify the union that he or she does not \nwant any union dues used to finance any part of the political campaign \ncontribution system. Fair enough, it seems.\n  The Supreme Court's 1988 Beck decision explicitly states that \nnonunion members in union shops may choose to pay reduced agency fees, \nand the McCain-Feingold bill simply codifies the Beck decision.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, we hear that opponents of McCain-Feingold \nhave argued for the need to codify the Beck decision. Senators Feingold \nand McCain have done just that by including a provision that expressly \ncodifies the Supreme Court decision.\n  Now, however, there is an effort to seek a new amendment, a new \nprovision. The pending amendment is clever. It indeed may rise to the \nlevel of being ingenious. But its sole purpose and function is to kill \nthe cause of campaign finance reform. The majority leader himself was \nquoted in the Wall Street Journal in September this past month as \nsaying:\n\n       I set it up [referring to the amendment] so they will be \n     filibustering me.\n\n  This is a political tactic that is designed to thwart, to prevent \ncampaign finance reform. It clearly indicates that this is not a \nserious debate about reforming our campaign laws.\n\n  Perhaps the Washington Post editorial of October 1, 1997, sets the \nrecord in the proper context. And I quote:\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, having magnanimously \n     allowed campaign finance reform legislation to come to the \n     floor, now proposes to kill it with an amendment affecting \n     the use of labor union dues for political purposes.\n\n  I regret that the amendment in that form was offered. I hope that \nsome\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\nmechanism might be developed to permit us to pursue campaign finance \nreform and offer other amendments without this particular provision \nwhich has been variously characterized as a ``killer'' amendment or a \n``poison pill'' amendment because I believe that its purpose is to \neffectively prevent campaign finance reform.\n  Mark Twain once observed that ``Everyone complains about the weather, \nbut nobody does anything about it.'' The same could be said about the \nway we finance our campaigns for elective office.\n  If there ever was a time to reform our political system, the time is \nnow. Neither political party has benefited in terms of public opinion \nfrom our present campaign finance system. Overwhelmingly, 92 percent of \nthe American people believe that our system desperately needs reform \nand the time for us to do it is now. If we let this opportunity slip \naway, I fear that real campaign finance reform may not be enacted.\n  We need to ban soft money, and to stop the onslaught of negative ad \nattacks on political candidates.\n  We need to level the playing field, and give challengers who want to \nrun for Congress and to prove that their ideas have merit and represent \na broad base of public support the opportunity to do so.\n  Madam President, we need to restore public confidence in the American \npolitical system. And I believe that the McCain-Feingold revised \nmeasure represents our best hope for making these significant and \nneeded changes prior to the next election.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \nfinally taken up the discussion of the McCain-Feingold campaign reform \nlegislation.\n  I very much appreciate the efforts of Senator Daschle in pushing this \nprocess forward. His role in demonstrating that all 45 Senate Democrats \nsupport the revised version of McCain-Feingold I think was essential. \nAnd I hope that it becomes clear to all Americans that with the one \nadditional Republican vote necessary that we will in fact achieve \nhistoric reform of the campaign funding system in our Nation.\n  But I also want to applaud Senators McCain and Feingold for what has \nbeen a tireless effort on their behalf in forging this bipartisan \ncompromise legislation. We have seen many good bills fall by the \nwayside over the years. But this seems to be one of the best \nopportunities in recent years to actually achieve real reform.\n  That said, I have to express disappointment on my part that this \nlegislation has been stripped down to a more modest level from its \noriginal version. In particular, I am disappointed that the system no \nlonger creates a system of voluntary spending limits in the way that \nthe original bill did. I believe that kind of limitation, that kind of \nrestraint that will slow the nuclear arms race of campaign fundraising \nand spending in the long run, will in fact be essential.\n  Madam President, I have been a long-time supporter of campaign reform \nlegislation. My experiences over these past 2 years have made it even \nmore apparent to me that passage of this campaign finance reform \nlegislation is absolutely critical to the health of our democracy.\n  There are those who would suggest that any restraint on spending of \nany kind is somehow a dumbing down of our democracy when in fact the \nreality is just the opposite. The quality of our democracy, the \nintegrity of our democracy, is not a function of how much money we \nspend. It is a function of how well the debate is conducted.\n  There are those who have legitimate philosophical problems. There are \nthose who simply see the status quo as being supportive of their own \ncurrent election to the body, and to the House of Representatives. But \nI think that there are a great many of us here--and I believe a \nmajority, if the opportunity were afforded to us to actually cast a \nvote on the merits of campaign finance reform--who would actually \nsupport this sweeping legislation.\n  I personally have just been through one of the longest and, frankly, \none of the most expensive per voter Senate campaigns in the history of \nAmerica. My opponent and I spent a total of $24 for every vote cast. \nAnd, if one were to include the money spent by the national party \norganizations and the various independent groups, total spending would \nrise to around $29 per vote. All of this money produced one of the \nlongest political campaigns the Nation has ever seen. My opponent began \nrunning campaign commercials 17 months from the election, then 13 \nmonths before the election--an attack ad campaign, one that I had to \nrespond to, although I was not yet even formally an announced candidate \nin the race.\n\n  That is the kind of campaign negative--vitriolic, long-winded, \nlongstanding--that did nothing to improve the confidence of the \nAmerican public in our political process, and did nothing to restore \nconfidence that in fact the system reflects their values and their \nideals and their values. It was simply a system awash in too much \nmoney.\n  Put in perspective, in South Dakota, our small State, with statewide \ntelevision advertising relatively inexpensive, for a race like this, if \none were run in a State like California at $29 per vote cast, the cost \nwould be staggering. The equivalent cost in the State of California \nwould be a $250 million Senate campaign.\n  Some argue that the money is good for democracy, that the voters will \nbe more educated by this kind of enormous financial overkill.\n  Last week, the Washington Post quoted the House Speaker saying that \n``If you have enough resources on both sides, you can actually \ncommunicate rationally.'' In his view, the more money spent by \ncandidates the better.\n  But I can tell you with utmost certainty, given my own experience, \nthat these arguments are utterly wrong. Voters in fact over recent \nyears have been turned off by campaigns of this duration and of this \nnegative quality because of unending commercials.\n  As I speak to South Dakotans in every corner of my State, there is a \nfervent wish that we could return to the days when campaigning began \nwith great seriousness around Labor Day of the election year--not Labor \nDay of the year prior.\n  The appearance of this amount of money, the appearance of the raising \nof this amount of money, is one that gives rise to attitudes that the \nentire system is corrupt, the entire system is unresponsive, and the \nAmerican public, that there is too much time spent raising the money.\n  Madam President, how long is it going to be that Members of this body \nand Members of the other body vacate their offices daily to go to their \nprivate campaign offices in the row houses and the streets off the Hill \nto make their fundraising phone calls, to do this ``dialing for \ndollars,'' as it is referred to around here, trying to raise the amount \nof money necessary to run one of these campaigns?\n  The typical U.S. Senate campaign, if it were raised in an equal level \nof energy throughout the 6-year term, would require the incumbent to \nraise $14,000 a week, every week, 52 weeks a year, for 6 years. Madam \nPresident, that is not the kind of money that can be raised casually. \nThat is not the kind of money that can be raised with a barbecue in \nyour backyard back home in South Dakota, or whatever State you are in. \nThat is not the kind of money that can be raised in small increments. \nThat requires a concerted, sophisticated, methodical effort. And it is \ncorrupt and demeaning to the service in this body. And it is destroying \nthe public's confidence in the quality of the deliberations that take \nplace here, and in the kind of accountability that this body has.\n  As the amount of money rises, what we have seen last year in the last \ncycle becomes only more so in the future. The amount of money to raise \nto win a congressional seat has continued to rise astronomically. \nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, the typical candidate for \nan open seat in the House of Representatives raised nearly $600,000--\nclose to double what was required only 4 years ago. The growth in so-\ncalled soft money has been even more explosive. Data from the 1996 \nelections show that the amount of soft money that was raised and spent \nwas more than three times what was spent in 1992, and 11 times more \nthan was spent in 1980.\n  It should be so fundamentally absolutely clear that something is \nwrong--\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nsomething is terribly wrong with our system of financing elections in \nthis country.\n  Campaigns have become in many ways little more than a campaign \nfinance arms race. And the American public has understandably become \ndisenchanted with politics in large part because of this process.\n  There are people who suggested that all we need to do is to ban soft \nmoney raised by the political parties. Again, a mistake. Banning soft \nmoney without addressing the expanding role of independent groups and \npolitical campaigns would not go far enough, and it could create a \nwhole new set of problems. We need to redefine the term ``soft money'' \nto include all forms of campaign spending that is presently \nunregulated.\n  During the 1996 election cycle when we experienced a flurry of \ncampaign activity by independent organizations and congressional races, \nindependent expenditures accounted for $19 million of spending--most of \nit targeted to key congressional races.\n  An even more pressing problem is the new phenomenon of issue advocacy \nadvertisements. Last year's Supreme Court decision in the Colorado case \nopened the floodgates for this kind kind of activity.\n\n  According to a study by the Annenberg Center at the University of \nPennsylvania, one-third of all campaign advertising totaling $150 \nmillion came from these so-called issue ads. Just as influential as \nother ads, they are political ads. They are not subject to the same \nfundraising regulations as in reporting requirements. Nobody knows \nwhere the money comes from. They are utterly unregulated.\n  The Annenberg study indicated that issue ads were the most virulently \nnegative ads on the air. Overall, 81 percent of these ads were attack \nads.\n  We have also seen the last expansion in the political activity by \ntax-exempt organizations--organizations, in effect, using taxpayer \ndollars to further a very political agenda on the left and on the \nright. And 30 tax-exempt groups are not supposed to be engaged in \npartisan political activity. But the reality has become very apparent \nto everyone who has even had a casual following of what has transpired \nover these last 2 years. In particular, banning soft money to political \nparties without addressing the growing problem of third-party groups \nwould merely cause more money to flow into these unregulated groups.\n  One of my fears is, while we may limit spending that flows formally \nthrough the campaign structures of the respective candidates and their \nparties, that the money then as water flowing downhill washes \nincreasingly into even more unregulated and less accountable mechanisms \nfor running the campaigns, and the candidates will find themselves \nincreasingly irrelevant to their own political campaigns, the political \nthemes. And the political attacks and responses will be orchestrated \nand designed and organized by these so-called tax-exempt groups--groups \nthat are, in fact, using taxpayer dollars in effect to run their \npartisan independent issue advocacy kinds of campaigns.\n  That does a disservice to the political dialog in our Nation. That \ndoes a disservice to any hope that we have that political candidates \nwill be accountable to the public for the positions they take. The \nAmerican public deserves better than that, and that is why we need \ncampaign finance reform and that is why we need a broadened sense of \nsoft money regulation.\n  It is not clear whether there are going to be any amendments allowed \nin the course of this debate. It is certainly my hope there will be. \nThat is the nature of debate in this body. It is what we have done for \n200 years on issues of great public significance. And yet we find a \nparliamentary procedure being used that may, unfortunately, stop \namendments, stop debate and cause this whole exercise to come tumbling \ndown.\n  But if we have an opportunity for a full, meaningful debate, \ninvolving amendments, if we are allowed to offer amendments, I have two \nI want to pursue. One is an amendment that would deal with the problem \nof candidates spending their campaign funds for personal use. This is \nsomething I think has become out of hand, as reimbursement payments to \nelected officials are not itemized and there are literally thousand-\ndollar reimbursements coming back to candidates for their personal use.\n  I think we need to clean this up. I think we need to take another \nstep in the right direction to make the American public think that in \nfact this system is responsive to them, that campaign money is not some \nadditional source of slush fund, not some additional source of personal \nfinancial wealth that is available to candidates.\n  A recent study by the Gannett News Service last year showed that many \ncandidates have reimbursed themselves thousands upon thousands of \ndollars from their campaign funds with virtually no explanation of \nwhere the money has gone, what it has been used to purchase. I believe \nthe same itemization requirements ought to be applied to candidates as \nare applied to other areas.\n  Second, I believe another matter in cleaning the system up and \nrestoring a greater sense of integrity to the system is campaigns ought \nto pay the fair market value for use of private aircraft such as the \ncorporate jets that transport Members from one corner of this continent \nto the other. Currently, candidates simply reimbursing the equivalent \nof first-class airfare, when in fact the cost of this transportation is \noften in the tens of thousands of dollars, and again going unrecorded, \nresults in less accountability than I believe we should have.\n  We have had a historic first session of the 105th Congress as we come \ndown now to this final month in the sense I think we have dealt \nresponsibly with the Federal budget, the Federal budget deficit, with \nthe design of some tax relief, in placing I think a greater emphasis on \neducation, preserving a commitment to the environment, doing I think \nsome positive things. But this Congress cannot be deemed a success and \nhistory will treat this Congress poorly, in my view, if we miss this \nopportunity now to enact meaningful, significant campaign finance \nreform, reform that is supported by the nonpartisan reform \norganizations around the Nation, one that is not designed to tilt the \nplaying field to one political party or the other because, frankly, in \npast years that has happened from time to time. We need to get away \nfrom that and, in fact, to pursue this kind of significant reform that \nhas bipartisan support, that is supported on a very broad basis by the \nAmerican public and to quit making excuses to the American public about \nwhy it could not get done, no more excuses about why the money will \ncontinue to mount, no more excuses why there will not be any greater \naccountability than in the past, about where the money is raised and \nhow it is spent, no more excuses about why these campaigns are taking \nnow years and years rather than months and months to transpire, no more \nexcuses about where the money came from and who, in fact, has their \ninterests best being considered by our legislative bodies in \nWashington.\n  We have that opportunity now. We cannot allow this to escape from us. \nWe have, today and tomorrow, an opportunity to cast a historic vote to \nget past some of the parliamentary abuses that are attempted to be used \nhere, the poison pill parliamentary efforts, to get past that and to \nallow each one of us in this body to go home at the end of this session \nof the 105th Congress and to look our constituents in the eye and say, \nI voted for or I voted against campaign finance reform on the merits, \nup or down. Let us be permitted to cast that vote with the full breadth \nof debate. While I am worried that that may not in fact transpire today \nor tomorrow, during the remainder of this 105th Congress we have this \ngreat opportunity and it is certainly my hope we will not allow it to \nslip.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, much of the debate this past week about campaign \nfinance reform has missed an important dynamic of the political \nprocess. The integrity of any process depends on the integrity of the \nindividual. We recapture the trust and confidence of the American \npeople not by passing more laws, more regulation and more Government \nbut by taking responsibility for our own actions and the conduct for \nour own campaigns--personal responsibility. Will more Government \ncontrol, more regulation, more law really\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\nchange our behavior and our conduct? Will more Government control make \nus more honest and fill us with new-found integrity? I do not think so.\n\n  Systems are corrupt because of the people. Systems are not corrupt \nbecause of the system. When we lower our expectation and we lower our \nstandards, as we have in American politics, we lower our self-worth. We \nlower the system. And when we do not expect much, we do not get much. \nWhen we do not expect much from our candidates and our politicians, we \nwill not get much. It all becomes self-fulfilling.\n  Now, why do we blame the system and excuse the violators? Where is \nthe outrage over those who subvert the system and deliberately break \nthe rules and the laws already in place? Where is the outrage over \nindividuals who break the law and refuse to take responsibility for \ntheir own actions? Where are the voices demanding personal \nresponsibility and personal accountability? Where are those voices? \nThose voices are now talking about the system.\n  We glide over the alleged wrongdoing of individuals, saying, well, it \ndoesn't count, it doesn't matter--like it is beyond our control. We say \nthat it is the system; that is the problem. The system is flawed, not \nthe individual but the system. We say that money is evil, money is the \nterrible evil in our system. We excuse the alleged wrongdoing and \ncorruption by blaming the so-called vagaries of the campaign finance \nsystem and the laws.\n  We dance on the pinhead of technicalities. What is allowed? What is \nnot allowed? What is the correct shading of the law? Did the person \nreally break the law? How must we change the rules and regulations so \nthat this never happens again? All we need is more Government. \nEverybody knows that. If we have more rules, more regulation, more \nenforcement, more Government, then people will abide by the law.\n  Something is greatly amiss when we are debating the technicalities of \nright and wrong. There are no technicalities between right and wrong. \nRight is right. Wrong is wrong. There are no shades of right or degrees \nof wrong. The difference between right and wrong is not subject to a \ncontrolling legal authority. It is a matter of honesty. It is a matter \nof simply just doing the right thing. Is that difficult to grasp? Is \nthat so difficult to this body to grasp?\n  We are here today debating whether or not to pass new laws based on \nthe fact that some people broke the law, or at least allegedly broke \nthe law. Those are laws that we already have. Those are regulations and \nrules on the books now. It is very clear. We already have laws \nprohibiting foreign contributions. We already have laws prohibiting the \nsolicitation of campaign funds in a Government building. We already \nhave laws that very clearly spell out the difference between so-called \nhard money and soft money.\n  I ask my colleagues one question: How will changing the rules and the \nlaws and the regulations change behavior of those already inclined to \nbreak them? It will not. No number of new laws and new regulations will \nchange the basic integrity of the candidate. The integrity of the \nsystem depends on the integrity of the candidate. Each candidate must \ntake personal responsibility for his or her own actions in the conduct \nof their campaigns. We need to focus on individual violations of \ncurrent law. We need to focus on individual conduct and behavior, \nindividual responsibility and accountability. If each of us in public \noffice conducted our campaigns, every aspect of our campaigns in a \nmanner that our constituents will be proud of, not necessarily always \nagreeing with our positions but be proud of how we conduct ourselves \nand our campaigns, then we would not be engaged in this campaign \nfinance reform debate.\n  People get involved and participate in a democracy because they \nbelieve in things. The idea that more people will participate in our \npolitical process if we pass more laws and regulations completely \ndiscounts the nature of free people. Politics is about people. Politics \nis not about Government. Politics is not about rules and regulations. \nPolitics is about people. Politics is about people who believe in \nthings. We will not restore the trust and confidence of the American \npeople in elected officials and the political system by placing further \nrestrictions, by placing further restrictions on the rights of \nAmericans to participate in the political process.\n  A former Governor of Deleware and former Member of Congress, Pete \nDuPont, made a very compelling argument in last week's Wall Street \nJournal when he wrote that limits in campaigns are akin to price \ncontrols in the economy. And he said, ``All of these ideas are bad \neconomics, bad politics and, as 40 centuries have proved, very bad \npublic policy.''\n  The best way to correct the system is not to replace an old bad set \nof rules with a new bad set of rules. That is not reform. That is \nrearranging the restrictions. Too many people here in Washington \nconfuse the two. The best thing to do would be to provide the American \npeople complete and immediate disclosure of all contributions--complete \nand immediate disclosure of every dollar in the system. Hard money, \nsoft money, independent expenditures, every single dollar that goes \ninto the system must be disclosed immediately.\n\n  The press already does a good job of telling the people who is giving \nmoney to whom, when the media knows, that is. I have every confidence \nthat if we had full disclosure of every dollar, the press would inform \nthe people as to who is giving and receiving these contributions. They \nwill tell the people who is spending the money for or against \ncandidates. They will let the people know where candidates are getting \ntheir campaign contributions. Let the press do the job and report all \nof these contributions.\n  I trust the people. I trust the people of this country to be able to \nsort it out. If they have the information, if the people of this \ncountry have the information, they will make an informed decision. They \nwill determine what is acceptable to them, not because some bureaucrat \nor Washington regulator tells them what is right or wrong but the \npeople sort it out. Just give the people the information.\n  As Governor DuPont wrote, ``A well-informed electorate will safeguard \nAmerican campaigns far better than any appointed group of the best and \nbrightest Washington regulators.''\n  Another change we might look at is to again make political \ncontributions tax deductible. We used to do that. We allow people to \ndeduct contributions to charities. We allow union members to deduct \ntheir union dues, but if people want to participate in American \ndemocracy by giving money, it is not tax deductible. Is not our system \nof self-government just as important as a charity or a union?\n  How will we restore the trust and confidence of the American people \nin their elected officials? By electing good people to office, by \nholding those who serve in public office accountable for their actions, \nand holding them to the highest standards. I consider serving in public \noffice to be an honor and privilege. I know every one of my colleagues \nfeels the same. This is not a right. This is not a right, to be in this \nbody, to hold public office. It is not mine to hold onto by whatever \nmeans I can, no matter how questionable those means. It is a privilege \nbestowed on me by the people of my State. It is a privilege they also \nhave the right to revoke. The people need to be our partners in the \npolitical process. We can create all the laws we want, but only the \npeople--not the laws, not the regulators, not the regulations, not the \nsystem--but only the people can hold elected officials accountable for \ntheir actions. Only the people can, through their votes, determine when \nsomeone no longer deserves their trust and confidence.\n  I believe that for far too long we have been creating a society less \ndependent on the voluntary rule of honesty and good behavior of the \ncitizen than on the impressive mandates of Government. Government does \nnot mold human behavior. Behavior comes from within. I cannot support \nany proposal that seeks to limit the ability of the people and \ninstitutions to express themselves and takes the power to shape our \npublic policy debate away from the people and gives it to the \nGovernment. I cannot support such legislation. That is what McCain-\nFeingold would do, in the name of reform.\n  What are we really reforming, the right of people to participate in \nthe political process? In a free democracy, taking away people's rights \nis not reform. In Buckley v. Valeo the Supreme Court ruled the debate \nabout campaign finances is about the fundamental role of the people in \nour democratic society. The Court wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S10398]]\n\n\n       In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not \n     government but the people--individually as citizens and \n     candidates and collectively as associations and political \n     committees--who must retain control over the quantity and \n     range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.\n\n  Madam President, the system has not failed us. Campaign dollars are \nnot the problem. They may be the excuse--the system, dollars, may be \nthe excuse for some. But our problems are with ourselves. What outrages \nthe American people is the conduct of some politicians--and my good \nfriend, Senator McCain, talked about this earlier this afternoon when \nhe referenced in the poll the ``lying windbags,'' the lying windbags \nthat many people think of as politicians, and I know that is true. But \nwhat really outrages the American people is the conduct of some \npoliticians and their supporters who have corrupted the system by \nviolating the integrity of the process for their own end.\n  Our political leaders have, as one of their most sacred \nresponsibilities, the responsibility to set the moral tone in America \nand give moral leadership. I do not mean religious leadership. I do not \nmean religious leadership. I mean moral leadership. Moral leadership \ngoes well beyond the rule of law and regulation. Were the great leaders \nof our Nation great because of laws and regulations dictating their \nactions and behavior? No. Our great leaders were great because they had \na moral compass and they shared that moral compass with our people and \nour Nation. And they relied upon that moral compass for governance. \nAmerica deserves leaders who lead through the force of character and \nintegrity, not through the force of regulation and law. Before we \nreform the campaign finance system, we should first look at how we \nmight reform ourselves. We might look at how we might reform ourselves.\n  Madam President, I would like to end my speech this afternoon with a \nquote from Thomas Jefferson, our third President, one of our Nation's \nstrongest defenders of the rights of the American people. Thomas \nJefferson said, many, many years ago:\n       I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of \n     society but the people themselves; and if we think them not \n     enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome \n     discretion, the remedy is surely not to take it from them, \n     but to inform their discretion by education.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, as I mentioned when I was last on the \nfloor, the campaign finance reform bill we are debating will not \nproduce meaningful political reform. The McCain-Feingold proposal will \nnot lead to reform because it leaves the single greatest obstacle to \ncompetitive elections untouched. In fact, it will strengthen the single \ngreatest obstacle to competitive elections. That obstacle is the \nadvantage of incumbency, which is now and always has been the single \ngreatest perk in politics. An incumbent has access to the podium, \naccess to the news media, and the ability to create name \nidentification. Any time you limit political spending, any time you \nlimit what the competitor can generate in terms of information, you \nstrengthen the incumbent.\n  I submit that Hershey doesn't need to advertise that it sells \nchocolate, but a new competitor does. And those who inhabit public \noffice are well-known for the fact that they inhabit it. But new \nindividuals need to have the ability to create that same awareness in \nthe mind of the public.\n  Campaign finance legislation that restricts core political speech \nstrengthens incumbents by limiting the ability of challengers to \nincrease their own name recognition and to highlight the incumbents' \nvoting record on issues of concern to the voters.\n  So, if you say you cannot spend much money against an incumbent, and \nyour supporters can't talk about his or her voting record, then you \ncan't match the incumbent's advantages of being on C-SPAN in the Senate \nChamber, of moving through the news industry with press releases. If \nSenators want true political reform, the answer is to limit terms, not \nto limit speech. Let's limit politicians, not the citizens. We should \nbe talking about limiting the tenure of people in public office, not \nthe first amendment rights of the citizens of this country.\n  To this end, this afternoon, I have filed an amendment to the pending \ncampaign finance reform legislation that would authorize States to \nimpose term limits on their Senators and Representatives. However, my \namendment will not come up for debate or a vote if cloture is invoked \non the McCain-Feingold bill. Accordingly, a vote for cloture on McCain-\nFeingold is a vote against term limits.\n  Let me just review for a second why term limits would provide the \ntrue reform. Incumbency is the real problem in our system. It is the \nsingle greatest perk. Committee assignments and the ability to control \ncommittees relates to incumbency, and committee assignments translate \ninto big bucks. The value of incumbency is as strong or stronger, now \nthat we have had modest reforms over the last several years, than it \nwas before. As a matter of fact, when campaigning was wide open 100 \nyears ago the value of incumbency wasn't anything like what it is now.\n  Madam President, 94 percent of all Members who seek reelection get \nreelected, and an individual challenging them, if limited in what he or \nshe can spend, is at a disadvantage. Madam President, 94 percent is 19 \nout of 20. That means that the only true elections are for open seats.\n  Term limits are a tried and tested kind of reform: Forty one \nGovernors, 20 State legislatures and the U.S. President have term \nlimits. It is time that the Congress be term limited as well.\n  Term limits mean no more politics as usual. As a matter of fact, \nstudies done by research institutes indicate that we would have had the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution long ago if we had term \nlimits, which would have brought new individuals to Washington who \nvoted the way people do in their first two terms in office instead of \nvoting the way they do after they have spent term after term after term \nhere and begin to endorse the bureaucracy and to sanction it and to \nsupport it. I believe we should not limit the amount that citizens can \nspend on politics. We should limit the amount of time politicians can \nspend in Washington.\n\n  I will ask that individuals vote against cloture on the McCain-\nFeingold bill so we would have an opportunity to vote on term limits. A \nvote for cloture on McCain-Feingold will be a vote against term limits. \nA vote against cloture will at least provide us with the opportunity to \nbring forward amendments. Those amendments, including my term limits \namendment, hold the promise of giving us a real opportunity to amend \nand to otherwise change the election procedures for the benefit of the \npeople.\n  The people deserve honest elections. They first deserve enforcement. \nSo much of what is being talked about these days is the violation of \nlaws in existence. We don't need to proliferate the laws in order to \nenforce them. But we do need to give opportunity to individuals who are \nnot a part of the system now. That cannot be done by limiting what they \ncan spend to get known or limiting what their supporters can spend to \nexpose the record of those who are in office. But it can be given to \nthem if we decide America has enough talent to allow it to circulate \nindividuals through the Senate and the House, and by term limits, to \nsay that no individual should be a lifetime occupant here, that we \nshould give individuals an opportunity to seek election and that is the \nkind of campaign reform which will really benefit America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, is there any limitation on speaking at \nthis point? What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is none.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me speak for a few minutes, then, \non campaign finance reform. I would like to step back from the details \nof the debate. There has been some debate about limiting spending: \nShould we limit spending or not, should we ban soft money or not, \nshould we regulate phony issue advocacy ads or not, should we provide \nmore power to the Federal Election Commission or not--those are the \nkinds of questions we debate here. But I believe this entire discussion \nabout campaign finance reform\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\nis about one central question and that is what should determine the \noutcome of our Federal elections? Should we allow money to determine \nthe outcome of our Federal elections? Or should we allow, or try to get \nto a situation, where a complete and a balanced discussion of the \ndifferences between the candidates determines the outcome of the \nelection? Should we allow money or helpful information to change the \nminds of voters? And should we allow money or robust debate to \ndetermine who wins the race?\n  This fundamental issue, which I think is at the center of campaign \nfinance reform, has been obscured because opponents of campaign finance \nreform have been hiding behind what I believe are mistaken Supreme \nCourt opinions that have tried to equate money and speech. They argue \nthat money is speech, and, therefore, to limit money is to limit \nspeech. They say that money is robust debate. They say money is helpful \ninformation for voters. And they even say that money is or constitutes \na complete and a balanced discussion about the differences between \ncandidates.\n  In my view this argument is blatantly wrong. To any reasoned observer \nof our Federal campaigns, the argument obviously is without merit. Ask \nany challenger to an incumbent Senator if the millions of dollars that \nan incumbent is able to raise and spend in the race has meant more \nrobust debate, more helpful information for the voters, more complete \nand valuable discussions about the difference between the candidate and \nthe challenger?\n  The challenger will laugh out loud at the question.\n  My colleague said, to limit spending in campaigns is to assist \nincumbents because you have a lot of challengers out there who would \nlike to be able to spend more than incumbents to challenge them and to \nget their message out and they are not able to do so. Madam President, \nthat may be true for a very few rich individuals who have very \nsubstantial private wealth that they can put into races. But for an \naverage candidate for public office in this country, your ability to \nraise large sums of money and compete in the media and buy the air time \nis directly dependent upon your incumbency. Accordingly, a challenger \nis at a very substantial disadvantage unless we somehow restrict or \ncontrol the amount of money coming into this process.\n  Ask any voter who has been deluged with negative TV ads, funded by \nswelling campaign war chests, whether those TV ads have produced a more \nrobust debate and provided more helpful information to the voters, or a \nmore complete and balanced discussion of the differences between the \ncandidates? They would think that you were crazy to suggest that those \n30-second negative TV spots in fact improve their ability to make a \nreasoned judgment.\n  No, the vast increases in money spent in political campaigns have not \nproduced more robust debate, they have not produced more helpful \ninformation for voters, or more complete and balanced discussions about \nthe differences between candidates. This increased amount of money has \nmeant the very opposite. In fact, voters will tell you not only that \nmoney does not equal speech, but that excessive campaign money does \nequal the erosion and the undermining of our political system.\n  To them, money means bad government. To them, money is not speech; \nmoney is the corruption of the system. The American people are very \nspecific in their beliefs about this, Madam President. Voters surveyed \nrecently by the Princeton Survey Associates tell us exactly what the \npublic thinks:\n  55 percent of the public think that campaign money gives one group \nmore influence by keeping other groups from having their say in policy \noutcomes;\n  50 percent think that campaign money gets some people appointed to \ngovernment office who would not otherwise be considered;\n  48 percent think that campaign money keeps important legislation from \nbeing passed in the Senate and in the House of Representatives;\n  45 percent think that campaign money leads elected officials to \nsupport policies that even those elected officials don't think are best \nfor the country;\n  41 percent think that campaign money even leads elected officials to \nvote against the interests of the constituents who sent them to \nWashington;\n  63 percent of the public think that campaign money leads elected \nofficials to spend too much time fundraising;\n  And, finally, 52 percent think that money, and not speech, determines \nthe outcome of elections under our current system.\n  Madam President, it is hard to argue with the public's view on these \nvarious points. I submit that the arguments by opponents of campaign \nfinance reform, that money is speech, should not and fortunately does \nnot pass the laugh test with the American people.\n  The people are right, that we desperately need to reform the campaign \nsystem. In fact, they are right that we need to do a full U-turn from \nwhere we are today. We need to reduce the amount of money raised and \nspent in campaigns. We need to increase the amount of robust debate, \nproviding really helpful information to voters. We need to increase the \namount of complete and balanced discussions about the differences \nbetween candidates so the public has good information.\n  Even the modified McCain-Feingold campaign reform bill is a big step \nin the right direction. It does at least two very important things. \nFirst, it will reduce the amount of big unregulated donations from \ncorporations and unions and wealthy individuals in our campaigns, and \nthat is good. We need to reduce that. And second, it will regulate the \nhuge amounts of money spent by so-called independent special interest \ngroups on advertising that they disguise as issue ads but are, in fact, \ndesigned to advocate the defeat of a particular camp.\n  The original McCain-Feingold bill did much more. There were more \naffirmative proposals to actually encourage more robust debate, more \nhelpful information for the voters, more complete and balanced \ndiscussions of the differences between the candidates, but the bill had \nto be scaled back to reduce the objections of some of the opponents of \ncampaign finance reform. This modified version of the bill that we now \nhave before us does not complete the U-turn that we ought to be making, \nbut it is turning the car in the right direction.\n  Madam President, I stand ready to support the modified version of \nMcCain-Feingold. I hope we will have an opportunity at some point in \nthe near future, and hopefully this week, to have an up-or-down vote on \nthe bill. Perhaps at some point we can get past these parliamentary \nmaneuvers of killer amendments, of filling out the amendment tree, \nsecond-degree amendments to block an up-or-down vote. Perhaps at some \npoint in the near future the opponents of campaign finance reform will \nlisten to the people and conclude that money is not speech, that money, \nin fact, is undermining the political system that we were sent here to \nhelp ensure the functioning of.\n  I hope we will move expeditiously this week to pass campaign finance \nreform. Our constituents desire it, and we should do it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there has been a development today \nthat has a direct bearing on this debate that I thought would be of \ninterest to our colleagues and particularly the occupant of the chair.\n  The Supreme Court today denied cert and, therefore, refused to \noverturn a first circuit decision, in effect confirming a district \ncourt decision, specifically ruling unconstitutional, once again, most \nof the issue advocacy language in the McCain-Feingold bill which we \nhave before us. The similarities are noteworthy. Two of the three \ncategories of restrictions on issue advocacy in McCain-Feingold read as \nfollows. As we all know, the courts have been very clear for 21 years \nthat you are free to go out and express your views about any of us as \noften as you want to, in any way that you want to, as long as you don't \nsay certain things like ``vote for'' or ``vote against.'' That does not \nfall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Election Commission. That \ngroup does not have to answer to a Federal agency in order to criticize \nus. The Federal Election Commission, as\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\nwe all know, doesn't like that. So they have issued regulations seeking \nto change by regulation previous Court decisions on what is or what is \nnot issue advocacy.\n\n  In those regulations, which are remarkably similar to two of the \nthree sections in McCain-Feingold dealing with issue advocacy, the \nsimilarities are noteworthy.\n  In the McCain-Feingold bill, the following words are used, and the \nwords mean this in the bill, as I understand it, that if any of these \nthings happen, the group would fall under the Federal Election \nCommission and be subject to their jurisdiction. In addition to the \nbright line test that the Supreme Court has already laid down, the bill \nwould seek to add to that the following:\n\n       . . . or a campaign slogan or words that in context can \n     have no reasonable meaning other than to advocate the \n     election or defeat of one or more clearly identified \n     candidates.\n\n  Madam President, that is part of the language in the underlying bill.\n  Other language in the underlying bill remarkably similar to the FEC \nregulations struck down by the Supreme Court today read as follows:\n\n       . . . expressing unmistakable and unambiguous support for, \n     or in opposition to, one or more clearly identified \n     candidates when taken as a whole and with limited reference \n     to external events, such as proximity to an election.\n\n  What the underlying bill is seeking to do is to outline a series of \ncircumstances under which a group would fall within the jurisdiction of \nthe Federal Election Commission. Currently, they are outside of that \njurisdiction unless they say ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' tests \nwhich the Supreme Court laid down 21 years ago and has never changed.\n  That was the language from McCain-Feingold. Let me now read the \nlanguage out of the FEC regulations which were struck down by the \nSupreme Court today:\n\n       . . . more communications of campaign slogans or individual \n     words which in context can have no other reasonable meaning \n     than to urge the election or defeat of a candidate.\n\n  Further language from the proposed FEC regulations which were struck \ndown by the Supreme Court:\n\n       . . . when taken as a whole and with limited reference to \n     external events, such as the proximity to the election, could \n     only be interpreted by a reasonable person as containing \n     advocacy of the election or defeat of one or more candidates.\n\n  Further from the FEC regulations struck down by the Supreme Court \ntoday:\n\n       The electoral portion of the communication is unmistakable, \n     unambiguous and suggestive of only one meaning.\n\n  Madam President, there is a remarkable similarity between the \nlanguage struck down by the Supreme Court today and the language of two \nof three of the sections in the McCain-Feingold bill which seek to \nredefine by statute what happens in an issue advocacy campaign. This is \nan important new development.\n  We have had a lot of discussion on the floor of the Senate over the \nlast week and a half about what is and isn't constitutional. It has \nbeen suggested that there are 126 constitutional scholars out there who \nare certifying, in effect, that these new restrictions on issue \nadvocacy are, in fact, constitutional. That has been asserted by some \nof our colleagues, even though there have been a whole line of Supreme \nCourt decisions before the one today reiterating that they crafted this \nthe way they did on purpose; it was not an accident. The Supreme Court \nwanted to have the widest latitude possible for organizations to \ncriticize us, and there is no indication that they intended that \ncriticism to necessarily be evaded just because it was in proximity to \nan election.\n  There is no language on the 60-day test, which is the third provision \nof the McCain-Feingold bill. Frankly, that is sort of a new item. The \nFEC has not yet tried that. But if you look at that language and look \nat the fact that the Court has confirmed time and time and time again \nthat it meant what it said it did with regard to issue advocacy, I \ndon't think it is much of a stretch to predict that, if the Court is \ngoing to strike down language almost the same as two of the three \nsections in McCain-Feingold seeking to make it difficult for groups to \ncriticize us, they would be very likely to strike down the third, which \nmakes it impossible effectively for them to criticize us without \nbecoming a federally registered committee in the last 60 days of an \nelection.\n  As I said--I see my colleague from Washington on his feet--we can \ndiscuss as long as we want to what is and isn't constitutional. The \nfinal word on that is the U.S. Supreme Court, and they just spoke again \ntoday on the very subject that we have been discussing on the floor of \nthe Senate in the last week and a half. I think it is a very important \nadditional indication that the Court, in spite of all the prodding of \nthe Federal Election Commission to set up a new standard for issue \nadvocacy, the Court has absolutely no intention of changing its mind. \nIt has been absolutely, unequivocally consistent for 21 years as to \nwhat you would have to put in an advertisement to be brought within the \nFederal Election Campaign Act and thereby covered by the FEC.\n  Here is what the Court said back in Buckley--and it has had many \nopportunities to revisit that, it hasn't changed its mind over the \nyears, didn't change its mind again today--this is what the Court said. \nFor a communication by a group to fall within the Federal Election \nCampaign Act, you would have to have express words of advocacy of \nelection or defeat, such as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``support,'' \n``cast your ballot for,'' ``Smith for Congress,'' ``vote against,'' \n``defeat'' or ``reject.''\n  They have had 21 years to revisit that standard, 21 years to decide \nthe Federal Election Commission knew better than the courts about how \nto craft this language, 21 years to change its mind, new judges coming \nonto the bench and old judges leaving, and the Court has never changed \nits mind, up to and including today when it refused to grant certiorari \non a lower court decision, in effect upholding the same language that \nhas been on the books since 1976.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is an important addition to the \ndebate. I hope that Senators will note that the Supreme Court is not of \na mind to change its opinion on issue advocacy versus express advocacy, \none of the important issues that we have been debating here in the \ncontext of the proposed McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. GORTON. He would.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, is there any order of sequence on the \nspeaking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1974, impelled by certain individuals \nand groups who felt that too much money was being spent on political \ncampaigns and on political speech, the Congress of the United States \npassed a law limiting the amount of money that a candidate for Federal \noffice could receive from any individual source, and limiting the \namount of money that a candidate for a Federal office could spend \nadvocating his or her election to that office.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the half of that \nstatute that limited the amount of money that a candidate could seek \nfrom any given individual or organization or group; but about the \nproposition that a candidate could be limited in the amount of money \nthat he or she could spend on a campaign, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States made this statement--and I quote\n\n       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting \n     the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \n     exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is \n     because virtually every means of communicating ideas in \n     today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. The \n     distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails \n     printing, paper and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies \n     generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the \n     event. The electorate's increasing dependence on television, \n     radio, and other mass media for news and information has made \n     these expensive modes of communication indispensable \n     instruments of effective political speech. Being free to \n     engage in unlimited political expression subject to a ceiling \n     on expenditures is like being free to drive an automobile as \n     far and as often as one desires on a single tank of gasoline.\n\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\n\n  And the Supreme Court of the United States found invalid, as a \nviolation of the fundamental first amendment right of free expression, \nany such limitation.\n  The same mindset that gave us those laws and that has forced those \nindividuals or groups who feel vitally interested in the election or \ndefeat of a candidate to spend money in other ways, often through the \npolitical parties that sponsor those candidates, now has brought this \nMcCain-Feingold bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Finding it ineffective simply to limit the amount of money that \ncandidates can collect from a given individual, the bill now seeks to \nlimit severely the amount of money that political parties can collect \nwith which to express their message to the American people. The fact \nthat this flies in the face of most thoughtful academics observing the \npolitical scene in the United States who call for greater party \nresponsibility and a greater role for political parties to play in \norder to create a greater degree of responsibility and responsiveness \nin carrying out the will of the people as expressed in elections, the \nMcCain-Feingold bill seeks to tie the hands of parties and to render \nthem largely ineffective.\n  The sponsors of the bill do recognize, however, that there are other \nmethods of communicating political ideas. While they did not attempt to \nlimit the right of other individuals or organizations in communicating \ntheir ideas directly, and in some cases not at all, they do attempt, as \nthe Senator from Kentucky has just pointed out, to take a form of \ncommunication called issue advocacy--that is to say, making your views \nknown to the people of the United States with respect to issues that \ncome before the Congress of the United States--and force it into a \ncategory which they define as express advocacy, essentially whenever \nthe name of a candidate or a Government officeholder is used, and once \nagain provide limitations on the amount of money that can be collected \nfor the expression of that form of advocacy.\n\n  As the Senator from Kentucky has so clearly pointed out, not only is \nthat portion of the McCain-Feingold bill unconstitutional on the basis \nof a long line of Supreme Court decisions, its unconstitutionality was \nreaffirmed this morning, this very morning by the refusal of the \nSupreme Court even to listen to a challenge to a first circuit decision \non exactly that subject.\n  So what we have in McCain-Feingold is, in addition to the limitation \non the amount of money that can be spent or contributed to individual \ncandidates, an additional limitation on the amount that can be \ncontributed to political parties, but no limitation at all on the \namount of money that can be spent independently of those political \nparties by the widest range of groups and individuals in the United \nStates who have a vital interest in the actions of this Congress unless \nthose groups make a mistake which is absolutely unnecessary to make and \nuse one of a handful of magic words.\n  Finally, of course, McCain-Feingold does not attempt in any respect \nwhatsoever to limit the commentary, either in news columns or on \neditorial pages, on the part of the newspapers in the United States or \nsimilar commentary on radio and television stations. It isn't long, \nhowever, since exactly such a set of potential restrictions were \nproposed.\n  With a degree of intellectual honesty, absent from this debate, in \nFebruary and March of this year many of those who are here today \npromoting the McCain-Feingold bill recognized that the goals they \nsought were blatantly violative of the first amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States and proposed to amend the first \namendment.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I think it not at all inappropriate \nonce again to read into the Record what those Senators--I think some \n30-plus of them altogether in the final vote--proposed to do to the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution of the United States. They proposed \nto say:\n\n       Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on the \n     amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the \n     amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or \n     in opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, \n     or for election to, Federal office.\n\n  It seems clear to me, Mr. President, that that constitutional \namendment, were it placed in the Constitution of the United States, \nwould have permitted Congress to state that the New York Times, or a \nnewspaper in a city of 50,000 people in a city in Kentucky, could have \nits commentary on election campaigns limited in the same way that the \npresent law limits contributions to candidates today.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think a newspaper--I will take one of my own--\nsay the Tri City Herald in central Washington, with a circulation of \nsome 40,000 newspapers a day, if it writes an editorial in favor of my \ncandidacy, which I am pleased to say that it has, and distributes \n40,000 copies of that newspaper, it has exceeded that $1,000 campaign \ncontribution limit if the cost of writing and printing and distributing \nthat newspaper exceeded 2.5 cents a copy.\n  Lord knows by how much the New York Times would exceed that \ncontribution by making any kind of commentary on behalf of or in \nopposition to a candidate for political office. Lord knows how much \nmore such a commentary on network television news could be considered \nto be worth.\n  Yet, Mr. President, at least the proponents of that constitutional \namendment were being intellectually honest and at least they were being \nconsistent, or would have been consistent had they been willing to say \nthey wanted to limit the way newspapers and radio stations and \ntelevision stations could comment on politics, because, obviously, if \nevery other form of communication is going to be limited, how in the \nworld can we justify letting those few people in the United States with \nenough money to own the newspapers or having the good fortune to be on \ntheir editorial boards and, for that matter, to write news stories \nabout politics not be limited? Of course they should.\n  But, Mr. President, the first amendment was written not when we had \ntelevision or radio stations, but when we had thousands of newspapers \nin the United States of America, most of them speaking much more \nsharply about candidates and issues than do newspapers today. And the \nmen who wrote the first amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates knew that every one of those newspaper publishers had a greater \nfirst amendment right by the definition used by the promoters of \nMcCain-Feingold than did the average citizen who did not own or write \nfor a newspaper. But they consider that right of mass communication \nabout political ideas to be a fundamental liberty of the people of the \nUnited States. Now we have opponents of this bill who say it is not \nonly not a fundamental liberty of the United States; it is such a great \nevil that we need effectively to muzzle them.\n\n  Hark back to the Supreme Court in which the Supreme Court says \nvirtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society \nrequire the expenditure of money. We have proponents who say we should \nnot allow the expenditure of money in amounts that are sufficient to \ncommunicate those ideas.\n  Having limited the amount of money candidates can get, they now wish \nto limit the amount of money political parties can get. It is clear \nthey wish to limit the amount of money that these independent groups \ncan get, but in the absence of their constitutional amendment, they \ncan't do that.\n  Now, last year, Mr. President, I asked this question: Were the \nexpenditures of candidates or of political parties or of third party \ninterest groups the least responsible? The answer, obviously, is the \nlatter. A candidate whose name must go on all political communications \ncan be immediately called to account for falsehood and, in fact, can \nreadily be called to account even for what is considered to be an \nunfair characterization of his or her own candidacy or an unfair \ncriticism of an opponent. Expenditures by political parties don't carry \nthat same degree of responsibility. The occupant of the chair at the \npresent time is not really responsible for the communications of the \nKansas State Republican Party, nor am I in my political party in my \nState. We will catch a certain degree of criticism for what our parties \ndo, but we at least have plausible deniability. But now having forced \neven the parties\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\nout of the field of effective communication, we leave all political \ncommunication to the newspapers and the television stations and those \norganizations, whether they are of the left or the right or of a narrow \nspecial interest, almost wholly to the field of unregulated \ncommunication for which neither beneficiaries have any responsibility \nnor the victims any effective way of responding.\n  The Senator from Oregon, during the course of this debate, has \npointed out the impact of a law very much like the one that we are \ndiscussing here on politics in Oregon. There the limitations on \ncontributions for candidates were even tighter. The point that he made \nof what happens in the real world was the candidates can't raise very \nmuch money, the political parties are fairly weak, so campaigning \nbecame more negative than it had ever been before--not only more \nnegative because of the use of the undocumented constitutional rights \nof these outside groups to criticize, but from the fact that almost all \nof their communication was critical and negative in nature, and the \nlimitations on the candidates made it effectively impossible for them \nto answer.\n  My own State, Mr. President, is going through pretty much the same \nexperience. The more the limitations on the candidates, the greater the \nexpenditure of money independently in so-called issue advocacy will be, \nand the more negative political communication will be, as it was in the \nclassic example of the tens of millions of dollars spent by the labor \nunions in 1995 and in 1996.\n  Now, Mr. President, one other point, and I will have to admit, along \nwith everyone else who has spoken today, almost everything that has \nbeen said today has been with respect to the revised McCain-Feingold \nbill. The issue before the Senate, however, is the Lott-Nickles \namendment. The same analysis does not attain to the Lott-Nickles \namendment because it simply says that labor unions and labor union-type \norganizations, while they remain entirely unlimited in the way in which \nthey can spend their money, and with respect to issue advocacy, can \nonly be involved in politics by the use of money to the extent that \nthere are members who have paid dues into those unions who allow their \nmoney to be spent in such a fashion.\n  It is curious in the mind of this Senator that such an obviously just \npolicy--not allowing my money, your money or anyone else's money to be \nused to communicate ideas with which you or I or that third party \ndisagrees, a proposition that is clearly constitutional--should be \nconsidered to be a poison pill or the death knell for campaign reform. \nWhat could be more fundamental, Mr. President, than the idea that the \nindividual whose money is being spent in connection with the \ncommunication of political ideas should have some control over how that \nmoney is spent?\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I am in a position to tell you how that works in \npractice because another element of one of the latest of the campaign \nreforms in the State of Washington was to make just such a provision. \nWhen that provision became law, 80 percent or more of the members of \nthe Washington Education Association, the teacher's union, refused to \nallow their money to be used in politics at all. I have just heard, \nthough I can't be entirely certain of this statistic with respect to \nother labor unions, the percentage of members who are willing to permit \ntheir money to be used is in single digits. Presumably, the members of \nthose organizations prefer their money to be used for the primary \nfunction of a union with collective bargaining rights and not even on \npolitics with which they agree, much less politics with which they \ndisagree.\n  That, Mr. President, is the reason the opposition to this amendment \nis so fierce. That is the reason we are told most of the proponents of \nMcCain-Feingold will filibuster this very bill if it is included. It is \njust because the opposition on the part of members of these \norganizations to spending their money in the way in which it has been \nspent over the last several years is so deep, so broad, and so fierce.\n  But in this case, I want to state once again, Mr. President, we are \nnot talking about a matter over which there could be any serious \nconstitutional challenge at all. We are simply talking about whether or \nnot it is good policy. We are talking about something that would meet \nthe goals of McCain-Feingold to the extent that their goals are to \nlimit the amount of money being spent on political speech. It would \ncertainly limit it in connection with the last campaign.\n  Now, I am not convinced of the case that we are spending too much \nmoney on political speech. I believe the wide diffusion of political \nideas was exactly what the first Congress of the United States had in \nmind when it passed the first amendment. However, if you are going to \nlimit political speech, you ought to do so fairly and across the board. \nTo do so fairly and across the board, you must gut the first amendment \nto the United States, you must change the Constitution, and you must \nsay we are going to have Government--Members of this body and the \nappointed Federal Election Commission--decide what speech in the \npolitical context is legitimate and what speech is not, and the \ndefinition of that challenge is its own death knell because, defined in \nthat fashion, there aren't 5 percent of the American people who would \nagree.\n  We have before the Senate, Mr. President, a flawed bill with a flawed \nand unconstitutional goal, together with the breathtaking statement \nthat should we make the fundamental requirement that a man or woman's \nmoney not be spent on politics with which he or she disagrees, that we \nare killing this flawed proposal.\n  Well, I don't think the bill becomes any more constitutional by the \nadoption of the Lott-Nickles amendment. I don't believe the obvious \nconstitutional flaws reiterated once again today by the Supreme Court \nof the United States are improved by it. Abstract fairness probably is. \nBut a bill that says that there is something wrong with the \ncommunication of ideas--the last Democratic speaker criticized the way \nin which campaigns were conducted, apparently feeling that maybe we \nought to have a governmental entity that says what an individual says \nin a political campaign is fair or unfair. We have created the greatest \nand strongest democracy in history and the greatest debate over \npolitical ideas with the first amendment as it is. I, for one, believe \nwe ought to leave it alone.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As the Senator from Washington pointed out, today's \nhuge news that the Supreme Court has struck down essentially most of \nthe issue advocacy language in the McCain-Feingold bill, maybe we \nshouldn't waste our time talking about this. But if you look at the \noriginal bill, it was designed to shut down campaigns, shut down \nparties, and shut down issue advocacy, and the Senator from Washington \npointed out the only entity exempt from this would have been the press \nwhich enjoys a specific exemption under the Federal Election Campaign \nAct.\n  In fact, I have it here for our viewers if they want to look, section \n431(9)(B), subsection 1:\n\n       Any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed \n     through the facilities of any broadcasting station, \n     newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless \n     such facilities are owned or controlled by any political \n     party, political committee, or candidate;\n\n  In other words, a blanket exemption for the press that no one else \nwould enjoy.\n  I say to my colleague from Washington, just to ask a question, \nWestinghouse owns CBS, Disney owns ABC, and GE owns NBC. Now, these big \ncorporate giants in America will, through the ownership of these \ntelevision broadcast networks, enjoy a total exemption from all the \nrestrictions that would be placed on the political speech of everybody \nelse. This is not an unrealistic hypothetical. We just saw Ted Turner, \nwho used to control CNN, declare on Friday he would not sell ads to a \ncertain group because he did not like what they were saying.\n  So I ask my friend from Washington if he could speculate with me for \na moment the mischief that might be created by the ownership of the \nonly exempt avenue to engage in free and unfettered political \nexpression without the heavy hands of the Federal Government, what kind \nof mischief he might imagine could happen in our country?\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. It would certainly increase the price of television \nstations and television networks. It would be a bonanza to those \ncorporate owners, as any other corporation that had a political agenda \nwould find the only way it could effectively communicate its ideas \nwould be through the ownership of a television network or a major \nmetropolitan newspaper and the like.\n  But the point made by the Senator from Kentucky is a most interesting \none. Westinghouse and Disney and GE don't need to give soft money to \nparties, do they? They don't need to come up with their political ideas \nindirectly. They have the ability to communicate them directly, without \ncontrol, without limitation as to amount, to the people of the United \nStates. So the Senator from Kentucky has made my own point better than \nI did myself. If you are going to limit political speech effectively, \nyou are going to have to limit everyone's political speech. And the \nfewer the exemptions from those limitations, the more valuable those \nunlimited mouthpieces are because they cannot effectively be countered, \nexcept by someone else with the exemption.\n  I want to repeat one more time that I believe the constitutional \namendment that was seriously debated, but defeated, on the floor of \nthis Senate in March would have permitted limitations on what those \ntelevision networks could have done, what the New York Times and every \nnewspaper in the United States could have done. And it is the very fact \nthat that constitutional amendment would have allowed such limitations \nthat is the reason it should not have gotten one-third of the votes of \nthe Members of this body. It should not have gotten any at all.\n  Once, however, you determine that we should continue the more than \n200 years of unrestricted freedom on the part of the mass media, it \nbecomes increasingly difficult to justify the proposition that we \nshould limit the ability to communicate of everyone else.\n  As the Supreme Court decided more than 20 years ago, the ability to \nuse money and to use, in turn, the mass media is at the very heart of \nthe first amendment rights. The Senator from Nebraska, who was here \nbefore, it seemed to me, had the appropriate answer to this question. \nPolitical contributions should be freely given, not coerced. They \nshould be immediately publicized and made available. Those who violate \nthose laws of disclosure ought to be appropriately punished. None of \nthese elements is a part of the law today, and that is where reform \nought to start.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, I want to take a few minutes and \nlet my views be known concerning campaign finance reform. First, I want \nto commend my colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin. It is not easy to \nintroduce legislation that you know will be adamantly opposed from the \noutset. I recognize this and I want to congratulate them. Second, I \nwant to commend the Senator from Kentucky, who on more than one \noccasion has stood on this floor and took an unpopular stand against \npopular legislation for all the right reasons.\n  Mr. President, I have always been a strong advocate of congressional \nreform, even to the point of introducing legislation that has upset \nmany of my colleagues. I have always believed that congressional reform \nshould make Congress more like the people we represent not above them. \nThat is why I have long been a supporter of term limits, which I \nbelieve would be one of the best campaign finance reform measures we \ncould ever enact.\n  Campaign finance reform should give every American the opportunity to \nparticipate, as fully or as little as they want. This country's \nprinciples are based on freedom. People should have the ability to \nchoose whether they want to participate in the system. We cannot and \nshould not coerce or force citizens participation in this process. Nor \nshould we stifle citizens participation in the electoral process. I do \nnot believe that this quick fix of McCain-Feingold passes either one of \nthese tests.\n  First, I do not believe this legislation protects the working men and \nwomen in this country. Our electoral system is a voluntary activity. \nThe U.S. Congress should never force participation in a voluntary \nactivity, whether through individual activity or through financial \ncontributions. This is why I believe the Lott amendment is so important \nfor any campaign finance reform legislation. I would never do anything \nto stop outside groups from participating in the system, I just ask \nthat all activity be voluntary. I would never force anyone to support \nme by either their vote or through a contribution if they disagreed \nwith my views and I believe this should apply across the board to any \ngroup involved in our political system.\n  I have heard complaints that the Lott amendment would weaken the \nunion's power and hurt the union membership. If the political positions \nof the union bosses are supported like they believe they are by the \nmembership, then there should be no problem whatsoever for the unions \nto stay strong. But, if the unions' Washington office takes positions \nthat are contrary to its membership, then maybe they need to rethink \ntheir ways.\n  Also, a provision that is forgotten by many who oppose the Lott \namendment is that it also applies to corporations and national banks. \nThe amendment makes it unlawful for any corporation or national bank to \ncollect from or assess its stockholders any dues, initiation fee, or \nother payment as a condition of employment if such dues, fee or payment \nwill be used for political activity in which the national bank or \ncorporation is engaged. Likewise, a labor organization cannot collect \nor assess its members or nonmembers any dues, initiation fee, or other \npayment if any part of such dues, fee, or payments will be used for \npolitical activities.\n\n  I think this amendment is very clear, no matter where you work, you \nshould not have to choose between putting food on the table for your \nfamily or participating in an election or supporting an election. Let's \nmake it very clear, the people who do not support this amendment \nbelieve that working men and women, union or not, should have to choose \nbetween working or supporting issues and elections with which they \ndisagree.\n  I have also heard that being a union member is voluntary and one of \nthe most democratic institutions since employees must vote to start a \nunion, elect its leaders and if they do not like the direction the \nunion is taking then they can work to change it or as a last resort, \nquit the union. If you do not like the direction of the union, you must \nquit your job as a last resort. I do not think any union member should \nhave to make that choice--a job or a political contribution. This same \nprovision applies to corporations and national banks. No employee \nshould have to choose between keeping their job or participating \nfinancially to causes or elections they disagree with.\n  Some want to apply this amendment to groups such as the NRA or the \nSierra Club or other issue groups. The difference between these groups \nand the employment condition in the Lott amendment is that joining \nthese groups is completely voluntary and is not tied to a job. If a \nmember of one of these issue groups wants to quit their respective \ngroup, then they just stop paying the dues and rip up the card. There \nis no employment backlash that causes that person to lose their job.\n  Thomas Jefferson summed it up best when he said, ``To compel a man to \nfurnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he \ndisbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.''\n  Second, in our quest of campaign finance reform, American citizens \nshould not have to lose their voice. The first amendment is very clear \nin its wording, ``Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the \nfreedom of speech or the press * * *.'' While campaign finance reform \nefforts are based on the best of intentions, whether by legislation or \njust simple suggestions, most of the time they will affect individuals' \nfirst-amendment rights.\n  The Supreme Court has been very clear where it stands on the first \namendment and campaign finance laws. Since the post-Watergate changes \nto the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 24 congressional actions \nhave been declared unconstitutional, with 9 rejections based on the \nfirst amendment. Out of those nine, four dealt directly with campaign \nfinance reform laws. In each case, the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\nhas ruled that political spending equals political speech. This Senate \nattempted to change this through a constitutional amendment limiting \nthe amount one can spend in a campaign, which only tells me that this \nfact is undeniably recognized by this body.\n  In the now famous, or infamous to some, Buckley versus Valeo case, \nthe Court states that:\n\n       The First Amendment denies government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views \n     is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society \n     ordained by our Constitution it is not the government, but \n     the people--individually as citizens and candidates and \n     collectively as associations and political committees--who \n     must retain control over the quantity and range of debate \n     on public issues in a political campaign.\n\n  This simply states that the Government may not ration or regulate \npolitical speech of a citizen through spending limits or limit its \nquantity any more than it can tell the local newspaper how many papers \nit can print, what it can print, or when it can print.\n  Also, the court states that `` * * * the mere growth in the cost of \nFederal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis for \ngovernmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending * * * \n.'' This goes for not just the candidate but also outside groups who \nwant to participate in the process.\n  That brings me to a specific provision in the legislation before us. \nI have yet to hear what makes 60 days such a magic number. How can an \noutside issue group's ad carry a valid message 61 days before an \nelection but if run the next day, it would lose all validity and become \nillegal. This just makes little sense. When I ran for this seat in the \nSenate, I was blasted from all angles by many different groups, but \nthat's fine. It made my life and campaign a little more difficult, but \nit let me explain why I voted the way I did. These groups brought all \nthe issues into play and no candidate can hide their record from the \npublic.\n  However, no matter how I have to defend my record against these ads, \nI will never attempt to legislatively silence their voice. To do so \nwould place myself over the rest of America. I cannot support the idea \nthat my viewpoint is so much more important, that no one outside of the \ncandidate can speak less than 60 days before the election. I cannot and \nwill not quiet the electorate.\n  I did forget one exception during the 60-day blackout, the media. \nThis 60-day blackout only strengthens the media and whatever they say, \ncannot be challenged, except by the candidate. Today, newspaper \nendorsements are held off until the end of the campaign to maximize \ntheir effect, but this 60-day blackout period will let the endorsement \ngo without criticism from outside groups. And I question whether once a \ncandidate gets an endorsement, if their campaign will be covered with \nthe same amount of scrutiny as the other candidate, for again, any \nrebuttal to their coverage can only come from the candidates opponent.\n  I believe this provision places too much power in the hands of a few. \nI have the utmost respect for the media and the professionals who work \nfor in the field, but too much of one gets too powerful for all.\n  Also, I believe this 60 day blackout will be used to remove Congress \nfrom the close scrutiny of the public. Let me explain. I am afraid that \nCongress will hold off some of the more controversial issues until the \nlast 60 days before an election in order to escape the scrutiny of \nthese outside groups. This regulation is nothing more than politicians \nwanting to quiet citizens from bringing up issues that politicians want \nto ignore.\n  Another problem arises regarding soft money. The definition of soft \nmoney is campaign money raised outside the regulatory structure for \nFederal elections--or non-Federal money. These funds are raised and \nspent by political parties outside of the Federal fundraising \nlimitations to benefit the party's State and local elections efforts. \nWhile soft money is not federally regulated, it is regulated by the 50 \nStates. Current law already bans the use of soft money in Federal \nelections. Basically, a complete ban on the ability of the parties to \nraise and spend any soft money would federalize all elections because \nany money given to the national parties in support of state and local \ncandidates would fall under the stricture of Federal laws.\n  The Buckley case clearly states that ``[S]o long as persons and \ngroups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the election \nor defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as \nmuch as they want to promote the candidate and his views.'' The ACLU \nsays that ``the purpose of this profound distinction is to keep \ncampaign finance regulations from overwhelming all political and public \nspeech. And it is this distinction which defenders of the \nconstitutionality of a ban on soft money continue to disregard.''\n  The Court has permitted the unrestricted use of soft money by \npolitical parties and nonparty organizations in the Buckley decision \nand has enhanced and given it legitimacy in its subsequent decisions, \nincluding a decision involving the Republican Party from my own State \nof Colorado in 1996.\n  Let me also make a point about money being the determining factor in \nelections. In my Senate race, I was outspent by almost $750,000--a \nquarter of $1 million. You don't have to have the most money to win, \nyou just have to have the right message and I will not legislatively \ntry and stop someone from speaking their message during a campaign, not \neven my opponent's.\n  Many believe that now is the right time to pass a restrictive \ncampaign finance measure with all the scandal surrounding the last \nPresidential campaign and that we should take a chance on the Supreme \nCourt to rule it constitutional. The problem with this logic is that \nsince 1976, the Supreme Court has referred to the Buckley decision over \n100 times in setting limits on the Government's authority to regulate \npolitical speech. I just cannot see this Supreme Court overturning a \nruling that has become the landmark decision and reference point for \nall campaign finance decisions.\n\n  In the end, our campaign finance system needs to be fixed, but any \nreform must not run counter to the first amendment. The first amendment \nensures that even if we don't like what someone says, they have the \nright to say it. While many believe that the amount of money being \nspent in campaigns is objectionable, the Court has clearly stated that \ncampaign spending is equal to speech and no matter how objectionable, \nit is protected under the first amendment.\n  I will have to say that the McCain-Feingold bill has gotten organized \nefforts behind it, like this ad run in the Denver Post on Thursday, \nOctober 2, by the group Campaign for America. However I would like to \npoint out a few things.\n  I find some great irony in this ad. First, if McCain-Feingold passes \nand this ad was to be aired on TV or radio, it may just be illegal, \nespecially if it is within the 60-day blackout period before an \nelection. If an incumbent believes this ad to be an attempt to \ninfluence an election, they can challenge it, thus stifling debate. The \nvery message they wish to send could be stopped by the legislation they \nsupport. That is the point I would like to make.\n  They want to stop big money and big guys with their big bucks from \nbuying the system, which I want to do also by the way. Well, this group \nis backed by the some of the richest people in America. Actually, two \nof the men are on the Forbes 400 list. Plus, many of them have given \nhundreds of thousands of dollars to each party. It seems to me that \nthis group is a bunch of rich guys using their big bucks to buy \nlegislation. And, despite my request, I have yet to receive a full \ndisclosure from this group on how much is spent, who gives and how \nmuch. All I know is who sits on their board of directors.\n  But in all honesty, I cannot in good conscience stop them from \nexercising their first amendment rights. I want any campaign finance \nreform legislation to encourage this--not stop it.\n  This is why I introduced my own bill, the Campaign Finance Integrity \nAct. My bill does not restrict one from exercising their political \nspeech rights, but asks for complete and honest disclosure for all \ncampaign spending. While this statement is not one of endorsement \nconcerning my legislation, but in a review of the McCain-Feingold bill, \nthe ACLU says, ``Disclosure, rather than limitation, of large soft \nmoney contributions to political parties, is the more appropriate and \nless restrictive alternative.'' My bill does just\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nthat. As a matter of fact, I believe my bill has the strongest open \ndisclosure requirements of any bill introduced.\n  My bill also will require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of \ntheir contributions from individuals in the State or District in which \nthey are running;\n  Equalize contributions from individuals and political action \ncommittees [PAC's] by raising the individual limit from $1,000 to \n$2,500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5,000 to $2,500;\n  Index individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation;\n  Reduce the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing \npolitical party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal \ncontribution of a candidate above $5,000, by using only hard money;\n  Require organization, groups, and political party committees to \ndisclose within 24 hours the amount and type of independent \nexpenditures over $1,000 in support of or in opposition to a candidate.\n  Incorporate the Lott amendment, along with the requirement of an \nannual full disclosure of those activities to members and shareholders;\n  Prohibit depositing of an individual contribution by a campaign \nunless the individual's profession and employer are reported;\n  Encourage the Federal Election Commission to allow filing of reports \nby computers and other emerging technologies and to make that \ninformation accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours \nof receipt;\n  Completely ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings; and\n  Lastly, will create a tax deduction for political contributions up to \n$100 for individuals and $200 for a joint return to encourage small \ndonations.\n  One of the best way to reduce special interest money is to reduce the \nsize and scope of Federal Government and I am not alone believing this. \nA recent survey by Rasmussen Research shows that 62 percent of \nAmericans think that reducing Government spending would reduce \ncorruption in Government. The same survey showed that 44 percent think \nthat cutting Government spending would do more to reduce corruption \nthan campaign finance reform, while 42 percent think campaign finance \nreform would reduce corruption more than cutting Government spending. I \nhave said many times, if the Government rids itself of special interest \nfunding and corporate welfare, then there would be little influence \nleft for these large donors.\n  That is why I am fighting corporate welfare, especially thee Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corp. Some may not see OPIC in the same light, but \nany benefit for corporations will just keep them coming back for more. \nAnother way to achieve campaign finance is too eliminate the Department \nof Commerce, where a majority of the corporate welfare programs are \nfunded. Also, by scrapping the existing Tax Code with its many tax \nbreaks in favor of a flatter and simpler system would clean up our \ncampaigns greatly. Big Government solutions will not stop big business \nand big labor money. To break special interest money, we must break the \nso-called iron triangle of big business, big labor, and big Government.\n  I must say that by objecting to the Washington media is very \ndifficult for any politician, but turning your back on the first \namendment is more difficult for me. I want campaign finance reform and \nI have shown in my legislation how I would like to do it, but I will \nnot do so at the expense of the first amendment. Not even at the \nexpense of those people's speech who will disagree with me on this \nissue. The first amendment is the reason we can disagree.\n  Let me end with this. While big money has been made the villain, I \nbelieve it is not the money but the people. Bad people will do bad \nthings if given the chance. I believe that the tighter we made it, the \nmore people will try to find loopholes resulting in more scandals. We \nneed to enforce the laws on the books first before we add more \nGovernment regulation is not always the answer. To me it sounds like \nthose who are under investigation and are calling for more Government \nregulation of campaigns are saying, ``Stop me before it sin again.'' \nWell let's first uphold the law and then we can better fix it. And when \nwe do, let's not do so at the expense of those who legally want to \nexercise their first amendment rights. Don't let the bad shut out the \ngood participants in our system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado for an outstanding contribution to this debate. I \nlistened carefully to his entire speech. I thought it was truly \noutstanding. I just wanted to commend him for that and thank him for \nhis contribution to this important debate.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say, first of all, that the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, has been waiting for \na long time. I am most reluctant to take her spot. But I understand she \nhas to leave. So rather than waste the time, and with her indulgence, I \nhope she will forgive me, I will go ahead and proceed with my \nstatement.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I would like for every Member of \nCongress to ask himself or herself this very simple question: How much \nlonger do you think our democracy can survive if we continue under the \npresent system of financing our campaigns?\n  The first question ought to be: Can we continue to pass laws and \nelect people based on how much money they have and expect a \nparticipatory democracy to survive?\n  Question No. 2: Can this democracy survive under the present system \nof financing campaigns if we adopt McCain-Feingold?\n  With the utmost respect for two dear friends in the Senate, Senator \nFeingold and Senator McCain, I would have to say that this bill will \nhelp our democracy last a little longer than it would if we do nothing.\n  We call ourselves a participatory democracy. And yet, most people \nhave long since quit participating.\n  So another question that every Member of the Senate ought to ask \nbefore they vote on this bill is: Why do only 50 percent of the people \nin our country bother to vote?\n  The next question they ought to ask is: Why do only about 4 percent \nof the people in the country contribute to candidates and parties?\n  We can contribute 3 bucks to the Presidential Election Fund by \nchecking a box on our tax return, without any cost to ourselves, yet \nthe percentage of people who check that box is down now to about 13 \npercent of the people who file tax returns. Thirteen percent will say, \n``Yes. I want $3 of my taxes to go to the Presidential campaigns.'' I \nthink there are an awful lot of people in this country that think they \nare paying that $3 out of their own pocket. They don't pay the $3. All \nthey do is say I would like for $3 of my existing tax liability to go \nto the Presidential campaign. That system has attracted much higher \npercentages than in the past. But it has been declining.\n  So, ask yourself. Why do only 50 percent of the people vote?\n  Why do only 4 percent of the people contribute?\n  Why is the number of people checking the box on their Federal tax \nreturn continuing to go down?\n  The answer to that is very simple. They don't think they count. They \nsay to themselves: ``Why should I contribute? Yes. I could give 25 \nbucks. I could give 50 bucks.'' But when you see $100,000 contributions \nin soft money, and you see the $2,000 contributions to candidates, \nreally $4,000 if the contributor's spouse also contributes, who will \nbelieve that his $15 or $20 is going to make a difference? And they are \nshowing in big numbers they don't believe they count by staying home on \nelection day. And they see legislation passed continually where they \nknow money was the determining factor.\n\n  I can remember when I was a young attorney just out of law school \npracticing law in my little hometown. A man came into my office one \nday. He said, ``I want you to give me $250 for a Member of Congress.'' \nAnd I said, ``He's not even up for reelection this year. Why would I \ngive him $250?'' He said, ``Well, they have a lot of expenses,'' and so \non. And I said, ``Well, I'm not going to give\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\nyou $250,'' the primary reason being I don't have $250. The second \nreason is $250 is two monthly house payments. And the third reason is I \ndon't even like the guy; he doesn't represent my views. And fourth, I \nthought, if I were going to give $250, why would I give it to you? Why \nwouldn't I give it to the candidate so he would at least know I had \ngiven him $250 and I would also like for him to know that that is a \nbig, big amount of money for a struggling young lawyer in a little town \nin Arkansas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No, I won't yield, Senator. I have been waiting all \nafternoon to speak.\n  When I ran for Governor the first time, I found asking for money the \nmost difficult thing I had ever done. I could not believe that I had to \ngo around pleading with people to give me a few dollars. Nobody wanted \nto give me any money anyway because I had 1 percent name recognition \nwhen I started running. Some guy gave me a $100 one day, and he said, \n``I bet the horses all my life, but I have never bet on such a long \nshot as yours.'' But he gave me $100 anyway.\n  I asked Tom Eagleton, the fine Senator from Missouri, when he \nannounced he was going to leave the Senate, ``Tom, why are you \nleaving?'' He gave me three reasons. First of all, he said, ``I'm tired \nof laughing at things that ain't funny.'' The second was, ``I'm tired \nof answering hate mail.'' And third, ``I'm tired of going around with \nmy tin cup out''--three very compelling, perfectly legitimate reasons \nfor wanting to leave the Senate.\n  As good as McCain-Feingold is, it does not remove the problem \nSenators face of voting on issues in which an awful lot of people who \nhave given them money have a dynamite interest. My son, who lives in \nLittle Rock, and his wife had twins about a year ago, and they had a \nwoman who came to stay with them when the twins were born. They are \nvery fortunate they can afford that. A lot of people have twins and \nthey can't afford to have that kind of help. Be that as it may, she has \nbeen a very intelligent woman. I visit with her when I go over to see \nthe twins. Last week she said, ``You know, Dale, I don't know much \nabout what's going on up there, but it seems to me like you all spend \nall your time investigating each other.'' I said, ``That's right, \nNancy.''\n  That is all we are ever going to do as long as we finance campaigns \nthe way we do now. Every time you vote on an issue, Senators, you are \nvulnerable to accusations if it benefits anybody who ever helped you. \nWhen you take money from somebody and you vote on an issue, you better \nhope two things: That the issue turns out well, and that the guy who \ngave you money does not turn out to be a crook because if he does, the \npress comes running to you: How much money did he give you or why did \nhe give you money? Was there any quid pro quo?\n  I am reluctant to mention this, but I am going to tell you the truth. \nI never did like the Keating case. A colleague whom I consider to be \none of the most honest men I have ever known spent $600,000 of his own \npersonal money defending himself because he was said to have helped \nsomebody who gave him money in a campaign. I can promise you he would \nnever have taken it in a thousand years if he thought it had the least \ntaint to it. And if Keating's S had made it, you would never have \nheard about the Keating case. There would have been no case. But \nbecause he was giving money to a lot of people and his S went under, \nand he turned out to be a crook, then we had this big dog and pony show \nin the Senate that lasted a year or more.\n  You know, I have been a friend of the President's for now 26 years. \nAnd as well as I knew the President, as close a friend as we have been \nthrough the years, I never heard of Whitewater until he became \nPresident, never knew there was such a place, never knew there was such \na corporation. And if Bill Clinton hadn't had the temerity to come to \nWashington as the President of the United States, you would never have \nheard of Whitewater. It is all how things turn out.\n\n  But to reemphasize the point I started to make, that is, colleagues, \nwhen you take a contribution from anybody, even if your own intentions \nare pure, you better hope that money is coming from an honorable \nperson. You better hope it is coming from somebody who isn't out \ndefrauding people. And you better be careful how you vote on issues \nthat can help a contributor if they turn sour or turn out to be a \ncrook. It doesn't matter if you cast that vote on the merits. And as \nlong as we have this system of financing campaigns you can lie awake at \nnight worrying about it because it is a real threat. Where a quid pro \nquo can be inferred, it will be. That is the perception that will \nremain until we change the campaign finance law.\n  We have reached the point, Mr. President, where every single Member \nis constantly just one step away from disaster. And guilt or innocence \nhas little to do with the outcome. One woman told me the other day that \nshe had been interviewed and appeared before grand juries in one of \nthese many investigations and was going to have to deed her house--I \npromise you she is totally innocent of anything--going to deed her \nhouse to her lawyer because it is the only asset she has that will come \nclose to covering her legal bills.\n  Well, we have reached the point in this country where simple \nnegligence, bad judgment, just plain policy differences are becoming \ncriminal offenses. How many independent counsels do we have running \nloose in this town? And how many more will we have? I can answer that \npartially. As long as we finance campaigns the way we do now, there are \ngoing to be independent counsels galore in this city. When you increase \nfunding, spending on congressional elections in 1976 from $99 million \nto, in 1996, almost $800 million, you have to ask, where is this going \nto end? That is an 800 percent increase in 20 years, with no letup in \nsight.\n  Look at the $450 million or almost $500 million in soft money for \nboth parties during the last election cycle. It will be more this year, \nthey are already ahead of the 1995-1996 cycle. Who gives that money? It \nis not little struggling lawyers as I was 40 years ago in a little town \nin Arkansas. It is not average folks with five and ten and fifty dollar \ncontributions.\n  I will tell you when it is going to end, Mr. President. It is going \nto end when the American people rise up in righteous indignation and \ncome to the realization that the system is rotten, come to the \nrealization that they do not count. It will end when enough people in \nCongress get tired of every contribution that goes sour being \nmicroscopically addressed by the press and wondering about when you are \ngoing to be on one of the news magazines the next episode.\n  There is no perfect solution to this. I happen to come down on the \nside of public financing. I have a bill. I wanted to introduce my bill \nas an amendment. Senator Kerry and Senator Wellstone have a bill. We \ndiscussed whether to try to offer our bills as amendments to this bill. \nWe concluded that would probably be counterproductive, would not get \nmany votes, probably would not get a single Republican vote, maybe 25 \nor 30 Democrat votes. Yet 66 percent of the people, according to a \nGallup poll in October of last year, 66 percent of the people in this \ncountry said they favor public financing of our campaigns.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Colorado say a moment ago that \nhe won even though he was outspent. I was too in my first race. I ran \nagainst a Rockefeller. I guess you would call that stupidity. But in \nany event, I won, and when I ran for the Senate against an incumbent, I \nwas badly outspent. But I tell you, those are rare exceptions. I \napplaud anybody who spends less money than his opponent and manages to \nwin because 90 percent of the candidates in this country who spend the \nmost money end up winning. Pretty heavy odds. According to statistics \nto this date, if you have the money, you have a 9-to-1 chance of \nwinning.\n  In the 1995-96 election cycle, 400 corporations, labor unions, and \nindividuals contributed $100,000 or more in soft money; 400 of them \ngave over $100,000. Were they after good government? Is that what they \nwanted? I don't mean to demean anybody, because I have a lot of friends \nwho have been faithful to me for 26 years in the contribution area. I \ncan truthfully say I am most grateful to all of them. But when I first \nstarted running for Governor in my State, there were no campaign laws \nand I was absolutely aghast\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\nat the amount of cash money, greenbacks, that was floating around in \ncampaigns. One man handed me fifty $100 bills. I knew he had a deep and \nabiding interest in certain things that were bound to come up when I \nwas elected, if I was elected. So I handed him his fifty $100 bills \nback.\n  Do you know something? He doesn't like me to this day. You can't give \npeople money back and make them like it, can you, Senator?\n  My campaign finance director came up and said, ``How are we going to \nrun this race? You are giving more money back than we are taking in.'' \nI have given a lot of money back. All I am saying is, when you think \nabout how much money $100,000 is, and when you think about who gave it, \nyou have to believe that they wanted something more than good \ngovernment.\n  In 1996--listen to this--in the U.S. Senate, Senate incumbents had a \n2 to 1 spending advantage over challengers. You hear people say public \nfinancing of campaigns is welfare for the politicians. Do you know what \nI say to chamber of commerce and Rotary Club members, all conservative \nbusinessmen who do not much like this idea of public financing? I \nremind them, you have been investing in the stock market for several \nyears now and you have been doing well. But I can tell you, if you \nreally want to make some money, if you really want a return on your \ninvestment, you opt for public financing. That will give you the \nbiggest return of any investment you ever made in your life, because we \nwon't be spending a lot of money on unworthy projects that contributors \nsupported. It will be a great investment because it will yield a \ncleaner government and the people will believe it is a cleaner \ngovernment.\n  The average successful Senate race today costs $4 million. That is \naverage. Some races have cost as much as $28 million. Where will we be \n20 years from now if the costs of Senate races continue to go up \nanother 800 percent? You can't count that high. You can't get computers \nto count that high at the rate we are going.\n  One of the problems that I have with the McCain-Feingold bill, and I \nam a cosponsor and ardent supporter and I certainly intend to vote for \nit, but I will tell you one of my fears is, while it will help preserve \nour democracy for a little longer and it will take some of the problems \nout of the way we finance campaigns today, nothing will cure the \nproblem like public financing.\n  But the point I want to make, what I worry about is, if we pass \nMcCain-Feingold, there will be a lot of hoopla about it, because I have \nnever known people as tenacious and determined and as hard-working as \nSenator Feingold and Senator McCain have been on this issue. They have \nmy deep and abiding admiration for their tenacity and their \ndetermination to try to do something about what is wrong with the \nsystem. But if it passes, we will go home and we will pat ourselves on \nthe back and give ourselves the ``good government'' award, as Senator \nHollings is always saying, and the American people will be thinking the \nsystem has been fixed. A lot of it will have been fixed, but problems \nwill remain and I fear that they will make the people even more \ncynical.\n  The issue advocacy ads that are really ads for a candidate--they \ndrive me crazy. This bill would help to bring them under control, \nrequire disclosure of the sources of money used to produce them. They \nare really campaign spending.\n  I can tell you, I have voted for one constitutional amendment since I \nhave been in the Senate. I voted for ERA soon after I arrived in the \nSenate.\n  Since that time, I have voted about 32 times against every \nconstitutional amendment. Either earlier this year or last year, I \nvoted against Senator Hollings' amendment to the Constitution which \nwould have allowed the Congress to set campaign spending limits. I am \ngoing to vote for it. I want to announce now publicly, the next time \nSenator Hollings brings that amendment up, I intend to support it. \nDespite my deep reservations about amending our Constitution, I will do \nalmost anything to change the way we finance campaigns in this country, \nbecause I am absolutely convinced that this system is totally \ndestructive to our democracy. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to announce my intention to join \nmy colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and vote for his motion to \ntable the amendment offered by the distinguished majority leader to the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign reform legislation.\n  This has not been an easy decision for me. I strongly support the \nunderlying objective, if not the precise language of Senator Lott's \namendment. The principle that America's working men and women should \nnot be required to contribute their hard-earned money to advance the \ncampaign of candidates they do not support is a compelling one. The \nstrong opposition of big labor to this reasonable proposal demonstrates \ntheir fear that many of the rank and file union members would not agree \nto the use of their dues for political purposes.\n  But in the final analysis, my decision on this matter must be \ndetermined by considerations other than the merits of Senator Lott's \namendment. The plain truth is that its adoption will kill campaign \nfinance reform. That is not simply my judgment; it is the judgment of \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold who have devoted so much time and \nenergy to further the cause of reform.\n  When I ran for the U.S. Senate, I made a clear and unambiguous \npromise to the people of Maine. I promised that I would fight for \ncampaign finance reform. The people of my State responded by entrusting \nme to represent them in this body, and whatever other loyalties that I \nmight have, I owe my ultimate allegiance to them. I kept that promise \nwhen I cosponsored the McCain-Feingold bill, and I am keeping it now by \npledging to vote against what I have concluded is, in fact, a killer \namendment.\n  I do, however, want to say a few words to my Democratic colleagues. \nAt the end of the day, we will not have campaign finance reform without \nsacrifices and courage on both sides of the aisle. If Senator Lott's \namendment is not defeated, the spotlight will shift to the Democrats. \nSo far, they have had the easy road, able to proclaim their passion for \nreform, knowing that it faces an uphill battle and confident that they \ncan blame the Republicans if it does not pass.\n  But if their response to the Lott amendment is simply to filibuster \nand not to offer a reasonable compromise on the union dues issue, an \nalready skeptical public will reach the inevitable conclusion that \nDemocrats are not serious about reforming the system. A number of \nDemocrats have urged me to put principle over party, and to them I say, \n``Your turn may come.''\n  Mr. President, a fair campaign finance system is essential to a \nhealthy democracy. While not perfect, the McCain-Feingold bill would \ngive us a fair system. Given the commitment of the people of Maine to \nfair play, I am confident that my position on this issue not only is \nright as a matter of principle, but also reflects the values of my home \nState.\n  I want to also take this opportunity to commend Senator McCain and \nSenator Feingold for their unceasing efforts in this very important \nfight.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to say what \na Senator of courage the Senator from Maine is. This is a very \ndifficult issue. The Senator from Maine, of course, is a loyal \nRepublican, but for her to come out here and have the courage to stand \nup and join with us to say that this amendment would kill our bill is \nextremely important.\n\n  I have heard her admonition as well that this must continue to be \nbipartisan. But the fact that she would come out here at this key \nmoment and say that she will stand with a bipartisan effort, as she has \ndone in the past, is not a minor matter. It is the same thing the \nSenator from Maine did a few months ago when everyone kept saying, \n``You don't have any cosponsors; you only have two Republican \ncosponsors.'' It was the Senator from Maine who actually had some ideas \nthat were better than our ideas, and we added them to the bill and \nimproved it.\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\n  Let me add both my personal and professional gratitude for the \ncommitment of the Senator from Maine to reform. We in Wisconsin like to \nthink that we are the greatest reform State, but Maine sure gives us a \nchallenge.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for a question.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator for his kind comments.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the very \nimportant discussion that the Senate is having regarding campaign \nfinance reform, and I commend the Senator from Kentucky, Senator \nMcConnell, for not only his leadership but for his tenacity in \ndefending what he believes and so many of us believe is an assault on \nthe first-amendment rights of all Americans.\n  I also thank Senator Lott, our leader, for his leadership in \nscheduling this debate, and I commend my colleagues who thus far have \nadded insight and value to our discussion.\n  Mr. President, if we are to have campaign finance reform, I believe \nwe must achieve those changes necessary to ensure public trust in our \ninstitutions and our Government officials. Serious reform must take \ninto consideration the significant number of Americans who are \ncompelled to make mandatory political contributions at their workplace \nas a condition of employment. No citizen should be required to make \ninvoluntary contributions to any candidate, party, or political \ninterest group. No corporation, no labor union, and no business entity \nshould have the power to twist the arms of their employees or members. \nThese practices are wrong and un-American, and I believe they must be \nended as part of our overall effort to reform the financing of Federal \nelections.\n  Serious reform must also contain provisions that increase the \nfrequency and specificity of mandated contribution disclosure. I \nsupport measures which bring about greater transparency, those that \nallow the American people to know the where, the when, how much, and \nfrom whom of campaign contributions.\n  The last election cycle was filled with numerous activities that \nviolated existing campaign laws. As we proceed through this debate, we \nshould be mindful of the fact that these new reforms do nothing to \nreach those past violations. We must ensure that illegal foreign \ncontributions are kept from election campaigns, and I believe that we \nmust ensure disclosure violations are uncovered and are punished. Thus, \nperhaps the most important so-called change we can now achieve is to \nensure that the existing laws are routinely and are properly enforced.\n  However, in our zeal for change, we should not compromise the rights \nand freedoms of the same people we claim to protect. We must pay close \nattention, I believe, to the numerous Supreme Court decisions which \nclearly set forth that the regulation of many campaign-related \nactivities directly implicates first-amendment rights.\n  In 1974, the Supreme Court reviewed the Federal Election Campaign Act \nin the case of Buckley and struck down the statutory restrictions on \ncampaign expenditures. In its holding, the Court concluded that \npolitical discourse ``is at the core of our electoral process and of \nthe first amendment freedoms.''\n  While the Court did allow a minimal level of restriction that we know \nabout--caps on the direct contributions to candidates--and only for the \npurpose of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, it \ngranted the full protection, Mr. President, of the first amendment to \nanyone spending money to communicate an idea, a belief, or a call to \naction.\n  In no uncertain terms, the Buckley decision makes clear that the \nfirst amendment forbids the Federal Government from restricting \npolitical speech and expression rights by way of campaign expenditure \nlimits.\n  Mr. President, the Buckley decision does not stand in isolation. For \nthe past 20 years, the Supreme Court of the United States has returned \nto this decision and consistently and unequivocally reaffirmed its \nsoundness. The Court's subsequent decisions clearly demonstrate this, \nsuch as in FEC versus National Conservative Political Action Committee. \nThe Court, tracking the Buckley decision, struck down restrictions on \nfunds spent in support of publicly financed Presidential candidates in \nfurtherance of their election. The Court held that such expenditures \nfell squarely, Mr. President, within the protections of the first \namendment rights.\n  Also, in the FEC versus Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the Court \nruled that the voter guide published by an incorporated entity was \nentitled, Mr. President, to first amendment protections and invalidated \nan enforcement action the FEC brought against this organization.\n  More recently, Mr. President, in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \nCommittee versus FEC, the Court again, following Buckley, held that \nfirst amendment protection covers someone communicating an idea, a \nbelief, or a call to action. The Court found that political party \nexpenditures made in support of party ideals and even party candidates \nwere protected under the first amendment of the Constitution of the \nUnited States so long as the expenditures were not made, as we say, in \ncoordination with candidates.\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court rulings provide us two guideposts in \nour endeavor to reform campaign finance. We have the constitutionally \nproscribed power and thus the responsibility to prevent corruption and/\nor the appearance of corruption in Federal elections, but we can ``make \nno law * * * [that] abridges the freedom of speech * * *,'' quoting the \nConstitution.\n  Therefore, I believe that it is essential that any reform initiatives \nwe pass do not further encroach on the basic rights protected under the \nfirst amendment. It is not the proper role of Government, I believe, to \nrestrict the ability of the American people to participate in election \ncampaigns. It would be absurd, I think, to allow the Government to \ncontrol the manner in which Americans communicate. If reform crosses \nthese lines, I think it commands too high a price, it goes too far.\n  Mr. President, in light of the Supreme Court holdings, I do not \nunderstand and cannot support the present legislative efforts that \ndirectly impinge on first amendment rights. I particularly object to \nthe so-called reform in Senators McCain and Feingold's bill which \nrestricts independent parties from communicating ``for the purpose of \ninfluencing a Federal election,'' regardless of whether the \ncommunication is expressed advocacy.\n  Just think about it. Time and again, in case after case, the Supreme \nCourt of the United States has held that Congress can only legislate to \nrestrict campaign-related activities where those activities comprise \nthe express advocacy of a particular candidate. The Court even \nspecified in a footnote in the Buckley case what it meant by express \nadvocacy--communications such as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``defeat'' \nand ``reject.'' So when Congress places restrictions on communications \nthat do not fall within this tightly drawn class, it violates, \naccording to the Court, the first amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, as we have consistently heard on the floor during this \ndebate, the first amendment is not a loophole. It is beyond our \nconstitutional authority to restrict the ability of independent groups \nto communicate their political views where they do not engage in \nexpress advocacy.\n  Mr. President, I am also greatly troubled, as are others, by a \nprovision in Senators McCain and Feingold's bill which prohibits \nindependent communications that merely mention the name of a candidate \nwithin 60 days of a Federal election. Not only does such a restriction \nstrike at the heart of first amendment protections, it all but \nguarantees a free ride to the incumbent involved in the election.\n  Just think about it, Mr. President. If there is no commentary \nregarding a candidate's performance in office at the time when the \nelectorate is most tuned into the campaign, no sitting Member would \never lose. Incumbents would be able to capitalize on the inherent \nadvantages of being in office, while challengers would be forced to \nrely solely on their own and probably much less resources.\n  This provision is incumbent reelection insurance, not campaign \nfinance\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\nreform. Make no mistake about it. The electorate must be able to hear \nall the views about candidates in a timely manner. And candidates must \nbe able to stomach the full range of opinions regarding their \ncandidacy.\n  Mr. President, we must clean up the system but without compromising \nfundamental first amendment rights. I believe this task is difficult \nbut not impossible. Without infringing upon any American's rights, we \ncan ensure that the American people control the direction of their \ncontributions, have an understanding of who gave what to whom, and are \nconfident that our elections are free of foreign influence, which is so \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, the Senate, I believe, should work to enact these \nmeasures into law and not infringe on our first amendment rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I wonder if I might take 3 \nminutes as in morning business. I can go into morning business and do \nthis, and then we can come back to this.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to yield to \nSenator Domenici for up to 5 minutes and then have my rights to the \nfloor restored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, \nwithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very, very much. I will be perhaps \neven briefer than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10339-6", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO AID IN THE RESTORATION OF THE \n                   BASILICA OF ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on September 24 and 25, Umbria, Italy, \nthat community, was hit by twin earthquakes. Extensive damage was \ninflicted upon the towns and villages across the region. Eleven people \nlost their lives and thousands of homes and buildings have been \ndamaged.\n\n  The Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi was one of the buildings that \nwas severely damaged. It isn't just a church or a great center of \npilgrimage, or an artistic archive and yet it is all of those things.\n  It is one of those special places that you visit one day, but long to \nreturn to for a lifetime if you are fortunate enough to get to Italy \nand to set about to see some very, very historic buildings with culture \nand with religion that just wreaks from the walls.\n  That is why I was profoundly saddened to learn that the basilica was \nseverely damaged by the earthquakes of September 24 and September 25, \nand again last week.\n  It seems so ironic that the basilica, built in honor of the patron \nSaint of Italy who cherished the natural world, was ravaged by an act \nof nature.\n  The basilica is one of the finest examples of Italian Gothic \narchitecture, a building of ``unparalleled importance in the evolution \nof Italian art.'' It has been written, by those more knowledgeable \nabout art and architecture than I am and will ever be, that ``a \nharmonious relationship exists between the architecture and its fresco \ndecoration.'' ``The strong and simple forms are repeated throughout the \nbuilding both to unify and to articulate the space with so powerful an \neffect that the architectural members are echoed in the painted \nframework to the frescos.''\n  The basilica is a living museum providing a home for the art of \nseveral great masters of the 13th and 14th centuries. These art \ntreasures depict scenes from the Old and New Testaments.\n  The famous fresco artist, Cimabue, began his work in the basilica, \nbelieve it or not, in 1277. Cimabue's frescos include scenes from the \nlife of the Virgin, popes, angels, and saints, as well as scenes of the \nApocalypse and the Crucifixion.\n  Cimabue's pupil, Giotto, painted 28 famous, and beautiful frescos \nbased on St. Bonaventure's version of St. Francis' life, and major \naccomplishments. These famous Giotto frescos painted on the sidewalls \nof the basilica were cracked by the earthquake but are miraculously \nsomewhat in tact. These frescos are world treasurers. So that my \ncolleagues understand, let me make this comparison. Giotto was to the \nbasilica what Brumidi was to our own beautiful Capitol.\n  Mobilization of Italian artists and restorers has been swift. In \naddition, the National Museum in London and the Louvre have offered \nexperts to help with the restoration.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution calls upon the Smithsonian, the \nNational Gallery of Art, and any of the other premier art museums in \nthe United States that have the pertinent expertise to provide \ntechnical assistance to aid in the restoration of the Basilica of St. \nFrancis of Assisi and the works of art that have been damaged in the \nearthquake.\n  I want to indicate to the Senate I will send to the desk to be \nconsidered in wrapup a resolution--just by the Senate; we are not going \nto try to go to the House--just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \nstates the facts regarding this disaster, and merely says that the \nSmithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art and any of the \nother premier art museums of the United States having pertinent \nexpertise in restoration should provide technical assistance to aid in \nthe restoration of the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi and the works \nof art that have been damaged in the earthquake. That is essentially \nwhat it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10409-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10409-S10420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor and strong supporter of \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, and I want to explain this afternoon in some \ndetail why I support a key section in the bill that is the subject of \nmuch debate. It is section 201, the provision that is intended to stop \nwhat we call issue ad abuse. By issue ad abuse I mean the mislabeling \nof candidate ads as issue ads in order to evade contribution limits and \nthe disclosure requirements that now exist in Federal campaign law.\n  I want to emphasize this point because it has been overlooked, it \nseems to me, by so many of us during this debate. Current law restricts \ncontributions and the Buckley case has upheld that restriction as being \nconsistent with the first amendment. Section 201 is not only \nconstitutional within Buckley but it is also critically important to \ncampaign finance reform. I want to spend some time explaining why.\n  Now, Buckley--which I think has been cited by just about everybody \nwho has spoken in this debate--is the touchstone for drafting \nconstitutionally permissible Federal campaign finance laws. So I want \nto start with Buckley. In Buckley, the Supreme Court upheld a strict \nset of limits on campaign contributions to Federal candidates, despite \nimpassioned argument, including by the ACLU, that such limits \nimpermissibly restricted first amendment rights of free speech and free \nassociation.\n  This is what the Court said in Buckley, and I will be quoting at some \nlength because it is critical in understanding the permissible limits \nof campaign finance law and limits:\n\n       It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary \n     purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption \n     resulting from large individual financial contributions--in \n     order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for \n     the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private \n     financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal \n     or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from \n     others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a \n     successful campaign. The increasing importance of the \n     communications media and sophisticated mass mailing and \n     polling operations to effective campaigning make the raising \n     of large sums of money an ever more essential ingredient of \n     an effective candidacy. To the extent that large \n     contributions are given to secure political quid pro quo's \n     from current and potential office holders, the integrity of \n     our system of representative democracy is undermined. . . .\n       Of almost equal concern is the danger of actual quid pro \n     quo arrangements and the impact of the appearance of \n     corruption stemming from public awareness of the \n     opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large \n     individual financial contributions. . . .\n\n  And the Court went on:\n\n       Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of \n     the appearance of improper influence ``is also critical. . . \n     if confidence in the system of representative government is \n     not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.'' . . .\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\n      Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was \n     only a partial measure, and that contribution ceilings were a \n     necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or \n     appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting \n     unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities \n     of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions \n     are fully disclosed.\n\n  In other words, the Supreme Court explicitly held in Buckley that \neliminating actual and apparent corruption of our electoral system--\ncorruption which is ``inherent in a system permitting unlimited \nfinancial contributions''--was a compelling enough interest to justify \nCongress in imposing campaign contribution limits, although such limits \ncollide with unfettered first amendment rights of free expression and \nfree association.\n  The Supreme Court adopted a balancing test, looking at what was the \nrestriction on the first amendment compared to the public interest in \navoiding the appearance of corruption in elections where there are \nunlimited financial contributions.\n  Now, what did the Supreme Court do in the area of contributions? They \nupheld a $1,000 contribution limit on contributions that an individual \nmay make to a Federal candidate. Despite the argument that that limit \ncollided with pure free speech rights--an argument made by the ACLU in \nthe Buckley case and not adopted by the Supreme Court in Buckley--quite \nthe opposite. They approved the contribution limit. The Supreme Court \nnot only said that the $1,000 limit on contributions to candidates was \nconstitutional, but it also upheld an overall ceiling of $25,000 on the \namount of money that a single individual could give to all Federal \ncandidates in a single year.\n  Now, how does the Court explain that? If the $1,000 limit is \nconstitutional, how, then, would it be constitutional to limit the \nnumber of $1,000 contributions in effect to 25 candidates? Why \nshouldn't people be allowed to give $1,000 to 50 candidates if they \nwant?\n  The language of the Court is again very instructive as to the \nbalancing test that they adopted relative to weighing limits on \ncontributions and any impingement on first amendment rights. Here is \nwhat the Supreme Court said:\n\n       The overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate \n     restriction on the number of candidates and committees with \n     which an individual may associate himself by means of \n     financial support. But this quite modest restraint upon \n     protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the \n     $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might \n     otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular \n     candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to \n     political committees likely to contribute to that candidate \n     or huge contributions to the candidate's political party.\n\n  The Supreme Court went on to say:\n\n       The limited additional restriction on associational freedom \n     imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a \n     corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation \n     that we have found to be constitutionally valid.\n\n  So the Buckley Court not only upheld limits on contributions of \n$1,000 per candidate per election, they also upheld an overall limit of \n$25,000 in a test which weighed the restrictions on associational \nfreedoms and first amendment freedoms against the need for clean \nelections, against the need to avoid the appearance of corruption, \nwhich in the Supreme Court's words, arises from unlimited financial \ncontributions to candidates.\n  The Supreme Court said Congress may try to avoid the appearance of \ncorruption that results from unlimited contribution to candidates by \nputting limits on the contributions to any one candidate and on the \ntotal number of contributions to all candidates combined. Why? In order \nto prevent ``evasion of the contribution limit'' by a person who might \n``contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through \nthe use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to \ncontribute to that candidate or huge contributions to the candidate's \npolitical party.''\n  That is Buckley. Now, we haven't heard a lot about that part of \nBuckley in this debate yet, but that's Buckley. We have heard, and \nproperly so, about that part of Buckley which put limits on \nexpenditures and acts inconsistent with the first amendment. But what \nwe have not heard enough of is those parts of Buckley which rule \nconstitutional the limits on contributions to candidates. It is that \npart of Buckley that upholds the constitutionality of limits on \ncontributions, which is at the core of McCain-Feingold. Because it is \nin order to avoid the evasion of existing law and its limits on \ncontributions that the McCain-Feingold bill is designed as it is. That \nis why we believe that it is perfectly consistent with Buckley.\n  The Buckley opinion also upheld disclosure requirements. By \nsustaining these disclosure requirements, the Supreme Court effectively \napproved the prohibition of anonymous or secret contributions to any \ncandidate or political committee. It also effectively approved the \nprohibition of direct campaign spending by anonymous or secret persons. \nAgain, the Supreme Court adopted a balancing test even when it came to \ndisclosure.\n  I know that the Presiding Officer has a particular interest in the \nneed for disclosure--an interest that I think most Members of this body \nshare. Many of us also want to put limits on soft money contributions. \nOn that, there is a difference inside this body. But in terms of \ndisclosure, I know that the Presiding Officer has had a very sincere \nand a very longstanding interest, one I think most of us would share.\n  Here is what the Court said relative to the first amendment's \napplication to disclosure requirements:\n\n       Compelled disclosure has the potential for substantially \n     infringing on the exercise of first amendment rights. But we \n     have acknowledged that there are governmental interests \n     sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of \n     infringement, particularly when the free functioning of our \n     national institutions is involved. The governmental interests \n     sought to be vindicated by the disclosure requirements are of \n     this magnitude.\n\n  So, again, it is a weighing test. The Supreme Court said explicitly \nthat compelled disclosure--which I think probably all of us in this \nbody support in one fashion or another--has the potential for \nsubstantially infringing on the exercise of first amendment rights. But \nthen the Court went on to weigh the value of disclosure against the \ninfringement and said that we have a legitimate public interest in \ncoming down on the side of disclosure. The Court listed three \ncompelling interests in requiring disclosure.\n  Later Supreme Court decisions built upon the base provided in \nBuckley. One key case was Austin versus Michigan State Chamber of \nCommerce in 1990. The Supreme Court in Austin upheld a Michigan State \nlaw which prohibited corporations from making independent expenditures, \nexcept through a political action committee which is subject to \ncontribution limits and disclosure requirements. Despite the \ncorporation's argument that its first amendment rights were being \nviolated, the Supreme Court specifically held that Michigan could bar \nthe corporation from placing an ad endorsing a specific candidate.\n  In other words, a corporation was told by the Supreme Court that \nMichigan has a right to prevent you from putting on an ad that endorses \na candidate. It quoted extensively from the Massachusetts Citizens For \nLife case, a 1986 case.\n  Here is what the Supreme Court said in the Michigan case, again \nquoting an earlier case significantly but having additional language of \nits own:\n\n       ``The resources in the treasury of a business corporation . \n     . . are not an indication of popular support for the \n     corporation's political ideas. They reflect instead the \n     economically motivated decisions of investors and customers. \n     The availability of these resources may make a corporation a \n     formidable political presence, even though the power of the \n     corporation may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.'' \n     We therefore have recognized--\n\n  Here again, we get into a weighing test\n\n     that ``the compelling governmental interest in preventing \n     corruption support[s] the restriction of the influence of \n     political war chests funneled through the corporate form.''. \n     . . Regardless of whether this danger of ``financial quid pro \n     quo'' corruption may be sufficient to justify a restriction \n     on independent expenditures, Michigan's regulation aims at a \n     different type of corruption in the political arena: the \n     corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of \n     wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate \n     form and that have little or no correlation to the public's \n     support for the corporation's political ideas.\n\n  So we have contribution limits approved by the Supreme Court. We have\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\ndisclosure requirements approved by the Supreme Court. We have a ban on \ncorporate independent expenditures except through a PAC approved by the \nSupreme Court.\n  Each of these campaign finance restrictions has been upheld by the \nCourt in the face of arguments that these restrictions were \ninconsistent with the first amendment. In each of those cases, the \nSupreme Court acknowledged that there was some impingement on pure \nfirst amendment rights but weighed that against the public interest in \nclean campaigns.\n\n\n                       Twenty Years After Buckley\n\n  Now, the campaign contribution limits that are in existing law--the \n$1,000 an election and $25,000 overall--are strict limits. No corporate \nor union campaign spending, except through political action committees. \nPresidential campaigns are supposed to be funded with public funds.\n  Those laws, as I said, are on the books today. But candidates and \nparties in the 20 years since Buckley have found many ways around these \ntough laws. Contribution limits have been rendered all but meaningless \nby the soft money loophole. We have all heard the story of Roger \nTamraz's $300,000 contribution to the Democrats, and the tobacco \nindustry's donating millions of dollars to Republicans. Disclosure \nrequirements and the ban on corporate independent expenditures have \nalso been rendered toothless, not only by the soft money loophole, but \nalso by the use of so-called ``issue ads.''\n  In my opinion, the most vicious combination in the 1996 election \nseason, outside of our control and the control of the campaign finance \nlaws, was the use of huge contributions from individuals or entities, \ncorporations included, funding candidate attack ads mislabeled as issue \nads. This vicious combination encapsulates for me more than any other \nsingle image the collapse of our campaign finance system and the rock-\nbottom need for reform. Documenting issue ad abuse and the role that \nthese so-called issue ads now play in American elections is vital to \nsupport legislative reforms that touch upon first amendment concerns. \nThat record is being built right here on the Senate floor. That record \nis being built in campaign finance hearings before the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, of which I am a member. It is a record \nthat is filled with examples of so-called issue ads that are \nindistinguishable from candidate ads, as well as testimony that we have \nelicited from experienced candidates, officeholders, and others about \nthe growing use of so-called issue ads as a tactic in Federal campaigns \nto evade the legal limits on contributions and disclosure requirements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this point that following \nmy remarks there be printed in the Record the transcripts of six so \ncalled ``issue ads'' that aired on television during the course of the \n1996 campaign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this list, compiled by Public Citizen, \nillustrates in the words of the group, ``. . . the use of the `issue \nad' loophole to engage in flat-out electioneering.''\n  I want to just use one of these ads as an example. This is a 1996 ad, \npaid for by the League of Conservation Voters. It refers to a House \nMember, Greg Ganske, a Republican Congressman from Iowa. The transcript \nof the ad reads as follows:\n\n       It's our land; our water. America's environment must be \n     protected. But in just 18 months, Congressman Ganske has \n     voted 12 out of 12 times to weaken environmental protections. \n     Congressman Ganske even voted to let corporations continue \n     releasing cancer-causing pollutants into our air. Congressman \n     Ganske voted for the big corporations who lobbied these bills \n     and gave him thousands of dollars in contributions.\n\n  The next line is:\n\n       Call Congressman Ganske. Tell him to protect America's \n     environment. For our families. For our future.\n\n  This ad is treated by its sponsors as an issue ad which can be paid \nfor out of unlimited, undisclosed funds. But if one word is changed--\njust one word--instead of saying ``call'' Congressman Ganske, the ad \nsays ``defeat'' Congressman Ganske--which the ad says in every single \nother way but doesn't use the word ``defeat.'' If they had explicitly \nuse the word ``defeat,'' then that ad would have to be paid for out of \nfunds which are restricted by law, because the word ``defeat'' is one \nof those magic seven words.\n  In the real world is there any difference between those two ads? In \nthe real political world, would any viewer of that ad get any message \nother than to defeat Congressman Ganske? Would any reasonable person \nreach any other conclusion as to the purpose and intent of that ad? Is \nthat ad not unmistakably aimed at the defeat of a candidate in the \nmiddle of an election when that ad runs? Is that ad not equivalent to \nan ad that is calling for the defeat of a candidate?\n  I think most of us in this Chamber who have been living in the real \npolitical world, as well as most of our constituents, wouldn't even \nnotice the difference--whether the word ``defeat'' or ``call'' were in \nthat ad. That is how similar they are.\n  Then the question is: Just as we are permitted by the Supreme Court \nto protect our contribution limit of $1,000 by having an overall limit \nof $25,000, will we be allowed to protect our law requiring that ads \ncalling for the defeat or the election of a candidate come from \ncontributions which are limited by law? Can we not protect that law \nalso in the way we have done in McCain-Feingold, by adding another word \nto the seven magic words --for instance, the eighth word--the name of \nthe candidate?\n  Seven words are listed in a footnote in Buckley--the so-called \n``seven magic words.'' If you use the words ``vote for'' or ``defeat'' \nor ``elect'' or ``support'' or ``vote against'' or ``reject,'' that is \nunequivocally considered an ad calling for the election or defeat of a \ncandidate. And the Supreme Court says that our restriction on \ncontributions is constitutional if one of those ads is used. It doesn't \nsay one of those words has to be used. It uses that as an example in a \nfootnote.\n  So we are coming along now in the real world 20 years later and \nsaying, ``Here is an ad that didn't use one of those magic seven \nwords.'' But is that ad functionally any different? Is that ad in the \nreal world any different from an ad which contains the word ``defeat,'' \nor does that ad unmistakably call for the defeat of that Congressman \njust as much if it had used the ``vote against''?\n  That is a question which the Federal Election Commission has ruled \non. They have adopted a test from a case called Furgatch that comes out \nof the ninth circuit. In the Furgatch case, the ninth circuit approved \nthe test which is now the regulation of the Federal Election Commission \nwhich says that, if an ad unmistakably calls for the defeat or election \nof a candidate, that ad is within the meaning of our law that restricts \ncontributions to $1,000 where the advocacy of a candidate's defeat or \nelection is express.\n  We had 30 days after the Federal Election Commission adopted that \nregulation based on the Furgatch case, as approved by the ninth \ncircuit--to reject the Federal Election Commission regulation that was \nadopted a few years ago.\n  The courts are divided. We have the ninth circuit saying that the \ntest in the Furgatch case is constitutional. We have the first circuit \nruling the other way. We have the Supreme Court deciding not to accept \ncertiorari in either of the appeals. In fact, just today they did not \naccept an appeal of the first circuit decision.\n  So we have the ninth circuit a number of years ago approving the \nunmistakable test in Furgatch which is in the Federal Election \nCommission regulation, and we have the ninth circuit going the other \nway, and one other circuit I believe going the other way.\n  So we have a division in our circuits as to whether or not the \nunmistakable test that the Federal Election Commission has adopted by \nregulation--and that we have not rejected when we had an opportunity--\nas to whether or not that Furgatch test is in fact constitutional. But \nsurely when you have one circuit ruling that it is constitutional, and \nwhen you have the Supreme Court declining to rule on an appeal from \neither circuit approving it or disapproving it, what we have now is the \nsituation where we have divided circuits. We have the Supreme Court \nthat hasn't ruled on the subject.\n\n  I would have like to have seen the Supreme Court adopt certiorari \ntoday, but they didn't. They left us with law\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\nin a state of limbo where you have one circuit saying the Federal \nElection Commission is right--it properly adopts the unmistakable test, \nand you have another court of appeals saying no--they can't do it \nconsistent with the Supreme Court decision in Buckley.\n  That is where we sit. That is where we are going to sit until one of \ntwo things happen. Either the Supreme Court decides to rule on an \nappeal from one of these circuits, or we adopt a test ourselves and \nthen presumably have that test ruled upon by the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield for \na question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to that, I was, I could say, a victim. That \nis the way I saw it with that very type of ad late in the campaign \nasking people to call Jeff Sessions and say you are opposed to A, B, C, \nor D--to things he had done while in office.\n  I think we can take two approaches to it. It fundamentally troubles \nme that the League of Conservation Voters do not feel free to run an ad \nand say vote against this guy just like the people who ran ads against \nme. Why shouldn't we just let them do it? They should have to put their \nname on it and say who is funding it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator proposing we repeal the current law?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think we have to consider the problem of trying to \ncontain free speech in America. I really am troubled by it. I was a \nvictim of it. I got angry at the time. Now I wonder why I should feel \nobliged to tell those trial lawyers and plaintiff lawyers who opposed \nsome of my filed suits that they can't run an ad and say my ideas are \nwrong and I shouldn't be elected.\n  As a matter of fact, I am troubled by that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of course the Senator knows they can run ads saying you \nought to be defeated. They can run all of those ads they want. But \nunder the law that we have passed, they must use contributions which \ncomply with the limits which we have adopted. So they are free to run \nthose kind of ads. But they must comply with law when they run those \nads.\n  The question is whether they should have unlimited, undisclosed funds \nto run ads which effectively say to defeat or elect somebody but do not \ncomply with the limit. That is what we are facing.\n  So, unless the Senator is suggesting that we repeal the existing law, \nwhich puts restrictions on contributions for ads which advocate the \nelection or defeat of a candidate--that is the existing law--unless the \nSenator is proposing that, then it seems to me we should make that law \neffective and not put form over substance. And when you have two ads \nwhich are functionally the same and equivalent, treat one as though it \nis different from the other.\n  That is the issue which we are now facing on the floor, as to whether \nwe want to enforce existing law to eliminate what we call a loophole, \nwhich clearly is the avoidance of a magic word in an ad which \nfunctionally is the same and which any reasonable person would say \nunmistakably is calling for the defeat of Congressman Ganske, as an ad \nwhich uses the word ``defeat'' itself.\n  But, again, unless the Senator is calling for the repeal of existing \nlaw, it seems to me we are then in the situation where we are either \ngoing to make those limits work, those contribution limits work, which \nhave been approved by the Supreme Court in Buckley, or else we are \ngoing to continue the current system where those limits are evaded and \nwhere you have all this soft money which comes into these campaigns, \nwhich I don't think was the intent of our law when we adopted the \nreform that we did after Watergate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Sure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator talking about the Furgatch case?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have made a number of references to Furgatch.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry; I was not on the floor, and the Senator \nwas making the point that he thought the Furgatch case did what? \nIndicated that the restrictions on express advocacy in the McCain-\nFeingold bill would be constitutional?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the language of the Furgatch case is such that it \nis much more than the magic words which determine whether or not an \nadvertisement effectively supports the election or defeat of a \ncandidate. Just to read some of the language from Furgatch, what \nFurgatch does, of course, is look at that famous --as my good friend \nfrom Kentucky knows--footnote in the Buckley case, footnote 52, which \nuses seven magic words. The question is, are those the only words which \ndetermine whether or not an ad advocates expressly the election or \ndefeat of a candidate?\n  Here is the Furgatch test. Here is what the Furgatch case says:\n\n       We begin with the proposition that ``express advocacy'' is \n     not limited to communications using certain key phrases. The \n     short list of words included in the Supreme Court's opinion \n     in Buckley does not exhaust the capacity of the English \n     language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a \n     candidate. A test requiring the magic words ``elect,'' \n     ``support'' or their nearly perfect synonyms for a finding of \n     express advocacy would preserve the first amendment right of \n     unfettered expression only at the expense of eviscerating the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act. Independent campaign spenders \n     working on behalf of candidates could remain just beyond the \n     reach of the act by avoiding certain key words while \n     conveying a message that is unmistakably directed to the \n     election or defeat of a named candidate.\n\n  So they then provided an alternative test. We are now talking about \nthe ninth circuit in Furgatch, which says that the term ``express \nadvocacy'' means a communication that advocates the election or defeat \nof a candidate by expressing unmistakable and unambiguous support for \nor opposition to one or more clearly identified candidates when taken \nas a whole and with limited reference to external events such as \nproximity to an election.\n  Now, that test was basically adopted by the Federal Election \nCommission in its current regulation. So we have a current regulation \nwhich basically adopts the unmistakable test. Under the law, as I \nunderstand it, Congress had about 30 days within which to review that \nregulation. We did not overturn that regulation of the Federal Election \nCommission. It has to date, in a case which the Supreme Court refused \nto review, been left in limbo in the case.\n  The Supreme Court, by the way, it has been said in the Chamber here, \nstruck down Furgatch, or more accurately----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I didn't hear anyone say that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was just getting the exact wording.\n  I think today it was said in the Chamber that the Federal Election \nCommission test has been stricken by the Supreme Court's decision \ntoday, and that is simply not accurate.\n  What the Supreme Court decided today was not to review a case, not to \nreview a case from a court of appeals in which the Court said that the \nFederal Election Commission regulation was not constitutional. But we \nhave another court of appeals in the Furgatch case adopting language \nwhich is the basis of the Federal Election Commission regulation, and \nthe Supreme Court didn't review the ninth circuit's decision. So we \nhave two decisions unreviewed by the Supreme Court, the ninth circuit \ndecision with Furgatch language and a first circuit decision with the \nFEC language which is based on Furgatch----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. In which a key question was raised, in fact was thrown out \nas unconstitutional.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is my colleague from Michigan familiar with the \nFederal Election Commission versus Christian Action Network, which was \ndecided April 7 of this year? The language in that decision on page 7, \nI directly quote for my friend from Michigan:\n\n       Seven years later and less than a month following the \n     Court's decision in MCFL, the ninth circuit in FEC v. \n     Furgatch could not have been clearer that it, too, shared \n     this understanding of the Court's decision in Buckley. \n     Although the Court declined to strictly limit express \n     advocacy to the magic words of Buckley's footnote 52 because \n     that footnote list ``does not exhaust the capacity of the \n     English language to expressly advocate election or defeat of \n     a candidate,'' the entire premise of the Court's analysis was \n     that words of advocacy such as those recited in footnote 52 \n     were provided to support Commission jurisdiction over a given \n     corporate expenditure.\n\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\n\n  I think what the Supreme Court was saying, or what the fourth circuit \nwas saying is that there might be another way beyond the precise words \nof the footnote to expressly advocate the election or defeat, but that \nthat was basically it. There might be another way to say the same thing \nbeyond words actually chosen in footnote 52. But you are not permitted \nto wander further. Is that not the----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think there is a split in the circuits, and the fourth \ncircuit basically is close to where the first circuit is, and that is, \nas I understand it, also subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n  The ninth circuit has adopted the Furgatch test, which was then \nadopted by the Federal Election Commission. So we have a situation \nwhere we have circuits split. We have the ninth circuit adopting the \nFurgatch test, saying if something unmistakably calls for election or \ndefeat of a candidate, that amounts to the express advocacy which is \nprohibited--not prohibited but which is subject to limits and \nregulations of existing law. You have the fourth circuit and the first \ncircuit that have reached a different conclusion on that. So you have a \nsplit in the circuits, and today the Supreme Court as of this moment \ndecided to leave that split where it is, to leave that issue in limbo.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not sure how in limbo my friend from Michigan \nwould find denial of cert in a first circuit case which pretty clearly \nlaid out that language, much of which is in the underlying bill the \nSenator from Michigan supports, is unconstitutional. Does the Senator \nfrom Michigan find that vague?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Find what? Find it vague?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Vague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No; I find it very clear in the fourth and first circuits. \nBut I also find in the ninth circuit, a very clear opinion which reads, \nin part, as follows:\n\n       We begin with the proposition that ``express advocacy'' is \n     not strictly limited to communications using certain key \n     phrases. The short list of words included in the Supreme \n     Court's opinion in Buckley does not exhaust the capacity of \n     the English language to expressly advocate the election or \n     defeat of a candidate. A test requiring the magic words \n     ``elect,'' ``support,'' et cetera or their nearly perfect \n     synonyms for a finding of express advocacy, would preserve \n     the first amendment right of unfettered expression only at \n     the expense of eviscerating the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act.\n\n  I find those words to be very clear as well, to answer my friend from \nKentucky, but the Supreme Court did not accept cert in that case \neither. So we have the Supreme Court not accepting appeals from \ncircuits which have reached different conclusions. The answer to the \nquestion of my friend is I find the words of the fourth circuit clear, \nI find the words of the first circuit clear, and I find the words of \nthe ninth circuit clear. Very clear.\n  What could be clearer than a finding of the circuit court in the \nninth circuit that says, ``The short list of words included in the \nSupreme Court's opinion in Buckley does not exhaust the capacity of the \nEnglish language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a \ncandidate''?\n  It is a very clear statement.\n  The Supreme Court is going to have additional opportunities to \naddress this issue, because there are additional cases which will be \ncoming to the Supreme Court. Hopefully, they will see fit to resolve \nthe dispute between the circuits on this issue.\n  Just to briefly continue with the Furgatch court, the Furgatch court \nwent on to say the following:\n\n       First amendment doctrine has long recognized that words \n     take part of their meaning and effect from the environment in \n     which they are spoken. . . . However, context cannot supply a \n     meaning that is incompatible with or simply unrelated to the \n     clear import of the words. With these principles in mind, we \n     propose a standard for ``express advocacy'' that will \n     preserve the efficacy of the Act without treading upon the \n     freedom of political expression.\n\n  And here is the conclusion of the Furgatch court, again, left where \nit was by a Supreme Court about 10 years ago. So this is the law in the \nninth circuit. The Furgatch court said:\n\n       We conclude that speech need not include any of the words \n     listed in Buckley to be express advocacy under the Act, but \n     it must, when read as a whole, and with limited reference to \n     external events, be susceptible of no other reasonable \n     interpretation but as an exhortation to vote for or against a \n     specific candidate. . . . [S]peech is ``express'' for present \n     purposes if its message is unmistakable and unambiguous, \n     suggestive of only one plausible meaning.\n\n  That test, which I think most of us would agree is a real-world test, \nthat test was adopted by the Federal Election Commission by a vote of 4 \nto 2. It was adopted after extensive public debate. It was presented to \nthe Congress in 1995 under a mandatory 30-day period of review. It \nencountered no opposition here, and it encountered no opposition that I \nknow of in the House of Representatives. But, this issue has not been \nruled on by the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court, again, as we all \nknow, announced today that it declined to review a case out of the \nfirst circuit which went the other way from Furgatch, leaving a split \nin the circuits between those who do and those who don't approve of \nusing the Furgatch test to distinguish between candidate and issue ads.\n\n\n                              60-Day Rule\n\n  One final comment, and that relates to the so-called 60-day rule that \nis in section 201 of the McCain-Feingold bill, because this is a third \nway of distinguishing candidate ads from issue ads. The key provision \nreads as follows:\n\n       The term ``express advocacy'' means a communication that \n     advocates the election or defeat of a candidate by . . . \n     referring to one or more clearly identified candidates in a \n     paid advertisement that is broadcast within 60 calendar days \n     preceding the date of an election of the candidate and that \n     appears in the State in which the election is occurring. . . \n     .\n\n  We have seven magic words in a footnote which, if used at any time \nduring an election, will result in an ad being required to be paid for \nfrom regulated, limited funds. If any of those magic words, so-called, \nare used, the Supreme Court has said, that is evidence, indeed \ncompelling evidence, that the ad is an express advocacy ad for election \nor defeat of a candidate.\n  Now, what we do is add an eighth word, in addition to words like \n``defeat'' and ``elect'' and ``vote against'' and ``vote for.'' For 60 \ndays prior to an election we add a eighth word, the name of the \ncandidate.\n  It is pretty logical in an election. That is what a candidate ad is \nusually all about. When a candidate is named--in this ad, we have \nCongressman Ganske, Congressman Ganske, Congressman Ganske, Congressman \nGanske. The Supreme Court has said, if you use any of the words in the \nfootnote, that does it, that is express advocacy anytime during an \nelection. And if it is express advocacy for the election or defeat of a \ncandidate, you have to use the limited, regulated contributions. It has \nto be paid for according to the law which Congress has adopted, because \nwe wanted contributions which go to advocate the defeat or the election \nof a candidate for Federal office to be governed by contribution \nlimits.\n  In order to avoid the appearance of corruption--in the Supreme \nCourt's words that exists when you have unlimited funds going into \nthese elections--adding a eighth word to ``vote for, vote against, \ndefeat, elect,'' when that eighth word is the candidate's name in the \n60 days before an election, is fully consistent with what the Court \ndecided in Buckley. It is inside the spirit of it, and it implements \nthe purpose of our law which is on the books, and it is intended to \ncomply with what the Supreme Court said in Buckley is the legitimate \npurpose, public purpose of the Federal elections law.\n  They said we can restrict and limit contributions. They have said why \nit is good public policy to do so. They have said all of that. They \naffirmed our limit on contributions, despite the ACLU's opposition to a \nlimit on contributions.\n  The ACLU's name has been invoked here a number of times. The ACLU was \nwrong in Buckley. The ACLU, in Buckley, argued that the first amendment \ndid not permit restrictions on contributions. The Supreme Court did not \nfollow the ACLU in Buckley. They adopted a weighing test, and they have \nsince in a number of other cases.\n  So, what we are doing is saying, ``Here is another bright-line test. \nAdd to those seven words in that footnote, a eighth word, for 60 days \non licensed media, and reflect the real world.'' Because we really have \ntwo choices, it seems to me. One is to repeal the law which puts limits \non contributions. And many in this body, I think, favor the repeal of \nthe law that puts limits\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\non contributions. The other thing that we can do is to implement the \nlaw, to fully implement its purpose by closing a massive loophole which \nhas now been created, a loophole which allows for those contributions \nto be made in nonregulated funds to attack or support the election of \ncandidates to the same degree in any real world sense as does an ad \nwhich uses one of the magic words in that footnote.\n  The 60-day rule is a good-faith effort in McCain-Feingold to comply \nwith the Buckley decision. It is an honest effort to comply with the \nwords in the first amendment in the spirit of the first amendment. I \ndon't think any of us differ in terms of our love of this Constitution. \nI think everybody in this body would pass that test with flying colors \nas to whether we love our Constitution. I think all of us would also \nsay we want clean and fair elections; we want to avoid the appearance \nof corruption.\n  Where we differ is in the process, as to whether or not we want to \nrestrict contributions or whether or not we want them unlimited. For \nthose of us who feel that unlimited contributions contribute to the \nappearance of corruption--and the Supreme Court has said that there is \na legitimate public purpose in restricting unlimited contributions--for \nthose of us who feel that unlimited contributions lead to the kind of \nspending and attack ads that we saw in the 1996 election, we want to \nfill that loophole, we want to close that loophole which has been now \nopened so wide that it basically has destroyed the effectiveness of the \nlimit.\n  So the effort in McCain-Feingold is consistent with the first \namendment. We hope that this body will have an opportunity to adopt, or \nat least to vote on, McCain-Feingold. What we have done, in summary, is \nto adopt some bright-line rules which we feel carry out the Buckley \ndecision and close the issue ad loophole without infringing on the \nfirst amendment.\n  It is not an easy task, but these rules that we have added we believe \ndo it. The 60-day rule provides criteria that are clear and \nuncomplicated but narrowly tailored to the essentials of \nelectioneering.\n  Mr. President, we are facing a historic moment, and that moment is \nwhether or not we are going to restore limits to a system which was \nintended to have $1,000 per candidate per election. That is supposed to \nbe the law of the land. It has been evaded. It has been evaded with the \nsoft-money loophole, and we are going to, within the next 24 hours, \ncast the first vote determining whether or not we want to restore \nlimits, effective limits, on campaign contributions as the Supreme \nCourt in Buckley said that we can do.\n  I hope that we rise to this occasion. I think the American public has \nhad its fill of the unlimited variety. The status quo has no limits. \nEvery day the status quo is losing more and more of the public's \nconfidence, and it will, hopefully, be our lot to restore some of that \npublic confidence by effectively restoring the limits that were \nintended to be in this law all along but which have been evaded by the \nsoft-money loophole and the issue ads, as they are now called.\n  We've talked about some specific issue ads that have raised concerns. \nA broader analysis of issue ads is provided by a recently released \nstudy from the Annenberg Public Policy Center, an executive summary of \nwhich I've already included in the Record. This study takes a \nconcentrated look at so-called issue ads aired during the most recent \nelection cycle. It estimates that, in addition to the $400 million \nspent by candidates and political committees to broadcast candidate \nads, between $135 and $150 million was spent by parties and outside \ngroups to broadcast issue ads never reported to the FEC as independent \nexpenditures. The study notes that the total spent on these issue ads \nis approximately one-third of the total spent on broadcast ads by all \ncandidates for Federal office in 1995 and 1996.\n  The study catalogs over 100 specific so-called issue ads, a list \nwhich it states is incomplete. It then analyzes these ads, finding \namong other things that almost 90 percent mention a candidate by name, \nhalf the ads favor Democrats while the other half favors Republicans, \nand, compared to other types of political advertising, issue ads as a \ngroup were the highest in pure attack.\n  The study makes the following comments about the role of issue ads in \nthe 1996 elections:\n\n       This report catalogs one of the most intriguing and thorny \n     new practices to come onto the political scene in many \n     years--the heavy use of so-called `issue advocacy' \n     advertising by political parties, labor unions, trade \n     associations and business, ideological and single-issue \n     groups during the last campaign. . . .  This is \n     unprecedented, and represents an important change in the \n     culture of campaigns. . . .  To the naked eye, these issue \n     advocacy ads are often indistinguishable from ads run by \n     candidates. But in a number of key respects, they are \n     different. Unlike candidates, issue advocacy groups face no \n     contribution limits or disclosure requirements. Nor can they \n     be held accountable by the voters on election day. . . .  [A] \n     sharp imbalance has evolved over the past two decades in the \n     laws governing campaigns. One part of the electoral system--\n     the part that pertains to candidates--remains regulated, \n     while another part--one that pertains to advocacy groups and \n     political parties--is barely regulated or not regulated at \n     all. If you were a wealthy donor interested in affecting the \n     outcome of a campaign, but not interested in leaving any \n     fingerprints, it is pretty clear where you would put your \n     money.\n\n  I have quoted from the Annenberg study, because it is a study \nperformed by a nonpartisan group with long experience in tracking \nbroadcast ads during election campaigns. The conclusions drawn by this \nexpert, nonpartisan group, based upon a broad-ranging study of specific \nissue ads in the last election cycle, confirms what every Senator knows \nfrom personal experience. Issue ads have become a powerful, frequently \nused tool in Federal elections--an election tool that has nevertheless \nbeen able to evade compliance with campaign finance contribution limits \nand disclosure requirements.\n  The bottom line is that the actual experience of Congress during the \n20 years since Buckley is that issue ad abuse has spiraled out of \ncontrol and is now undermining not only the campaign finance system set \nup to deter corruption and educate the electorate, but also public \nconfidence in the integrity of that system. The abuse has reached \ncrisis proportions. The system is broken, and it is time to fix it.\n\n\n                mc cain-feingold provisions on issue ads\n\n  So what to do? How are we to stop issue ad abuse, plug the issue ad \nloophole that is swallowing the rules on candidate ads, and do so in a \nway consistent with our respect for the first amendment?\n  The McCain-Feingold bill offers two answers. First, it seeks to \ncurtail the soft money loophole that currently provides the bulk of \nfunding for so-called issue ads.\n  The second solution that the McCain-Feingold bill offers to the \nproblem of issue ad abuse is section 201 which takes on the knotty \nproblem of fairly distinguishing between true candidate ads that ought \nto comply with campaign finance laws and true issue ads that are not \ncampaign activity and legitimately should escape campaign finance \nrestrictions.\n  As we've discussed, section 201 tackles this problem by first \ncodifying the basic test set out in Buckley for distinguishing between \ncandidate and issue ads. It states that independent expenditures \ncovered by the Federal Election Campaign Act are communications which \nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified \ncandidate.\n  This general principle, first set out 20 years ago in Buckley, \nprovides the constitutional basis for laws that subject political \nspeech about candidates to such tough legal requirements as \ncontribution limits and disclosure requirements. Congress has not \npreviously codified this principle in the primary Federal campaign law. \nMcCain-Feingold would do so for the first time.\n  But codifying the general principle is not, of course, enough to stop \nissue ad abuse. The Supreme Court has already held that Congress can \nimpose contribution limits and disclosure requirements on ads that \nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of one or more clearly \nidentified candidates. The problem is how to identify those ads--the \nads that contain the express advocacy that the Supreme Court said must \nbe present to justify campaign finance requirements.\n  Section 201 offers three alternative ways for determining whether an \nad contains express advocacy. The first alternative would codify the \nso-called magic words test first articulated in\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\nthe Buckley decision. The magic words test, which we've all heard \nabout, says that if certain enumerated words are present in an ad, the \nad is express advocacy and must comply with Federal campaign laws. This \npart of section 201, which simply codifies Supreme Court case law, has \nnot engendered controversy.\n  Section 201 then offers two other ways to determine if an ad contains \nexpress advocacy. Some critics argue that the McCain-Feingold bill \nviolates the Constitution right there, because the Supreme Court has \nallegedly held that only one test of express advocacy is permissible--\nthe magic words test--and nothing more is constitutionally permitted.\n  Those critics go too far. Buckley never says that the magic words \ntest is the only permissible way to determine whether an ad expressly \nadvocates the election or defeat of a candidate. In fact, Buckley \nbarely discusses the magic words test. That magic words test, which \nsome claim controls the fate of candidate and issue ads, is set out in \none sentence in one footnote, footnote 52, which provides minimal \nguidance.\n\n  Here is footnote 52 and the magic words test in its entirety:\n\n       Footnote 52. This construction would restrict the \n     application of [Section] 608(e)(1) to communications \n     containing express words of advocacy of election or defeat, \n     such as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast your \n     ballot for,'' ``Smith for Congress,'' ``vote against,'' \n     ``defeat,'' ``reject.''\n\n  That's it. That's the whole footnote. That's the whole discussion of \nthe magic words test in all of Buckley. Critics who claim that the \nSupreme Court has held that this test is the only test that can be used \nto determine whether an ad contains express advocacy sufficient to \njustify campaign finance restrictions are going beyond the bounds of \nBuckley--the Supreme Court has simply not made that determination.\n  Many of us don't think the Supreme Court would go that far in \nelevating form over substance. Instead, we support the ninth circuit \nFurgatch test which I've quoted earlier and which is one of the three \ntests that section 201 of the McCain-Feingold bill seeks to codify. \nSection 201 words the Furgatch test as follows:\n\n       The term ``express advocacy'' means a communications that \n     advocates the election or defeat of a candidate by . . . \n     expressing unmistakable and unambiguous support for or \n     opposition to one or more clearly identified candidates when \n     taken as a whole with limited reference to external events, \n     such as proximity to an election.\n\nIf Federal campaign laws are to stop issue ad abuse, we have to be able \nto go after ads that unmistakably and unambiguously advocate the \nelection or defeat of a clearly identified candidate--including ads \nthat convey such information without once mentioning a magic word.\n  Finally, section 201 of the McCain-Feingold bill proposes using the \nso-called 60-day rule. Broken down to its essentials, this test \nrequires three elements for an ad to qualify as express advocacy: a \npaid broadcast on television or radio, a reference to a clearly \nidentified candidate, and a broadcast aired within 60 days of the \ncandidate's election.\n  This 60-day rule is a more limited version of a proposal first made \nby Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein. It is more limited in two ways. \nWhere the Mann-Ornstein proposal would have applied to all forms of \ncommunications, including newspaper ads, mailings, billboards and more, \nthe section 201 proposal is limited to ads broadcast on licensed \nairwaves. Where the Mann-Ornstein proposal suggested a 90-day \ntimeframe, the section 201 is limited to 60 days.\n  The limitation to broadcast ads is a narrowly tailored solution to \nthe problem of issue ad abuse.\n  The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on which I sit has received \nevidence of serious issue ad abuse outside the broadcast arena. For \nexample, the committee subpoenaed documents related to a 1996 million-\ndollar mailing and telephone effort by a group called Americans for Tax \nReform. This group claimed to be engaged solely in issue advocacy, but \na host of undisputed facts suggests otherwise, including the fact that \nthe Republican National Committee [RNC] donated $4.5 million to the \ngroup in October 1996--the largest donation a political party has ever \nmade to a private organization; the group used the money from the RNC \nto pay for the mailings and telephone calls; the mailings and calls \nwere orchestrated by a known partisan corporation with campaign \nexpertise; the mailings and calls targeted specific congressional \ndistricts; and the mailings and calls were timed to occur in the last \nfew weeks before the 1996 elections. These facts raise the same \nconcerns that exist with respect to broadcast issue ads--that people \nare gaming the system and mislabeling activities as issue advocacy \nsimply to circumvent campaign laws meant to ensure clean election and \nan informed electorate.\n  Despite this evidence of issue ad abuse outside the broadcast field, \nthe sponsors of the McCain-Feingold bill adopted the suggestion to \nlimit the 60-day test to ads aired on television or radio. They agreed \nthat this limitation would address the worst abuses involving so-called \nissue advocacy, while leaving untouched many other outlets for first \namendment expression. They also agreed that Supreme Court precedent \nunder the Red Lion series of cases, provide constitutional foundation \nfor a campaign finance law that addresses paid advertisements broadcast \non publicly licensed airwaves, but not other forms of political \nadvertising.\n  Second, the sponsors of the McCain-Feingold bill limited the \nprovision to a 60-day rather than 90-day period, again in an effort to \nnarrowly tailor the test to address the worst issue ad abuse--those ads \nthat are broadcast immediately before an election.\n  Third, the McCain-Feingold test is limited to ads that mention a \nclearly identified candidate. That means that anyone who wants to \npresent an issue ad during the 60-day period can easily avoid the \nextending laws' contribution limits and disclosure requirements simply \nby excluding mention of a specific candidate. Issue ads could direct \nviewers to ``Call Congress,'' ``Call Your Member of Congress,'' ``Call \nthe White House,'' or ``Call Washington''--none of which mentions a \nspecific candidate.\n  Alternatively, an issued ad whose sponsor felt that mentioning a \nspecific candidate was crucial to an effective communication would be \nfree to mention that candidate--the ad would just have to comply with \nthe same contribution limits and disclosure requirements that now apply \nto candidate advocacy. Those legal requirements have already passed \nconditional muster in the courts, and the $400 million spent on \ncandidate ads in the last election cycle is incontrovertible proof that \nthey do not stop speech.\n  Critics argue that, nothwitstanding our efforts to craft a narrowly \ntailored solution to issue ad abuse, the 60-day rule is overly broad. \nThey contend that the rule would unavoidably restrict the broadcast of \ntrue issue advocacy during the 60-day time period.\n  My response to this argument is that it ignores the past 20 years of \nexperience we have had with the ingenuity of those who want to use the \npublic airwaves to communicate their message.\n\n  Any rule that Congress develops to stop issue ad abuse will best pass \nconstitutional muster by providing bright line guidance in this area. \nTo date, the Supreme Court has explicitly approved one bright-line rule \nto distinguish candidate and issue ads--the magic words test--though we \nbelieve the Court will approve other carefully crafted tests. Since \nBuckley, we have seen that the magic words test has suffered wholesale \nevasion due to the ingenuity of ad sponsors in designing ads that send \nclear messages about candidates without once using a magic word.\n  The McCain-Feingold 60-day rule doesn't want to repeat that mistake. \nIts goal is not to fight first amendment ingenuity, but to harness it. \nIt does so by providing such simple, bright line guidance that it \nbecomes easy for any person who wants to discuss issues to avoid \ntriggering it. All they have to do is avoid mention of a candidate or \navoid the 60-day period. That's not very difficult to do. At the same \ntime, the rule intentionally makes it very difficult for anyone who \nwants to support or oppose a candidate to evade the campaign finance \nlaw, since it is pretty hard to advocate the election or defeat of a \ncandidate without mentioning the person at issue immediately before the \nelection.\n  The Supreme Court has already held that it is constitutionally \nacceptable\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\nfor seven magic words like ``elect'' or ``defeat'' in an advertisement \nto trigger contribution limits and disclosure requirements. The 60-day \nrule proposes adding an eighth magic word in ads broadcast during the \nlast 60 days before an election--a candidate's name.\n  The Supreme Court has already said that clean elections is so \ncompelling a state interest that it justifies contribution limits and \ndisclosure requirements. That is the law today. But the law is being \nevaded. Constantly. With hundreds of millions of dollars of TV ads. \nEvading the magic words test is not a hypothetical or theoretical \nproblem. It is an actual problem documented in the Annenberg study and \nin the personal campaign experiences that many of us have had.\n  If we want to stop issue ad abuse--to stop allowing candidate ads to \nmasquerade as issue ads in order to evade the law--we need to design \nbright line rules intended to work with rather than against ingenuity, \nand the endless possibilities of effective broadcast communication. We \nneed bright line rules that close the issue ad loophole without \ninfringing on the first amendment. It's not an easy task, but we think \nMcCain-Feingold does it. We think it does so in a constitutionally \npermissible manner, because it provides criteria that are clear and \nuncomplicated yet so narrowly tailored to the essentials \nof electioneering, that those who wish to engage in issue advocacy can \ndo so with minimal effort, while those who wish to engage in candidate \nadvocacy will be hard pressed to evade Federal contribution limits and \ndisclosure requirements.\n\n  Some will argue that Congress has no right to close the issue ad \nloophole. But those of us who believe stopping issue ad abuse is \ncritical to restoring effective campaign finance laws believe we have \ncrafted a minimally intrusive means to achieve the compelling public \ninterest of detering actual and perceived corruption which the Supreme \nCourt has said is ``inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial \ncontributions.''\n  One of the most important provisions in the McCain-Feingold bill is \nthe ban on soft money contributions to the political parties. But if \nCongress shuts down soft money to the political parties without also \neffectively stopping issue ad abuse, our campaign system might actually \nend up worse off than now. How? Because the hundreds of millions of \ndollars of unregulated, unlimited and undisclosed money that now flows \nto parties could be redirected to broadcasting issue ads that are \ncandidate ads in everything but name.\n  I have heard opponents of the bill claim that McCain-Feingold's \nexpress advocacy provisions would shut down the use of educational \nvoting guides that simply report candidates' voting records. In fact, \nthe bill creates an explicit safe harbor for exactly that type of \ncommunication. Section 201(b) explicitly includes a subsection \nentitled, ``Voting Record and Voting Guide Exception.'' It states that, \nso long as none of the 7 magic words in the Buckley footnote are used \nin the material, educational voting guides will not be deemed express \nadvocacy subject to campaign contribution limits and disclosure \nrequirements.\n  I and other authors of section 201 in the McCain-Feingold bill are \nwell aware of the difficulty of putting into statute an effective yet \neasily understood means of distinguishing candidate ads from issue ads. \nWe've worked hard to create constitutionally acceptable language. We \nthink the tests proposed in the McCain-Feingold bill are a significant \nimprovement over the status quo. It is a status quo that every day is \nlosing more of the public's confidence due to ongoing, wholesale \nevasion of the contribution limits and disclosure requirements that are \nsupposed to be safeguarding our electoral process.\n  Stopping issue ad abuse requires more than magic words. I urge my \ncolleagues to give the McCain-Feingold approach an opportunity to do \nbetter.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues for this long period of \ntime that I have taken.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Phony ``Issue Ads'' From the 1996 Campaign\n\n       Here are a few television advertisements, each aired during \n     the 1996 campaign, that illustrate the use of the ``issue \n     ad'' loophole to engage in flat-out electioneering: \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Transcripts originally published in ``Issue Advocacy \n     Advertising During the 1996 Campaign: A Catalog.''

Mr. President, the debate over campaign finance reform is \nwhat I like to call the ``News of the Day''. The media has been on a \nfeeding frenzy looking for angles to show that this issue had divided \nmembers of Congress. That it had divided the members of the same party. \nThere there is a cry of outrage across America as people stand by ready \nto storm the Capitol in protest.\n  But despite the massive media hype, the public really doesn't care \nabout the campaign finance reform issue. In the most recent ABC News/\nWashington Post poll--where people were asked about the most important \nproblems facing the country--campaign finance reform did not even \nappear as one of the top 10 items on the list. In fact, it didn't \nappear at all. The same stands true for the latest CBS News poll, the \nlatest CNN/Gallup Poll, and even last month's L-A Times poll. After \nextensive research of all the major polls, campaign finance has not \nshowed up as a concern among American at all.\n  What is important to the American people are issues like crime, the \neconomy, health care, education, social security, and the moral decline \nof the country. What people really care about is whether their children \nwill get safely back and forth from school--and whether they'll get a \ngood education in the public schools. They care about keeping their \njobs and trying to make ends meet while they watch a good portion of \ntheir hard earned money going to Washington to support a wasteful and \ninefficient Federal Government bureaucracy. They care about their \nfuture--whether they can save enough money to retire some day--and \nacquire affordable health care. These are real concerns of Americans \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\n  Now let's just support for a minute that people actually did care \nabout campaign finance reform. That they sat around the dinner table at \nnight and said ``How was your day at the office, oh, and by the way, we \nreally need more campaign finance laws.\n  What Americans really need to know are the details about the campaign \nfinance laws that are currently on the books. And then they need to \nknow about the appalling campaign finance practices that were part of \nPresident Clinton's reelection effort--and how the campaign finance \nissues is being used to divert attention away from these scandals.\n  And they need to know what Congress wants to do to reform the \ncampaign finance laws and level the paying field so neither political \nparty has an unfair advantage over another.\n  They need to know what we've going to do to make all political \ncontributions voluntary--so that no person--union or nonunion worker--\nis forced to pony up their money for political purposes without their \nexpressed permission.\n  And, they need to know what we're going to do to give them complete \nand immediate access to campaign contribution records about who gave \nhow much to whom.\n  This prompt and full disclosure of so-called soft money campaign \ndonations will make the name of the donors public, aid allow the voters \nto decide if the candidate is looking after their best interest. Under \nthe McCain-Feingold plan, there would be an across-the-board ban on \nsoft money for any Federal election activity.\n  Let me first recognize my colleagues who have worked on this issue at \ngreat length and in good faith. I have nothing but the deepest respect \nfor both Senators McCain and Feingold in their tenacity and diligence \nto bring this issue to the attention of the public. I agree with some \nof their points of disagree with others--and I will continue to do so \nduring the course of this debate.\n  As for the ban on soft money, I have several major reservations on \nhow this measure would ultimately impact the current campaign finance \nsystem.\n  Not improving it, but creating such a hardship on the country's State \nand local political parties that it would force them to concentrate on \nraising money in order to exist.\n  Under the McCain-Feingold proposal to ban soft money, State and local \nparty committees would be prohibited from spending soft money for any \nFederal election activity.\n  Right now, State and local political parties receive so-called soft \nmoney from the national political parties. Here in Washington, both the \nRepublican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee \nreceive money from donors.\n  Some of that money is then distributed to the respective political \nparties in counties and localities all over the country. There are \nthousands of State, county, and local party offices that receive this \nfinancial aid. Then--under certain conditions--the money is used for \nactivities such as purchasing buttons, bumper stickers, posters, and \nyard signs on behalf of a candidate. The money is also used for voter \nregistration activities on behalf of the party's Presidential and Vice \nPresidential nominees. The money is also used for multicandidate \nbrochures and even sample ballots.\n  Let's say it's election day. You go down to your local polling site--\nwhether it's a school, a church or the American Legion hall. Sometimes \nthere's a person there who will hand you what's called a sample \nballot--listing all the candidates running for office who are in your \nparty. Like most voters, you are more likely to choose the candidates \nof your party.\n  But under the McCain-Feingold proposal, it will be against the law to \nuse soft money to pay for a sample ballot with the name of any \ncandidate who's running for Congress on the same sample ballot with \nState and local candidates of the same party.\n  Under McCain-Feingold, it will be against the law to use soft money \nto pay for buttons, posters, yard signs, or brochures that include the \nname or picture of a candidate for Federal office on the same item that \nhas the name or picture of State and local candidates.\n  Under McCain-Feingold, it will be against the law to use soft money \nto conduct a local voter registration drive 120-days before a Federal \nelection.\n  Because of these new laws in the McCain-Feingold plan, State and \nlocal party officials will have to use hard money instead of soft money \nfor these activities.\n  Let's look at the reality of this situation. Because of these new \nrestrictions, local party officials--say like the Republican Party \nchairman in Caldwell, ID--will be forced to seek out hard money \ndonations from local businesses and individuals to fund these political \nactivities.\n  In a town of just 2,000 people, this party official--who is a \nvolunteer--now has to spend more of his or her time fundraising, not to \nmention the fact that those with more money stand a better chance of \nwinning an election. Party affiliation will become insignificant. In \nother words, raising hard money will become a bigger concern for these \nState and local officials than ever before. And, whomever raises the \nmost money can then fund more political activities.\n  Mr. President, what kind of campaign finance reform is this? We have \njust added more laws to a system that's already heavily regulated, \nincreased the burden on thousands of State and local party officials \nforcing them to go out and raise money, and created more confusion for \nthe voters. If the point of the McCain-Feingold plan is to reform the \ncampaign finance system, the last thing you want to do is ban soft \nmoney.\n  Instead, full and immediate public disclosure of campaign donations \nwould be a much more logical approach. With the help of the latest \ntechnology, we could post this information on the Internet within 24 \nhours. Let's open up the records for everyone to see.\n  Anyone interested in researching the integrity of a campaign, or in \nfinding out the identity of the donors, or in looking for signs of \nundue influence or corruption would only have to have access to a \ncomputer. They could track a campaign--dollar for dollar--to see first \nhand where the money is coming from.\n  But Mr. President, what bothers me the most about the McCain-Feingold \nproposal is not what's in the bill, but what has been left out. it is, \nwhat the majority leader called the other day, ``the great scandal in \nAmerican politics * * * and worst campaign abuse of all.'' That is the \nforced collection and expenditure of union dues for political purposes.\n  Mr. President, this is nothing short of extortion.\n  Let me make myself clear, I fully support the right of unions and \nunion workers to participate in the political process. they should be \nencouraged to become involved and active in the electoral process. it's \nnot only their right but their civic responsibility.\n  Back in my home State of Idaho, I meet with union workers in union \nhalls, on the streets, and in their homes. And I hear their complaints, \ntheir anger and their outrage over how their dues are being spent and \nmishandled by national union officers.\n  They say to me ``Senator Craig (Larry), every month I am forced to \npay dues that are used for political purposes I don't agree with. But \nwhat can I do? If I speak out, they'll call me a troublemaker * * *''\n  During the 1996 elections alone, union bosses tacked on an extra \nsurcharge on dues to their members in order to raise $35 million to \ndefeat Republican candidates around the country. It's likely they used \nmuch more of the worker's money than they reported, but I'm sure we'll \nnever find out the truth.\n  But under the Paycheck Protection Act, offered by Senators Lott and \nNickles, union workers will have new and expanded rights and the final \nsay on how their money is being spent. The legislation not only \nprotects the rights of union workers, but also makes it clear that \ncorporations adhere to the same measure.\n  Unions and corporations would have to get the permission in writing \nfrom each employee prior to using any portion of dues or fees to \nsupport political activities. And, workers will have the right to \nrevoke their authorization at any time.\n  Finally, employees would be guaranteed the protection that if their \nmoney was used for purposes against their will, it would be a violation \nof federal\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\ncampaign law. Mr. President, this is commonsense legislation and it's \nthe right thing to do.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, once again, I rise to discuss an issue that \nin the recent past has generated lots of talk and not much action--\ncampaign finance reform. But thanks to the hard work of my colleagues--\non both sides of the aisle--we may finally be on the brink of actually \ndoing something to address the many problems we have with our system \nfor financing election campaigns.\n  Thanks to the tireless efforts of our colleagues, Senators McCain and \nFeingold, we now know that the question is not whether a bill will come \nto the floor, but whether we will pass the bill that they have brought \nus. Keeping that in mind, I want to speak a bit today on why I will \nsupport the measure currently before us.\n  As an original cosponsor of McCain-Feingold, I agree that what is \nnecessary is a comprehensive overhaul of the way we conduct our \ncampaign business. If we have learned anything from our experiences in \nthe last few elections, it is that money has become too important in \nour campaigns. Mr. President, in the last election Federal candidates \nand their allies spent over $2 billion--$2 billion--in support of their \ncampaigns. The McCain-Feingold bill currently before us, I believe, is \nthe sort of sweeping reform that we must pass if we are to restore \npublic trust and return a measure of sanity to the way we finance \nelections.\n  Now each of us has his or her own perspective on what's wrong with \nthe system. For me, Mr. President, it's the explosive cost of \ncampaigning. When I announced in March that I would not seek \nreelection, I said: Democracy as we know it will be lost if we continue \nto allow Government to become one bought by the highest bidder, for the \nhighest bidder. Candidates will simply become bit players and pawns in \na campaign managed and manipulated by paid consultants and hired guns. \nThe problem becomes clearer when you look at specifics. In my case, \nwhen I first was elected to the Senate, I spent less than $450,000--\nactually, $437,482--on my campaign. Back them, I thought that was a lot \nof money. If only I'd known. Mr. President, if I hadn't decided to \nretire, for next year's election I would have had to raise $4.5 \nmillion. Now, I know all about inflation but that's not inflation--\nthat's madness. What's worse, I understand that if we continue on this \npath, by the year 2025 it will cost $145 million to run for a single \nSenate seat. Can any of us imagine what our country will look like when \nthe only people who can afford public service are people who have--or \ncan raise--tens of millions of dollars for their campaigns? I can't \nimagine such a future, Mr. President--and the time is now to make sure \nthings never get that bad. McCain-Feingold won't cure everything that \nails the current system, but I support it because it represents a real, \nmeaningful first step toward restoring a sense of balance in our \ncampaigns by ensuring that people and ideas--not money--are what \nmatters. Specifically, I support McCain-Feingold because it deals with \na series of disturbing issues that have grown in importance in recent \nyears.\n  I also agree that a primary problem with the current system is the \nflood of soft money. But when I speak of soft money, Mr. President, I \nwant to make it clear that we are talking about more than just the \nfundraising of the national parties. True--in 1996, the parties raised \nover a quarter billion dollars in soft money, which they then used in \nvarious ways to support their candidates at every level of the ballot. \nThat's a lot of money, but it's only a small part of the total so-\ncalled soft money picture. That's because soft money, is any money that \nis not regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act. That includes \nnational party money, of course, but it also includes the millions of \ndollars raised and spent by corporations, unions, interest groups, and \ntax-exempt organizations. Our recent experience shows that these \norganizations are established, operated, and financed by parties and \ncandidates themselves--and their finances are totally unregulated. \nTherefore, McCain-Feingold is meaningful reform because it recognizes \nthat the problem is not just soft money, it is unregulated money.\n\n  The McCain-Feingold bill currently before us is also valuable because \nit recognizes that closing the party soft money loophole is not enough. \nThe bill also addresses the problem of so-called issue advoacy \nadvertising. These so-called issue ads have developed as a new--and \nsometimes devious--way that unregulated money is used to affect \nelections. Lawyers might call it issue advocacy, but I'm not a lawyer \nso I call it what it really is, handoff funding. Handoff funding is \nwhere a candidate hands off spending, usually on hardhitting negative \nads, to a supposedly neutral third party whose finances are completely \nunregulated and not disclosed. Now I know there are those who call \nthese ads free speech. But this isn't free speech, it's paid speech. Of \ncourse we need to respect the Constitution, but we can't let people \nhide behind the Constitution for their own personal or partisan gain. \nMcCain-Feingold draws this paid speech into the light where not the \nlawyers but the jury--the American people--can decide which issues and \nwhich candidates they will support.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond just a moment to the claim of many \nof my Republican colleagues that McCain-Feingold's issue advocacy \nreform somehow limits free speech. That simply is not true. When this \nbill passes, not one ad that ran in the last election--not one, not \neven the worst attack ad--will be illegal. What McCain-Feingold would \ndo is say to those candidates and groups who have been using handoff \nfunding to puff themselves up or tear down their opponents--all the \nwhile claiming that they were simply, quote, advocating issues--is that \nwithin 60 days of the election they must take credit for their work, \ndirty or otherwise. The only people whose speech will be prevented by \nthis law are people who are afraid to step into the light and be seen \nfor who they are. That, Mr. President, is what I call reform--and I \nthink the American people would agree.\n  Another critical issue addressed in McCain-Feingold--and this is one \narea, I think, where we all are in nearly unanimous agreement--is the \nquestion of disclosure. Currently there is too much campaign activity--\ncontributions and spending--that is not disclosed to the public on a \nregular, timely basis. We must commit ourselves, as does McCain-\nFeingold, to providing the American people with timely and full \ndisclosure to information about political spending, and the means by \nwhich they can access that information. Like many colleagues, I believe \nthat the Internet and electronic filing is the way to make this happen; \nbut I hope we will make it clear that all campaign finances--including \nthird-party issue advocacy--are to be disclosed before we get too \nworried about how such disclosure would take place.\n\n  Mr. President, all these reforms will be meaningless unless we are \nwilling to do right by the Federal Election Commission. If the FEC \nreally is the toothless tiger that many people say it is, we must take \nat least some of the blame for removing its teeth. Any bill that makes \nchanges to the campaign finance laws without restoring the FEC's \nfunding and improving its ability to publicize, investigate, and punish \nviolations cannot truly claim the title of reform.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I know that we will not have an easy \nroad to passage of campaign finance reform legislation. In this body \nthere are a number of colleagues who are opposed to reform and aren't \nafraid to speak their minds about the quote, danger, of reform. Mr. \nPresident, I can't blame them. If I had the advantage of millions of \ndollars from wealthy folks and millions more from corporations and \nspecial interests, I would think reform was dangerous, too, and I would \nhave to think twice before supporting a bill that took away that \nadvantage. Their opposition--whether in the public interest or their \nself-interest--means that the debate on this issue will get more than a \nfew of us into a real lather. I'll take that challenge, Mr. president. \nJust because campaign finance reform will be difficult, and might \nrequire each party to give up things it cares about or simply has \ngotten used to, is no reason not to pass McCain-Feingold, and soon.\n  All we need to do is to rollup our sleeves and remember the wisdom of \nthat great Kentuckian Henry Clay, who called compromise ``mutual \nsacrifice.'' Our way is clear, if not easy,\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\nbut I have confidence that we will do what is right to restore public \nconfidence in the way we fund our campaigns. I look forward to the \ncontinuing debate, and to demonstrate to the American people that we \nare serious about cleaning up the system by voting for comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \ncampaign finance reform; an issue which has been before the Senate in \nrecent days.\n  Like many members of this Chamber, I count myself on the side of \nthose favoring reform. The question is: what type of reform will have \nthe most positive impact on our electoral system.\n  As this debate has evolved, I have spent considerable time \nidentifying priorities. I have divided these priorities into two \nseparate categories. The first category is comprised of those standards \nor tests that any reform legislation must meet in order to receive my \nsupport. The second category constitutes a set of objectives which I \nbelieve should, as opposed to must, be included in any reform \nlegislation.\n  Let me begin by listing the standards or tests that I believe must be \nmet by any reform legislation.\n  First, we must act in a manner that is consistent with the first \namendment of the Constitution of the United States. Mr. President I \nwill not support a campaign finance reform bill that establishes any \nkind of prior restraint on political speech or empowers any federal \nbureaucracy to constrain first amendment rights. That is why earlier \nthis year I opposed the constitutional amendment presented to the \nSenate which would have allowed Congress and its agents, including the \nFederal Election Commission, to place constraints on first amendment \nrights.\n  Mr. President, The first amendment to the Constitution and its \nguarantees of political speech are fundamental. We must not allow any \nFederal legislation to circumvent them, or attempt to circumvent them.\n  My second priority with respect to campaign finance legislation is \nthat it must not impede or intrude on the prerogatives of the States \nand local units of government with respect to how they conduct \npolitical campaigns. To that end, Mr. President, I will scrutinize any \nlegislative proposal very carefully to determine not only whether it \nexplicitly encroaches on State and/or local election law, but also \nwhether it sets in motion a process which ultimately could require such \nintrusion in the future.\n  Any campaign finance reform legislation must also, in my judgement, \nmaintain a proper balance between the first amendment rights of the \nactual candidates and the political parties they represent and the \nrights of those who are not directly in the arena. Mr. President, I \nhave watched with interest in recent years as special interest groups \nand others who exist to promote particular issue positions and \nideologies have become increasingly active in the electoral process. \nThrough so-called advocacy advertising and independent expenditures \nthese groups have become dominant in many Federal elections. And, as \nthey have grown in dominance, they have diminished the roles of the \ncandidates and political parties.\n  Of course, our first amendment permits this. It is perfectly \nappropriate for anyone, either individually or in collaboration with \nothers, to advocate their views on issues and campaigns. Moreover, the \nSupreme Court has ruled that if this is done independently of Federal \ncandidates and the political parties, such individuals or groups may \nspend vast amounts of resources--well beyond donation limits permitted \nunder Federal law--in furtherance of their causes and candidates.\n  What this has led to, of course, is an environment in which political \ncampaigns are now increasingly a function of the efforts of special \ninterests groups, rather than of the candidates and political parties. \nAccordingly, we must be very careful, as we enact any campaign \nfinancing reforms, to make certain that we do not totally tilt the \nbalance away from the candidates and parties. Otherwise, Mr. President \nwe will end up with a system in which the candidates themselves are \nmore bystanders than participants and in which the various interest \ngroups on all sides of all the issues are doing all of the talking. In \nmy judgement, this would completely undermine the concept of \nrepresentative democracy and I will not support legislation that \nenhances the prospects of such an environment.\n  In addition to these requirements, any campaign reform legislation we \npass must be balanced. It can not be one-sided in favor of any \nparticular political party or cause. Frankly, Mr. President, one of our \nparties likes the bill before us too much for my taste. I don't blame \nthem, but it clearly focuses more on constraining sources which fund \nRepublicans than Democrats.\n  To their credit, I think the sponsors of the legislation have \nendeavored to move in a more balanced direction. That's why the \nlegislation before us has been modified from its original version. But \nin my judgment it isn't there yet.\n  Finally Mr. President, to have my support, any new campaign finance \nlegislation must address what I find in my State to be the most \ndisturbing aspect of the way American Federal elections are funded: \nnamely, the increasing extent to which the campaigns of candidates for \nthe House and Senate are financially supported by people who are not \neven constituents of the candidates themselves.\n  When I travel around my State and conduct town meetings, and the \nissue of campaign finance reform is raised, I ask people what disturbs \nthem the most. Almost every time I hear the same answer--that \nindividuals, political action committees, and special interest groups \nwho don't even live in Michigan are bank-rolling the campaigns of \nMichigan's Members of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I have not conducted a thorough study of this issue \nbut I do know that a large percentage of the money flowing into almost \nevery campaign comes from individuals who are not the constituents of \nour elected officials. In fact, in many instances, Members of the House \nand Senate actually receive a majority of their campaign funds from \npeople they don't even represent.\n  In my view this, more than anything else, is what has undermined \npublic confidence in our system. Sure, people are upset because of \nlarge personal or corporate or labor contributions to the national \nparties. But I think what galls them even more is the fact that their \nown representatives in Washington are being financed by people from \nother States or even other countries. Thus, to have my support, a \ncampaign finance reform bill must seek to address this glaring problem.\n  Obviously, the first amendment places certain constraints on how this \ncan be accomplished. In fact, some argue that requiring a certain \npercentage of funds to come from the candidate's State would not meet a \nconstitutional test. I think that's actually a close call and that such \na reform would be constitutional. By the same token, though, I believe \nwe can achieve the same general objective, and not raise a \nconstitutional challenge, by simply adjusting the donor limits, based \non whether or not the donors are contributing to someone who represents \nthem.\n  Whether this is accomplished by increasing the personal contribution \nlimit for constituents, decreasing the limits for non-constituents, or \na combination of both is a question we can look into. But I think such \na change would move us in the right direction. It would mean that more \ntime would be spent raising money from constituents, and it would mean \nthat the people we represent would produce a far greater percentage of \nthe resources involved in our campaigns. These results would greatly \nincrease our constituents' confidence that we are here to serve them.\n  These, then, are the five tests or standards by which I will measure \nany election reform effort. For my vote, any piece of legislation must \nmeet all of these tests. Also, I would note Mr. President, that I have \nseparately introduced a campaign reform bill which I believe \naccomplishes these objectives. At the same time, there are several \nother issues which I think should be addressed in a campaign finance \nreform bill. While not indispensable to the legislation from the \nstandpoint of my support, I consider them to be very important matters \nthat must be focused on either at this time or in some future context.\n\n[[Page S10420]]\n\n  First, I believe we must put an end to any explicit or implicit \ninvolvement of foreign money in political campaigns. As the Thompson \nhearings have gone forward, and the investigations of the financing of \nthe 1996 campaign reported, I have been increasingly disturbed at the \nprospect that a foreign government would endeavor to influence American \nforeign policy through campaign donations. We need real teeth in our \nfederal statutes to prevent this from ever happening.\n  In addition, a campaign finance reform bill should include fuller \ndisclosure than that which is presently required. I believe campaigns \nwhich reach a certain level of activity ought to be reporting, on-line, \ntheir contributions in a much more timely fashion. I also believe that \nindependent committees should be required to make the same type of \ntotal disclosure. The increasing role that advocacy advertising and \nindependent expenditures are playing in our campaigns demand that the \nfunding sources for such activities be disclosed and made available as \npart of the campaign debate.\n  Third, I believe there should be more democracy with respect to the \nactivities of political action committees. Whether it's labor PAC's, \ntrade association PAC's, issue advocacy PAC's or corporate PAC's, the \nleaders of our political action committees too often act in a fashion \ninconsistent with the wishes of the very people whose money they are \nspending. I think this is wrong. I think our campaign finance reform \nbill should create a mechanism by which donors to PAC's are able to \neasily indicate at least the political parties, if not the specific \ncandidates, they want their fund to benefit. Such a reform in my view \nwould much more effectively justify the existence of political \ncommittees in the future.\n  Finally, with respect to my list of things that should be included in \na campaign finance reform bill is the subject of fundraising in \ngovernment buildings. Evidently, the question of what can and can not \nbe done within Federal buildings and on Federal property is in need of \nclarification. I suggest that we eliminate any uncertainty that might \ncurrently exist and expressly prohibit such practices once again.\n  Mr. President, this then constitutes the context in which I believe \ncampaign finance reform must be addressed. As we move forward with \namendments and develop a bill, I will be monitoring our progress to \ndetermine whether the priorities I've established here today are \nsatisfactorily addressed. Legislation which does so will receive my \nbacking. Legislation which fails to accomplish these objectives will \nnot.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would also make several additional \npoints. Contrary to the innuendoes contained in much of the media \ncoverage of campaign financing I believe the Members of this body \nconduct their official business in a fully honorable and respectable \nfashion. While the way we finance elections sometimes gives rise to the \nappearance of impropriety, the truth is that the Members of the Senate \nare motivated by and act on the basis of long established personal \nphilosophies and not campaign donations.\n  I would say without question that the proponents of the legislation \nbefore us are fine examples of people whose integrity is unquestioned. \nIf tomorrow Senator McCain found himself with Senator Feingold's \ncontributors and vice-versa, I do not believe either would cast one \nvote or take one action differently than is their current pattern, and \nI feel that way about the other Members of this body as well.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that we say these things and \nthat we not allow the innuendos and criticisms to go totally \nuncontested.\n  At the same time, though, as we struggle to find consensus \nlegislation, I think all of us have an obligation to take personal \naction--regardless of what the election financing laws might be at a \nparticular point in time--to reassure our constituents that we are \nacting in an appropriate fashion.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I'm tired of hearing political figures on the \none hand condemn the way we finance elections and then on the other \nhand engage in all of the conduct they purportedly abhor, based on the \nrationale that they will not unilaterally disarm themselves.\n  Instead of exclusively focusing our energies on passing legislation \nin an effort to, in theory, save us from ourselves, I think each of us \nshould undertake those actions we determine to be most appropriate to \naddress the perception problems which exist regarding campaigns. I \nthink we should set these examples regardless of what the campaign \nfinance laws might permit.\n  If we think it's wrong to receive a disproportionate amount of our \ncampaign contributions from out of our States, then we should stop \ntaking a disproportionate amount of contributions from out of our \nStates. Similarly, if we think independent committees operating on our \nbehalf or in support of our efforts are acting in an inappropriate \nfashion, we should say so clearly, publicly and definitively.\n  Instead of simply debating campaign finance reform while conducting \nbusiness as usual, I think every Member of this Chamber who feels \nstrongly about these issues should take some action, independent of \nanything that might happen legislatively, to make the system better. I \nintend to do so, Mr. President, regardless of what the outcome might be \nof these campaign finance reform efforts. If that means I am \ndisadvantaged in my campaign should I decide to seek re-election, so be \nit. In fact, Mr. President, during my campaign in 1994 I unilaterally \nacted to limit the flow of PAC and out-of-state dollars to my \ncandidacy.\n  Instead of simply waiting around for Congress to act, I will move \nahead on my own. I hope other Members will do the same and that we \nmight lead by example.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on the issue of campaign reform, the words \nI speak here might not climb to the intellectual level of \nconstitutional dialog as others who are more versed in the subject. I \ndon't think it has to go that high. I think the simpler we keep it, the \neasier it will be for the American people to understand what we are \ntrying to do.\n  I want to premise this by saying that I believe, and strongly \nbelieve, in four basic principles:\n  We should abide by current law.\n  We should have full and timely disclosure.\n  All contributions to campaigns must be voluntary contributions.\n  And, yes, we have to abide by the first amendment of the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  Through this debate, a debate, I might add, whose time has come, a \nlot will be said of the good and not so good points of the pending \nlegislation, which, basically, right now is the new McCain-Feingold \nlegislation. It does address some of the concerns that I have had from \nthe beginning. However, I am still bewildered by one basic question in \nthis whole process that we have been through since Christmas a year \nago: Why is it, no matter what law we have, that it has become common \npractice to ignore the law?\n  I suggest to my colleagues, after all is said and done--and maybe \nmore will be said than done--but to change our existing campaign \nfinance law, one important question remains to be answered: Why do we \nreform or rewrite? Why don't we just abide by current law?\n  It is only logical to me that the best campaign reform is to enforce \ncurrent law. If one or a series of campaign laws have been broken, it \nis clear to me that the enforcement of such laws should take center \nstage in every case. Indicting the breakers of the law, the alleged \nviolators, would do more to reform campaign finance practices than any \nproposed legislation that we could ever pass through this body.\n  Think about that a little bit. Indicting the alleged violators of \npresent law\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\nto make them stand for their practices would do more than any reform we \ncould do for campaign practices that is before us today. It is very \nsimple.\n  Volume 18, United States Code, section 607 clearly prohibits \nsoliciting and receiving contributions in a Federal building. I quote:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive \n     any contribution in any room or building occupied in the \n     discharge of official duties.\n\n  No one has ever been prosecuted under this statute.\n  To reiterate what many others have stated as a matter of fact, in the \n1996 election cycle, that law was allegedly broken. In fact, Mr. \nPresident, it was clearly established during Senator Thompson's \nhearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee that that was the case. \nThe offending parties have not been brought to the altar of justice. \nYet, the alleged violators contend that they have sent millions of \ndollars back to their original donors after the election.\n  What does that say? What does that tell us? How is it that we, as a \nnation, became a nation where we do not enforce the law? It seems that \na patrolman in Montana today was in town enforcing the law. What is the \ndifference?\n  It plainly states--and I quote--``any person who violates this \nsection shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than \nthree years, or both.''\n  Now, if it has been broken, it should be enforced. If we would \nenforce the law, if we would indict the alleged violators, arrest, \npresent them to a judge and a jury, I think that would do more than \nanything we can do in changing the law before us.\n  You know, Mr. President, I spent a long time refereeing football. We \nare in football season. It catches everybody's imagination--the Super \nBowl, everything. I am wondering why that game can hold the order that \nit does.\n  Let me tell you, I thought about that a long time. In order to \ncapture the imagination of the American people, there has to be some \norder to it, it has to be competitive, it has to be fair.\n  So the first thing that happens is there is only one rule book. The \nrules for high school or college or professional football is the same \nin Kentucky as it is in California as it is in Colorado--one \nfederation.\n  And why is it on Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon four old men \nin striped shirts can go down on a field of 22 of the most mobile, \nhostile, heavily armored people intent on doing each other in and they \nhave very few problems? No. 1, the rules are enforced on both sides of \nthe ball. And, No. 2, that old man in a striped shirt is the arresting \nofficer, he is the judge and the jury, he is the penal officer, and he \ndoes it all in 30 seconds.\n  A young man can haul off and slug his opponent. The referee sees it, \nthrows the flag. That is the arrest. The judge and jury--you are \nguilty. ``So, 15 yards against your team and, you, young man, are out \nof the football game.'' He can say, ``I come from a broken family.'' It \ndoesn't say anything in that rule book about that. The rule book says, \n``Thou shalt not hit thy opponent with the open hand. If thou doest, \nyour team will be penalized 15 yards and you will get to watch the rest \nof the football game.'' It does not make any difference who you are, \nwhat you are; you are out of there.\n  So everybody understands the rules, everybody understands the \npenalties. It is all done in 30 seconds. And they are enforced \nimmediately. And after an hour of play on the field, we have very few \nproblems.\n  What are we missing in real life when we start talking about that? No \ndoubt that the White House made phone calls from the White House. They \nclaim the law doesn't apply to them. It has never been tested in court. \nSomebody has to file charges.\n  Here in the Senate there is one simple rule, one simple rule here in \nthe U.S. Senate: Do not make fundraising calls from your office. It is \nnot acceptable in any form, not by phone, not in person, not in \nletters, and not by hosting events. And basically common sense would \ntell you, do not put the taxpayers' property at the disposal of your \ncampaign.\n  We keep hearing about that we need to change the laws. What I am \nsaying here basically is, just obey the laws we have now. We cannot \nturn a blind eye to the fact that 938 people stayed overnight in the \nWhite House between 1992 and 1996 and they raised over $10 million, and \nthat 103 coffees raised $26 million over 18 months. All of these \nactivities are clearly established by the hearings. The law is very \nclear. To misunderstand or to refer to loopholes, I think, is just \nabsurd.\n  To comment on the newly revised McCain-Feingold legislation, I am \npleased to see that some of those steps have been made in the right \ndirection on this piece of legislation. The authors certainly have \nimproved it from its original version. Unfortunately, however, it is \nnot in a comprehensive form.\n\n  That is why I commend the leader for what he has done because a major \ntenet to campaign finance reform should be that all Montanans, all \nAmericans, who desire to give money or to participate in any way in a \npolitical campaign, do it voluntary. That is all we are asking. I do \nnot want anybody to tell me where I have to give my money. If you do \nnot want to contribute, you should not have to.\n  No one should be forced to do that, no political party, nobody, \nwhatever, no organization should have the power to collect dues or any \nother form of payment for political uses without receiving consent.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill contains the Beck language, but that leaves \na lot to be desired. And in some cases it is not as fair as it could be \nor should be. It allows union members to receive a refund upon request. \nBut that union member must give up his union privileges at that moment. \nYou are not allowed both. You cannot choose whether or not to make \npolitical contributions and still be a member of the organization.\n  So the Paycheck Protection Act is not a poison pill. It is a right. \nIt is a basic right. It is a basic right for every man and woman and \nchild in this country, whether to give funds or your services or your \nlabors for a candidate, for a political party, or a ballot issue. It \nmakes no difference. You should do it voluntarily. It is just a basic \nAmerican freedom.\n  So this provision, the Paycheck Protection Act, I think we can all \nagree on that, that all contributions should be voluntary. That is the \nreason that is important, for no one person, no one group, no \nassociation should be able to spend your hard-earned dollars without \nyour consent.\n  There are troubling provisions. They still remain in this \nlegislation. Clearly, as it exists today, it runs afoul of the first \namendment. That has been already taken to a plain that I am sorry I \ncannot attain.\n  Political spending is equated with speech. The courts are clear and \nconsistent on that point. We cannot say, on the one hand, we are \nprotecting speech and, on the other hand, restrict the means by which \nthat speech is carried out.\n  Under the revised bill, corporations and other organizations would be \nprohibited year-round from issuing communications to the public that \nfall under the bill's much broader definition of ``express advocacy,'' \nwhich includes ``words that in context can have no reasonable meaning \nother than to advocate the election or defeat of 1 or more clearly \nidentified candidates'' or ``expressing unmistakable and unambiguous \nsupport for or opposition to 1 or more clearly identified candidates \nwhen taken as a whole and with limited reference to external events, \nsuch as proximity to an election.''\n  With respect to that restriction, it is my belief it would not \nwithstand constitutional scrutiny. The Supreme Court in Buckley versus \nValeo--that is all going to be talked about--in striking down the \n$1,000 limit on independent expenditures enacted by Congress in 1974 as \na violation of the first amendment, noted that such limitation ``would \nappear to exclude all citizens and groups except candidates, political \nparties, and institutional press from any significant use of the most \neffective modes of communication.'' In other words, we don't want to \ntake away the power of the people and place it in the hands of \npoliticians, the Government and the press.\n  So I suggest to my colleagues there is an answer and it is a better \nanswer. It is simple, it is understandable, easily complied with, even \neasier to monitor--full and timely disclosure. Full and timely \ndisclosure should be the\n\n[[Page S10422]]\n\ncore, the core of all finance practices. We always thought we need to \nenhance public disclosure measures that will allow the voters to know \nwhere every single penny comes from and where every single penny is \nspent, no matter what the organization.\n  You want to do something about soft money? I will tell you how to do \naway with soft money, just report it. This would give a full picture of \nthe situation and allow the Sun to shine in the dark corners of the \ncurrent campaign practices.\n  Mr. President, let me end by saying we are getting closer to the \nreform package. Some of the changes, visions, are true steps in the \nright direction. I support Senator Lott's amendment. It is a good and \nnecessary addition to this legislation. We should take a look at soft \nmoney and where it goes and how it is raised. The only way you do away \nwith soft money is that everybody files, everybody reports, because you \nhave to remember it didn't start just last week. I think there was a \nlittle failure to disclose in October of 1996, and before this \ndiscussion is all over, I am going to give this Senate an opportunity \nto vote on a little amendment that may put some teeth in that. They are \nnot going to like the teeth. But I guarantee you they will file. They \nwill file their FEC report, and that is what has to happen.\n  We all look at ourselves here as being part of this reform package. \nThere are other things and other people that are also involved that \nwill be affected by this. So before it is all over, we will see how far \nthey really want to go in campaign finance reform, on what is right and \nwrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say briefly to my friend from Montana, thank \nyou very much for a very important contribution to this debate. I \nlistened with great interest to the contributions of my colleague from \nMontana. He made also some very constructive suggestions.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Shannon \nBishop be permitted privileges of the floor when we are debating this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in our debate today we have talked about \na number of things. Again, you might think from the discussion that \nthere was only one provision of our bill, the McCain-Feingold bill, and \nthat provision had to do with the issue of express advocacy.\n  Of course, that is a very important aspect of the bill. Not only are \nwe confident of the constitutionality of those provisions, but we know \nit is one of the very important issues that has to be resolved if we \nare going to deal with the problem of big money in politics.\n  If you listen to the opponents of this bill you can swear that is all \nMcCain-Feingold is. But there are 25 other provisions that our \nopponents choose to ignore, because not only are they essentially \nnoncontroversial provisions, they are the very provisions that, for \nexample, the Senator from Montana was just talking about.\n  A number of Senators today said on the floor, why don't we do full \ndisclosure? What I want to say to my colleagues, Mr. President, if you \nkill the McCain-Feingold bill, you will be eliminating a number of very \nkey new provisions that will provide exactly the full disclosure that \nMembers of the other side have been calling for. In other words, our \nbill does disclosure and more. So, why all this talk about why don't we \ndo full disclosure of campaign contributions?\n  The bill greatly enhances disclosure. Instead of simply saying that \ncontributions over $200 per person be reported, the McCain-Feingold \nbill as modified requires all contributions over $50 to be reported. \nThe McCain-Feingold bill provides the most immediate disclosure \npossible by requiring that candidates file electronically with the FEC. \nIt is no longer sufficient to just file a big stack of papers every 6 \nmonths and make people go through them. This will require computer \nreporting and immediate public access to this information on a daily or \nweekly basis so the connection between contributions and votes can be \nplainly seen. That is real disclosure. I can't imagine a fuller \ndisclosure than that, unless we went to absolute zero which I would be \nhappy to do in terms of contributions.\n\n  The bill also requires--you don't hear about this from the other \nside; they want to pretend somehow the bill is just about issue ads--\nthe bill requires groups and parties running independent expenditures \nagainst candidates to disclose these expenditures to the FEC.\n  So, more information, more disclosure, more transparency, with regard \nto independent expenditures. The bill requires that the Federal \nElections Commission make campaign finance records available on the \nInternet within 24 hours of filing. The bill requires the campaign to \ncollect and disclose all required contributor information. Right now, \nunder the current law you can do something apparently that is called \nmaking your best effort to figure out who is the person that made the \ncontribution and what their profession is. Our bill, the McCain-\nFeingold bill, requires all such information be obtained upfront.\n  The bill also bars campaigns from depositing campaign contributions \nover $200 into their campaign accounts until that information has been \ndisclosed. This is the disclosure that Senator after Senator who is \nagainst our bill has called for. What they have never mentioned is that \nit is in the bill. If you kill McCain-Feingold, you are killing all of \nthese disclosure provisions.\n  And there is another one that my constituents in Wisconsin have \ncalled for, and that is to simply require political advertisements to \ncarry a disclaimer identifying who is responsible for the content of a \ncampaign ad. Time and again, I have heard my constituents say they are \nsick and tired of all the negative campaigning, and they find it \nparticularly irritating that the people who run the ads aren't even \nrequired to say who they are, who is doing the ad. This is disclosure. \nThis is what it is all about when it comes to letting the American \npeople have the information they need and deserve to evaluate what is \nhappening with money in politics.\n  Yet if you listen to the debate by our colleagues on the other side \nof this issue, you could swear there is no disclosure. I have not heard \na single idea regarding disclosure that goes beyond this. This is full \ndisclosure, Mr. President. Kill McCain-Feingold, you kill these \ndisclosure provisions.\n  The same thing goes for stronger provisions with regard to enforcing \nour laws. All afternoon, Senators came to the floor and said ``We don't \nneed new laws. We need to enforce our current laws.'' I happen to agree \nthat we should more carefully and clearly enforce our current laws. I \ndon't think that does it by itself, but what it does do is indicate a \nseriousness about any violations that have occurred. I agree. But it \nhas become clear in the middle of the scandals and the allegations that \nsome of the provisions in our statutes need some shoring up so that \nenforcement can improve.\n  What do we do about enforcement? What does McCain-Feingold do about \nenforcement of the law that would be eliminated if the filibuster \nsucceeds? If McCain-Feingold is defeated, not only would our efforts to \ndeal with phony issue ads and that are really express advocacy ads be \ndefeated but all of these strengthening provisions would also go down. \nOne provision prohibits foreign nationals from making any sort of \ncontribution or donation to candidates or parties. After all the talk \non both sides of the aisle about foreign contributions distorting our \npolitical process--a concern which I share--do we want to kill campaign \nfinance reform, and with it eliminate a provision that would prohibit \nforeign nationals from making any sort of contribution or donation to \ncandidates or parties? We need to strengthen that law. The filibuster \nwould kill it.\n  Mr. President, this bill some would like to kill strengthens current \nlaw, making it absolutely clear that it is unlawful to raise or solicit \ncampaign contributions from Federal property, including the White House \nand the U.S. Congress. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of \ntalk by Senators today about the need to deal with that problem. This \nbill makes sure there are no excuses for those who would pretend \nwhether they are in the White House or in an office of a Congressman or \nSenator, that somehow there is a way to get around it and actually \nraise money\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\nfrom your office. Our bill takes care of that. Killing it destroys it.\n\n  The bill increases the penalty for knowingly and willfully violating \nFederal election law. The bill permits the Federal Election Commission, \nfor the first time, to conduct random audits at the end of a campaign \nto ensure compliance with Federal election law. The bill bars Federal \ncandidates from converting campaign funds for personal use such as for \na mortgage payment or country club membership. Yes, it bars minors, \nthose under 18, from contributing so that we don't have 3-year-olds \ngiving $1,000 contributions anymore which is perfectly legal under \ncurrent law. Those who would defeat and filibuster McCain-Feingold \nwould wipe out all of these new enforcement provisions and leave \nnothing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Senators on both sides have been very generous with the \ntime today. I will try to keep it brief. Beyond the disclosure and \nenforcement, we also do something about the fact that we all know that \nincumbents have an advantage under the current system. Our system says \nthat if people agreed to limit their personal spending to $50,000, they \nwould be able to continue to receive help from their parties in the \nform of coordinated expenditures; otherwise, not. That could be a \ndeterrent to an advantage for an incumbent or perhaps a very wealthy \nindividual who is trying to obtain a Senate seat through spending a \ngreat deal of money.\n  Our bill simply bans Members of Congress from sending out taxpayer-\nfinanced mass mailings under the franking privilege during the calendar \nyear of their election. This is a major advantage that incumbents have \nover challengers. Again, if you wipe out the bill, you wipe out McCain-\nFeingold, you haven't just addressed the one or two matters the other \nside identified as a problem, you have wiped out these reforms as well.\n  Finally, Mr. President, with regard to the issues of soft money and \nwhat I like to call ``phony issue ads,'' I have noticed that throughout \nthis debate Senators on the other side have focused their attention \nprimarily on trying to claim that our provisions with regard to express \nadvocacy are somehow going to be struck down by the Supreme Court. Of \ncourse, in that regard, what I say is, in the worst-case scenario if \nour provisions are unconstitutional, the Supreme Court will strike it \ndown and it won't go into play. But what I have noticed is that at the \nsame time that this constitutional argument has been advanced we hear \nvirtually nothing anymore about the fact that our bill bans soft money.\n  Where has the argument gone that banning soft money is \nunconstitutional? It appears to be gone. There is no challenge to our \nclaim and our ability to demonstrate that 126 constitutional scholars \nbelieve this is not only constitutional but essential.\n  With that, Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that there is a \ngreat deal to this bill that would be destroyed if we do not avoid this \nfilibuster. In that regard, I want to say that I listened with great \ninterest earlier to my colleague as he discussed the decision this \nmorning of the Supreme Court to deny certiorari with regard to the FEC. \nThe fact is, Mr. President, the claim of the Senator from Kentucky that \nthe Supreme Court struck down some kind of decision is just not true. \nThe Supreme Court simply chose not to take up that case, just as it \nchose in the past not to take up the ninth circuit case that makes \nalmost the opposite decision.\n  There is a conflict between the courts. The Supreme Court, at some \npoint, may have to resolve this. Maybe they will have to resolve it \nwhen acting on the McCain-Feingold bill. But what is clear is it was \nneither striking down of a provision, nor was it a huge moment. It was \nnothing but the Supreme Court saying we are not going to take this up \nright now. I recognize the pressure that is behind the effort to kill \nthis bill. I recognize the temptation to try to make something of a \ndecision that is simply not there. But to suggest that this is a major \ndecision or a precedent that has something to do with what the law of \nthe land is is simply not true. The Court didn't even offer an opinion. \nThey just said: we are not going to take up this first circuit case.\n  Mr. President, I listened with great interest earlier today to my \ncolleague as he discussed the decision this morning, of the Supreme \nCourt to deny cert--without opinion--in the case of Maine Right to Life \nversus the FEC.\n  I think it is essential to put this silent decision into its proper \nperspective, lest it be given weight it simply does not deserve.\n  Mr. President, there are any number of reasons, ranging from the \nfacts of the case to the simple fact that they can only hear so many \ncases in a given year, which might lead to the Supreme Court denying \ncertiorari in any case.\n  The Supreme Court's unwillingness to consider the appeal of this case \nis no more dispositive on the issue of express advocacy than was a \nsimilar decision to deny cert some 10 years ago in FEC versus Furgatch.\n  In Furgatch, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that \ncontext is relevant to determining what constitutes express advocacy. \nIn Furgatch, the court found that there was no doubt that the ad in \nquestion asked people to vote against President Jimmy Carter.\n  The court also gave weight to the timing of the ad, noting that it \noccurred within 1 week of the election. Further, they were not issues \nbased, but attacked the candidate directly--for personal qualities.\n  On October 5, 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition for cert \nfiled by Mr. Furgatch.\n  Mr. President, today we have heard that a similar decision of the \nSupreme Court--without comment, leaving in place a first circuit \ndecision that held the FEC's regulations regarding voting records and \nvoting guides were invalid, should be construed as to signal the end of \nthe debate on campaign finance reform.\n  Now we can debate the merits of the Maine case and the Furgatch case \nand we may or may not reach a mutual opinion of what those cases mean. \nHowever, what is not in dispute--in regard to either case--is that the \nsilent decision of the Court is not necessarily a substantive \naffirmation of the lower courts.\n  Such a conclusion is simply not appropriate. There may be any number \nof reasons--the exact reason we will likely never know--why the Supreme \nCourt passed upon the Furgatch case and on the Maine case this morning.\n  If we start inferring substantive approval to every lower court case \nthe Supreme Court refuses to hear, we will be left with a patchwork of \nrulings and laws which defy any thread of continuity or precedential \nvalue.\n  Mr. President, before we impute too much importance to the denial of \ncert this morning in order to avoid comprehensive reform, I think we in \nthis body should take a long hard look at our role in this process.\n  We have an opportunity to address the very issues of Furgatch and \nMaine Right to Life and rather than hide behind the silence of the \nSupreme Court we should accept our responsibility and do just that. My \ncolleague, from Kentucky argues that McCain-Feingold is \nunconstitutional despite the fact that legal scholars find otherwise.\n  The rejection of cert today means that the decision of the first \ncircuit remains in effect in that circuit, just as Furgatch remains \ncontrolling in the ninth.\n  The two are in conflict and yet, the Supreme Court has elected to \npass on both. If the decision today, as my colleague from Kentucky \nargues, means they support the first circuit, what does that mean in \nthe ninth circuit--that it is no longer good law?\n  Of course that is not what it means. What it means is that we have a \nconflict which will remain unresolved unless either the Supreme Court \nmoves to resolve the conflict, or we, the legislative body make the law \nclear.\n  We have no control over the Supreme Court--although I would note that \nmany in the Congress have been attempting to exert some control over \nthe courts in the past months--but we do have, in this body, an \nopportunity to resolve this impasse ourselves.\n  This issue before this body remains the same as it has from the \noutset--will we reform the campaign finance\n\n[[Page S10424]]\n\nsystem of this Nation. Nothing the Supreme Court said--or didn't say--\nthis morning changes that fundamental fact.\n  We should debate the constitutionality of this legislation and I \nwelcome that debate. We should not, however, hide behind the silence of \nthe Supreme Court as an affirmation of either position in this debate.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. It has been an interesting \ndebate. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I apologize to the Chair that this is \nthe last speech of the evening. If I don't speak tonight, I probably \nwon't be heard on this issue. I have been trying this afternoon, but it \nhas been a fair assignment of speaking rights down here and I have \nwaited my turn.\n  Mr. President, before I deliver my prepared remarks, I want to \ncomment on a few things I heard on the floor. I tried at one point to \nask a question of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, who made a lot about lack of participation in the American \ndemocracy and especially with reference to campaign contributions. If I \nread him right, he said because the big money is so influential and \npowerful, if you will, other people don't think they ought to be \ngiving, as if other people weren't giving.\n  The truth of the matter is that in every campaign, including the last \ntime, more individuals gave small contributions and medium-size \ncontributions than in the history of the Republic. At the pace they are \non now, it looks like they are going to do that again. Now, how much is \nenough? I don't know. But to say that because there are big \ncontributions, people aren't participating, you can go over and ask the \nRepublican Party where most of its contributions come from for the \nregular activities of the parties, they will tell you from small \ncontributions, and they are there by the hundreds of thousands.\n  Second, a big thing was made by Senator Bumpers to the people \nlistening that the democracy was not participatory in America because \nonly 50 percent of the people voted, and perhaps in the State of \nColorado it was 53, or in New Mexico it was 52. You know, people are \nreally using that fact for a lot of inferences, and I am not sure many \nof the inferences are right. But I surely don't believe that whatever \nthat participatory failure is--and in a moment I will say 50 percent \nisn't a failure--it is surely not because of contributions that we are \ntrying to control here on the floor. There are so many reasons that \nAmericans don't participate in politics, not the least of which is that \nAmericans are just darn independent. They sometimes don't want to be \nbothered about anything. As a matter of fact, they are very busy. As a \nconsequence, many of them just don't take time out. But I submit that \nfor a democracy as vintage as ours to have 50 percent of the voters \nparticipating heavily and 50 percent or more, even though slightly \nvoting, that is a pretty good track record. I submit that if the 50 \npercent turned into 75, we would probably get the same results. I don't \nwant to cast any aspersions on the validity of individual votes, but \nour participation is sufficient to deliver the will of the people. I \nbelieve that is what we are all looking for--that the people's will \nwould be exercised at the ballot box and get the kind of Government \nthey want.\n  I rise today to offer to those colleagues who want to listen, and a \nfew of the American people who might be listening, some thoughts that I \nhave on this issue before the Senate now. Should Congress alter the \nlaws governing the way we conduct political campaigns in this country \nin the manner recommended in the legislation before us, the so-called \nMcCain-Feingold reform? It seems to me that we ought to have a sense of \nperspective about this.\n  I want to make one general statement before I talk a little bit about \nhistory.\n  The risk and danger of changing the laws right now in the manner \nrecommended in this bill is that if that change causes one major group \nof Americans to lose their freedom of speech because they cannot use \ntheir money and causes another group of Americans to have an increased \ninfluence on campaigns because they can use their money, then I believe \nwe ought to be very careful about that imbalance.\n  What I think might happen if these amendments are adopted to the code \nthat we now have is that there will be a lot more opportunity for the \nlabor unions in America, who might have nothing against it but are \nprotected under the Constitution for their rights and freedoms of \nspeech, but I am fearful that the balance which is there, since the \nunions are almost a Democratic arm today, and I don't see any reason \nwhy they will change for a while, it would seem to me we don't want to \nget things out of balance and then look back and say, ``Oh. We also let \nthe electorate get influenced in an unbalanced way.''\n  So when I look at this democracy of ourselves, I see a very stable \ndemocracy. I see something very, very special. In other parts of the \nworld when countries change their leaders, they often change the entire \nnature of their government. In the last several years governments have \nchanged in Burma, Rwanda, Somalia and too many countries to mention. \nMany of these changes involved bloodshed and all kinds of revolution \nand riot. Obviously, for those who happen to be on the losing side, \nwhen some governments changed hands, that meant torture, imprisonment \nand all kinds of violations of civility and civil rights.\n  In the United States we ought to be very thankful that we have the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution. It is the bedrock of this \ndemocracy. To me the Constitution and the first amendment are what set \nthe United States apart as a mature democracy from the rest of the \nworld. The first amendment allows us to have free and open political \ncampaigns, and the Constitution provides for a smooth transition of \nthat power between the competing political parties once the election \nhas been completed.\n  In the name of reform, the bill before us fundamentally alters our \nunique democratic electoral process just because many are dissatisfied \nwith the way our campaigns are financed and operated. Some are \ndisgusted by the ads. Others lament the fact that candidates no longer \ncontrol their campaigns. Many believe we need to abolish soft money. \nOthers contend if we pass this bill the public cynicism of elected \nleaders will somehow evaporate.\n  The fact is, fellow Senators, that the debate over campaign spending \nis as old as this democracy itself. George Washington was roundly \ncriticized in the early days of our country for spending three or four \ntimes the cost of a house on his first election to the House of \nBurgesses. Abraham Lincoln's supporters accused the Democratic opponent \nof bowing to ``plantation and bank paper aristocracy'' which could \nraise five times what Lincoln raised for his campaign. That is kind of \nreminiscent of the discussions of today.\n  Let there be no doubt, the constitutionality of this legislation is \ndubious. I heard some of the arguments today. I just do not believe \nthey are right.\n  In my mind, you can be for McCain-Feingold, or you can be for the \nfirst amendment. I choose the first amendment.\n  The modified McCain-Feingold bill creates a so-called ``bright \nline.'' That is a test 60 days out from election.\n  Mr. President, am I operating under a time restraint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. The time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak for 7 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me go back.\n  This bill before us, McCain-Feingold--and I notice Senator Feingold's \npresence here, and I commend him for the way he has conducted himself. \nHe feels as strongly about this as I do about my views.\n  But this bill creates a so-called bright-line test 60 days out from \nelection. In effect, the bright line attempts to get through the back \ndoor what the Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo said you couldn't \nget through in the front door. In Buckley, the Supreme Court said, \n``The concept that government may restrict speech of some elements of \nour society in order to enhance the relative voices of others\n\n[[Page S10425]]\n\nis wholly foreign to the first amendment.''\n  With respect to independent expenditures, the Buckley decision means \nthat individuals and groups may spend unlimited amounts on direct \ncommunication with voters to support or oppose Federal candidates as \nlong as there is no coordination or consultation with any candidate.\n  At its heart the McCain-Feingold bill does two things:\n  First, it eliminates soft money.\n  Second, it reduces independent expenditures, express advocacy, and \ncreates the 60-day bright-line rule. Under the bright-line rule, any \nindependent expenditure that falls within 60 days of an election could \nnot use a candidate's name or likeness.\n\n  Mr. President, this is where the authors of the reform bill seek to \nget through the back door what the Supreme Court has already ruled we \nmay not get through the front door.\n  By redefining independent expenditures and express advocacy, the \nMcCain-Feingold bill limits political speech which the Supreme Court in \nBuckley said was unconstitutional. I believe they will do that again \nwhen you try to tell those protected organizations already indicated as \nbeing protected that you are protected, but for the last 60 days you \nare not. If they are protected by free speech to involve themselves in \npolitics, is it more important to our constitutional democracy that \nthey be permitted to do that 2 years before an election or 58 days \nbefore an election? I would assume they would all opt who want to use \ntheir constitutional rights to say, ``I don't care about doing it 2 \nyears before; what I care about is doing it when the people are paying \nattention.'' I don't believe sitting members of this Supreme Court are \ngoing to find that you can do that unless they decide to throw out \nBuckley versus Valeo in its basic concept and principal thrust.\n  So I want to move on to one other subject. Currently groups like the \nAFL-CIO, the Christian Coalition, the Sierra Club, the National Rifle \nAssociation may run unlimited political advertisements using soft \nmoney, in some cases in support of the opposition to a particular \nissue. We have all heard on the floor how many of these ads contain the \nlikeness of a candidate. The Supreme Court in Buckley said that any \nattempt to limit the expenditures of these groups for these purposes \nwas unconstitutional. McCain-Feingold would attempt to do precisely \nwhat the Supreme Court has said is unconstitutional.\n  I ask fellow Senators, isn't it interesting? In this bill there is \nalso a provision that says, even if the Court strikes down one part, \nthe rest may be valid. I ask you, what will you have in America if they \nstrike down the 60-day prohibition and leave the soft money and the \nsoft money prohibition is constitutional? You will essentially have \ndecided to turn the campaign over to issue-oriented advertising with no \nsoft money available for party building for those who would seek to \nrefute it. I believe it is an untenable provision.\n  I have examined these provisions very carefully, and, even on the \nslightest chance that the Supreme Court would find these provisions \nconstitutional, I ask my fellow Senators if this is good policy. The \nreason I ask this question is that in my view when you muzzle political \nspeech of individual groups whose voices will carry the day--and I ask \nthat question in our zeal on both sides of the aisle to address the \nrole of certain entities in our election--you need to ask yourself what \nthe consequence will be of restricting the free speech of unions, \ngroups, corporations, and wealthy individuals to engage in campaigns, \nrelated speech, and activities. In my mind, by restricting freedom of \nspeech for these groups, we will make the media an even more powerful \nplayer in the political process.\n\n  During the 60 days prior to the election, when the so-called bright-\nline rule is in effect, the only one who will be able to speak directly \nabout candidates will be through the news media. We all know around \nWashington that you should not pick a fight with someone who buys paper \nby the ton and ink by the barrel, because it enjoys the full protection \nof the first amendment and it enjoys the total discretion of those who \nwrite the news and edit the news. We call the media the fourth estate, \nor the unofficial fourth branch of government. The media are the big \nopinion makers. They write the editorials, they present the news, and \nthey decide which issues deserve the attention of the American people \non a daily basis.\n  We also know that members of the media are only human, and by that I \nmean they are not always factual and they even pride themselves as \nbeing opinionated. Their opinion tends to lean in favor of Democrats \nand in particular of the liberal agenda in America. That is their \nprivilege. That is their right. Recent surveys have shown that close to \n90 percent of the media votes for liberal Democratic candidates, and to \nme it is clear that the media coverage of politics mimics the voting \nrecord of the media, at least in many areas. What of their \nindependence? What about their role in the election of public \nofficials?\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote:\n\n       There are rights which it is useless to surrender to the \n     Government, but which rights governments always have sought \n     to invade. Among those are the rights of speaking and \n     publishing our thoughts.\n\n  This bill is a giant step toward Congress invading the rights of many \nto engage in political discourse.\n  In a recent column, George Will noted that this debate is one of the \nmost important in American history. He also noted that the media have \nfailed to address the first amendment problems created by McCain-\nFeingold. In Will's words:\n\n       One reason the media are complacent about such restrictions \n     on others' political speech is that these restrictions \n     enhance the power of the media as the filters of political \n     speech and unregulated participants in a shrunken national \n     debate.\n\n  I submit to the Senate that this is precisely the result we need to \navoid. When in doubt, I believe we should err on the side of more, not \nless, political speech. That is the essence of democracy.\n  In my mind, there is at least one other issue which needs to be \naddressed before we decide whether to adopt the so-called reforms. We \nneed to get to the bottom of the scandals and violations of the law \nwhich occurred in the 1996 election. How can we talk about reform when \nduring the 1996 election individuals and party committees blatantly and \nrepeatedly violated the letter and the spirit of clear laws we \ncurrently have on the books? How will so-called reform prevent this \nfrom happening again in the future? We should not allow the call for \nreform to shield those who have violated the law from being held \nresponsible for their acts. To do that makes a mockery of the Senate \nand of our laws.\n  I participated in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearings \nthe past several months. When the hearings began, I spoke of three \nstatutes that I believed were pretty clear. Section 441 of the Federal \nElection Campaign Act makes it unlawful for foreign nationals to make \ncontributions to elections. After 2 months of the hearings, I heard \nevidence of multiple violations of statutes by the Democratic National \nCommittee and its agents. I do not think I need to recite for the \nAmerican people all the examples of foreign money solicited by John \nHuang, Pauline Kanchanalak, and Maria Hsia and others associated with \nthe DNC and the White House. The point is clear: The law prohibits \nforeign money. But there is a clear pattern of ignoring the laws during \nthe last election.\n  Section 441(f) of the Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits making \na contribution to a Federal election in the name of another person. \nPlain and simple, this law prohibits money laundering. We have seen the \npast election replete with those, and yet we have seen nobody punished, \nnobody penalized.\n  The final area of law implicated by the committee's investigation is \nsection 607 of the Federal Criminal Code. It makes it a crime to \nsolicit or receive campaign contributions on Government property. There \nhas been much debate in the media and among members of the committee \nabout whether the law covers the President and Vice President, whether \nit extends to soft money, and what Congress' original intent was when \nwe passed this law more than a century ago.\n  To me, the law means what it says. Politicians, including those in \nthe White House, cannot use Federal facilities paid for by the taxpayer \nto raise\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\nmoney for their campaigns for national political office. That is how I \nalways understood the law. That is the way I have conducted fundraising \nactivities, in strict accordance with that interpretation, yet the \ncommittee's record is full of evidence that fundraising calls were made \nfrom the White House.\n\n  There are other issues of illegal activity which the committee has \nyet to fully explore. Recently, the U.S. attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of New York obtained guilty pleas from three individuals \ninvolved in the last Teamsters election. These individuals apparently \nwill testify that the Democratic National Committee and the AFL-CIO \nwere used in efforts to launder money from the union's treasury into \nthe reelection of Ron Carey, the Teamsters' president. I am not here \nalleging that he knew of it or that he was a party to it. I am merely \nreciting what I know from the reports from the guilty pleas and other \nthings occurring in that court.\n  The Democratic National Committee apparently entered into an \nagreement with the Teamsters to launder money in exchange for \ncontributions to the party from members of the union.\n  We have heard a lot about the union's role in the last election, and \nI share the concern expressed by my colleagues. But it seems to me that \nwe need to get to the bottom of the criminal allegations, not just \nchange the law to deal with their political activity.\n  I would like to make one point about unions and their activities in \nthe last election. We all know that unions spent at least $35 million \non issue adds in 44 congressional districts during the 1996 campaign. \nCompared to the unions, Republican groups spent a pittance. Citizens \nfor Reform, a group which was created to counter the unions, spent $2 \nmillion in 15 districts. The coalition, Americans Working for Real \nChange, spent $5 million. The unions spent $700,000 in 1 week for \nadvertisements. This is their privilege. This is their right. I do not \nseek to limit them. I only seek to make sure that a balance is \nmaintained between the exercise of that right and the exercise of \nrights by others. So the unions have decided, because the current law \ngives them an advantage, that they are able to take a portion of their \nmoney dues without consent and use these dues for political activities.\n  Some want to call the Lott amendment a poison pill. I believe the \nvote, if we do have one on that issue, is a vote for fairness and \nbalance. I believe that all contributions and paid political speech \nought to be voluntary.\n  According to some, the law related to fundraising on Federal property \nwas designed to prevent Government officials from coercing political \ncontributions from Federal employees. Should the same rule against \npolitical contributions being done without consent apply to everyone, \nbusinesses, unions, PAC's and all?\n  On both sides of this issue I have listened as attentively as I can. \nI think this has been a very civilized debate, worthy of the \ninstitution of the Senate. But I have yet to hear anything that \nconvinces me that passing this bill, which will erode free speech \nrights of candidates, parties and groups, is necessary to enhance our \nelectoral process.\n  Clearly, the bill takes us in the wrong direction, away from the \nfirst amendment and from our free, fair and open electoral system that \nis the envy of the world.\n  I would like to make one last point. Everyone here recognizes the \nmany problems we are addressing today stem from the fact that the \nSupreme Court struck down various provisions in the post-Watergate \nreforms that were passed in 1974 and upheld others. I wish to caution \nSenators that the McCain-Feingold bill, although earnest in its attempt \nto correct the errors of the past, fails to take heed of the history of \nreforms of the past and is destined to lead us in the wrong direction \nand on a course to make many of the same mistakes.\n  This bill contains a severability clause that essentially means if \ncertain provisions of this bill are held unconstitutional, the \nremainder of the act shall not be affected by the rest of the holding. \nAlthough I do not agree with the approach in this bill, I do believe \nthat those who will vote for this bill believe that it will somehow \nlevel the playing field. If that is their interest, I ask them to very \ncarefully examine the consequences of the title VI severability clause. \nIf the Supreme Court holds that the bright-line rule created by this \nbill is unconstitutional, which I believe they will, we will not only \nhave succeeded in increasing the inequities between the haves and the \nhave-nots, but we will have also created a Pandora's box, full of new \nproblems.\n  I thank the Senate for its attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10420-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, criticism of and attacks on the tobacco \nindustry--and, by implication, tobacco growers--has become a sort of \none-upmanship cottage industry among politicians who, in earlier days, \nscrambled to pay their respects to those engaged in growing tobacco and \nmanufacturing it. The name of the game is ``piling on'' and the \npolitical types are doing it with gusto.\n  Last month, Mr. President, Dot Helms and I attended a meeting of the \nBurley and Dark Leaf Tobacco Association at Williamsburg. The \ndistinguished speaker at the dinner was Fred Barnes, one of today's \nmost respected journalists.\n  Presiding at the dinner was an impressive young lady, Pem Pfisterer \nClark, general manager of the Stemming District Tobacco Association in \nHenderson, KY.\n  During the program, Ms. Clark recited a touching poem she had written \nabout tobacco farmers. To those of us whose States produce tobacco, so \nheatedly maligned by its turncoat one-time friends, Pem Clark's tribute \nto these farmers was something that needed saying--and she said it \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Pem Clark's poem be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n                           Tribute To Growers\n\n     Ladies . . . gentleman . . .\n     My mission now tonight\n     Is to share from my perspective\n     My thoughts on this ``Tobacco Fight''.\n\n     I represent a group of folk\n     Who dedicate their lives\n     To producing the very plant\n     On which this industry survives.\n\n     Here's a billion dollar business\n     That we hold to our hearts,\n     That's sprouting from God's smallest seed.\n     Now, that's a very humble start!\n\n     It's not by chance or accident\n     That from the well-worked earth,\n     A rich and leafy plant springs forth\n     That boasts of quality and worth.\n\n     A farmer can't put on his crop\n     By tossing out some seeds.\n     Even a ``city slicker'' knows\n     That all that guy will grow are weeds.\n\n     The work is toil, the labor long.\n     He plants and hoes and sprays.\n     And weary, he goes in at night\n     And sighs, and bows his head and prays.\n\n     At this point he's done all he can;\n     Now it's not up to him.\n     A lot of what will happen now\n     Depends on Mother Nature's whim.\n\n     The drought will come, pests and disease.\n     It's like a game of craps.\n     The sun, the wind, the rain, the hail . . .\n     But farmers, see, are used to that.\n\n     Relief!

In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Jewel and Rudy \nRush of Rolla, MO, who on October 19, 1997, will celebrate their 50th \nwedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we \ncan celebrate a similar milestone.

Additionally, the \nCenter provides free confidential counseling, basic medical services, \nand lifestyle assessments at its newly constructed facility.\n  America needs more organizations which, like Life Choices Crisis \nPregnancy Center, encourage communities to help their own, rather than \nrely on government-funded programs for assistance.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nCitizens Access to Justice Act of 1997. Many Members of the Senate have \nas a paramount concern the protection of individual rights protected by \nour Constitution.\n  One particular right--the right to own and use private property free \nfrom arbitrary governmental action--is increasingly under attack from \nthe regulatory state. Indeed, despite the constitutional requirement \nfor the protection of property rights, the America of the late 20th \ncentury has witnessed an explosion of Federal regulation that has \njeopardized the private ownership of property with the consequent loss \nof individual liberty.\n  Under current Federal regulations, thousands of Americans have been \ndenied the right to the quiet use and enjoyment of their private \nproperty. Arbitrary bureaucratic enforcement of Federal and State \nregulatory programs has prevented Americans from building homes and \ncommercial buildings, plowing fields, repairing barns and fences, \nclearing brush and fire hazards, felling trees, and even removing \nrefuse and pollutants, all on private property.\n  To make matters worse, many property owners often are unable to \nsafeguard their rights because they effectively are denied access to \nFederal courts. In a society based upon the rule of law, the ability to \nprotect property and other rights is of paramount importance. Indeed, \nit was Chief Justice John Marshall, who in the seminal 1803 cast of \nMarbury versus Madison, observed that the ``government of the United \nStates has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of \nmen. It will cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws \nfurnish no remedy for the violation of a vested right.'' Despite this \ncore belief of John Marshall and other Founders, the ability of \nproperty owners to vindicate their rights in court today is being \nhampered by the overlapping and confusing jurisdiction of the Court of \nFederal Claims and the Federal district courts over fifth amendment \nproperty rights claims. It is also frustrated by localities which \nsometimes create labyrinths of administrative hurdles that property \nowners must jump through before being able to bring a claim in Federal \ncourt to vindicate their Federal constitutional rights. CAJA seeks to \nremedy these situations. Let me explain.\n  The Tucker Act, which waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates by granting the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to \nentertain monetary claims against the United States, actually \ncomplicates the ability of a property owner to vindicate their right to \njust compensation for a Government action that has caused a taking. The \nlaw currently forces a property owner to elect between equitable relief \nin the Federal district court and monetary relief in the Court of \nFederal Claims. Further difficulty arises when the law is used by the \nGovernment to urge dismissal in the district court on the ground that \nthe plaintiff should seek just compensation in the Court of Federal \nClaims, and is used to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal Claims on \nthe ground that plaintiff should first seek equitable relief in the \ndistrict court.\n\n  This Tucker Act shuffle is aggravated by section 1500 of the Tucker \nAct, which denies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain \na suit which is pending in another court and brought by the same \nplaintiff. Section 1500 is so poorly drafted and has brought so many \nhardships, that Justice Stevens, in Keene Corporation versus United \nStates, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 2048 (1993), has called for its repeal or \namendment. CAJA would resolve the jurisdictional muddle by both \nrepealing section 1500 and by eliminating the\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\nTucker Act shuffle, thereby granting to both courts concurrent \njurisdiction to fully adjudicate takings claims. To assure uniformity \nin property rights law, appeals from both courts would be heard by the \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n  Adding to this jurisdictional problem, is the misapplication by many \ncourts of the finality doctrine. These courts have required claimants \nto jump through endless administrative, appellate and other hoops, \nsometimes created by agencies to retard the legitimate use and \ndevelopment of property, before these courts will adjudicate claims. \nThis has resulted in increased costs to the taxpayers and has impeded \ninnocent property owners from vindicating their constitutionally \nprotected rights. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court in Suitum versus \nTahoe Regional Planning Agency--1997, struck as an impermissible burden \non property rights such administrative and appellate schemes that make \nit overly difficult for property owners to protect their rights in \ncourt. CAJA would codify the Suitum case, thereby providing courts with \nguidance on the application of the finality doctrine.\n  Finally, I must emphasize that CAJA certainly does not create any \nsubstantive rights. The definition of property, as well as what \nconstitutes a taking under the just compensation clause of the fifth \namendment, is left to the courts to define. The bill would not change \nexisting case law's ad hoc, case-by-case definition of regulatory \ntakings. Instead, it would provide a procedural fix to the litigation \nmuddle that delays and increases the cost of litigating a fifth \namendment taking case. All CAJA does is to provide for fair procedures \nto allow property owners the means to safeguard their rights by having \ntheir day in court.\n  I ask for your support to allow just claimants their day in court.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1259. A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1998 and \n1999 for the U.S. Coast Guard, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n    the coast guard authorization act for fiscal years 1998 and 1999\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.\n  The Coast Guard is one of our Nation's truly essential agencies. It \naids people in distress on our bays, oceans, and waterways, preventing \ninjuries and loss of life on these waters.\n  It enforces all Federal laws and treaties related to the high seas \nand U.S. waters. It is the lead Federal agency for preventing and \nresponding to major pollution incidents in the coastal zone. It makes \nour ports and shipping lanes safe for efficient marine transportation \nand commerce. And, as one of the five armed forces, it provides a \ncritical component of the Nation's defense strategy.\n  A few statistics graphically illustrate the Coast Guard's importance \nto the Nation. Last year, it saved 4,750 lives, assisted more than \n90,000 individuals in distress, and saved or protected nearly $6 \nbillion in property.\n  As part of its law enforcement mission in 1996, the Coast Guard \nconfiscated 29 tons of cocaine and marijuana that was destined for the \nUnited States. It intercepted over 9000 immigrants headed to our \nshores.\n  During the same year, the Coast Guard responded to more than 17,000 \npollution incidents. And the maritime cargo activities that the Coast \nGuard monitors and protects are estimated to contribute $74 billion \nannually to our GDP.\n  Fortunately for the American people, the Coast Guard performs these \nand other essential missions with a high degree of professionalism.\n  Last year, Congress enacted the Coast Guard Authorization Act of \n1996, which authorized the Coast Guard through fiscal year 1997. The \nbill we are introducing today reauthorizes the Coast Guard for the next \n2 years--fiscal years 1998 and 1999.\n  It authorizes both appropriations and personnel levels for these 2 \nyears. And it also contains various provisions that are designed to, \namong other things, provide greater flexibility to the Coast Guard on \npersonnel administration, streamline the inventory management process, \neliminate an unnecessary reporting requirement, and enhance the \neffectiveness of the Coast Guard Investigative Service. The bill also \nprovides authority to transfer excess property to the Coast Guard \nAuxiliary, protects personal information from release to the public \nduring marine casualty investigations, conforms the U.S. territorial \nsea definition in certain laws to the 1988 Presidential Proclamation \nextending it from 3 to 12 miles, provides for some noncontroversial \nproperty conveyances, and contains other provisions.\n\n  One provision that deserves particular mention relates to marine \nsafety. Needless to say, we must have a zero tolerance policy when it \ncomes to the use of alcohol and illegal drugs by anyone involved with \nthe operation of a vessel. Unfortunately, some problems have arisen in \nrecent years with the implementation of the Coast Guard's chemical \ntesting requirements that apply in the aftermath of serious marine \nincidents like oil spills.\n  Last year, after the oil tanker Julie N hit a bridge in Portland, ME, \nand spilled 170,000 gallons of oil, it was revealed that the pilot of \nthe vessel failed to complete a test for alcohol, as required by \nregulation. Consequently, we will never know whether he was under the \ninfluence of alcohol when he hit the bridge. And this is not the only \ncase of such a lapse. The National Transportation Safety Board, with \nwhom I consulted on this language, has identified approximately 20 \ncases in recent years in which chemical testing procedures have not \nbeen properly complied with after serious marine incidents.\n  This bill contains a provision designed to address the problem. \nWhereas current regulations only require the marine employer to ensure \nthat alcohol tests are promptly conducted, the bill adds a provision \nthat will require the Coast Guard to ensure that these tests are \nconducted, one way or another, within 2 hours of the accident being \nstabilized. The provision also increases the civil penalty for failure \nto comply with Coast Guard chemical testing procedures from $1,000 to \n$5,000. With these two changes, we will now have a clear chain of \naccountability in the testing process and a powerful incentive that \nshould prevent testing lapses--and hopefully accidents related to \nintoxication--from occurring the in the future.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill that enjoys bipartisan support on \nthe Commerce Committee. I look forward to moving this bill to the \nSenate floor at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Election Commission (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Commission'') was created in the wake of the \n     Watergate scandal to ensure the integrity of Federal \n     elections by overseeing Federal election disclosure and \n     enforcing Federal election law;\n       (2) maintaining and improving the strength and \n     effectiveness of the Commission is essential to the integrity \n     of the Federal election system;\n       (3) the growing volume of financial activity in election \n     campaigns and the sharply increasing number of cases \n     regarding potential violations of Federal election law make \n     it increasingly difficult for the Commission to fulfill its \n     watchdog role;\n       (4) between 1994 and November, 1996, the Commission's \n     caseload rose 36 percent in the six months leading up to the \n     elections, and because complaints relating to the 1996 \n     Federal elections are still being filed, the Commission \n     expects the caseload to ultimately rise by 52 percent;\n       (5) As of August 30, 1997, the Commission has been only \n     able to actually work on 88 complaints of the total 262 cases \n     pending;\n       (6) with this great increase in its workload the \n     Commission's budget has not increased by an amount necessary \n     to allow it to hire staff to fulfill its duties;\n       (7) the proposed appropriations for the Commission for the \n     next fiscal year will not allow the Commission to hire \n     additional investigative or enforcement staff; and\n       (8) the combination of a decreasing budget and an \n     increasing workload have severely impaired the Commission's \n     ability to fulfill its role.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should provide the Federal Election Commission \n     with sufficient resources and authority to allow it to\n\n[[Page S10439]]\n\n     fulfill its duties in a timely and effective manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      JEFFORDS AMENDMENT NO. 1287\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nan amendment proposed by Mr. Lott to the bill, S. 25, supra; as \nfollows:\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert:\n\n       .

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Gregg \nand myself, I submit an amendment. Mr. President, this is a very simple \nand straightforward amendment which has been drafted to address a very \nunique situation concerning State tax liability for persons performing \nservices at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Naval Shipyard. This shipyard \nis a Federal facility located on a group of small islands in the inner \nPortsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River, which forms the border between \nthe States of New Hampshire and Maine.\n  The amendment we are offering will make pay and compensation of \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard employees subject only to the State taxation \nlaws of the State in which the employees reside.\n  On July 28, 1997, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1953, a \nbill which likewise makes State taxing authority subject to an \nemployee's State of residence with respect to three other Federal \nfacilities located on State borders.\n  Again, Mr. President, these are very unique situations where we have \na serious issue of tax fairness of Federal employees at these \nparticular Federal facilities on the border between States. It is \nappropriate for the Congress, in these instances, to use its power to \nclarify taxing authority especially where the States involved have been \nunable to work out an equitable tax reciprocity agreement on their own. \nMoreover, I would note that in this instance, there is disagreement \nbetween New Hampshire and Maine on whether the border location of the \nshipyard puts it geographically in New Hampshire or Maine. This is all \nthe more reason for Congress to seek to help these Federal employees \ncaught in the middle of a border dispute.\n  As a Member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, I look \nforward to working with Chairman Thompson and my other colleagues on \nthe committee in the next few weeks to schedule action on both the \nHouse bill and the amendment Senator Gregg and I are offering to it \ntoday.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would note that when H.R. 1953 passed the \nHouse a few weeks back, some of my colleagues there noted that it took \nnearly 10 years to correct the tax inequity for the Federal employees \nat the three Federal facilities on State borders referenced in\n\n[[Page S10442]]\n\nthat bill. Let me say that I first took up the unfair tax situation \nfaced by my New Hampshire constituents at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard \nnearly 10 years ago, and introduced legislation in the years that \nfollowed which, unfortunately, never came to pass. However, my \ncolleagues have told me a congressional hearing might be the best way \nto make our case. That is why I look forward to Senate consideration of \nthis amendment in committee. When the facts are carefully reviewed, I \nthink my colleagues will realize that my constituents have waited too \nlong already for resolution of the unfair tax burden they face by \nvirtue of their employment at this particular Federal facility. My \namendment with Senator Gregg to H.R. 1953 gives the Congress another \nopportunity to address this situation, so it is my hope we can now \nrectify this situation without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10441-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    BURNS AMENDMENTS NOS. 1301-1303\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BURNS submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 25, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 1301\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n       Title II of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 431 et seq) (as amended by section 101) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``325.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring my \ncolleagues' attention to a crime-fighting initiative implemented by the \nBaltimore City Police Department, in conjunction with the Federal \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services [COPS] Program created by the 1994 \nCrime Bill, and with American Telephone and Telegraph. This \ninitiative--the 1-year anniversary of which was the first of this \nmonth--has contributed greatly to community policing efforts in \nBaltimore, and I believe holds great promise for the Nation at large.\n  Like other major cities in America, Baltimore--our 12th largest \ncity--has experienced over the past several decades a rapid rise in \ncrime. One of the effects of this rise has been the increasing burden \nplaced on the 911 emergency telephone system--a system which citizens \nregularly used to phone in not only emergency calls, but also criminal \ncomplaints of a nonemergency nature. In 1995 alone, the Baltimore \nPolice Department fielded 1.7 million 911 calls. Such a volume made it \nincreasingly difficult for the city's police to address in an \nexpeditious manner those complaints that were truly of an emergency \nnature, and required the redeployment to the phone banks of officers \nwho should have been on the city streets.\n  In October 1996, the Baltimore City Police Department, aided by a \n$350,000 award from the COPS office, established a new telephone line \nfor nonemergency calls. This 311 line is staffed by limited duty \nofficers specifically trained to handle both emergency and nonemergency \ncalls, and citizen understanding of the differences between the 311 and \n911 lines has been heightened by an intensive public awareness \ncampaign.\n  Mr. President, this experiment has proven to be an unmitigated \nsuccess. As a result of the implementation of the new 311 number, \nemergency calls to 911 have decreased by 25 percent, leaving \nBaltimore's police with more time to address in an expeditious manner \ntrue emergencies. In fact, statistics show that 911 operators now \nanswer the phone on an average of 2 seconds, as compared to 6.5 seconds \nbefore the 311 line was set up, and that 80 percent fewer callers to \n911 receive a message asking them not to hang up. In short, because of \nthe 311 number, Baltimore's police can now respond immediately to \nsituations that demand prompt action.\n  Moreover, the reduction in 911 calls has allowed Baltimore's police \nto spend more time patrolling their beats, a consequence of which has \nbeen a declining crime rate in the city of 15 percent in fiscal year \n1997, as opposed to an 11 percent decline in fiscal year 1996.\n  These and other statistics appear in an October 2 New York Times \narticle entitled ``Baltimore Cites Success with Alternative to 911,'' \nwhich I ask to be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  Mr. President, on this 1-year anniversary of the 311 program, I want \nto applaud the successes of the COPS Program, and the efforts of the \nBaltimore City Police Department and the Office of Governor Glendening, \nboth of whom have demonstrated the kind of vision and initiative that \nare essential to a successful Federal-State-local law enforcement \npartnership. Numerous other localities are in the process of developing \ntheir own 311-type programs, and I fully expect that on the second \nanniversary of the Baltimore initiative, several of my colleagues will \nbe on the Senate floor announcing similar success stories in their own \nStates.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 2, 1997]\n\n            Baltimore Cites Success With Alternative to 911\n\n                         (By Michael Janofsky)\n\n       Baltimore, Oct. 1.--Until a year ago, the owner of a cat \n     stuck in a tree and the spouse of a shooting victim would be \n     likely to call the same number for help: 911.\n       But under a pilot Federal program that could expand quickly \n     around the country and beyond, Baltimore is using a different \n     telephone number for non-emergencies, 311, a change that has \n     reduced the number of 911 calls to local police by nearly 25 \n     percent, enabling operators to handle life-threatening \n     situations more efficiently and giving officers more time to \n     patrol the streets.\n       In announcing the results of the program on its first \n     anniversary, local, state and Federal officials said the 311 \n     experiment has been so successful that more than 100 other \n     jurisdictions, including Chicago and Philadelphia, are eager \n     to try it.\n       ``The results here have exceeded my expectations,'' said \n     Joseph E. Brann, the director\n\n[[Page S10443]]\n\n     of the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented \n     Policing. ``The importance to the rest of the country is that \n     this was a community willing to use a new strategy to solve \n     an old problem.''\n       Most regions have used 911 as an emergency alternative to a \n     seven-digit number for the local police station since the \n     early 1970's. But here in Baltimore, Thomas C. Frazier, the \n     police commissioner, said the steady increase of calls to \n     911, an average of 5 percent a year in recent years, was \n     forcing many officers to spend their entire eight-hour shifts \n     responding to calls--many of which were not \n     true emergencies--at the expense of department efforts to \n     increase the time officers patrol neighborhoods.\n       ``We are trying to create more discretionary time for \n     officers.'' Mr. Frazier said at a news conference, ``and this \n     enhances our ability. It has freed up an amount of time for \n     them to be proactive.''\n       As part of the Clinton Administration's comprehensive 1994 \n     crime act, the Justice Department last year had a small \n     grant--$349,787--available to test a program that would \n     combine new technology and a city's willingness to wean \n     residents from 911 for non-emergency needs. Baltimore jumped \n     at the chance.\n       After a year, Mr. Frazier pronounced the program ``a hugh \n     success,'' with 24.8 percent fewer calls to 911 and better \n     service for those who still needed it. A department analysis \n     of calls made after 311 was implemented showed that 911 \n     operators now answer within an average of two seconds, rather \n     than six seconds; that 78.5 percent fewer callers get a busy \n     signal, and that 82.2 percent asking them to not to hang up.\n       In addition, a police survey of people who called 311 found \n     that 98.2 percent of them were satisfied with the response \n     even after learning that an officer would not be immediately \n     dispatched. For example, someone returning from vacation to \n     discover a burglary had taken place would probably be told by \n     a 311 operator that the police would respond, but not \n     necessarily right away.\n       More significant, Mr. Frazier said, the availability of 311 \n     to solve nonemergency problems led to an immediate decrease \n     in the frequency with which the police were dispatched. \n     After 311 was introduced, Mr. Frazier said, the number of \n     times the police were dispatched fell enough to give an \n     officer an additional hour a day for community policing. \n     Mr. Frazier added that the overall crime rate in Baltimore \n     has fallen 15 percent in 1997, compared with an 11 percent \n     drop in 1996.\n       The success of the 311 option here probably will lead to \n     its implementation in other cities. Lieut. Gov. Kathleen \n     Kennedy Townsend, who helped lobby for the Federal grant, \n     said Maryland's other populous regions, including Montgomery \n     County and Prince George's County, near Washington, would \n     soon get 311 systems. And John F.

CONNELLY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Conrad Richard Gagnon, Jr., and Maureen E. Connelly who were \nnamed finalists in the second annual Samsung American Legion \nScholarship Program.\n  The scholarship program is funded by a $5 million endowment from the \nSamsung Group, an international company based in South Korea, and is \nadministered by the American Legion, the world's largest veterans \norganization. Only direct decedents of U.S. wartime veterans are \neligible for the scholarships.\n  Conrad and Maureen are among many other outstanding young Americans \nnamed as finalists to compete for 1 of 10 college scholarships, each \nworth $20,000. The students were judged on the basis of their \ninvolvement in their school and community, and for their academic \nachievements.\n  Conrad is a native of Bedford, NH, and is currently in his senior \nyear of high school. He is the son of Conrad and Gisele Gagnon, and has \nthree bothers: Brian, Tim, and Dan. His grandfather, Richard Adalard \nGagnon, is a World War Two veteran.\n  Conrad has distinguished himself by achieving excellent grades, as \nwell as being involved in numerous and varied activities. He is an \nassociate editor of his school year book, a member of his school's math \nteam, and French club. He has been awarded the Boy Scouts Order of the \nArrow, and will travel to California and Japan this summer on the Sony \nStudent Abroad scholarship. Conrad also participates in community \nservice activities such as peer tutoring, food drives, and was involved \nin organizing an effort to place over 100 of his peers in volunteer \npositions. He would like to study engineering and law in college.\n  Maureen is a resident of Greenland, NH. She attends Portsmouth High \nSchool. She is the daughter of Mark and Marian Connelly, and she has a \nsister Carolyn, and a brother Steven. Her grandfather, Quentin Dante \nHalstead, served on active duty in World War Two, the Korean war, and \nthe Vietnam war.\n  Maureen has earned outstanding grades in honors and advance placement \nclasses. She is also very active on her school's field hockey team and \ntrack team. In addition she is a member of student government, serving \nin the capacity of treasurer, as well as a member of the school \nnewspaper staff. Maureen volunteers her time to teach young children \nfield hockey and at a local hospital, she also maintains a job as a \nlifeguard. She is a senior in high school and would like to be a \ndoctor.\n  Young men and women such as Conrad and Maureen are a valuable asset \nto New Hampshire and the future of the United States. I congratulate \nthem on all their hard work and wish them success in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10443-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10443-S10444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE RALLYING CRY OF THE ECONOMIST\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the most current issue of The \nEconomist has a cover story on the Year 2000 Problem. Entitled the \n``Millennium Bug Muddle,'' the story and editorial describe the global \nreaction to the computer glitch. While the editors do believe much of \nthe alarmists hue and cry is overstated, they are careful not to \nminimize the warnings about the critical steps we must take to solve \nthis problem.\n  First, even with the lowest estimates of cost at $52 billion, the \nmillennium bug still counts as a serious computing problem, probably \nthe worst to strike the industry to date. Governments and industries \nmust be prepared to pay the bill. Executives and public officials will \nhave to convince the shareholders and taxpayers that they should foot \nthe bill even though the fix will not increase productivity one lick.\n  Second, in their research, The Economist authors found that ``firms \nthat are a year or so into the repair job say they have learned two \nthings. Had they done nothing, the consequences would have been ugly \nindeed, from complete failure of their accounting and billing systems \nto, in the case of some retail firms, an inability to do business at \nall. But solving the problem is proving relatively straightforward, if \ntime consuming and expensive.'' This reaffirms my belief that this is a \nmanagement problem, NOT a technological problem.\n  Third, the article alludes to the impending deluge of litigation. \n``The results of these unfortunate programming decisions are already \nappearing. The Produce Palace, a retailer in Michigan, brought the \nfirst millennium bug case to court earlier this year, suing the makers \nof its sales terminals because their terminals cannot handle credit \ncards that expire after 1999 . . . Meanwhile, Hartford Insurance had to \nstart fixing its systems as far back as 1988, when it realized that its \n7-year bonds would crash its software from 1993 onwards.'' Our society \nis extremely litigious. Business interruptions and the ensuing blame \ngame of lawsuits could have lasting harm on our economy and our courts.\n  Lastly, as The Economist does so well, the authors see the larger \nmeaning in this problem. They conclude that because we are dependent on \ntechnology--and the pragmatic solutions that are devised in \ntechnology's evolution--we can be hindered and, in time, stricken, by \nthe unintended consequences of these ``innovations.'' As they point \nout, ``British railwaymen chose Stephenson's standard gauge over \nBrunel's wider one in the first half of the 19th Century, as they did \nin America and most European countries. This standard, originally \nderived from horse-drawn wagons in British mines, has remained even as \nrailway engineering has undergone 150 years of change. Not \nsurprisingly, it is hopelessly inadequate.''\n\n[[Page S10444]]\n\n  But in the end, though costly, the market will compel us to change. \nThe authors write: ``Sometimes a standard will be chosen which later \nturns out to be wrong, (two-digit dates, narrow-gauge railways), but \nmarket forces keep the waste in check, and eventually the standard \nbecomes wrong enough to be replaced.''\n  What market forces and The Economist authors have failed to address, \nhowever, is the lagging response of the U.S. Government to this problem \n(a relative benchmark, as the United States is ahead of most \ncountries). With just under 800 days left, we cannot have half of our \nagencies still assessing how many mission critical systems will be \naffected. This is but the first phase of three--renovation and testing/\nimplementation are the other two. We need an outside body to ensure \nthis problem is fixed. My bill, S. 22, will do just that.\n  The good news is that cover stories like that of The Economist will \nincrease awareness, the bad news is that without mention of the status \nof the Federal Government, the probability of widespread failure will \nincrease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10443-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO EILEEN FOLEY, MAYOR OF PORTSMOUTH.\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Mayor Eileen Foley, a remarkable and dedicated leader from \nPortsmouth, NH. Mayor Foley, Portsmouth's favorite daughter, has \nannounced her retirement from the office of mayor after serving 10 \nconsecutive years. She has demonstrated tremendous leadership and \nguidance to a countless number of people. A special era of service and \ndedication has come to an end with Mayor Foley's retirement.\n  Mayor Foley, 79, has served the city in the top seat at various times \nfor a total of more than 16 years. Her long history of city service \nbegan as a teenager, when she and her sisters helped their mother, Mary \nCarey Foley, in her mayoral campaign. The elder Foley served as the \ncity's first woman mayor between 1945-47.\n  Eileen Foley continued the tradition by submersing herself in a \ncareer of dedicated public service, first in the Women's Army Corps in \n1944 and later as State senator, Portsmouth City Counselor and School \nBoard member. As mayor, she has served many terms, between 1968-72, \nagain in 1984-85, and then again in 1988 until the present.\n  Mayor Foley, in her long years of public service, became identified \nwith the very city of Portsmouth in the minds of local constituents, as \nwell as government officials and business people far and wide. She has \nalways acted as a kind of concerned and caring mother and goodwill \nambassador, speaking at clambakes and ribbon cuttings, lending her \nsupport to civic, cultural, veterans, and charitable organizations, and \nrepresenting the city around the State and at such distant locations as \nCarrickfergus in Northern Ireland and Nichinon in Japan.\n  Over the years, Mayor Foley has been honored by many, including being \nnamed as 1 of the 10 most powerful women in the State by a statewide \nbusiness magazine, as well as being honored with a lifetime achievement \naward by the Portsmouth Rotary.\n  Mayor Foley will continue to serve on appointed boards, be visible \naround town, and take an active interest in city affairs, for it is \nhard to leave the public eye after earning the respect and admiration \nof so many.\n  Certain people are made to serve the public. Mayor Foley is such a \nperson, epitomizing the term public servant. Her service to the town of \nPortsmouth, NH, its people and to the State of New Hampshire is nothing \nshort of appreciative and commendable. Mr. President, as a public \nservant myself I understand the amount of time, heart, and dedication \nrequired each and every day. Mayor Foley has served the public, not out \nof force, but out of love and compassion for the people, demonstrating \nimmense heart and dedication. Mayor Foley will be missed as her public \nlegacy comes to an end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10444-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ANN ARBOR DISTRICT LIBRARY--1997 LIBRARY OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Ann \nArbor District Library for being chosen the 1997 national library of \nthe year by the Library Journal. The Ann Arbor District Library is \nbeing recognized for providing innovative and comprehensive services to \nthe public in a highly responsive manner. Some of the recent changes at \nthe Ann Arbor District Library include investments in technology to \nprovide an extensive CD-ROM collection and Internet and World Wide Web \nconnections. Also of note is the library's award winning welcome to the \nlibrary packet which is aimed at parents of at-risk children to \nencourage reading, education, and child safety. All of these \ninnovations have resulted in a significant increase in the library's \nusage.\n  Standing alone, the library's technological innovations, public \nawareness campaigns and exemplary service would be reason enough to \nmerit this prestigious award. However, what is even more remarkable \nabout the Ann Arbor District Library is that all of these new changes \ntook place during a time of tremendous transition. In 1994, the Ann \nArbor District Library was still part of the Ann Arbor Public School \nSystem. That same year, voters in Michigan approved a state-wide tax \nrestructuring proposal which had the effect of preventing the Ann Arbor \nDistrict Library from renewing its tax levy under the school districts. \nIn order to survive, the Ann Arbor District Library had to become its \nown public entity with its own governing board and its own millage. Not \nonly did the library succeed at doing all of this in only 2 years, but \nit also managed to institute all of those wonderful changes as well.\n  It took the exceptional talents of many dedicated library staff, \ntrustees, and community members to institute new programs and services \nin a seamless manner to its patrons while simultaneously creating a new \npublic entity from the ground up. In particular, I would like to \nrecognize and congratulate the Ann Arbor District Library's \nadministrative team which consists of the library's director, Mary Anne \nHodel and her top deputies, Tim Grimes, Lana Straight, Don Dely, Gary \nPollack, and Marge LaRose.\n  The Library Journal's selection of the Ann Arbor District Library as \nthe 1997 library of the year is a fitting tribute to all of the hard \nwork that went into establishing this library as an important, well \nutilized and well run public institution. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10444-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10444-S10445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CREATIVE OPTICS, INC.\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Creative Optics, Inc. in Bedford, NH, for receiving the \nSmall Business Innovation Research [SBIR] Model of Excellence Tibbetts \nAward. Creative Optics is a 15-year-old, innovative think tank that \ndevelops ideas and solutions to complex problems facing the Department \nof Defense community.\n  Companies were selected based on the economic impact of their \ntechnological innovations and their overall business achievements. It \nis a competitive three-phase program that provides qualified small \nbusinesses with opportunities to propose innovative ideas to the \nFederal Government. These proposals are a response to solicitations \npublished by the 10 Federal agencies on their upcoming research and \ndevelopment needs. There is a mutual benefit in that the Government \nsecures the needed research, while the small business retains rights to \ncommercialization. Creative Optics has made, and continues to make, a \nsignificant impact at the State and regional level.\n  After relocating to southern New Hampshire in 1991, Creative Optics \ndeveloped a myriad of relationships with local organizations and \nbusiness resources. Creative Optics is sharing its hard experience with \nother small businesses in the region, on the State level as well as the \nnational level.\n  The president of Creative Optics, Dr. John F. Ebersole, and the owner \nIngrid Ebersole, John's wife, have provided both technical vision along \nwith an administrative personal touch to the company. Along with the \nEbersole's vision and touch are the brilliant, creative minds of the \nindividuals developing new, inventive ideas, allowing Creative Optics \nto shine.\n  Creative Optics is a unique small business in New Hampshire, \nproviding high-level employment opportunities, economic growth, and an \ninnovated\n\n[[Page S10445]]\n\ntechnology developed through SBIR funding. Small businesses are \nfruitful in research and development, producing more than half the \nNation's product innovations. Furthermore, the Federal Government is \nachieving the highest quality research to meet specific mission needs, \nas well as expanding the Nation's industrial base. I commend Creative \nOptics for their outstanding innovations that benefit not only the \nState of New Hampshire but also the Nation as well. Creative Optics is \na worthy candidate for receiving the prestigious Tibbetts \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10444-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FRED HOOPER\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as more and more Americans live to \nbe 100, thanks to advances in health and longevity, I am honored to \noffer a tribute to a distinguished centurion from Florida: Mr. Fred \nHooper of Ocala, FL.\n  Mr. Hooper, who celebrates his 100th birthday on October 6, 1997, is \na builder, an educator, and an inspiration to all those who have \naspired to the triumph of victory in sports competition. Fred Hooper \nhas a special place in the history of horse racing because he won the \nKentucky Derby in 1945 with his first horse, ``Hoop Jr.'', bought in \n1943. Since then, he has bred and raced more than 100 stakes winners.\n  For decades, Mr. Hooper has been an instrumental force in \nthoroughbred racing. Through his promotion of horse racing, he has \nsupported and strengthened Florida tourism and agriculture; two \nindustries which are important components of Florida's economy.\n  As he approaches the special milestone of his 100th birthday, Mr. \nHooper continues to rise early in the morning to oversee the training \nof his top thoroughbreds and the cutting and baling of his hay in the \nfields at his farm.\n  I recently visited this living legend at his home in Ocala. As he \nrecalled his accomplishments and his ties that extend throughout \nAmerica, I was inspired by a man who has lived a full life and has \nimpacted so many people and events. He told me of his first horse, \n``Hoop Jr.'', and his working relationship with Eddie Arcaro, one of \nthe all-time greatest jockeys. Together they achieved racing history \nwith their victory at the 1945 Kentucky Derby. This Hooper-Arcaro \ncombination advanced the Florida racing industry to national \nprominence, while making Fred Hooper a legend in Florida and the racing \nworld.\n  I also learned that Mr. Hooper's activities have not been limited to \nracing. The Hooper Construction Company built roads, bridges, airports, \ndams and buildings in Florida and the Southeast. It has been said that \nif all the roads built by Mr. Hooper's company were linked together, \nthe combined total would stretch for four lanes from Miami to Houston.\n  Education is another Fred Hooper hallmark. During the 1970's, he \ncontributed to the building of a private school in Alabama, on the \nformer site of his construction company. And, he is rightfully proud of \nhis support--and the generosity of the thoroughbred industry--for the \nveterinary school at the University of Florida.\n  Part of the joy of this birthday is sharing the celebration with \nfamily. Mr. Hooper is the proud father of 4 children, 13 grandchildren \nand 9 great-grandchildren.\n  The celebration of his centennial birthday on October 6, 1997, will \nbe another achievement in the rich and rewarding life of Fred Hooper. I \nask my colleagues to join me, the community of Ocala, the Hooper family \nand all those who love horse racing in congratulating Fred Hooper and \nextending to him best wishes into the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10445-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HISPANOS UNIDOS CONTRA EL SIDA/AIDS, INC.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of Hispanos Unidos Contra El SIDA/AIDS, Inc. of New \nHaven, CT, as they celebrate their 10th anniversary.\n  In 1987, this organization was founded by a group of concerned \ncitizens as Connecticut's first Latino AIDS agency. Since that time, \nthis dedicated group of men and women have worked to both curb the \nspread of AIDS through education and provided support services to \ninfected members of the Latino community and their families. By serving \nas a fully bilingual/bicultural resource, support and advocacy agency, \nHispanos Unidos Contra El SIDA/AIDS has not only been effective at \nserving its own clients, but has helped other community and government \norganizations better serve the Latino community as well.\n  The dedication and commitment of the staff are evident not only in \ntheir casework but also in the partnerships and coalitions they form \nwith State and local government and nonprofit agencies. In this way \nthey are able to assist those most immediately in need while also \nworking to better coordinate local, regional and statewide efforts to \nprevent the spread of AIDS. They are the true embodiments of the ideals \nof compassion and community service, and the people of Connecticut \nthank them for the important work they have done for the past ten years \nand will continue to do in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10445-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY BY EMPLOYER OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The frescos depict the \n     life of St. Francis who had the special gift of understanding \n     and being able to speak to animals;\n       Whereas other talented artists including Simone Martini and \n     Pietro Lorenzetti left their artistic mark on the Basilica \n     during the first half of the 14th century, frescoing the left \n     side of the transept of the Lower Church;\n       Whereas the Basilica was severely damaged by twin \n     earthquakes on September 24 and 25, 1997, the extent of which \n     has been described as more devastating than the World War II \n     bombings of Padua and Pisa in 1944;\n       Whease the famous frescoes painted by Giotto on the side \n     walls of the Basilica in the early 14th century and depicting \n     scenes from St. Francis' life are cracked but mostly intact;\n       Whereas experts in Italy are already working to restore the \n     Basilica; and\n       Whereas the National Gallery in London and the Louvre in \n     Paris have offered experts free of charge to help in the \n     restoration of the Basilica: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Smithsonian Institution, the National \n     Gallery of Art and any of the other premier art museums in \n     the United States having pertinent expertise in restoration \n     should provide technical assistance to aid in the restoration \n     of the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi and the works of art \n     that have been damaged in the earthquakes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/06/senate-section/article/S10445-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PRINTING OF A COLLECTION OF RULES AND AUTHORITIES OF SPECIAL \n                 INVESTIGATORY COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
