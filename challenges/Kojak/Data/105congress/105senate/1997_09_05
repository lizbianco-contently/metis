Under the previous order, there \nwill be debate until 9:50 a.m., equally divided, on S. 830. It will be \na little bit less than 12 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I salute the majority leader for moving \nthe debate on the FDA modernization forward. We should no longer \nneedlessly delay consideration of S. 830, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997.\n  S. 830 represents months of bipartisan effort to address serious \nshortcomings in the FDA's regulatory procedures. Two hearings were \nheld. The measure passed the committee with a strong bipartisan 14-to-4 \nvote, and months of negotiations have ensued with dozens of \naccommodations made for Senator Kennedy and the administration.\n  For almost 20 years, Congress, the General Accounting Office, and \nnumerous advisory commissions have examined, reviewed, and made \nrecommendations to modernize the FDA.\n  During 1978 and 1979, Senator Kennedy championed legislation that \nwould have required FDA to do some of the very same things we are \nrequiring of it in S. 830.\n  In 1982, the Commission on the Federal Drug Approval Process, \nconvened at the request of Representatives Albert Gore and James \nScheuer, recommended simpler investigational new drug requirements. The \nCommission recognized that drug effectiveness could be demonstrated by \none study in appropriate cases, and it urged greater use of outside \nexpert advice and improved interactions with industry.\n  In 1989, the advisory committee on the FDA, on which Dr. David \nKessler served, made a key recommendation. It said:\n\n       . . . the agency should be guided by the principle that \n     expeditious approval of useful and safe new products enhances \n     the health of the American people. Approving such products \n     can be as important as preventing the marketing of harmful or \n     ineffective products.\n\n  In 1991, Vice President Quayle's Council on Competitiveness \nrecommended that the FDA expand the use of outside reviews and advisory \ncommittees, interpret efficacy with a more appropriate standard, and \nenhance internal agency management.\n  More recently, Vice President Gore has used the President's \n``reinventing Government'' initiative to improve the FDA product \napproval system and to eliminate outmoded FDA regulations for a variety \nof drugs, medical devices, and food products.\n\n[[Page S8838]]\n\n  Last year, the committee on Labor and Human Resources held four \nhearings on reforming the FDA. The witnesses testified about the same \nproblems that have been described for 20 years, and they recommended \nmany of the same solutions that have been recommended for 20 years.\n\n  This year, the Labor Committee continued its effort to modernize the \nFDA. The committee held two hearings in early 1997. The first hearing \nwas dedicated to the FDA, and the second hearing included \nrepresentatives from patient and consumer coalitions and from the food, \ndrug, and medical devices sector regulated by the FDA. It is no easy \ntask that we ask FDA to perform. Americans want the FDA to hold the \ngate tightly shut against unsafe or ineffective products while opening \nit wide for the next generation of innovation. Clear statutory guidance \nis needed to assist the agency to find this delicate balance and to \nbring our food and drug laws and regulatory systems into the next \ncentury. S. 830 contributes significantly to reaching that balance. The \nmeasure embodies the bipartisan conclusions and recommendations reached \nfor the past 20 years for accomplishing this difficult task of \nbalancing risk and promise.\n  Mr. President, a few have charged that this Congress is moving too \nfast. They ask, ``What's the rush?'' But they have asked the wrong \nquestion. For the past 20 years, every administration has sought to \nmake FDA better--to make better, safe and more effective products more \nreadily available. After almost 20 years, we must ask ourselves, why \ndelay further? Why continue to delay reforms that have been studied, \nreviewed, recommended, restudied, and endorsed again and again for over \n20 years? Clearly, the FDA should be modernized now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Vermont, on \nhis time, there are 4 minutes 24 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 6 minutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Diane \nRobertson be given the privilege of the floor during the consideration \nof this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate my friend \nand colleague, Senator Jeffords, for the attention he has given to \ntrying to bring the FDA into the modern world and to trying to consider \na wide variety of different recommendations and suggestions and for \nworking with the members of our committee, both the Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  This has been a trying process, but I commend him--and I speak for \nall of those on our side--for the diligence with which he has \napproached this and the knowledge he has demonstrated on this \nparticular range of issues.\n  We all understand, the American people understand, that the principal \nresponsibility of the FDA is to preserve and protect the public health. \nThis is different from other agencies. Therefore, any alteration or \nchange in the authority of the FDA and in consideration that various \naspects of the law have to be balanced against what is in the short-\nterm, medium-term and long-term interest of the public health of the \nAmerican people. The FDA is the singular agency throughout the world \nthat has demonstrated that it understands that particular commitment \nand has done an extraordinary job.\n  Many of us have frustrations about the FDA on particular products in \nour State and about general kinds of process and procedure. But no one \ncan review the history of the FDA and not understand that today the FDA \nis the principal instrument for approving new drugs and new medical \ndevices. This legislation today is to try to extend what we call the \nPDUFA, which is a proposal that was enacted under the leadership of \nSenator Hatch and myself a number of years ago, which provides user \nfees by the major drug companies to make sure that we will have the \nexpertise to consider various drug products more rapidly. There is an \nimportant need for the extension of that particular proposal, and all \nof us want to see it extended. I am a strong supporter of extending it. \nThere are many, many features of this legislation which I support.\n  But having said that, Mr. President, we have to look at the remaining \nitems that need attention and, in particular, one which is completely \nunacceptable and enough to warrant and justify the attention of the \nMembers of the Senate about whether we are prepared to move ahead and \nconsider this legislation, with that particular provision in in, that \nis now before the U.S. Senate. It is a provision that was not a part of \neither the initial proposal that was advanced last year by Senator \nKassebaum or advanced this year by Senator Jeffords. It concerns the \nwhole question of the preemption of the States with regard to cosmetics \nand over-the-counter medicines, but primarily on the issue of \ncosmetics.\n  There are other important protection items dealing with unsafe or \nineffective medical devices, including provisions that could undercut \nFDA's ability to regulate cigarettes, and there is a back-door assault \non one of the most important environmental protections. We will have a \nchance to get into those later in the course of the morning.\n  I want to point out what this legislation is going to do with regard \nto cosmetics, to all of the Members as we are coming over here to \nconsider a cloture vote. We have to recognize and we will have a chance \nlater on in the morning to point out the limitation of the Food and \nDrug Administration in regulating cosmetics. It has virtually no \nregulatory authority in this area.\n  The American people should take no satisfaction in extent of the \nprotections regarding the cosmetics they use every single day because \nthe Food and Drug Administration does not have the jurisdiction to \ndetermine what is in those cosmetics, whether they are safe and whether \nthey are effective. Absolutely none. There are only two members of the \nFDA who are out there supervising this issue--only two members of the \nFDA--in terms of looking out after the packaging and the labeling \nprovisions--two members.\n  The enforcement, in terms of protection of the public health on the \nissues of cosmetics, are left to the States. That is where the real \nregulatory authority is today. And now, because of the greed--and it is \ngreed--of the cosmetic industry and because of the success of a \nreferendum in California, they want to preempt any kind of protections \nfor the health and the safety enacted by the States with Federal \nlegislation that will effectively eliminate for all time the \npossibility of the States providing protection on health and safety. \nThat was put into this legislation as an amendment. That amendment has \nbeen objected to, not just by the Senator from Massachusetts, but by \nall of the Governors of the 50 States.\n  I will submit the correspondence from the National Governors' \nAssociation and from a principal Republican Attorney General Dan \nLundgren of the State of California, a State that has done more in \nterms of protecting the American public as a result of the legislation \npassed in California than anyone else.\n  The last GAO study points out that in the cosmetics used primarily by \nwomen in this country every day, 125 ingredients are suspected of \ncausing cancer, 20 ingredients are suspected of damaging the nervous \nsystem, 20 ingredients are suspected of causing birth defects. And the \nlist goes on and on and on.\n\n  And to put that into this legislation without a single day of \nhearings--without a single day of hearings; the last hearings in the \nSenate of the United States were in 1978--will amount to a wholesale \nthreat to the health of the American consumer. Primarily the women of \nthis country do not deserve the kind of vote for cloture in moving \nahead and effectively denying us the opportunity for a full debate and \ndiscussion of the issues that this provision deserves. That is why I \nhope that the vote on cloture is not successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd, and the remaining time after that to Senator Coats.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote to invoke cloture on \nthis. But let me say at the outset here I want to commend our \ncolleagues, and particularly my colleague from Massachusetts on this \nmatter. He has labored for many, many years on FDA legislation. And he \nbrings up an issue here regarding the cosmetics issue which will \ncertainly be the subject of debate and has been the subject of debate \nin our committee over the last 2\\1/2\\ years. In the most recent round \nof markups--we have been through a couple markups--the bill has had \npretty substantial bipartisan support coming out of the committee. I \nthink our vote was something like 14 to 4 in the last markup.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. September 30 is coming. We \nhave to reauthorize PDUFA. This is the first time we have been able to \ndeal with FDA in a way that will not only guarantee that we will have a \nquicker response on these applications, but also a safe and efficient \nand effective response for the consumers, the patient groups of this \ncountry.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. I commend my colleague \nfrom Vermont, the chairman of the committee, for his leadership on \nthis. The committee has worked very, very hard on this, my colleague \nfrom Indiana and others. We have had some very difficult issues over \nthe last 2\\1/2\\ years to try to reach compromise on and resolve them. \nAnd we have, by and large, with the exception of this one issue which \nis a great testament to the efforts of the members of the committee and \nthe staffs that have worked on this.\n  But I think it is time now that we bring the bill to the floor and \ntry to leave it up to the Members themselves to resolve any outstanding \nissues that we have or, hopefully, over the next coming days, to \nachieve a compromise so we can avoid a kind of battle here on the floor \nover one or two remaining issues.\n  Mr. President, I urge that we move forward on this. We have done a \ngood job I think in the committee. It is not uncommon for there to be \nan outstanding issue. I urge the invoking of cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana has 2 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. I would like to yield some of that time to the Senator \nfrom Maryland, if she is interested in making some comments. I have a \nlimited amount of time, but I would be happy to yield a portion of it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much.\n  I wish to say to my colleagues, we have worked very long and hard to \nmove FDA reform ahead, to make sure that products, whether they be \npharmaceuticals, biologics, or cosmetics, are available in a safe way \nto the American people. There are policy differences, but they should \nbe decided on the basis of debates and votes. We should not hold up \nreform on the basis of process.\n  Let us vote for cloture. Let us move the bill forward. Let us resolve \nour differences in the usual and customary way. I ask my colleagues to \njoin with me to vote for cloture, and then move forward in an adequate, \nrobust and well-amplified debate on the issues.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to add my support, in a \nbipartisan way, to the remarks as stated by the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Maryland and the efforts that have \nbeen undertaken by the chairman, Chairman Jeffords, and all of us on \nthe committee over the past 2\\1/2\\ years to move this bill forward.\n  There has been extensive debate on this in committee, 2\\1/2\\ years' \nworth. There has been extensive hearings on this. There has been \nextensive negotiation, and there has been extensive compromise on the \npart of those of us who are advocating FDA reform.\n  We have made concession after concession after concession to Senator \nKennedy and the administration and to those who have opposed our \nefforts in an attempt just to get the bill to the floor. Every time we \nsolved one issue, a new one pops up that we had discussed over and over \nand over and voted on in committee, but it does not mean that we should \nnot move forward with the process.\n  All we are asking for today is to move this bill forward so that \nSenator Kennedy and others who have concerns with it can raise their \nobjections, can debate it once again, can negotiate some more. But to \nstop the bill from going forward, to keep the drugs from being \napproved, to keep funds from going into FDA, to deny people the \nbenefits from FDA approval of drugs and devices, simply because a \nSenator has a problem with one portion of the bill, I think certainly \ndoes not serve this body well.\n  So I urge our colleagues to support the effort to invoke cloture so \nthat we can move ahead with this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Senator Kennedy has 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is not just one Senator. Let me read \nfrom ``The National Governors' Association, The National Conference of \nState Legislatures.''\n\n       When the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee \n     considered the Food and Drug Administration Reform \n     legislation . . . the committee adopted an amendment proposed \n     by Senator Gregg that preempts state regulations, disclosure \n     requirements, labeling, and warning requirements as they \n     apply to nonprescription drugs and cosmetics. The National \n     Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors' \n     Association, vigorously oppose this provision and hope that \n     it will not be part of the bill when it is reported by the \n     Senate.\n\n  These are the Governors, the State legislatures. The Secretary of \nHealth indicated that ``We and the administration all agree PDUFA is in \nthe best interest. However, as maintained in its present form, with the \noutstanding issues not addressed, we will be forced to recommend to \nveto the legislation.''\n  We are talking about health and safety. And we will have a chance to \ndevelop that in the postvote of this. But this bill contains too many \nimportant provisions with PDUFA and the medical devices and the drug \nprovisions to go forward. And I believe that it should go forward, but \nnot with this provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, pursuant to rule XXII, \nthe Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the \nclerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 105, S. 830, the FDA reform bill:\n         Trent Lott, Jim Jeffords, Pat Roberts, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, Tim Hutchinson, Conrad Burns, Chuck Hagel, \n           Jon Kyl, Rod Grams, Pete Domenici, Ted Stevens, \n           Christopher S.

Mr. President, I want to most sincerely thank my \ncolleagues for the tremendous vote to move forward on FDA reform. This \nis most rewarding. All of the proponents and supporters are pleased to \nknow that we can go forward at this time.\n  This is a tribute to a lot of hard work and compromise from a lot of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the issue. The \nvote represents the best of bipartisanship from Senators who support \nit, and even from opponents and the administration. Today is just the \nfirst step, but it could hardly be a better one. We will need to debate \nthis bill, consider amendments to it and, no doubt, improve it. I \nbelieve that there are still changes that can be made to accommodate \nthe concerns that have been expressed here by the opponents. I know we \ncan find solutions to those.\n  We will need to debate this bill, consider amendments and, as I say, \nno doubt, improve it. But I hope by this time next week, the Senate \nwill have given its resounding support to this bill. It is too \nimportant to the American people to let it languish. It is too \nimportant for us not to move it out as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have a time agreement, am \nI correct? Would the Chair be kind enough to state it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement is: Under a previous order, \nthere will be 8 hours of debate, equally divided between the Senator \nfrom Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] and the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. \nKennedy].\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. The legislation we are debating today \nincludes many positive elements. It reauthorizes the important \nprescription drug user fee program, one of the most effective \nregulatory reforms ever enacted. It includes a number of other \nprovisions that will significantly improve and streamline the \nregulation of prescription drugs, biologic products, and medical \ndevices. And I am pleased that through a long process of negotiation, \nboth prior to and subsequent to the markup of the legislation, many \nprovisions that seriously threaten public health and safety were \ndropped or compromised. But a bill that includes the damaging \nprovisions that remain in this bill, should not become law.\n  I have received a letter this morning from the Administration \nannouncing their opposition to these provisions and their judgment that \nthe bill should be vetoed if they are not eliminated. It would be the \nheight of folly for the Senate to doom this important legislation to \nfailure by taking it up before the provisions that merit a veto are \nremoved or changed.\n  The provisions that make this bill unworthy of passage by the Senate \ninclude: The preemption of State regulation of cosmetics and over-the-\ncounter medicines; the elimination of two important protections against \nunsafe or ineffective medical devices, including a provision that could \nundercut FDA's ability to regulate cigarettes, and a backdoor assault \non one of the most important environmental protections. The most \negregious and unjustified provision in this bill would effectively \npreempt the State regulation of over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. \nThese provisions were not included in the chairman's original mark. \nThey were not the subject of significant hearings. They have no place \nin a bill whose primary purpose is to reauthorize the Prescription Drug \nUser Act.\n  If this bill were serious about dealing with issues of over-the-\ncounter drug and cosmetic regulation, it would undertake a serious \nreform of the whole regulatory structure to assure that consumers are \nadequately protected and not include a single provision designed to \nprotect the profits of wealthy companies at the expense of the health \nof consumers. Preemption of cosmetic regulation is fundamentally \noutrageous and shows a callous disregard for the health of American \nwomen, especially those who are pregnant. It shows a callous disregard \nfor the likelihood of birth defects in newborn babies. Cosmetics are \nused far more broadly than most prescription drugs, medical devices, \nand biologic products.\n  Whether the issue is hair spray, or shampoo, or lipstick, or baby \npowder, or suntan lotion, or soap, or toothpaste, Americans assume that \nthe products they use are safe. But this confidence is too often \nunjustified because Federal oversight of this $20 billion industry \ntoday is extremely limited. The basic law regulating cosmetics has not \nbeen updated since 1938. The FDA has less than 30 employees overseeing \nthis huge industry. Only two deal with packaging and labeling.\n  The legislation, Mr. President, the food and drug and related law, \nhas 126 pages dealing with drugs and devices. It has 55 pages for \nfoods. It has 1\\1/2\\ pages of Federal law dealing with cosmetics. It \nbasically does not deal with regulating the cosmetics of this Nation.\n  The FDA has no authority to require manufacturers of cosmetics to \nregister their plans or products. The FDA has no authority to require \nmanufacturers to register their plans or products. It cannot require \nmanufacturers to file data on the ingredients of their products. So \nthere is no information with regard to the ingredients of their \nproducts. That is completely different, obviously, from the complex and \nvigorous review schedules which are places for pharmaceuticals and for \nmedical devices. The FDA cannot require the manufacturers of cosmetics \nto file data on the ingredients in their products. It cannot compel \nmanufacturers to file reports on cosmetics-related injuries. It cannot \nrequire their products be tested for safety, nor can it require that \nthe results of safety testing be made available to the agency. It has \nno power, as it does with prescription drugs and medical devices, to \nrequire that the tests be done or that they gather information as a \nresult of tests. It has no oversight authority in terms of making sure \nthere are safe manufactured products. None of that currently exists \nwith regard to cosmetics. The FDA does not have the right of access to \nmanufacturers' records, and it cannot require recall of a product. The \nFDA is virtually outside the loop with regard to giving assurances to \nthe American people about the health and safety of their products. This \nis unlike prescription drugs, it is unlike over-the-counter drugs, it \nis unlike medical devices. The FDA is outside the loop.\n  A study by the respected, nonpartisan General Accounting Office \nreported that more than 125 ingredients available for use in cosmetics \nare suspected of causing cancer. Twenty cosmetic ingredients may cause \nadverse effects on the nervous system, including headaches, drowsiness, \nand convulsions. Twenty cosmetic ingredients are suspected of causing \nbirth defects. The GAO concluded that cosmetics are being marketed in \nthe United States that may pose a serious hazard to the public. That is \nthe GAO. They concluded that cosmetics are being marketed in the United \nStates that may pose a serious hazard to the public.\n  The legislation that is before us is saying that the States should \nnot be able to do anything about it. This is the primary issue in terms \nof the health the American people--may we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. Senators will \ncease audible conversation. Would the\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nSenators to the Chair's left cease conversation.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The cosmetic industry wants the public to believe that \nno effective regulation is necessary at either the State or Federal \nlevel. They are the masters of the slick ad and expensive public \nrelations campaign. But all the glamorous pictures of the world cannot \nobscure the basic facts. This is an industry that is underregulated \nand, too often, hazardous.\n  A mother of a beautiful 6-year-old girl in Oakland, CA, found this \nout when she used a hair product on her child that resulted in second-\ndegree burns on her ears and neck. A 59-year-old California woman \nalmost died from an allergic reaction to hair dye. A 47-year-old woman \nhad her cornea destroyed by a mascara wand. In another tragic case, a \nwoman's hair caught fire as a result of an inflammable hair treatment \ngel. She lost her hair and was severely scarred. Beauty parlor \nemployees are particularly vulnerable to asthma and other diseases that \nresult from exposure to chemicals in the products that they use.\n  In fact, for every 1 million cosmetic products purchased, there are \nmore than 200 visits to the doctor to treat cosmetic-caused illnesses. \nIn 1987, a study for the Consumer Product Safety Commission found that, \nin 1 year alone, cosmetic products resulted in 47,000 emergency room \nvisits. These severe reactions are only the tip of the iceberg. As the \nGAO study points out, available estimates of cosmetic-related injuries \ndo not accurately reflect the extent to which consumers are exposed to \ntoxic cosmetic products and ingredients. Because symptoms of chronic \ntoxic effects may not occur until months or years after exposure. The \ninjury estimates generally account for only the acute toxic effects--\nthe effects that are seen right away. It is a fact that many of the \ningredients, according to the GAO, included in many products are toxic \nin nature, maybe carcinogens, that take time to work their way through \nthe body system and only later reflect themselves in incidence of \ncancer, or assaults on the nervous system, or birth defects long after \nthey are used.\n  In the face of limited Federal authority to protect the public \nagainst these hazards, and the even more limited resources devoted to \npreventing them, you would think that the Congress would want to \nencourage the States to fill the regulatory vacuum. Since the Federal \nGovernment is not doing it, you would think we would want the States to \nmake sure that they are protecting their consumers.\n  That is logical. We are talking about a health and safety issue. We \nare not talking about the economic regulations. We are talking about \nhealth and safety issues. If we are not going to have a responsibility \nin doing it, you would think we would want the States to move ahead and \nat least ensure the protections. But not in this legislation. \nEffectively we are preempting the States--telling the States they can't \ndo it. We are not doing it, and we are not going to permit the States \nto do it either, ever.\n  That is the effect of the provisions that have been included and \nadded on to the bill in Committee--not in the initial proposal offered \nby Senator Kassebaum, not in the initial proposal offered by Senator \nJeffords. It was one of the last of the amendments that were \nconsidered. There have been no hearings on this issue since 1978, 1988 \nin the House of Representatives. Still we have moved ahead, basically \nat the whim of the cosmetic industry, a $20 billion industry. This bill \nentirely bars the States from regulating packaging and labeling and \nplaces severe limits on the States' ability to establish other forms of \nregulation.\n  Mr. President, just listen to this language on the scope of the \npreemption provision on the packaging or labeling of a cosmetic: `` * * \n* shall be deemed to include any requirement relating to public \ninformation, or any other form of public communication relating to the \nsafety or effectiveness of a drug or cosmetic.''\n  There it is, clear as can be; no more information for the people of \nCalifornia, no more information for the people in the Midwest or the \nEast. This is what it says. ``This preemption shall be deemed to \ninclude any requirement relating to public information, or any other \nform of public communication relating to the safety or effectiveness of \na drug or cosmetic.''\n  We don't do it at the Federal level, and we are denying the States \nthe opportunity. What is the cosmetic industry so afraid of that they \nare precluding any public information or any other form of public \ncommunication relating to safety? What are they so frightened about? Is \nthe almighty dollar worth that much when you are talking about \ncarcinogens and toxic substances?\n  There it is, Mr. President, as clear as can be. The language, no \nwarning labels, no information that a product contains carcinogens or \ncan cause severe allergic reactions; no ``keep out of the reach of \nchildren'' labels; no notification that a product has been recalled \nbecause it is dangerous or adulterated; no expiration dates. Mexico \nrequires expiration dates. The European Union has expiration dates. Sri \nLanka has expiration dates. But no way--particularly in products such \nas mascara that can deteriorate and adulterate and cause serious \nthreats to people's eyes--no expiration dates. The materials have been \nheld in terms of the danger of mascara over a period of time without \nendanger rates or warnings to the public that use mascara; no \npreemption, right here in this legislation.\n  We are talking about health and safety. That is why we voted on this \nmeasure--health and safety issues.\n  We have already spent more time on this issue now this morning than \nwe spent in the committee in its discussion. No ``keep out of the reach \nof children'' labels; no notification that a product has been recalled \nbecause it is dangerous or adulterated; no notification. The cosmetic \nindustry seems to believe that for purchases of their products \nignorance is bliss. In fact, what you don't know today can severely \ninjury you, or even kill you.\n  Some States are already taking an active role in protecting \nconsumers. Many more may do so in the future. But not if this bill \nbecomes law. Minnesota has passed a hazardous product labeling bill \nrequiring a warning on all products that are ignitable, corrosive, \nreactive, or toxic. You would think that all consumers should be \nentitled to that kind of information about products which they put on \ntheir faces or spray on their hair or wash their bodies with. But the \ncosmetic industry disagrees.\n  California requires notification if a product contains carcinogens or \nreproductive toxins that cause birth defects. You would think every \nconsumer should be entitled to that information. Not after you pass \nthis provision. When you take the time later in this debate to go \nthrough each of these and show the medical information, the study, the \nresearch which supports that finding, there are products that contain \ncarcinogens and reproductive toxins. The studies have been done by some \nof the great research institutions in this country, but the data from \ntheir studies, warnings to expectant mothers, or to others who are \ngoing to use that product cannot be communicated to the American public \nby the States.\n  That authority will be gone. You can do all the research you want, \nfind everything you want, but that authority will be gone. It is out. \nYou would think that the consumer should be entitled to that \ninformation.\n  We had support for nutritional labeling around here for consumers to \nhave information. It is one of our most important achievements, that \npeople have some idea of the nutritional content of their diets, their \nfiber, and the various nutritional elements included in those. People \nwant to know. That is enormously important in terms of the general \nhealth and dietary needs of the American people. But here we are \ntalking about carcinogens. We are talking about toxic substances. We \nhave the information that is being made available to the public on the \none hand. But when it comes back to items that are going to endanger \nthe health and safety, we are saying, no way--no at the Federal level \nand no at the State level.\n  Texas is investigating hormone creams that may affect the \nreproductive health of young women. You would think the States should \nbe encouraged to take this kind of action. But this law prohibits it.\n  New York requires expiration dates on cosmetics because products can \nbreak down and be subject to bacterial contamination after a certain \ntime period.\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\n  Most of you would think that this is basic information that every \nconsumer should have. But not the cosmetics industry. If you want to \ntry to say, OK; we had a preemption of various States' activities with \nregard to food and nutrition, yes. We did. We worked that process out. \nIt was worked out with the various interests of the American consumer, \nand it is protected. If you want to go back and see where you want to \nhave a national program in terms of preemption in terms of these \ndangers, you are going to talk about a completely different regulation. \nBut that isn't recommended. That isn't suggested. That isn't talked \nabout. That isn't being considered here. No. All it is saying is you \nare not doing it here at the Federal level. Legislation under the Food \nand Drug Act doesn't permit you to do it, right in that page and a \nhalf. It shows that they don't have the authority to do it. And we are \nnot going to permit you to do it at the State level.\n  Mr. President, this provision of the bill is an example of what I \nconsider to be the worst kind of sweetheart deal for special interests \nat the expense of the public interest. It is intolerable that it should \nbe included in a bill that purports to be the Food and Drug \nAdministration Modernization and Accountability Act. We are supposed to \nbe out here modernizing the FDA, on the one hand, balancing the very \nimportant public health interests and also trying to consider the \nlegitimate interest of the patient and the consumers using medical \ndevices and new pharmacy products. That is a balance. It is a difficult \nand a complex one. You want to bring on line the new kinds of \ninnovative products. But you don't want to do it if it poses a threat \nto public safety. That is a balance. And we have differences about the \ntime, the process, and the procedure. Those are legitimate public \nhealth debates and discussions.\n  But not with regard to cosmetics.\n  So we have worked through the whole area with regard to \npharmaceuticals and with regard to devices. There are two items which I \nthink are of major importance that still need to be addressed. We have \nmade very significant and important progress on the matters that are \nenormously important to the health and the safety of the American \npublic.\n  And because that train is going down the track, here comes an old \nindustry, the cosmetic industry, to hook this sweetheart deal right on \nit; hook right on it.\n  I hope we are not going to hear from other Members that we now need \nto have hearings now on various other issues after what we have seen on \nthe cosmetics. I hope we are not going to have those issues. I heard \nthe other day that we need more study in terms of the testing of \nchildren. We need more hearings on all of this. We have had extensive \nhearings over in the House and some hearings over here. But we need \nmany more days of hearings before we jump into this at this direction--\nwhen you are talking about health and safety. And that has effectively \nnever been done.\n  Another unacceptable part of this bill, Mr. President, contains the \ntwo provisions dealing with the safety of medical devices, which I will \ncome to in just a few moments.\n  I see a friend and colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, here on \nthe floor. I would be glad to yield to him whatever time he might take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for yielding.\n  Mr. President, over the past several months, we on the Labor \nCommittee have been working diligently and effectively to try to create \na Food and Drug Administration reform bill--a bill that truly balances \nthe need for technological innovations and flexibility but that doesn't \nupset the fundamental obligations of the Food and Drug Administration \nto protect the public's health and safety. And we have made progress.\n  We have to recognize that the purpose of this bill fundamentally is \nthe reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. That is the \ncritical dimension that we are faced with. With the expiration of that \nauthority at the end of this month or the beginning of the next fiscal \nyear, we would lose a very valuable program, a program that has \ngenerally provided great success in speeding up approval, of ensuring \nthat drugs are brought to the marketplace in a much more efficient and \neffective way. Linking the authorization of the Prescription Drug User \nFee Act to the controversial FDA reform proposals may threaten many of \nthe benefits of PDUFA--the acronym for the Prescription Drug User Fee \nAct. I hope that will not be the case. I hope we can work out some of \nthese details and reach a suitable conclusion.\n  Much of the credit is due to the leadership of both Senator Jeffords \nand Senator Kennedy. They have been working diligently to arrive at a \nlegislative proposal that would balance the need for a rapid and \neffective regulatory response to the approval of medical drugs and \ndevices but also fundamentally protect the public health. Frankly, I \nsuggest that this is the motivation for our debate today.\n  The critical issue has to be, must be, and should be the protection \nof the public health and safety. That is why we have a Food and Drug \nAdministration. That is why we maintain a strong, vigilant Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  We have agreement, I believe, that PDUFA is working, and that we can \nmove forward with PDUFA. The industry is, indeed, thrilled by it. It \nworks well. They pay fees dedicated to the examination and review of \nproposed drugs and devices. These resources have enabled the FDA to \nspeed up the process.\n  In terms of the FDA process, PDUFA has done a great deal. The bill \nthat we are considering on the floor today includes a reauthorization \nof PDUFA, and represents many improvements in the original bill that we \nstarted with, and, indeed, even the bill that emerged from the \ncommittee. But there are still critical issues that have to be \naddressed in terms of protection of the public health and safety. They \nare complicated issues. They are issues that require careful review and \ndeliberation.\n\n  One of the disappointing aspects of this process is that the final \nversion of this bill was just released publicly Wednesday, the same \ntime the cloture motion was filed. Again, in the spirit of careful, \nthorough, thoughtful review, this does not provide the best opportunity \nto review all the nuances of this legislation.\n  So that is why I believe the effort today, led by Senator Kennedy, is \na very important one. It allows this body to more carefully, more \nintelligently and more thoroughly review provisions that will affect \nthe lives of untold Americans. I daresay that the Food and Drug \nAdministration reaches the lives of every American, probably more so \nthan any regulatory agency in this country.\n  All the prescription drugs on the shelves, all of the medical devices \nthat are used--all of them, the food additives, all of these things--\nare influenced by FDA action. We have to be very careful, very \nthoughtful and, I believe, methodical. So today's debate--and again I \ncommend Senator Kennedy for ensuring that we do have a thorough \ndebate--is vitally important to that goal.\n  I mentioned that we have made progress on this bill, but I should say \nthere are also areas that need improvement--desperately need \nimprovement. There is one in particular I would like to speak to for a \nmoment, and that is the issue of medical device labeling.\n  This bill contains a medical device provision which potentially opens \nup a serious public health loophole. Section 404 of this bill would \nprevent the Food and Drug Administration, before clearing a device for \nthe market, from examining whether a device will be used for an \nunlabeled use before clearing it for use in the market. This provision \ncould allow the gaming of the FDA process where companies could attempt \nto escape a requirement of providing essential safety and effectiveness \ndata by adopting a very narrow use for the device.\n  For example, under this bill, a company could get approval for a \nbiopsy needle from the FDA, even though it may be used in practice--\nand, indeed, this would be something that the company might have \nknowledge of--for an entirely different purpose, such as for tumor \nremoval. Yet, the company could avoid submitting to the FDA any safety \nor effectiveness data on this device for tumor removal because FDA\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\nwould be prohibited by law from asking for that data. In other words, \nthe FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the limited proposed \nuse of the device.\n  Another example is a company which receives approval of a general \nsurgical laser, even though the laser is clearly designed for prostate \nsurgery. The public health of the American people is dependent upon a \nthorough and complete review of such devices, and yet, section 404 \nwould essentially put blindfolds on the agency. They very well might \nknow from general literature, the company might very well know from its \nsales force who, when they present this product, hear medical \nprofessionals saying, ``This is great, but I'll use it for something \nelse,'' and yet the FDA would not be able to require data on this \nlikely use. This provision would prevent the FDA from providing for the \nsafety and effectiveness of medical devices.\n  The issue of allowing FDA to look beyond the conditions of use on the \nlabel and evaluating the use of a device is somewhat of a gray area. \nCertainly, advances in technology, new uses by the medical profession \nof devices should not be inhibited, but we also do not want to \ncompromise the ability of the FDA to protect the public health. That is \nthe great balance we must strike in this legislation: allowing for \ntechnological flexibility, regulatory efficiency, but not compromising \nthe public health of the American people. It is a balance that we are \nedging close to.\n  We have made progress since the adoption of this bill at the \ncommittee level, but more progress can and should be made. We are \ncommitted to making such progress. We are committed, I think, to coming \nup with final legislation that will reflect both the need for \ntechnological efficiency and innovation, but also protecting the public \nhealth of the American people.\n  I hope we can do that. I know that we desperately want, all of us, to \nreauthorize PDUFA so that we can continue that outstanding record of \nregulatory efficiency and approvals that have been generated by PDUFA. \nBut, I don't think any of us want to create a situation where months \nfrom now or years from now we are confronted with public health \nproblems because we acted hastily or we acted without the thoughtful, \ncareful review that is necessary to develop legislation that protects \nthe public health and provides for all of the new innovations that are \nfast becoming part of our medical marketplace.\n  Again, I commend Senator Kennedy for his unflinching efforts to \nensure that these concerns are fully addressed. I also thank and \ncommend the chairman of the committee who has worked diligently, \nsincerely and doggedly over these last several months to try to bring \ntogether opposing views on the committee. I believe we are close but \nnot quite there yet. I believe in the days ahead, we can, in fact, \nreach a position of which we will all be very, very proud. At this \ntime, I am prepared to yield back to the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator very much for identifying not only \nthis issue on cosmetics, but also the issue of the medical devices \nproposal. That is an extremely important measure. Obviously, if there \nis advertisement and an intention for a certain kind of purpose and \ntechnologically it is suitable for that purpose, it meets the health \nand safety standards to be used for other kinds of purposes, that \nraises some very, very important questions.\n  The particular example that the Senator gave with regard to the \nbiopsy needle is a current one. We understand it might be a suitable \ndevice in getting a biopsy in terms of cancer, but there are those \nactually using it to extract certain kinds of tumors. Whether it does \nthat or not--and people assume it is going to be effective in doing \nthat because it is used for other purposes --this is something that the \ndevice has not been tested for or intended. I think they there are very \nimportant health issues that are related and can be addressed. There \nare ways of trying to address those particular issues. We have tried to \ndo this, and we still have important health and safety issues which I \nthink are unresolved.\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield for response, one of my fears is \nthat not only would this situation result in perhaps not giving the FDA \ndata on uses that the companies are aware of in the marketplace, but it \nmight provide a subtle incentive in marketing these devices to \nencourage uses that are not authorized by the FDA and certainly not to \nbe attentive to those types of uses and report back to regulatory \nauthorities.\n  Again, when we think about this legislation, we have to think about \nalso that there are a complex set of incentives and disincentives for \nthe best possible behavior by pharmaceutical and device companies. I \ndon't think any of us would like to unwittingly create a situation in \nwhich devices approved for one use are cavalierly marketed by companies \nfor other uses and are merely winked at when they do not fall within \nthe category of the approval. So that is another important issue.\n  There is another aspect of this which I would like to raise with \nSenator Kennedy, and that is, I understand that Secretary Shalala has \ncommunicated concerns about this issue. I understand that she is \nconcerned about this and her concern may be of such a level that it \ncould suggest that she recommend to the President a veto of this \nlegislation. A veto would be, I think, particularly unfortunate since \nwe have worked so hard, we have made so much progress, and we have \nreached a point where we are very close to legislation which could \nvirtually pass with unanimity in this body. It would be unfortunate \nthat this type of provision of the bill would disrupt that process. I \nwonder if that is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. In the Secretary's letter, \nshe mentioned several items. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 5, 1997.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to reiterate the \n     Administration's commitment to continue working with you to \n     accomplish the timely reauthorization of the Prescription \n     Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992 and the passage of \n     constructive bipartisan Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     reforms. I very much appreciate your leadership and hard work \n     on the important issues that are raised by the FDA \n     legislation and the spirit of cooperation and accommodation \n     that resulted in agreement on so many of the provisions in \n     the Food and Drug Administration Accountability Act of 1997, \n     S. 830. However, we are concerned that a timely \n     reauthorization of PDUFA is in jeopardy.\n       Mr. Chairman, since S. 830 was reported out of Committee in \n     June, we have come a long way and have reached agreement on \n     what appeared to be the most difficult issues in the bill, \n     including the dissemination of information by drug and device \n     manufacturers, the effectiveness standard for drugs and \n     biologics, the regulation of health economic claims, and the \n     regulation of drugs made through pharmacy compounding. \n     Unfortunately, we continue to have serious concerns about a \n     number of issues that remain unresolved. We think that most \n     of these issues can be worked out, but there are four issues \n     that have the potential for jeopardizing our mutual goal of \n     timely reauthorization of PDUFA and passage of constructive, \n     bipartisan FDA reform.\n       The first of these issues is preemption of the state \n     regulation of over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. The \n     Administration has serious concerns about far-reaching \n     preemption--particularly in the absence of a strong federal \n     program. The second issue relates to what FDA may consider in \n     making substantial equivalence determinations for newly \n     marketed devices. For example, the bill requires the Agency \n     to review the intended use of a new device based on the \n     manufacturer's proposed labeling--even if the device's \n     technology clearly indicates that the device will be used for \n     a use not included in the labeling. Third, the bill seriously \n     undermines what was sought to be accomplished by the National \n     Environmental Policy Act by virtually eliminating the \n     requirement that FDA disclose the environmental impact of new \n     products that it approves. The Administration recently took \n     significant steps to decrease the burdens that were \n     associated with conducting environmental assessments for FDA-\n     approved products. We can think of no reason to jeopardize \n     the environment by eliminating a review that is not costly to \n     industry. Fourth, the PDUFA trigger as currently proposed in \n     the bill would undercut the bipartisan budget agreement by \n     denying FDA access to user fees at expenditure levels \n     consistent with the Balanced Budget Agreement and would \n     interfere with my ability to allocate resources \n     appropriately throughout the Department. Finally, with \n     respect to the pediatric labeling issue, we want to work \n     with the Congress to assure that any provisions in the \n     final bill complement the recent FDA actions and reach our \n     mutual goal of effectively protecting our nation's \n     children\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\n     and providing needed information to health professionals \n     who treat them.\n       Mr. Chairman, we in the Administration all agree that \n     reauthorization of PDUFA is in the best interest of the \n     American public. We believe that we are close to reaching \n     consensus on a bipartisan bill that includes this essential \n     reauthorization. However, if the bill were maintained in its \n     present form, and the outstanding issues were not addressed, \n     I would be forced to recommend to the President that he veto \n     this legislation.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this report, and that \n     enactment of S. 830 would not be in accord with the \n     President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the letter says:\n\n       The second issue relates to what FDA may consider in making \n     substantial equivalence determinations for newly marketed \n     devices. For example, the bill requires the agency to review \n     the intended use of a new device based on the manufacturer's \n     proposed labeling, even if the device's technology clearly \n     indicates the device will be used for a use not included in \n     the labeling.\n\n  So I think the point the Senator makes where they get approval for a \nparticular purpose, it might be easier to get it for one purpose but \nwith the clear intention of marketing for another purpose in which \nthere has not been testing, and that can produce a hazard to the \nindividual.\n  We have seen, for example, in some of the laser technologies that \nthey have been approved for certain kinds of cutting procedures, and \nthen they have been in certain instances adopted, for example, for \nprostate cancer, where they have not been tested and have not been \neffectively cleared and pose some very important health hazards.\n  So this is something that is very important, as we are moving through \ninnovation, because we want to make sure we get those innovations. We \nwant to make sure that the products are tested and have full \ninformation and disclosure.\n  I thought we worked out language to try and deal with that. It is an \nimportant health issue, and I appreciate the Senator's focus and \nattention on it. It is a matter of sufficient importance in terms of \npublic health that we would have this identified by the Secretary as \nbeing one of the two or three items that the Secretary has identified \nwould pose sufficient health hazard as to indicate a recommendation for \na veto.\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield again, I concur with his \nanalysis, with the danger, and also with the fact this has risen to the \nlevel of the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a significant an \nobstacle to passage or acceptance by the President. Again, I don't \nthink any of us are suggesting that pharmaceutical and device \nmanufacturers are going to--some may, but I hope not--deliberately try \nto bait and switch. But the market is evolving so much and there is so \nmuch innovation that if the FDA can't, by reviewing the literature, \nmake an estimate of what a device might be used for and ask for data on \nthat likely use, then I think we are really constraining FDA--as I said \nbefore, putting blinders on the FDA.\n  That, I think, would be a mistake in policy. And I also feel, based \nupon my sense of the progress we have made to date, that this is not an \nunsolvable issue. This issue is one that there is compromise language, \nwith which we can both provide for innovation, we can provide for \nmarketing, we can avoid cumbersome demands by the FDA. But we can still \ngive the FDA the authority to say, ``Listen, you are marketing this \ndevice for a very specific use, but we are aware that it would likely \nbe used two or three others ways. How does this device work in those \ncontexts?'' This is a very serious issue.\n  Once again, without the efforts of the Senator from Massachusetts to \ntry to focus on these issues, it well could have been lost in the \nclamor of getting out of here and getting on with other business. It \nwould be, in the long run, unfortunate for the public health of the \nAmerican people.\n  Let me conclude by saying that it is vitally important in ensuring \nwhen the bill passes--and I believe we all hope it passes--it passes in \na way we will all be proud of and will deal with all these issues that, \nleaving no unintended loophole or unintended consequences. I hope that \nwe will have thought it through, worked it out and come up with \nlegislation that will provide for the kind of technological innovation \nwe all want, provide for the kind of efficient regulatory review that \nwe all want and certainly protect the safety of the American public \nwhich not only we want but the American people demand. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nraising those issues, because that is a rather technical issue, it is a \nrather targeted question, but one that is of very significant \nimportance.\n  I certainly agree with the Senator that we don't believe that the \noverwhelming majority of the medical device manufacturers don't intend \nto do such things. But what we have to try and do is make sure that \nthose who may want to--and that is basically what happens in any \nregulatory procedure--you want to try and catch those particular items \nwhich are dangerous; that this is one that, with the tremendous \nexpansion, in terms of certainly medical device technology, that we \nshould address.\n  I appreciate the Senator saying that it can be addressed. We had \nlanguage that we had considered, that I thought the device industry had \nbeen very supportive of and was acceptable. Then in the rush at the \nend, somehow individuals who had been involved in it felt they didn't \nwant to have any further kind of adjustment or change in the language.\n  I think it is significant--and I am sure the Senator would agree and \nthe chairman would agree--that we have had, in the fashioning of this \nbill great support and cooperation from the industry, from the \npharmaceutical and also the device industry. We have perhaps some \ndifferences that have been moving along on particular kinds of items, \nbut I must say--and I think the Senator would agree; I know he is proud \nof the industry in his own State, as I am in my State--we have had \nenormous cooperation and help. So many of these items are \ntechnologically difficult, complicated, and involved. We are basically \ngeneralists as Members of the Senate. We have some information and try \nto develop some expertise in particular areas of responsibility, but \nthis gets to an involvement in detail which is enormously complex. When \nwe have responsible industry involvement trying to help us. I did find \nthat in other parts of the legislation it was very helpful. What we \nhope to do as this whole process moves ahead is come back and visit \nthis provision and see if we cannot address it.\n  Mr. REED. If I may, if the Senator will yield, I, too, concur with \nthe support, the assistance, the advice, and I think the general \ngoodwill that the industry has brought to this debate. We are now, \nthough, at the detail level, the fine detail, technical detail, and \nthat is critically important. These are the types of details which \nlater on come back to haunt us sometimes if they are not done well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. The industry has been responsive and reasonable, and we \nwant to incorporate their best advice but also recognize that our \nultimate responsibility is to the health of the American people.\n  Something else, too, that the Senator alluded to was that this \nindustry is becoming a very important part of our economy, not just \nnationally but locally. In Rhode Island we have several companies that \nare emerging as leaders in the industry. They offer not only \nextraordinary opportunities to help the American people, indeed, the \npeople of the world, through medicine and devices, but also are \nbecoming increasingly important economic powers within our \ncommunities--sources of jobs, employment and the types of activity that \nwe certainly want to encourage.\n  Part of our motivation today is to ensure that we do this right. We \nneed to give them the kind of direction and incentives that will make \nthem stronger competitors in the international marketplace, stronger \nsources of strength in the communities of America, but also make them \nresponsible and accountable to the American people through appropriate \nregulation. All of these things we can accomplish because I believe \nthat the differences that separate us at the moment are not \nfundamental, ideological or in any other sense broad based. They are, \nrather, important details which will ensure or not ensure that this \nlegislation can be used effectively to protect the public health.\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\n  So again I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  When we are talking about these technicalities, we have to remember \nthat some of these items, particularly those medical devices that enter \nthe body, have enormous health implications. I remember chairing, in \n1974 or 1975, the Dalkon shield hearings where we found that 2,300 \nAmerican women died from a perforated uterus from the Dalkon shield. \nThat was before we had a Food and Drug Administration that really \nlooked into medical devices.\n  We have the Shiley heart valve that passed through the FDA, and then \neventually the FDA was able to uncover some of the difficulties with \nthat and took steps. I think, if my memory serves me correctly, they \nwere going to use a perfected Shiley heart valve over in Europe, and \nthey altered some opening where the blood went through by just about 10 \ndegrees, and that resulted in a rather significant increase in the \nfailure of that medical device which was actually marketed abroad. The \nFDA was very much involved in seeing the termination of that.\n  So even very modest changes or alterations can have important kinds \nof health implications. We are not going to be able to solve all the \nproblems and we are not interested in producing a bureaucracy that is \ngoing to halt innovative and creative ways of dealing with some of \nthese issues. But it is important that we are talking about a Food and \nDrug Administration and public health.\n  As I mentioned briefly at the outset, this is the one agency that is \nintimately involved with public health. It has broad jurisdiction on a \nwide variety of items, and it has important responsibilities for the \npublic health. This is where the buck stops. Some feel it ought to just \nbe the agency to fast track various kinds of devices or fast track \nvarious pharmaceuticals without considering the health and \nefficaciousness of those products. That is why I think it is useful to \npause here for a little while to give some focus to exactly this \nlegislation and what its implications are going to be in terms of \npublic health.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to speak for a few moments just to try to \nallow those of my colleagues who are viewing us here as to why all this \ncontroversy. We just saw a vote of 89 to 5 in favor of moving forward \nwith a bill that has come out and is ready to be placed before the \nbody. Why is that occurring with all of these horrible problems which \nwe have just been hearing about?\n  Take a look at this bill. This bill is 152 pages long--152 pages \nlong. We are talking about four pages on cosmetics and two pages on \nmedical devices. So we have to keep things in perspective. This bill \nhas tremendous support because in almost every instance the issues that \nare of concern to people are taken care of.\n  But why all of this discussion about cosmetics? Because nobody is \ndoing anything. That is why the controversy. The question is who should \ndo something. Now, the question is whether or not you want some \nuniformity, and that is the Federal Government, the FDA, which we have \ntremendous confidence in, to take on the issue of warning about the \nproblems of cosmetics and to have a uniform approach, uniform labels \nand those things so, if you go from one place to another, you don't get \nconfused about what you should or should not be using or doing.\n  That is the question here. It revolves down to this. Right now, the \nStates say, oh, my God, you can't tell us what we can do. Well, they \nhaven't been doing anything, with the exception of California. It is \nnot something we are moving into and pushing aside all existing \nregulations; there are none. The question is who ought to do it. Well, \nto California we said, OK, you have that so we will carve you out. Go \nforward. You have yours out there. That is fine. The Federal Government \nwill not intervene, will not do away with that. So the bill presently \nsays, California, what you have done is fine. The question is everyone \nelse.\n  Now, since nobody has moved into this, it is not like you have a \nwhole bunch of States out there panicked because their existing rules \nand regulations are going to be superseded. It is natural for Governors \nand State legislatures to scream and say, oh, my gosh, you can't take \nour power away to do something.\n  So where did we get down to before we came here? We got down to this \nclose--this close. This is how close we are. We said, OK, if the FDA \nhas not done something and has not established that this cosmetic is a \ndangerous one, then the States can move in. And if they feel \ndifferently, that it is and therefore we should do it, they have the \npower to do that.\n  That is the way it is right now. But we say that if the FDA has \nacted, then we want uniformity and so we should try to make sure that \npeople across the country will have uniformity.\n  Then the issue was raised, well, suppose the FDA says that it is \ndangerous because it may cause problems on your face. Suppose the State \nbelieves it may have something to do with your blood system. Does that \nmean they cannot warn people that this cosmetic may be dangerous if it \ngets into your bloodstream?\n  Well, that is the issue. That is how far apart we are. On the two \npages that deal with devices, the issue is about as narrow as that. It \ncomes down to the question of, if a manufacturer says this device is \nfor this purpose, and the FDA says, well, maybe we want to make sure \nthat we know all the other purposes it might be used for, so they \nshould alert us to those. We are down that far on those two pages, and \nwe are down to within a few lines on the other four pages, but the \nother 146 pages there isn't really much disagreement with.\n  So I want to make sure we have things in perspective here. That is \nwhy the support, that is why we had the 89-to-5 vote on moving forward \non this. But these are important issues. It is important for us to make \nsure that people know that with respect to cosmetics they are going to \nbe protected and who is going to do it and what kind of awareness are \nwe going to be able to have and what are the States rights versus the \nFederal Government.\n  So that is where we are. I will go at length later, but right at this \npoint I want to make sure we understand where we are and what the issue \nis. In cosmetics, nobody is doing anything now with the exception of \nthe State of California. We think the FDA ought to get in there. They \nought to make sure that the cosmetics that are advertised are safe, \nthat we know what problems could be caused and that we have uniformity \nin the country, so that when you go one place to another, you will have \nthe ability to be able to rely upon uniformity as to what the various \nproducts may or may not do to you.\n  On the other hand, if the FDA does not take any action and a State \nthinks that this particular cosmetic or whatever is harmful, then they \nhave the power to act.\n  So that is where we are. I want to reassure people that this bill \ndoes not ignore the problem of cosmetics. For the first time it really \nemphasizes that the FDA and the States should do something. What should \nthey do? That is not going to be taken care of in the legislation \nbecause we would not know. But we do know that there is a need out \nthere and that the FDA should have the authority to act and that they \nshould have the authority to provide uniformity. But, on the other \nhand, the States should not be stripped of their rights to protect \ntheir people in the event the FDA has not acted.\n  Mr. President, I just wanted at this time to pause to try to make \nsure that everybody understands where we are and why we got the 89-to-5 \nvote to move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The fact is that the FDA does not have the authority \ntoday--just does not have it. It has the authority to deal with \npharmaceuticals and with medical devices but not with the issues which \ninvolve health and safety.\n  I will spend a moment or two just going through the Food and Drug \nAdministration Act, the actual law. It is a page and a half. And there \ncannot be a fair reading of this, of these provisions, section 601 to \n603. To believe that there is any adequate protection for American \nconsumers in this page and a\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\nhalf is folly. I mentioned earlier the FDA has no authority to require \nmanufacturers to register their plants or products. It cannot require \nmanufacturers to file the data on the ingredients in their products. It \ncannot compel manufacturers to file reports on the cosmetic-related \ninjuries. It cannot require that products be tested for safety or that \nthe results of safety testing be made available to the agency. It does \nnot have the right to have access to manufacturers' records. It cannot \nrecall a product.\n  Now, those are powers the FDA has with regard to pharmaceuticals and \nmedical devices, but not with regard to cosmetics that may also be \ncarcinogenic, and may also include toxins. We are not talking about an \nunimportant matter. We are talking about questions of health and \nsafety. I find it difficult, with all respect, to say, ``Well, look, in \nCalifornia, we've carved that out. All of our Members will probably \nunderstand that means. ``We have carved out California.'' California \nconsidered this and took action. But if Minnesota--and they have been \ninterested in taking some action on some products--wants to take action \ndown the road in the future to protect its consumers, it cannot do it. \nIn my State of Massachusetts, that has very similar legislation to that \nof California pending now, and they hope to be able to pass it in the \nnext legislative session--they are out. They are finished.\n  We have taken care of one State, California. I am glad we did not \nwipe out California because I am interested in the protection of the \ncitizens of California. They are going to get some protection, but not \nfull protection, because you are going to preempt other health and \nsafety statutes in California. This did not provide all the protections \nin California. Nonetheless, I am glad that the consumers in California \nare going to get some protection. But I cannot understand why we are \ndenying other States from making a judgment that they want some \nprotection. That is what this legislation does.\n  An additional point others will make is, ``Well, we're just dealing \nwith packaging and labeling.'' But that is where the States act, with \npackaging and labeling. We do not see the withdrawal of products. They \nare able to do that and have been effective at it, in California. And I \nwill get into how effective they have been, because they have been very \neffective in protecting consumers, not only in California, but the rest \nof the country, because when California, as a result of an extensive \nkind of medical research, has discovered that various products may \ncontain carcinogens or dangerous and toxic substances, and required \nthose products to be labeled, what happened? The manufacturer changed \nthe product. And I will get into the examples.\n  This is the power that regulations on labeling and packaging can \nhave. This is where they have been effective. These are the key \nelements, the possibility of developing warning labels. They have not \nhad to develop the warning labels in California because the companies \nand the manufacturers have changed the products. One of the outstanding \nexamples is Preparation H. Where there were products that were \ndangerous to consumers, the California regulations were effective in \nimproving product safety. The manufacturer reformulated the product \nitself and says now it is better than it even was before. That was as a \nresult of research that was done to uncover potentially dangerous \nsubstances that had been included in the product.\n  So, Mr. President, we have an agency that cannot practically deal \nwith and has been restricted from packaging and labeling. We have seen \na carveout, a carveout in the FDA authority in section 601 that talks \nabout various products. It says they will not be able to deal with \neither poisonous or adulterated cosmetics, and cannot apply to coal-tar \nhair. Coal-tar hair dye. There is the cosmetic industry able to write \nright into the law ``coal-tar hair dye,'' even though the research has \nshown what that has done in terms of making hair dyes more dangerous \nthan they need to be. The cosmetics industry has been effective enough \nto get written into this legislatively that, even though it is \ndangerous, there cannot be any kind of oversight of it. That is the \npower. That is real legislative power.\n  Mr. President, just on this question of the FDA and its ability to \ndeal with this, let us go back to what the GAO said should be done if \nwe were to have an FDA that would be able to provide adequate \nprotection for the public health. This is a public health issue and a \nsafety issue. That is what we are dealing with with regard to \ncosmetics.\n  The other items that we mentioned earlier deal with health and safety \nand are of importance. But on cosmetics, we are effectively talking \nabout health and safety issues. When the GAO last looked at the FDA, \nand were charged with making recommendations, these are the \nrecommendations that they made. They said:\n\n       We recommend that the Congress amend the Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act to give FDA adequate authority for regulating \n     cosmetic products. Specifically, we recommend that the \n     Congress authorize FDA to require:\n       Registration of all cosmetic manufacturers.\n       Registration of cosmetic products and filing of ingredient \n     statements [so that they know what ingredients are in the \n     various products].\n       Manufacturers to submit to FDA data to support the safety \n     of their products and the ingredients in them [to demonstrate \n     the safety of their products prior to putting them on the \n     market. Before marketing, to be able to give the assurance of \n     safety and also to be able to get the ingredients of these \n     products].\n       Premarket approval by FDA of certain classes of cosmetics \n     or ingredients when the agency deems such approval necessary \n     to protect the public health.\n\n  Why? Because they take notice that some of these products contain \npossible carcinogens and some of them have toxic products. They are \nsaying we ought to be able to demonstrate the safety of those products \nrather than put them out in the marketplace and endanger the public.\n  The GAO report further recommends that:\n\n       Manufacturers to submit to FDA consumer complaints about \n     adverse reactions to cosmetics.\n       Manufacturers to perform specific testing FDA deems \n     necessary to support the safety of a cosmetic or an \n     ingredient.\n\n  So if the FDA were to make a judgment that they believe that items \nmay cause birth defects, may cause an assault on the nervous system, \nmay somehow threaten seriously the health and the well-being of the \nconsumer, that they would be able to ensure there is going to be \nadequate testing. Those are very minimal standards. These \nrecommendations are from the last review for the power and the \nauthority for the FDA.\n  Now, do you think we have any of those today? No, we do not have any \nof those. And all we have to protect the consumer is what is happening \nat the State level. That is all we have. With this legislation, we are \neffectively preempting the States from providing those protections to \nthe consumers in their States.\n  I find it extraordinary how quickly we are to be willing to accept \nthat particular provision without hearings. We understand the power of \nthe cosmetic industry. We understand why this has come up. This has \ncome up, Mr. President, because of the action that has been taken by \nCalifornia. Because California has acted in various cases in order to \nensure that the cosmetics that are being used by Californians are safe \nand effective. They do not want to have to keep dealing with this. \nNonetheless, manufacturers have changed their products. They have made \nthem, in so many different instances, safer. That is the way it should \nbe.\n  If we are not going to do it at the Federal level, why do we take \naway the power of the various States? It is effectively like preempting \nthe States from having State police. All the States have various State \npolice in order to look after safety and security in their States. We \nare saying, we are not going to provide any kind of help and \nassistance, but, in addition, we are taking away your safety, a means \nof protecting your people as well. And that, I believe, is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I want to just mention some of the various items since \nwe have talked in generalities here about some of them. Some of these \nitems that we have addressed here have posed a threat to the health and \nsafety.\n  First of all, we have hair dye, the coal tar in the hair dye. That is \na potential carcinogen. It is a danger in terms of the American public \nand the consumer. One State, California, has a State law. Ohio has \ntried to deal with this, but they have been basically unable to do so. \nThe industry has been so\n\n[[Page S8847]]\n\npowerful it has been able to get written into the law, into the bill \nitself, that we cannot tamper with something we know is directly a \npublic health hazard. In public health we know that, and still it is \nwritten into the law.\n  We have the old Grecian Formula. It does not have to go through the \nFDA. It had lead in it--lead. People thought, well, we can use it \nbecause it is just a hairspray. We know what happens when lead is \ningested. We know it causes mental retardation, for example, in \nchildren.\n  One of the principal problems in inner cities is old paint chips that \nhave the lead content. We know the incidence of mental retardation, and \nif you go into any urban area in this country and go to the great \ncounty hospitals, they have a lead paint poisoning program. You see the \nincidents of mental retardation that are a direct cause of lead in the \npaint. The children are either eating the chips or they are playing \noutdoors and the chips are ingested. They get on the cats and dogs, and \nchildren pet them and then scratch themselves or put their hands in \ntheir mouths.\n  It just goes on. We understand that. That has been well understood \nand documented for 30 years now. But we now know there was lead in \nGrecian Formula. This came out as a result of the various analyses in \nCalifornia. There was a certain amount of concern about it, but then \nthere was action by the company, and they said, look, maybe there is \nlead in it, but it is on your hair, and you are not ingesting it, so, \ntherefore, it is not a problem. Then other studies showed that people \nwere washing their hair and were also embracing their children and \ntouching their children and working with their animals or their pets, \nand this was picking up the flakes and, if the dye was being used over \na considerable period of time, the lead posed a significant and \nimportant threat to children.\n  So what happened? Grecian Formula changed their ingredients as a \nresult of this to make a safer product. They did not miss a beat in \nterms of being able to market it and being able to be successful. But \nit was changed, and that is because of local activity--not the FDA, but \nbecause of local activity.\n  Mr. President, I will give further illustration, but I will just at \nthis point remind Senators, as we are going through some of these \nexamples, there may be those who say, ``Well, OK, you've got a half \ndozen out there, but is that really enough to try to resist this \nprovision to preempt State activities?'' Well, the last serious study \nthat was done by a congressional committee was actually done by our \ncolleague, Congressman Wyden, who held landmark hearings in 1988.\n  The industry gave his subcommittee a list of 2,983 chemicals used in \ncosmetics. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health at \nNIH analyzed the 2,983 chemicals and found 884 cosmetic ingredients had \nbeen reported to the Government as toxic substances. Let me just repeat \nthat: The industry, the cosmetic industry, provided to the Congress a \nlist of 2,983 chemicals that are being used in cosmetics.\n  The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, what we \ncall NIOSH, which is the center for expertise in being able to analyze \nvarious toxic substances, and NIH analyzed these chemicals and found \nthat 884 cosmetic ingredients have been reported to the Government as \ntoxic substances.\n  We have known for 10 years that a third of cosmetic chemicals are \ntoxic, but we have done nothing to strengthen the consumer protections. \nInstead, we would rather weaken the consumer protections. Instead of \ntrying to make some progress to protect the consumer we are taking \nsteps to put them at greater risk. Does that make any sense?\n  We had debate and discussion about the Delaney amendment with regard \nto carcinogens and processed food and we debated those issues and said \nis it not time to alter, change, and modify that? We passed very good \nlegislation dealing with pesticides, insecticides, and fungicides just \n2 or 3 years ago because we were looking at the fact that the best \nestimate is that there are probably 2,600 to 3,000 Americans that were \ndying because of pesticides and insecticides that were being put on \nproducts and were being ingested. We have run into problems. We had \nextensive hearings about the dangers of insecticides on children, \nbecause children eat more bananas and certain types of food and \nproducts have more insecticides, and therefore it has more of an impact \nin terms of their bodily functions.\n  We spent hours and hours and days and days on hearings because we \nwanted to provide protection against carcinogens in our food supply. \nHere we have now, according to NIOSH, and according to the NIH, 884 \ncosmetic ingredients that have toxic substances. Rather than trying to \ndo something about those in terms of examining those in relationship to \nwhat is being done in the House and in terms of the well-being of the \nconsumer, we have not only had no enforcement or regulatory protection \nat the Federal level but we are eliminating what actions could be taken \nat the State level.\n  It makes no sense, Mr. President, makes no sense at all. That is what \nthe effect of the preemption does. I read the language on the \npreemption and that is effectively what that language does.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have a situation, for example, that has come \nup in fairly recent time, a hair spray that might be inflammable, and \nwe find out that the State of Minnesota was looking at trying to make \nsome effort to try and identify the dangers that result from this.\n  Mr. President, there is a Senator here that would like to address the \nSenate and I am happy to accommodate him.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and I thank the \nranking members who are ahead of me for allowing me this time. I have a \nschedule conflict and I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words.\n  I will have more to say as we move forward with this legislation. I \nwanted to make some opening remarks. I am very pleased that we are \nactually here at this time with the legislation on the floor. It has \nbeen a long and arduous road that we have traveled over this past 2\\1/\n2\\ years to address the need for FDA reform. We have, as the chairman \nand Senator Kennedy said, had numerous hearings. We have listened to \nthe Commissioner of the FDA and his representatives and employees and \ncolleagues. We have listened to outside experts. We have heard from the \nvarious industry groups. But the real reason that we are here is not \njust the fact that a few Senators got an idea that perhaps we ought to \naddress some issues at FDA. The real reason we are here is that all of \nus have been besieged by consumers, by patients, by, yes, manufacturers \nof drugs and devices and others who have outlined to us the nightmare \nthat exists at FDA in terms of approving products for beneficial use by \npatients.\n  What I will primarily do this morning is briefly state the ``why'' of \nthe need for FDA reform and save my remarks on what we have done--which \nI am sure will be outlined by many others--save my remarks on what we \nhave done for debate on Monday, Tuesday, or following that, depending \non how long this discussion goes on.\n  First of all, let me state that the precipitating reason for moving \nforward was the need to reauthorize PDUFA. That is the user fee that is \npaid for by the drug prescription industry to allow FDA to hire \nadditional personnel and to employ additional technology to speed up \nthe approval of drugs. I am not sure who bears the responsibility for \nlack of personnel or lack of updating technology.\n  I have worked with Senator Mikulski on a more comprehensive \nmodernization of FDA, consolidating their campus, giving them the new \ntechnology that they need, and giving them the personnel that they \nneed. Because SBA was in such desperate shape in terms of its ability \nto use drugs we enacted sometime ago a user fee whereby the industry \nitself would be taxed with the money designated specifically to hire \nthe personnel and improve the process and procedures for approval of \nprescription drugs. That is what finally moved us from debate and delay \nto the NIOSH action.\n  I am particularly pleased that Senator Jeffords, the chairman, \nresponded to my concerns that if we move only with a limited PDUFA \nreauthorization we will have addressed only\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\na small part of the problem that exists at FDA, that what we needed was \na comprehensive bill, broad in scope, that would allow us to address a \nnumber of problems that exist at FDA, including substantive reform for \nmedical devices and other products regulated by the agency. I commend \nthe chairman for agreeing to do that. We held extensive hearings and \nbroadened the scope of the bill. The bill we have put forward is one \nthat does address a number of issues and that is why it receives such \nwidespread support from the Congress.\n  Clearly, the vote in committee, a strong bipartisan vote for moving \nthis process forward in support of the comprehensive bill and the vote \nthat was just taken this morning--overwhelming, almost historic in \nproportion--vote on cloture I think indicates the depth and the breadth \nnot only of the bill but of the support for the bill with Democrats, \nRepublicans, liberals, conservatives, moderates, everybody in between. \nOnly a handful, literally a handful of Senators voted against cloture. \nSo I think that shows the need for moving forward on this bill.\n  FDA bureaucracy and delay, inconsistent rules, lack of willingness to \nuse outside expertise--all of this has jeopardized the health of \nAmerican patients. FDA opponents of reform like to state, ``Oh, we \ncannot jeopardize the health and safety of Americans,'' and yet in \ntheir insistence on maintaining virtually status quo in total FDA \ncontrol on their assistance on that, they have denied Americans \nlifesaving and health-improving benefits both through prescription \ndrugs and devices and other forms of medical assistance. They have \ndenied people the opportunity to beneficially affect their health and \nhave forced them to go outside the United States, forced manufacturing \ncompanies to go outside the United States, forced drug device companies \nto go outside the United States in order to market their product \nwhereby they would be subject to the rules and regulations of foreign \ncountries rather than this country.\n  To imply that only the United States FDA has the wisdom to be able to \ndetermine what is in the best interests of the health and safety of its \ncitizens is, I think, a slap in the face to countries like Germany, \nBritain, France, and others who have similar approval processes that \nbenefit the citizens of their own country.\n  FDA average review time, just taking medical devices, average review \ntime for low- to moderate-risk medical devices, the so-called 510(k)'s \nin 1995 increased over the previous 6 years by over 200 percent, from \n82 days to 178 days, for total review days from 66 days to 137 days for \ntime actually in the FDA's hands. The law says they need to do this in \n90 days--the law. We passed the law, a statute here that says that the \nFDA on low- and moderate-medical devices you have 90 days. The FDA \nsaid, OK, 90 days. In that period of time since we passed the law it \nhas doubled in terms of the amount of time they take to review those. \nThose are average review times.\n  Specific examples show how ridiculous and how scandalous the process \nis or has been at FDA. Fortunately, we are in the process of looking \nfor a new Commissioner, and hopefully that Commissioner will bring some \nbusiness sense instead of simply an ideological bent to the agency and \nprovide for some expediting of some of the devices that do not pose \nserious health risk to Americans at all.\n  We all hear about this whole idea that FDA is standing at the bridge, \nkeeping Americans from being subjected to the most egregious of \nviolations, drugs and devices perpetrated by a greedy industry that is \nconcerned only about the bottom line.\n  I have a device manufacturer in my State that makes hospital beds. \nThat device manufacturer, which is well respected on a national basis, \nthat device manufacturer designed a new bed cover. This is the cover \nyou put over a mattress, on a bed. The bed had been approved, the \nmattress has been approved, the old device cover has been approved. It \nis a piece of cloth. But they designed a new one that prevents bodily \nfluids from leaking into the mattress. Obviously, that could be a \npotential health risk to not only that patient but perhaps a subsequent \npatient. So they had come up with a new mattress pad which achieved \nsignificant improvement in promoting the health of patients who would \nuse that mattress.\n  Of course they had to submit it to FDA for approval. This is a class \nI device, the lowest risk to the patient. So they submitted it to FDA, \nand the FDA took 476 days to review that mattress pad before it would \ngrant approval. So we talk about the average review times and \nprotection of the party but when you bring it down to specific examples \nof the ineptness and the bureaucracy that exists at FDA, there are \nexamples on both sides.\n  The other side likes to use relatively rare anecdotes and of course \nmany of these go back 20, 30, and 40 years, and no one--no one in \nsupport of FDA reform--is stating we ought to compromise on health and \nsafety. What we are trying to do is say we think we can expedite and \nutilize new technology that improves health and safety if FDA could get \nits act together. Now, if you takes 476 days to approve a mattress pad \nwhich clearly is in the benefit of the health and safety of hospital \npatients because it prevents bodily fluids from seeping through the \ncurrents mattress pad, then if it takes 476 days to do that, something \nis wrong at FDA. Meanwhile, new 510(k) notifications have dropped \ndramatically, from 7,000 annually in 1989 to a projected 4,800 in 1998. \nSo high-risk, if you look at that, and novel device review times \nincreased from 348 days to 773 days, on average. Many are far longer \nthan that. Some have been languishing in the system for 4 and 5 years.\n\n  Now, the statute says that FDA has 90 days on low to moderate risk, \n180 days on high risk, and yet, FDA's average review time in 1995 is \n773 days on high-risk and novel devices. So, clearly, something needs \nto be done.\n  What the committee has tried to do is simply say, let's take an \nagency that we need, an agency that is important to the health and the \nsafety of Americans and let's see if we can improve it, let's see if we \ncan reform it. The best step and the first step was the resignation of \nthe Commissioner, who admitted to the committee in what was one of the \nmost astounding statements I have ever heard any agency head ever \ndeliver, which was basically saying, ``I am incapable of doing this. \nYou in Congress are going to have to force me to do it. I need the \npressure from Congress to do it.'' Can you imagine a CEO of a \ncorporation coming before the board of directors and saying, ``I am not \ncapable of running this company efficiently like you want me to, but if \nyou will put pressure on me and force me to do it, then I can go to my \nvice presidents and say the board is insisting that I do this''? Is \nthat an example of the weakest form of management and oversight that \nyou can possibly imagine? I could not conceive that the then \nAdministrator, Dr. Kessler, of the FDA would make such a statement. ``I \nam incapable of doing it, but you force me to do it and then maybe I \ncan convince the people that work for me that we ought to do \nsomething.''\n  Well, let me talk about another example of intolerable delays. This \nisn't a mattress pad. This goes to life and death. The product was a \nstent, a small, mesh, spring-like device used to keep coronary arteries \nfrom closing. A new stent product that was developed by a manufacturer \nwas submitted to the FDA in November 1986. In August 1987, FDA said, \n``We need more paperwork.'' It took them that long to figure out they \nneeded more paperwork. In April 1988 and in August 1989 and in June \n1991 were additional requests for more paperwork. An FDA panel meeting \nwas held in May 1992, and they gave unanimous approval to the product. \nFour years after it was first submitted, an FDA panel gave unanimous \napproval to the product. It then took the agency an additional year to \nissue a letter allowing the device to go to market.\n  Now, have you ever heard of such bureaucratic ineptness? After 4 \nyears of reviewing paperwork on a life-saving device, on which the \nstatute said the FDA had 180 days--after 4 years, the FDA panel met and \ngave unanimous approval. From that time, it took 1 year for the FDA to \nissue the letter saying, ``Congratulations, you have been approved.''\n  Now, critics of reform talk about the potential threat to American \nhealth and safety for approval of devices. But\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\nthey never talk about the demonstrated not only threat but consequence \nto the safety and health and even life of Americans for ineptness and \ndelay in the approval of drugs. How many people died or suffered \nserious incapacity because a life-saving stent on which we could not \nget a letter of approval from FDA, which approved it, until 1 year \nlater? How many people, over a 5-year period of time, lost their lives \nbecause a life-saving device didn't receive FDA approval for 5 years? \nLet's say it took 4 years; let's grant them that it took 4 years of \nreviewing paperwork to make sure that this life-saving stent device was \nworthy of FDA approval. There is no excuse. What possible excuse could \nthere be for a delay of 1 year in submitting the letter so the company \ncould go ahead and market the product?\n  Dr. Frist, who is a member of our panel, said, ``I would have loved \nto have had that stent. I known what that stent does. I've used that \nstent. Had I known that stent was available before approval * * *''--to \nthink that it was languishing in FDA 1 year after FDA approved it \nunanimously--it took them a year to get the letter out so that they \ncould market the device. So there are people lying in their graves.\n  This Senator is tired of hearing about FDA being the guardian of the \nhealth of Americans and we should not move forward with any kind of \nreform at all. When you touch the words ``reform of FDA'' and try to \nmove up their approval process or expedite the process at all, why, \nthen you are jeopardizing the health and safety of Americans. The \nburden of that lies on the shoulders of those who won't move forward \nwith responsible reform.\n  Fortunately, today, this Senate, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote--\nonly five people opposed--said it is time to move forward with reform \nand it is past the time to move forward with reform. We owe apologies \nto the families of the Americans who have been denied life-saving \ntreatments and devices because people have blocked reform and efforts \nto move forward.\n  A Hoosier who attended one of our FDA hearings recently had a life-\nsaving vascular graft implanted in his body. Mr. Friar testified before \nour committee. He was one of the fortunate patients to receive the \ngraft because he needed the product only after it was approved. Other \npatients who were denied that before FDA got around to approving it, \nwere not so fortunate.\n  I could go on and on with examples, but I won't. I do get exercised \nover it because it is unfair to characterize those that try to seek \nmeaningful reform as those who somehow don't care about the health and \nsafety of American people. We care so much we want to get something \ndone. We want to get some reform underway.\n  The Hudson Institute, in late 1995, surveyed this question and came \nup with an estimate. It is difficult to talk about an estimate when we \nare talking about human life. The Hudson Institute is a respected \ninstitution. Let me cite an example from their study. Delay in \napproving the coronary stent, they say, reached 27 months. The FDA gave \naccess to this product to American patients 27 months after European \npatients had access to the product. Depending on how one attributes \nresponsibility to the agency, partial or total, the regulatory delay is \nestimated to have resulted in 1,600 to 2,900 lives lost, patients whose \nlives were lost because of bureaucratic excess.\n  So we stand on this floor and talk about it being irresponsible to \nmove forward with FDA reform and we delay FDA reform. We won't even \nallow a disputed issue to come to a debate on FDA reform, when we are \ntalking about a potential loss of lives of Americans who are denied \nproducts because of FDA ineptness.\n  That is the human side of the question. I am not even going to get \ninto the business side of the question because the two don't even begin \nto compare. We have lost manufacturing and jobs to overseas facilities \nin record numbers because manufacturers are throwing up their hands and \nsaying they will go broke waiting for FDA to approve their products. It \nmeans a significant number of jobs. Sixty-one percent of U.S. device \ncompanies plan to market offshore first. We lead the world in drug and \ndevice product development. But they are being pushed out of the \ncountry by the FDA. They are being aggressively lured by foreign \ngovernments who know that our bureaucratically bloated system provides \nthem the competitive advantage they need to draw those American \ncompanies and employees and the brain power away from the United \nStates.\n  A Netherlands foreign investment company has a publication out \nhighlighting the oppressive climate in the United States. They say, \n``Come over here and we will provide a much more favorable climate.'' \nNow, we will hear in rebuttal about some product that was approved and \nlater turned out to be a mistake. Well, there are exceptions and there \nwill be exceptions, whether they are in the Netherlands or in the \nUnited States. We are talking about human beings. We can't guarantee \n100 percent perfection. But that is no excuse for not reforming FDA and \ntrying to give it the tools and give it the wherewithal to do a better \njob.\n  It has been estimated that the delay in U.S. availability of products \nthreatens a loss of 50,000 jobs in the next 5 years. This is one of the \ngreatest industries we have ever had in this country, in terms of \npromoting job growth, but beyond that, providing health-improving and \nlife-saving benefits for the American people. Why do we make it so \ndifficult for them?\n  I don't want to go any further with that because, as I said, you \ncan't compare economic benefit with health benefit. We ought to be \nfocusing on the denial of benefits, the loss of life for failure of the \nFDA to meet its statutory requirements. We are not asking the FDA to \ncompromise; we are not asking them to compromise on health and safety. \nWe are saying: Do what you said you could do, or at least let's look at \nalternatives. I proposed an alternative to try to help the FDA. You \nwould have thought I was proposing an amendment to disband the FDA and \nlet the free market sort it out. It was nothing of the sort. That is \nnot what we are after here. I thought we would try to give them some \nassistance with a third-party review, the FDA certified agencies or \norganizations outside of the FDA. But FDA looked at it and said: You \nhave the testing wherewithal and the scientific wherewithal to help us \nexpedite approval of these products, and as long as we certify you and \nas long as we approve the process, and as long as we have a veto power, \neven if you approve it, if we have a veto power and say, no, we have \nchanged our mind, or we are not sure about that--not even that was \nacceptable to the opponents of this bill. But it is acceptable, \nfortunately, to the majority of the committee. It is acceptable to a \nmajority of the American people. It is acceptable to a majority--not a \nmajority but a supermajority--of this Congress. But yet with all of \nthat debate, there is delay and withholding of moving forward, and \nprocedural delays, all in an effort to oppose an honest effort at \ntrying to help the FDA do its job. The irony is the FDA was already \ndoing some of this. We are trying to provide a way that they can do \nmore of it. So the FDA couldn't come forward and say, ``Well, we think \neverything ought to be done within the FDA.'' They admitted they needed \nhelp from the outside, and we structured the statute in such a way that \nyou even wonder if it is going to work because the FDA has so much \npreapproval, during the process approval, postapproval, veto, and \neverything else on the thing. But at least it is a start. At least it \nis a movement in the right direction.\n\n  FDA has made all kinds of promises about internal approval, approval, \nimprovement, reinventing itself, and so forth and so on. The record \nspeaks for itself. Prescription drug user fee types have improved, and \nwe are grateful for that. And they have improved because we taxed the \nindustry. The industry said, ``We are so anxious to try to get some of \nthese drugs to market we will pay for it. Not only the development of \nthe drugs, which is enormously expensive, not only the approval of the \ndrug but we will tax us some more and we will give the money to FDA, \nand you can hire more people so you can look at it. If you turn it \ndown, you turn it down. But at least get an answer one way or another \nso we can move on to something else, if you don't approve it.''\n  People say, Why don't you do the same thing with devices? Let's tax \nthe device industry. We are not talking about American-owned products, \nor\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\nMerck, or Pfizer, Glaxo, major international companies with the funds \nable to do this. The device companies are often small organizations--\nstartup venture capital organizations. To tax them at this stage is \ngoing to just accelerate driving them offshore, and in many cases they \nin no way have the wherewithal to provide a tax for that. It is not \ntheir responsibility. It is a governmental responsibility.\n  The President's budget hasn't helped much either. The President's \nbudget proposal for fiscal year 1998 reflects something other than an \neffort to strengthen the agency. In fact, it proposed a cut of funding \nfor the agency. They wanted to cut the Device Center budget by 27 \npercent. Clearly that calls for congressional action to address the \nissue, to ensure that the bureaucracy, and the old ways of doing \nbusiness give way to some efficiencies and accountability in this era \nof tight budgets.\n  So that alone is reason for us to move forward. Here we are now in \nSeptember on PDUFA and a jeopardy of laying off--expiring and laying \noff--a whole bunch of people. And we are way behind the timetable that \nwe ought to be on in terms of moving this forward.\n  Just on another point about the size of device companies. Of roughly \n8,000 device companies that exist in United States, 88 percent have \nfewer than 100 employees and 72 percent have fewer than 50 employees. \nUser fees are clearly not workable in a situation like this. And I am \npleased that the bill doesn't impose those.\n  I have all kinds of statistics here, and all kinds of anecdotes and \nall kinds of stories. The bottom line is we are attempting to bring the \nFDA into this century. This century is almost over. We are attempting \nto try to take a tired, inefficient bureaucratic ideologically driven \nagency and introduce it to the modern era. We are trying to take \nadvantage of these marvelous technological breakthroughs in drugs and \ndevices and products that are occurring at an ever increasing rate \naround the world, but particularly in the United States, and make them \navailable to American consumers to improve their health, to ensure \ntheir safety, to prolong their lives, to save their lives. That is why \nwe have formed an extraordinary coalition between Republicans and \nDemocrats. This has nothing to do with party lines, liberals, \nconservatives, and everybody in between. There was an almost \nunprecedented vote in committee of 14 to 4, and we would have had even \na better vote than that if we went back and did it now because we have \nresolved some of the concerns that those four had. We wouldn't get all \nfour. But we would have even a better vote--probably more like 16 to 2 \nbecause we have addressed those concerns that were raised in committee. \nThose Members thought that they had better reserve their vote and \nnegotiating ability. And we resolved that.\n  We have done an extraordinary amount of negotiating from the time the \ncommittee passed the bill out until this point. We were that far away \nin July from resolving this. In the negotiations with Senator Kennedy, \nwe made 30-some concessions on a bill that passed 13 to 4 in order to \nget the approval of one person because one person could tie this thing \nup procedurally. We made 30-some concessions--concession after \nconcession after concession by the chairman, this Senator, and other \nSenators. What is the problem? How can we fix it? Can you work it out? \nCan you go along with the bill, if we did that? Can you do that?\n  We finally threw our hands up in total exasperation because every \ntime we thought we were at the goal line, no, move the ball back \nanother 15 yards to another position. Take that up. Will that do it? \nYes. Solve that. Then they thought of another one. There was always a \nreason to delay and delay. And then we went through the August recess. \nIf we were talking about making a widget, if we were talking about \nsomething that didn't affect the health and the safety of the American \npeople--I suppose that is just part of the process here--but we are \ntalking about people waiting for steps that would save their lives; \nwaiting for approval from FDA of drugs that can potentially keep them \nfrom dying, waiting for products that can make their life a little more \ntolerable while we play games in the U.S. Senate because one person \ndoesn't think it is a perfect bill in front of him, even though there \nis a widespread majority in support of it. That is wrong.\n  So I am glad we are moving forward. I am sorry that we had to invoke \na procedure to cut off a filibuster to do it.\n  I understand people may have some concerns about this bill. It is not \na perfect bill. It passed through months of arduous negotiation. There \nhas been give and take. Every Senator is free to come down here and \nmake his point and raise his objection and offer an amendment and take \na vote. If it passes, the bill will be modified. If it fails, instead \nof taking the ball and going home and saying we are not going to play \nanymore, let's just say apparently I wasn't persuasive enough, or maybe \nI got my facts wrong, or maybe that is not what the majority wants to \ndo. But let's not deny health improvements and safety improvements for \nthe American people and the American consumer just because we don't get \nour way. Let's move forward. We will now.\n  We have invoked cloture. I regret that we had to do that. I regret we \nhad to go through the month of August waiting to reconvene, because \nthere are people out at FDA that are going to be laid off if we do not \nget this thing moving. All the efforts that we have done to try to hire \nadditional people out there will be undermined in terms of drug \napproval because we can't get this bill moving.\n  So let's move forward. Let's raise our objections. Let's have a \ndebate. Let's have a vote and accept the result, and let's move forward \nwith FDA reform.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this at a later time. I \nhave not gotten into the ``what.'' I was talking about the ``why'' \nhere--why do we need reform. I have not gotten into what the bill \nincludes. It is a broad bill with a lot of depth. It covers a lot of \nareas. It is significant reform. It is not as much as this Senator \nwould like. It is more than some other Senators would like. But it is a \nbig step in the right direction.\n  I just note for the Record that I don't know what is going on, Mr. \nPresident, at the White House. We have been without a commissioner now \nat FDA for some time. They nominated someone this week, and then \nwithdrew the nomination 24 hours later. I don't know why. But I urge \nthe administration to continue its search. I am going to suggest a \ncouple of names to them of people, if they need people to look at. I \ndon't do it with any hope that they think anybody I would suggest ought \nto head up FDA--not this administration. But we ought to get somebody \nin there who is willing to exercise the oversight and the \nadministrative ability to work with the Congress in bringing this \nagency into the modern era and improving the way things are done there. \nThere are a lot of dedicated, competent, hard-working scientists and \nresearchers and medical personnel at FDA who deserve to have competent \nleadership, competent management, and deserve to have the support of \nthis Congress in providing the funds and providing the technology and \nproviding the assistance in expediting in an appropriate manner the \nbringing to market of drugs and devices that can make a difference in \npeople's lives.\n  Mr. President, there is more to come later. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1086.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) over 53,000 Americans are currently awaiting organ \n     transplants;\n       (2) in 1996, 3,916 people on the transplant waiting list \n     died because no organs became available for such people;\n       (3) the number of organ donors has grown slowly over the \n     past several years, even though there is significant \n     unrealized donor potential;\n       (4) a Gallup survey indicated that 85 percent of the \n     American public supports organ donation, and 69 percent \n     describe themselves as likely to donate their organs upon \n     death;\n       (5) most potential donors are cared for in hospitals with \n     greater than 350 beds, trauma services, and medical school \n     affiliations;\n       (6) a recent Harvard study showed that hospitals frequently \n     fail to offer donation services to the families of medically \n     eligible potential organ donors;\n       (7) staff and administration in large hospitals often are \n     not aware of the current level of donor potential in their \n     institution or the current level of donation effectiveness of \n     the institution;\n       (8) under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq; 1396 et seq.), hospitals that \n     participate in the medicare or medicaid program are required \n     to have in place policies to offer eligible families the \n     option of organ and tissue donation; and\n       (9) many hospitals have not yet incorporated systematic \n     protocols for offering donation to eligible families in a \n     skilled and sensitive way.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that hospitals that have organ or tissue donor potential take \n     prompt steps to ensure that a skilled and sensitive request \n     for organ or tissue donation is provided to eligible families \n     by--\n       (1) working with the designated organ procurement \n     organization or other suitable agency to assess donor \n     potential and performance in their institutions;\n       (2) establishing protocols for organ donation that \n     incorporate best-demonstrated practices;\n       (3) providing education to hospital staff to ensure \n     adequate skills related to organ and tissue donation;\n       (4) establishing teams of skilled hospital staff to respond \n     to potential organ donor situations, ensure optimal \n     communication with the patient's surviving family, and \n     achieve smooth coordination of activities with the designated \n     organ procurement organization; and\n       (5) monitoring organ donation effectiveness through quality \n     assurance mechanisms.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside for later debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/05/senate-section/article/S8850-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8851-S8869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n                        1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of motion to proceed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to address the motion pending \nbefore the Senate at this time on the FDA reform bill.\n  I have listened very, very closely to the statements by my colleague \nand friend, the Senator from Indiana. I note that his comments are \nheartfelt about a very important agency. The Food and Drug \nAdministration is by Federal standards a small agency. The annual \nappropriations is in the range of $1 billion, and by the standards of \nWashington, DC, it might be ignored by many. But those of us who are \nfamiliar with the important mission of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, those of us who have worked closely with that agency \nand with its Commissioners over the years, and in my particular case, \nthose of us who have had the opportunity to literally fund this agency \nthrough the Appropriations Committee of the House, understand the \ncritical importance of this agency. Though its resources and budget may \nbe small by Washington standards, its responsibilities are immense. \nThere is not an American living who is not touched by the work of the \nFDA. They regulate things as diverse as the radar guns used by police, \nmicrowave ovens used in airplanes, and virtually all of the drugs and \nmedical devices for sale in the United States. We count on them every \nday. And they are an agency, as you can tell from the previous \nSenator's remarks, which is not above criticism. This is an agency \nwhich has a very difficult mission. On the one hand, a person who is \nill seeking a new drug or medical device wants the FDA to issue \napproval as quickly as possible. That is a natural reaction.\n  By the same token, a company with a drug or a medical device which \nthey want to see approved is anxious for the FDA to give approval as \nquickly as possible. The FDA approval on a drug or medical device is \nbetter than any Good Housekeeping seal of approval. It is literally a \nticket for sales, confident sales, worldwide. Once the Food and Drug \nAdministration of the U.S. Federal Government gives its approval, you \nknow that your medical device or your prescription drug is going to \nhave an opportunity for a worldwide market because that approval means \nsomething.\n  There is another side to this ledger. The Food and Drug \nAdministration, with the pressure to approve drugs and medical devices \nby not only consumers but also by manufacturers, also has an awesome \nresponsibility to make sure that those approvals are done in the right \nway, so that the American consumers know that what they purchase is \nsafe and effective.\n  Those are the two criteria. So the scientists and those working at \nthe FDA put in long hours, days, weeks, months, sometimes years, to \nmake certain that a product, before it goes on the market in the United \nStates, is safe. While they are in the process of evaluating, there are \npeople on the sidelines saying, what is taking so long? Why hasn't this \nagency moved to approve this drug or this medical device?\n  I have been frustrated myself when people in my old congressional \ndistrict or in my State have come forward and said, it has taken \nmonths, sometimes years; why don't we have the FDA's final approval? I \nam sure some of that may be associated with bureaucratic slowdown, and \nif this bill addresses\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\nthat, then I think it is a very important step forward. But do not \nminimize the fact that many times the evaluations by the Food and Drug \nAdministration are careful reviews of clinical trials to make sure, \nbefore a drug or device is released in America, it is safe and \neffective. Not a single one of us would want to take a drug prescribed \nby a doctor uncertain as to whether or not it was safe. No one would \nwant to do that. The Food and Drug Administration tries to give us that \nconfidence.\n  There has been a reference made earlier to Dr. David Kessler, the \nlast Administrator of the Food and Drug Administration. The previous \nspeaker obviously shares a different opinion than some about Dr. \nKessler's performance and contribution. I think he is one of the most \nextraordinary public servants I ever had the opportunity to work with. \nThe only holdover from the Bush administration, Dr. Kessler was \nreappointed by President Clinton and I think did an exceptional job. Of \ncourse, we are kindred spirits on the tobacco issue, but beyond that I \nthink his job at the Food and Drug Administration will set an example \nthat others will have to try to emulate, and they will find it \ndifficult to do so. I am sorry we lost him, but he gave so many good \nyears of service to the Federal Government we can be thankful he did.\n  Let me also say that this is an agency which has fallen under \ncriticism politically. When the Republican control of the House \noccurred after the 1994 election, I was amazed that one of the first \nlines of attack by Speaker Newt Gingrich was on the Food and Drug \nAdministration. He made arguments, many of which you have heard this \nmorning, that this agency was stopping those devices which would save \nlives, this agency was stopping the approval of drugs which would save \nlives. And he went on at great length about how they were going to \ndismantle the Food and Drug Administration, literally to turn out the \nlights at this agency.\n  Thank God that didn't occur; saner minds prevailed, came forward and \nsaid that would be a serious mistake. A lot of the references to a more \nresponsible approach came from the same industries that are regulated \nby the FDA. They realized that when you drop your guard, when you get \ninto a no-holds-barred strategy when it comes to the approval of drugs \nand medical devices, the reputable companies will be the first to lose \nwhen consumer confidence is destroyed.\n  Let me give you three examples of what I have seen in a short period \nof time, of the work of the Food and Drug Administration. Some of these \nare forgotten, and they should not be.\n  There was a counterfeit infant formula on the market that was \ndiscovered by the Food and Drug Administration. It turned out that some \ngroup of individuals had decided to take one of the most popular brands \nof infant formula in the United States and to literally copy its label \nand to put contents in a can and sell them as if it was the product \nthat it was advertised to be. In fact, it wasn't. It was a phony. \nLuckily, the FDA caught them and in catching them stopped the sale of \nthis infant formula product which was grossly deficient, which if it \nhad been given to infants across America could have caused serious \nhealth problems. The Food and Drug Administration was vigilant, caught \nthem and stopped them.\n  Let me make reference to one that most people remember. It was only a \nfew years ago that they discovered these syringes in Diet Pepsi cans. \nOh, every nightly newscast told us about this discovery. What did it \nmean in the wake of the AIDS crisis to find a hypodermic syringe in a \ncan of soda? Well, luckily the Food and Drug Administration stepped in \nand determined that this was only an isolated example and a hoax. It \nwas important for the consumers across America, but it was equally \nimportant for Pepsi Cola. Their stock had plummeted when this occurred. \nBut the Food and Drug Administration stepped in and said this is \nsomething the consumers do not have to worry about. We have it under \ncontrol. And because they have the respect of the American people, the \nproduct went back on the market without a problem and the stock resumed \nits climb. I think it is important for us to make sure that we talk \nabout what this agency brings to us.\n  I also took a trip to the State of Massachusetts, to review the Food \nand Drug Administration programs there, in particular, to review one \nparticular company that was making heart catheters. Most people are \nfamiliar with them. Those who are not should know that they are tiny \nlittle threaded lines that the surgeon will insert in your body and \nthen it will course through your veins to your heart, and they can \nliterally take samples as well as photographs of the interior of our \nbodies--a critically important medical device. Yet, as it turns out, \nthis company was making defective heart catheters that literally broke \noff inside people's bodies and then, of course, surgery was necessary \nto remove them. That is the type of thing the Food and Drug \nAdministration must be constantly vigilant to watch out for and to \nprotect us against.\n  I could go on--and I will not--for hours about what the Food and Drug \nAdministration does and how important it is when we reform this agency \nto remember their enormous responsibility to consumers across America.\n  I agree with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, that there are portions \nof this bill that should be reviewed and I hope changed during the \ncourse of the floor debate. I think it is wrong for us to remove from \nthe States the authority to review cosmetics and to put warning labels \non them, if a State decides it is in the best interest of its citizens. \nWe do not have sufficient personnel at the FDA right now in the \nCosmetic Section to take responsibility for complete Federal oversight \nof this large industry. Senator Kennedy has made a compelling argument \nthat we should allow the States to continue to have this authority, to \nput those provisions in place which will protect the health and safety \nof consumers.\n  I have three amendments which I am going to offer, and I hope that \nthey will be amendments approved on a bipartisan basis. One seeks to \nreverse an area of this bill which I am afraid will weaken the strong \nsafety protections put in place by the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990. \nMany of us remember the tragedy resulting from the Bjork-Shiley heart \nvalve failure. Extensive congressional hearings were held in the late \n1980's examining what had gone wrong and how we might prevent future \nrepeats of those terrible deaths when this heart valve failed.\n  In the United States alone, over 300 people died because this \ndefective medical device was implanted. Worldwide, almost 1,000 people \nhave died as a result of fractures in this valve once it was put in \nplace. After it was concluded these heart valves were defective, over \n50 percent of the patients with these heart valves in their bodies \ncould not be located. One widow testified before Congress about how her \nhusband had a heart valve, suffered chest pains and the couple had no \nidea that it was because of the defective heart valve. They had not \nheard about it. They had not been notified. They lived at the time \nequidistant between two hospitals, only one of which was capable of \nperforming open heart surgery. They made a mistake; they went to the \nother hospital. Her husband died. She didn't realize that he might need \nopen heart surgery because the heart valve in his body was defective.\n  The Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 set up a system for mandatory \ntracking of these high-risk devices so that if problems were found, the \npatients with the devices could be located and notified. That is a \nbasic protection.\n  There are only 17 types of devices that require mandatory tracking. \nThey are all extremely high-risk medical devices--heart valves; \npacemakers; vascular stents; jaw, shoulder, hip joint replacements; \nwindpipe prostheses; breathing monitors and ventilators.\n  It is hard to imagine the tracking of such high-risk devices could \never be made optional, and yet that is exactly what this bill does. The \nFDA has already complained that they find it extremely difficult to \nenforce this provision, and yet instead of helping them with \nenforcement, this bill weakens their ability further by making tracking \ndiscretionary.\n  Isn't it curious that automobile manufacturers are required to have a \ntracking system so that if a safety problem is identified with your \ncar's model, they know where to find you. It seems unthinkable to have \na lower standard of consumer protection for a pacemaker or a ventilator \nas compared to a seat belt.\n\n[[Page S8853]]\n\n  The second aspect is surveillance. This is a key part of this Safe \nMedical Device Act which this bill undermines. The mandatory \nsurveillance program of high risk medical devices is especially \nimportant for consumers. These surveillance programs are important for \nthe early detection of potential problems with medical devices. In some \ncases the initial breakage of a device may not cause instantaneous \nharm. For example, in the case of Telectronics' heart pacemaker J \nleads, which were found to be defective in 12 percent of the patients, \nbreakages did not result in harm until the next bout of heart \narhythmia. Surveillance of these leads identified problems in some \npatients. This led to the notification of patients with these leads of \nthe need to have them checked. Such early detection and correction can \nprevent a health crisis.\n  Let me give you another example. Early detection, unfortunately, was \nnot seen in the case of Teflon jaw implants made by Vitek in the 1980s. \nThese implants, once put inside of a human being, were found to \nsplinter and cause massive corrosion of jaws and skull due to the \ntriggering of inflammation and other immune responses. By the time the \npatient suffered the pain, extensive damage had already been done. Many \nof these patients required complete resection and removal of their \njaws, even some of their skulls exposing their brains.\n  Donna Fennema from Ames, IA, testified here late last year at an FDA \nhearing of how she needed 30 hours of critical major medical surgery to \nrectify her splintered jaw implant. She needed a rib graft to rebuild \nher jaw on both sides. To this day, she suffers pain from both her jaw \nand her rib cage. If a surveillance program had been in place prior to \nthe Vitek jaw implant defect, many of these patients would have been \nable to have the implants removed prior to the deterioration of their \nphysical conditions. This terrible tragedy that we have seen is one of \nthe major catalysts, along with the Bjork-Shiley heart valve, for the \npassage of mandatory surveillance and tracking of implantable high-risk \nmedical devices.\n  Yes, it is true that these programs of surveillance and tracking are \nburdensome to industry. Make no mistake about it. But the cost to \nsociety, the cost to each of us, the cost to American families of \nweakening them is far too high for us to be undermining them.\n  The second issue I would like to raise is one that is very typical \nand one that I have worked on for a long time. It is the issue of \ntobacco. I am concerned that section 404 of this bill, this FDA reform \ncould undermine FDA's ability to regulate tobacco. This section \nattempts to limit FDA's ability to look at anything other than the \nmanufacturer's label to determine the intended use of the product and \nto determine whether the product is safe and effective for this labeled \nuse.\n  This section has much broader implication than just tobacco \nregulation. It provides a generally huge loophole through which device \nmanufacturers can attempt to avoid FDA regulation through imaginative \nlabeling. However, it is most worrisome for tobacco regulation given \nthe long history of tobacco companies and their deception.\n  In the early seventies when there was a ban on TV advertising of \ntobacco products, the industry devised every imaginable way to \ncircumvent this ban. They would purchase bill-board space at sport's \nevents which were placed in such a manner and location, that they knew \nthey would be televised during the sport's event. For example, they \nwould purchase billboards behind homeplate of a baseball game or near \nthe scoreboard. They would purchase racing cars with advertisements \nalong their sides. No stone was left unturned, looking for ways around \nthe ban.\n  Around the same time of the television ban on advertising of tobacco, \nthe industry passed a voluntary code that none of them would use models \nthat appeared to be under 21, and yet many of the models which were \nused could pass as high school students.\n  All this suggests to me at least that we do not want to jeopardize \nany type of tobacco settlement with this FDA reform bill. I suggest a \nvery simple and straightforward fix, and I hope that the sponsors of \nthe bill will consider it. It says as follows: Nothing in this entire \nbill shall be construed to alter any authority of the Secretary to \nregulate any tobacco product or any additive or ingredient of a tobacco \nproduct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that issue?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I welcome the Senator's focus on that particular \nprovision. We had attempted to address that question, but it was done \nvery unsatisfactorily. I think the Senator has raised a very important \nissue with regard to what we have done in the legislation and the power \nof the FDA to deal with tobacco in this legislation.\n  We will have an opportunity to address that when we move toward the \nlegislation itself, but I think it is important and one of the \nprincipal reasons for taking the additional time on the legislation for \nthe reasons that the Senator has just identified.\n  For example, I think we have heard from responsible legal authority \nthat if the manufacture of tobacco products were to label them as \n``intended for smoking pleasure'' or ``intended for weight loss'' or \n``intended to be used twice weekly,'' then there is a real question \nwhether FDA can get safety data on the addiction of those health \nhazards.\n  We know how creative--and the Senator from Illinois knows well \nbecause he has been a leader in the House of Representatives and in the \nSenate with regard to the activities of the tobacco industry--how \ncreative they can be in terms of packaging, so to speak, their \nintercessions with the FDA in ways that can circumvent the kind of \nprotections that all of us are so concerned about, primarily with \nyouth, and also as part of this whole tobacco negotiation.\n  I commend the Senator for the work that he is doing and welcome the \nopportunity to join with him to try and address the actions of the \ntobacco industry in the recent budget item to circumvent the agreements \nthat the tobacco industry had made with the attorneys general. That is \nanother issue for another time. What it does reflect is how the \nindustry is working tirelessly at every junction to try and foreclose \nthe opportunity of meeting their responsibilities, either under the \nagreement or under this legislation.\n  I think they undermine the authority of the FDA in their agreement, \nwhich they signed with the attorneys general, and that agreement should \nnot pass under any circumstances unless that measure is addressed. I \nknow the Senator will work with us closely in doing that.\n  But the Senator has identified another potential loophole that ought \nto be addressed. I am very hopeful that we will be able to do that. I \nthank the Senator for raising this because this is another very \nimportant aspect, as we are being asked to rush through this \nlegislation. There are only two or three Senators evidently concerned \nabout this particular proposal. We have seen the fact that the \nGovernors, all of the Governors, the State legislatures sent in their \nresolution and their letter saying, ``Go slow,'' in opposition to the \nlegislation. As the Secretary of Health and Human Services has also \nindicated, go slow.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments on these other items, but \nparticularly with regard to tobacco.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. Another item I \nwould like to address on which I will be offering an amendment that I \nhope Senator Jeffords will consider is that of removing any possible \nmoney taint of the external review process.\n  This bill expands the ability of medical device companies to purchase \ntheir own third-party reviewers. Given the importance to the public of \nthe approval process remaining untainted by monetary influence, it is \nextremely important we ensure that there are very strict anticonflict \nof interest standards for product reviews.\n  In laymen's terms, if we are going to hire companies to review \nmedical devices to determine whether or not they are safe enough for \nsale in America, devices such as the heart catheter that I mentioned \nearlier, we want to make certain that the reviewers are truly \nobjective; that they do not have any conflict of interest or any \nmonetary gain associated with what they are doing.\n  This bill, as currently drafted, has only very limited language on \nthe issue of preventing conflict of interest. Senator Harkin was \nsuccessful in adding\n\n[[Page S8854]]\n\nsome strength to that language. His amendment which was accepted after \nthe markup of this bill in committee, allows the FDA to look at the \ncontractual arrangements between an outside reviewing entity and the \ncompany whose product is being reviewed.\n  FDA employees themselves are subject to a wide range of anticonflict \nof interest legislation for obvious reasons. If you are an employee at \nFDA, if you can purchase stock in the company of the device you are \nabout to approve, you are in for a windfall. We don't want that to \noccur, and we certainly don't want it to occur when we talk about \nthird-party reviewers.\n  Senator Feingold and I will be offering an amendment that would \ncodify into law basic requirements for outside reviewers. We don't seek \nto impose all the FDA employee regulations on outside reviewers, merely \nthe most appropriate. We would be happy to work with Senator Jeffords' \nstaff to tailor these very basic requirements specifically to outside \nreviewers.\n  Our amendment is simple. It merely asks outside reviewers not be \nallowed to have a financial interest in a company that they review. It \nfurther demands that no outside reviewer may receive a gift from a \ncompany whose product they review. To monitor and prevent such \nactivities, the amendment allows FDA to require financial disclosure.\n  It should be obvious to all of us why it is necessary.\n  The money stakes are certainly higher with respect to getting FDA \napproval. Every day we read of how the stock market soars for a company \nwhose product has just received FDA approval. For instance, on May 7 \nthis year, FDA announced approval for a laser system made by a company \ncalled Premier Laser Systems, Inc., that treats tooth decay painlessly. \nThere is something we all would like to see. Within days of this \napproval, the company's stock price more than doubled, and for the \nfirst time since going public in 1995, Premier hit the top 10 in \ntrading volume on Nasdaq, far surpassing even Microsoft 5 days in a \nrow. That is what FDA approval means.\n  As we farm out this responsibility to third-party reviewers, it is \nimportant that they make decisions that are objective and honest.\n  Failure to get approval of a product can have the opposite effect. \nFor example, recently an FDA panel voted 9 to 2 that FDA reject an \napproval for a heart laser made by a company known as PLC Systems. \nTrading in the stock had to be halted after this announcement. Shares \nof PLC had risen dramatically in recent weeks on the expectation of a \nmore favorable result. FDA denial of approval shattered the stock's \nprofitability.\n  The medical device industry produces over $50 billion annually in \nsales. In fact, a recent article in the journal Medical Economics, \nentitled ``Why Medical Stocks Belong in Your Portfolio,'' the medical \ndevice industry was described as ``a hot market that is only getting \nhotter.''\n  Not only are the money stakes high for investors, however, the stakes \nare also high for patients who have to rely on these devices.\n  Reviews must be of the most stringent nature and must be carried out \nwithout outside corrupting influences.\n  The approval of an unsafe drug or device, as I have already \nmentioned, can have a devastating impact. Surely, it is not too much to \nask that a reviewer be prevented from accepting gifts or loans from a \ncompany they are reviewing and that they not be allowed to designate \nanother person for acceptance of such a gift.\n  Furthermore, a reviewer or their spouse or minor child should not be \nallowed to have a financial interest in a company whose product they \nare reviewing. That seems basic and fundamental. I hope Senator \nJeffords and others on the committees would consider agreeing to the \nDurbin-Feingold amendment. The products are too important to the \nAmerican people. I believe we should take a firm stand and specifically \nenumerate basic standards within this legislation to prevent even the \npotential for corruption of this process.\n  Let me say, I was one of the five this morning who joined with \nSenator Kennedy in suggesting that this bill should be debated at \nlength. I hope that some of the items that I have raised during the \ncourse of this debate will give Senator Jeffords and others an \nindication of my concern. But let me say also that I respect what \nSenator Jeffords and the committee has accomplished here. FDA reform is \nneeded, and I think what you are setting out to do, to make it a more \nefficient process, is a very worthy goal.\n  I find most of this bill to be very positive, and I am anxious to \nsupport it. I hope that during the course of the debate on my \namendments and others, we can rectify what I consider to be a handful--\nbut only a handful--of very important items which still need to be \ndebated. I hope to be able to vote for final passage of this bill, and \nI hope Senator Jeffords and others will be open to these amendments. \nThey are offered in good faith, and I hope we can work together to \nresolve some of the concerns I have.\n  Let me close by saying that those who are critical of the FDA often \npine for those countries overseas where it is so easy to get approval \nfor drugs and medical devices. I recommend to some of them that on \ntheir next trip to Mexico that they drop into a pharmacy and look at \nwhat is for sale on the shelves of those Mexican pharmacies. You will \nfind products that are openly advertised as being cures for cancer and \nAIDS. Many countries, which have a much easier process, have little \nintegrity in that process. We want to maintain that integrity to make \nsure the American consumers know that they still are getting the very \nbest. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, Senator Mikulski will be \nhere shortly. I would like to make a few comments before I turn the \nfloor over to her.\n  With respect to the devices, as I pointed out earlier and I just want \nto refresh everybody's recollection, the bill that we are dealing with \nis 152 pages long. The matters on devices are two pages. The matters on \ncosmetics are four. I thank the Senator from Illinois for bringing \nattention to some possible problems with respect to ensuring, as we all \nwant to ensure, that there is no conflict of interest involved with any \nof the companies that they will be dealing with.\n  I point out, first of all, that the FDA has total control over the \nthird parties that will be allowed for the purposes of reviewing. They \nhave total control over that. There are already regulations which \npropose to correct most of the problems, although a couple others have \nbeen raised, and we certainly are going to seriously consider \namendments that will take care of those problems.\n  Let me go through the provisions right now on the existing \nregulations for FDA:\n  Can't own a device company;\n  Can't have any ownership or financial interest in any medical device \ncompany;\n  Can't participate in the development of medical products;\n  Can't be a consultant;\n  Can't prepare advice for companies; and\n  Fees cannot be contingent on third-party recommendation.\n  In addition, I emphasize that the FDA has a list of those they have \nexamined, have gone through to make sure that they are appropriate for \nthe purposes of assisting--assisting--FDA in coming to conclusions on \nthese devices.\n  There are some protections:\n  Can't obtain reviews for the same product from more than one third-\nparty organization;\n  Can't contract for a substantial number of reviews, like more than 10 \na year, from the same review organization on different devices; and\n  Can't contract for reviews from the same review organization where \nthe sum of fees is substantially like $50,000 one year when the other \norganizations have the same capacity.\n  So there are many protections now. Of course, we are very concerned, \nalong with the Senator from Illinois, and want to make sure we have \ntaken care of every possible situation.\n  With respect to the legislatures and the Governors, I will point out \nthat the discussion in that regard has been very limited to certain \nprovisions, but I want to enter into the Record a letter\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\nwhich came to the majority leader, Senator Lott, from Gov. Tom Carper \nfrom the State of Delaware, chairman of the Committee on Human \nResources, and Gov. Tom Ridge, the vice chair of the Committee on Human \nResources. I will read that for the Record:\n\n       On behalf of the nation's Governors, we are writing to \n     express our support for swift passage of bipartisan FDA \n     reform and a reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User \n     Fee Act (PDUFA).\n       Better health care for all Americans is a paramount \n     national goal that is strongly supported by the Governors. An \n     important component to improved health care delivery is the \n     development and approval of safe and effective new medical \n     technology. New therapies, for example, have the potential to \n     improve the lives of millions of Americans and may, in many \n     instances, reduce health care costs.\n       The Governors also recognize that the competitiveness of \n     the U.S. pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device \n     industries--and the hundreds of thousands of people they \n     employ in our states--is dependent on bringing products to \n     market safely and quickly. Constructive reform will improve \n     the efficiency of the approval process while continuing to \n     protect the public's health and safety.\n\n  We have the support of the Governors. They are not going to go \nthrough everything. Generally, they support what we are doing. That is \nwhy we had an 89-to-5 vote today to move forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the nation's Governors, we \n     are writing to express our support for swift passage of \n     bipartisan FDA reform and a reauthorization of the \n     Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).\n       Better health care for all Americans is a paramount \n     national goal that is strongly supported by the Governors. An \n     important component to improved health care delivery is the \n     development and approval of safe and effective new medical \n     technology. New therapies, for example, have the potential to \n     improve the lives of millions of Americans and may, in many \n     instances, reduce health care costs.\n       The Governors also recognize that the competitiveness of \n     the U.S. pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device \n     industries--and the hundreds of thousands of people they \n     employ in our states--is dependent on bringing products to \n     market safely and quickly. Constructive reform will improve \n     the efficiency of the approval process while continuing to \n     protect the public's health and safety.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Tom Carper,\n                              Chair, Committee on Human Resources.\n     Governor Tom Ridge,\n\n                         Vice Chair, Committee on Human Resources.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. With that, I see Senator Mikulski is here. I would, \ntherefore, yield to her such time as she may desire.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his leadership \nin bringing about not only a reform structure for FDA that preserves \nboth the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals, biologics and other \nproducts that the American people utilize, but also for the fact that \nhe has been able to move this legislation to the floor.\n  I also extend my compliments to Senator Kennedy for his longstanding \ncommitment to public health, to public safety, and at the same time \nbeing able to maintain the whole idea of developing jobs in our own \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I have been working on FDA reform for a number of \nyears. I worked on FDA reform when I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee, serving under \nthen Congressman Dingell, where we embarked, on a bipartisan basis, to \nensure consumer protection and that we did not dump our drugs that did \nnot meet our standards on third world countries.\n  Coming to the Senate, I joined with my colleague from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from Utah, [Mr. Hatch], in fashioning legislation \ncalled PDUFA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which enabled a very \nimportant tool to go into place in which we could hire more people to \ncome to FDA to examine the products that were being presented for \nevaluation, to be able to move them to clinical practice in an \nexpeditious way. The leadership of Kennedy-Hatch on PDUFA has not only \nstood the test of time, but has really been shown as a test for being \nable to expedite approval processes and maintaining safety and \nefficacy.\n  But it was clear that PDUFA was not enough, that more staff operating \nin an outdated regulatory framework, without a clear legislative \nframework, was deficient. That is when we began to consult with experts \nin public health, those involved in public policy related to food, \nparticularly with drugs and biologics. And in the meantime, while we \nwere considering all this, something came into the world which was the \nrevolution in biology. We had gone from a smokestack economy to a \ncyberspace economy. We had gone through basic discoveries in science \nfrom the field of chemistry and physics to a whole new explosion in \nbiology, which is truly revolutionizing the world, whether it is in \ngenetics or other biologic materials. These offer new challenges to \nensure their safety and efficacy, new staff and a new legislative \nframework.\n  What we then said is that we needed an FDA with a new legislative \nframework and a new culture. This is then when we tried to put together \nwhat we called the sensible center, working with Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, because we certainly never want to play politics with \nthe lives of the American people to come up with it.\n  Senator Kassebaum chaired the committee during this initiative. We \ntook important steps forward. I say to Senator Jeffords, you have \nassumed that mantle, and I think you have improved on the original \nlegislation that Senator Kassebaum had written.\n  I was proud to participate for several reasons.\n  One, I have the pleasure and the honor of having FDA located in \nMaryland. I cannot tell you the enthusiasm to be able to have the \nNational Institutes of Health in Bethesda and FDA in Rockville, really \nlooking at the life science endeavors, the ingenuity, creativity and \nscientific know-how, to come up with basic knowledge, to work \nextramurally in these wonderful institutions in Maryland, in \nMassachusetts, and Vermont, academic centers of excellence, to come up \nwith fantastic new ways of saving lives and at the same time generating \njobs.\n  Through the work, then, of Secretary Shalala and the Vice President, \nwe did make some improvements. But we must codify those improvements. \nSo this is where we come to today. What I like about the legislation \nhere is that it streamlines and updates the regulatory process for new \nproducts, it reauthorized that highly successful Prescription Drug User \nFee Act, and it creates an FDA that rewards significant science and \nevaluation while protecting public health.\n  Now, what is the end result of the legislation that we will pass? It \nwill mean that new life-saving drugs and devices will get into clinical \npractice more quickly, and it will enable us to add products that we \ncan sell around the world and, through this, save lives and generate \njobs.\n  FDA is known the world over as kind of the ``gold standard'' of the \napproval of products. We want to maintain that high standard. We want \nto maintain its global position. At the same time, we want to make sure \nthat FDA can enter the 21st century. This bill gets us there. It sets \nup a new legislative and regulatory framework that reflects the latest \nscientific advancements. The framework continues FDA's strong mission \nto protect public health and safety and at the same time sets a new \ngoal for FDA, enhancing public health by not impeding innovation or \nproduct availability through unnecessary processes that only delay the \napproval.\n  We are considering a very important issue today. I would just like to \nreiterate the importance that no matter what the outcome of this bill, \nwe must pass the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. \nThis has enabled them to hire 600 new reviewers and cut review times \nfrom 29 to 17 months over the last 5 years. If we fail to act, it means \nthat people who have been working on behalf of the American people will \nget RIF notices because we have not been as quick to approve FDA reform \nas we have asked them to approve products that do meet the safety \nstandard.\n  Who benefits from this legislation? Most of all, it is the patients. \nSafe and effective new medicines will be getting to the patients early. \nIt will meet the\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\nperformance standards in PDUFA, and we will be able to again provide \nthis great opportunity for patients.\n  By extending PDUFA, we can make further improvements in the drug \napproval process. Currently, PDUFA only addresses the review phase of \nthe approval process. Our bill expands PDUFA to streamline the early \ndrug development phase as well. This expansion will be covered in a \nseparate letter. This letter is very significant in how PDUFA will \nwork. The letter includes performance goals that have been worked out \nbetween FDA and the biological and pharmaceutical industry.\n  What are the kinds of things that this will do that will help? \nElectronic submissions. It means that instead of a carload, whether it \nis UPS, IPS, or whatever, pulling up at FDA, with stacks and stacks and \nstacks of material, it can be done electronically. That not only \nreduces paperwork, but actually provides a more facile, agile way for \nthe scientific reviewers to get through the data. Also, we are talking \nabout meeting management, in other words, FDA meeting to discuss what \nare the appropriate protocols; reducing the response time on clinical \nholds; having written protocol agreements; predictable appeal \nprocesses; and reducing manufacturing supplement review times, along \nwith some others.\n\n  These are management tools, and I cannot understand why the naysayers \nare saying no to this.\n  I want to make it clear that these goals that we are outlining should \nbe binding on the agency. It is my intent that the letter that will \naccompany this legislation should be considered as a minimum, not a \nmaximum, commitment. The agency can do better; it should by all means \ndo better. The agency did a great job exceeding its commitments in the \n1992 letter along PDUFA compliance. I am sure they can do it this time.\n  Updating the approval process for biotech is another critical \ncomponent. Biotech is one of the fastest growing industries in our \ncountry. There are over 143 biotech companies like that in my own State \nof Maryland. They are working on AIDS, Alzheimer's, breast and ovarian \ncancer, other life-threatening infections such as whooping cough.\n  I know during the NIH discussion the other day we passed additional \nmoney for Parkinson's. I am proud to report that there is a biotech \nfirm in Maryland that also has a joint venture with brilliant \nneurological scientists from Johns Hopkins. And we anticipate either a \ncure for Parkinson's--a cure for Parkinson's--or certainly the ability \nto stretch out the ability of people to function both intellectually \nand in terms of their motor skills.\n  You know what? That cure could very well come from Maryland. My gosh, \ncan you understand the joy that I will have the day that I can come to \nthe U.S. Senate and announce that we have found a cure for Parkinson's, \nthat it is in my own home State, and that we have a pharmaceutical that \ncan help people gripped by this devastating and debilitating disease?\n  That is what we are here for. We do not find the cure, but we fund \nthe research to look for the cure. We do not invent the product; that \nis up to the genius of our private sector working with our scientific \ncommunity. We cannot ensure the safety and efficacy of that idea to \nmake sure it is not only a dream, but also has the ability to really \nwork in clinical practice in a way that enhances in patients. And that \nis the job of FDA. But our job is to fund the research and to have the \nregulatory and legislative framework to evaluate it, to get it out to \nclinical practice. That is why I am fighting for this. This is exactly \nwhy I am fighting for this.\n  My dear father died of Alzheimer's, and it did not matter that I was \na U.S. Senator. I watched my father die one brain cell at a time, and \nit did not matter what my job was. My father was a modest man. He did \nnot want a fancy tombstone or a lot of other things, but I vowed I \nwould do all I can for research in this and to help other people along \nthese lines. And we can go around the Senate. Every one of us has faced \nsome type of tragedy in our lives where we looked to the American \nmedical and pharmaceutical, biological community to help us.\n  When my mother had one of her last terrible heart attacks that was \nleading rapidly to a stroke--there is a new drug that is so \nsophisticated that it must be administered very quickly. You need \ninformed consent because, even though it is approved, it is so dramatic \nthat it thins the blood almost to the hemophilia level. I gave that \napproval because my mother was not conscious enough to do it.\n  Guess what? That new drug approved by FDA, developed in San \nFrancisco, got my mother through her medical crisis with the hands-on \ncare of the Sisters of Mercy in Baltimore at Mercy Hospital. We were \nable to move that through. Mother did not have a stroke because we \ncould avoid the clotting that would have precipitated it.\n  Thanks to the grace of God and the ingenuity of American medicine, we \nhad my mother with us 100 more days in a way that she could function at \nhome, have conversations with us and her grandchildren.\n  Do you think I am not for FDA? You think I am not for safety? You \nthink I am not for efficacy? You bet I am. And that is what this is all \nabout. It is not a battle of wills. It is not a battle over this line \nitem or that line item. It is really a battle to make sure that the \nAmerican people have from their physicians and clinical practitioners \nthe best devices and products to be able to administer to save lives.\n  So that is what we are all about. I do really hope that we can \napprove this FDA reform. I am glad that we invoked cloture, not because \nI want to stifle debate, but I hope that for whatever ways can be done \nto improve the bill, let us offer those amendments on the floor, let us \nhave a robust debate, and then let us vote on this, because at the end \nof next week we will make sure we have had adequate staff to be able to \ndeal with work at FDA and an adequate framework to save lives and \ngenerate jobs.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for the time. If I seem a little \nemotional about it, you bet I am. I love FDA. I am really proud they \nare in my State. I thank God for the ingenuity of the American medical \ncommunity. And I really look forward to moving the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Maryland whose untiring \nefforts have enabled us to come forward here with an excellent piece of \nlegislation, her undying efforts on behalf of FDA and the people of \nMaryland and the rest of the country to ensure that they are an \neffective, efficient operation and they do all that is possible and \nappropriate to protect the interests of others. There is no one I \nrelied on more who has done more to bring about this bill in the shape \nthat it is in and in a position where I feel confident that it can \npass. So I thank the Senator very, very much for her effort.\n  Mr. President, I know of no other Members on my side of the aisle who \ndesire to speak and I do not believe there are those on the other side, \nother than Senator Kennedy.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present for the purpose \nof allowing other Members to notify me if they do desire to come and \nspeak and we will certainly accommodate them. I will wait for at least \n5 minutes for a response.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have given Members time to notify us \nthat they desire to speak. I have received no requests from my side or \nsupporters of the bill for a presentation here. I believe the same is \ntrue for Senator Kennedy, but I defer to him for that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is a possibility of one speaker but \nnot more than that, although I have some remarks related to the \nlegislation which I will look forward to presenting.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. My present intention is to make some final remarks \nmyself and then to yield back the time on behalf of the majority. It is \nmy understanding, as the Senator has said,\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\nthat he intends to proceed for some time and perhaps have one \nadditional speaker, and it is my understanding at that time that he \nwill yield back his time. I am not concerned for the presentation of \nthe majority because we have another 4 hours on this on Monday morning, \nI believe, so we will have ample time--just to reassure the majority--\nwe will have ample time on Monday to take care of any situation which \nmay arise.\n  Before I complete my remarks, I want to refresh people where we are, \nespecially on the critical issues that have been raised by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. I understand there are concerned people, and I am \nwell aware of editorials and groups who have raised issues, most of \nwhich I have found not to be relevant to the bill which we are \nconsidering. Many of those problems were related to last year's bill \nand we are assured the whole country has available to them the bill \nbefore us here by having it on Web pages and all. I am hopeful those \ngroups who have expressed their deep concerns will review the \nlegislation that is before the Senate and not make conclusions or alarm \nthe public based upon provisions which were in the bill which did \nappear before this body last year but of course were not voted on.\n  First, I remind everyone we voted 89-5 to proceed on this \nlegislation. It is clear that the large majority of the Members here \nbelieve and have full confidence that any problems that may exist in \nthe bill will be taken care of. I remind everyone, as I hold this bill \nup, it is 152 pages long. The areas we are concerned with are two, \nbasically. One is cosmetics. That is an area of deep concern to all of \nus and the present status of things without this legislation. That is \nfour pages in the bill. There are another two pages on the problems \nwhich some see with respect to medical devices and the approval process \nfor them. The issues there have been narrowed down to very small \nissues, but they are important. I do not diminish that at all.\n  With respect to the cosmetics, and that is where the most concern has \nbeen expressed, and rightfully so because of the present situation with \nrespect to cosmetics, there is little or no assistance or help to the \npublic in understanding as to whether there are problems, health \nproblems, created by cosmetics. The industry itself has done a great \ndeal to work within the industry to try and ensure they have adequate \nunderstanding of what the contents of the cosmetics are and they have \ntried to eliminate to the extent possible any potential harm to \nindividuals. That has apparently been fairly successful.\n  On the other hand, the present situation with respect to governmental \ninfluence in trying to protect the public or trying to allow people to \ndetermine the safety of the utilization of cosmetics, there has really \nbeen no effort to do this which is satisfactory to us and to the \nAmerican public generally. The issues are raised in a way that explain \nwhat the present situation is and make it look like that is what the \nbill is. That is not what the bill is. The bill is trying to take care \nof the concern that the public has with the present situation of not \nbeing aware or officially find ways to determine whether or not \ncosmetics are harmful.\n  What the bill does is to say not only should the FDA get into this \nand reassure the public on cosmetics but that they should do that with \nan eye toward uniformity so that if you buy something in Vermont it \ndoes not tell you one thing and you find if you buy it in California, \nsomething else, or other places have no warnings. You do not have any \nway to judge if the product you may be using is one that is safe.\n  Now, the States have had authority to move into this area and thus to \npoint out that this will somehow interfere with the States. You have to \nremember they have had this authority forever, I guess, and only one \nState has taken it upon themselves to really do anything in this area \nto try and solve the problem--not the best of ways, to determine what \ncosmetics are good or bad for your health.\n  What did we do? We said, ``OK, California, fine, we will not get \ninvolved with preempting you with respect to your laws that are on the \nbooks. We will allow those laws to stand. The FDA can work around \nthat.'' But on the other hand, we will tell the other States that you \nare free, too, unless the FDA has moved in on those specific products \nand has made a determination and has exercised its authority, in which \ncase you would be preempted.\n  Now, that leaves a narrow problem we are dealing with and is one of \nthe reasons, perhaps the only reason, we are here, and that is suppose \na State should say no, not only is that cosmetic going to cause \npossibly skin cancer, it may also cause blood poisoning, and the FDA \nonly includes skin cancer. Can we not tell our people they should be \nprotected against blood poisoning? We have not quite resolved that. It \ndoes not seem irresolvable to me or make the bill horrible because I \nhave that much confidence in the FDA.\n  With respect to the devices, again, that is two pages of the bill. \nWith respect to that, it gets down to another problem for the industry, \nand that is, when they have a device and they say we have studied it \nand this is the intended purpose of that device and the studies have \ngone on and it shows it is effective and safe for this purpose, FDA \nsays, yes, but there may be some other uses of that, so we want to do \nstudies on all possible uses of that device. The industry says, well, \nwait a minute, it is being produced for this purpose, being sold for \nthis purpose, intended for this purpose; we should not have to run all \nthese studies on other things that somebody dreams it may be used for.\n  The issue of tobacco has been raised. We were concerned, also, that \nthe tobacco devices--I don't know what they might be, but obviously \nfilter-type things, or whatever else, I don't know. Anyway, we were \nconcerned about that. So, first of all, we asked the CRS as to whether \nor not the bill, as presently drafted, in the device areas would in any \nway allow tobacco devices to be sold out from under the bill and, \ntherefore, create problems and a very serious situation in tobacco. I \nhave the CRS study that was done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1997.\n     To: Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Honorable \n         James M. Jeffords, Chairman.\n     Attention: Jay Hawkins.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Discussion of Possible Effects of Sections of S. \n         830, the ``Food and Drug Administration Modernization and \n         Accountability Act of 1997,'' On FDA's Ability to \n         Regulate Tobacco.\n       This memorandum responds to your request for an examination \n     of various claims and the effect that certain provisions of \n     S. 830, the ``Food and Drug Administration Modernization and \n     Accountability Act of 1997,'' \\1\\ may have on FDA's current \n     authority to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco \n     products. Specifically, you are concerned with provisions of \n     S. 830, as reported out of the Senate Committee on Labor and \n     Human Resources, that may interfere with FDA's ability to \n     regulate these products or have serious, unintended \n     consequences. Two memoranda by different commentators have \n     been prepared and have examined S. 830's provisions as they \n     may relate to the FDA's regulation of cigarettes and \n     tobacco.\\2\\ The following highlights and discusses the main \n     provisions of S. 830 that were discussed in the two memoranda \n     and concludes that it would not appear that S. 830, in its \n     current form, would interfere substantially or negatively \n     with the FDA's tobacco authority. To a certain extent, this \n     discussion is speculative considering that a hypothetical new \n     cigarette product is discussed herein and that a new product \n     application is not pending or known to be the focus of this \n     inquiry.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n              relevant provisions of S. 830 and discussion\n\n       Section 404 of the bill, as reported out of full committee, \n     would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) \n     \\3\\ and provides, in pertinent part:\n       ``Consideration of labeling claims for product review.\n       ``404(a) PREMARKET APPROVAL . . . In making the \n     determination whether to approve or deny the application, the \n     Secretary shall rely on the conditions of use included in the \n     proposed labeling as the basis for determining whether or not \n     there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, \n     if the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading. In \n     determining whether or not such labeling is false or \n     misleading, the Secretary shall fairly evaluate all material \n     facts pertinent to the proposed labeling.''\n       ``404(b) PREMARKET NOTIFICATION . . . Whenever the \n     Secretary requests information to demonstrate that the \n     devices with differing technological characteristics are \n     substantially equivalent, the Secretary shall only request \n     information that is necessary\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\n     to make a substantial equivalence determination. . . . The \n     determinations of the Secretary under this section and \n     section 513(f)(1)[Initial classification and reclassification \n     of certain devices] with respect to the intended use of a \n     device shall be based on the intended use included in the \n     proposed labeling of the device submitted in a report under \n     section 510(k) [of the Act].'' \\5\\\n       Section 404(a) of the bill relates to agency action on an \n     application for premarket approval of a device intended for \n     human use.\\6\\ This section of the bill primarily relates to \n     the classification of devices, findings of substantial \n     equivalence to prior approved products, and, premarket \n     notification requirements under 510(k) of the Act. With \n     reference to 404(a) and (b) of S. 830, several concerns and \n     responses were raised in the commentators' memoranda. \n     Regarding 404(a), Mr. Westmoreland asserts that the bill may \n     limit the Secretary's ability to determine whether there is a \n     ``reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness'' if the \n     Secretary's evaluation for approval is tied only to \n     ``conditions of the use included in the proposed labeling'' \n     of the product.\\7\\ This concern is raised in light of the \n     tobacco industry's history of dealing with the agency, \n     consumers, and others. The commentator notes that, \n     hypothetically, the manufacturer could develop a cigarette \n     that reduces nicotine intake levels and state on the proposed \n     labeling that the product is for occasional \n     consumption, weekend use, or once-a-week use. Under this \n     scenario and the language of 404(a), he claims that the \n     Secretary would assess safety and effectiveness only in \n     light of the proffered ``conditions of use'', when in \n     reality, addicted smokers would most likely consume many \n     more cigarettes than the occasional one or two. Under this \n     scenario, the memorandum states, ``the FDA may be required \n     to approve the product as safe (inasmuch as there are \n     probably few data about smoking once a week.) \\8\\\n       The question is raised whether this provision would reduce \n     or negatively interfere with the FDA's authority and result \n     in the approval of a cigarette that would have the agency's \n     imprimatur of ``safe and effective'' for the conditions of \n     use listed on the label. By way of background, the FDA \n     currently regulates cigarettes as delivery devices and \n     nicotine as the drug in the device under the Act, recent \n     rulemakings and other relevant statutes. The agency has been \n     granted broad statutory and regulatory authority, as well as \n     a great degree of agency discretion, when evaluating an \n     application for approval of a device or drug, particularly in \n     light of strong public health concerns.\n       Section 404(a) does appear to limit the Secretary's \n     examination to the proposed label, to a certain extent, \n     however, it provides an exception for ``false or misleading'' \n     labeling and authorizes the Secretary to ``fairly evaluate \n     all material facts pertinent to the proposed labeling.'' This \n     exception is bolstered further by other important provisions \n     of the FFDCA. The Act currently defines ``label'' to include \n     a display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the \n     immediate container of the article and defines ``labeling'' \n     to include all labels and other written, printed or graphic \n     matter upon any article or its containers or wrappers or \n     accompanying such article.\\9\\ Additionally, under the \n     misbranding provisions of the Act, an article may be deemed \n     misbranded because the labeling or advertising is misleading. \n     When determining if the labeling is misleading, the Secretary \n     shall take into account, ``among other things'', not only \n     representations made or suggested by statement, word, design, \n     etc., ``but also the extent to which the labeling . . . fails \n     to reveal facts material in light of such representations or \n     material with respect to consequences which may result from \n     the use of the article to which the labeling . . . relates \n     under the conditions of use as are customary or usual.''\\10\\\n       Additionally, section 515(d) of the Act currently \n     authorizes the agency to deny the approval of an application \n     if, ``upon the basis of the information submitted . . . and \n     any other information before [the Secretary],'' that ``based \n     on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the proposed \n     labeling is false or misleading in any particular.'' \\11\\ \n     Thus, even though current law does constrain the Secretary \n     to ``conditions of use on the proposed labeling'', much in \n     the same manner as S. 830, other relevant provisions grant \n     the Secretary authority and discretion to examine other \n     material facts and information when evaluating the product \n     application. This permits the agency to view different \n     facets of the product, the manner in which it is commonly \n     used, the presence of misleading or false information on \n     the label, or the absence of appropriate information.\n       When viewed in the context of the agency's broad statutory \n     and discretionary authority under the FFDCA, it would appear \n     that section 404(a) of the bill would not necessarily confine \n     the FDA to look only at the label thereby compelling the \n     agency to make a favorable decision on a product like the \n     hypothetical new cigarette offered for ``occasional use.'' \n     Relying on its statutory authority and recognizing its \n     mandate to protect the public health, the agency would most \n     likely evaluate the new product for safety and effectiveness \n     by considering numerous issues it considers material. Thus, \n     the agency would not necessarily be confined to a narrow \n     reading of only the proposed labeling. Although this approach \n     may be objectionable to some, it is likely that the agency \n     would examine material issues beyond the proposed labeling, \n     particularly in light of the scientific data that indicate \n     the addictive nature of cigarettes, especially for young \n     people, and the debilitating, serious health effects of \n     cigarette ingredients and smoking. While the intent of 404(a) \n     seems to be aimed at limiting or confining the agency to a \n     certain degree and clarifying rules of procedure \\12\\, it \n     does not appear that this section would operate in a vacuum \n     and result in a catastrophic, unintended consequence \n     involving cigarettes or tobacco products.\n       Section 404(b) of the bill focuses also on the label but \n     presents slightly different issues that involve the \n     classification of devices \\13\\ and the finding of \n     ``substantial equivalence'' between a new device and a device \n     already on the market, i.e., predicate device.\\14\\ This \n     subsection would amend section 513(i)\\15\\ of the Act by \n     adding new provisions relating to what types of \n     information the Secretary may request to demonstrate that \n     devices with differing aspects are ``substantially \n     equivalent'' to a product already on the market. To \n     generally explain, current law provides that any device \n     intended for human use that was not introduced into \n     interstate commerce for distribution before the date of \n     enactment is classified in class III (triggering high risk \n     controls) unless (1) the device (a) is within a type of \n     device (i) which was introduced into interstate commerce \n     before the enactment date and which is to be classified \n     under 515(b) [classification panels] or (ii) which was not \n     introduced before such date and has been classified in \n     class I or II and (b) is ``substantially equivalent'' to \n     another device within such type or (2) the Secretary, in \n     response to a petition, has classified the device as class \n     I or II. In sum, under current law all devices are class \n     I, II or III, however, the manufacturer can petition to \n     have its product placed in class I or II.\n       Examining the text of section 404(b) of the bill (see \n     above), the thrust of the provision appears to be that the \n     Secretary, when requesting certain information concerning \n     substantial equivalence, must request only the amount of \n     information that is necessary to the decision and is the \n     least burdensome to the manufacturer. Among other things, \n     this provision would operate during the agency's assessment \n     of substantial equivalency and classification for controls. \n     Section 404(b) would appear to limit the Secretary's inquiry \n     concerning ``intended use'' of the device, and ultimately \n     substantial equivalency, to only information of intended use \n     that the manufacturer includes in the proposed labeling \n     (submitted in a report under 510(k) of the Act.) At the same \n     time, this provision appears to be aimed at lifting perceived \n     information and demonstration burdens borne by manufacturers.\n       The question has been raised whether 404(b) is constructed \n     in such a way that it, albeit unintentionally, could limit \n     the FDA's authority to regulate cigarettes, tobacco, and \n     nicotine by limiting the agency's decision only to the \n     intended uses listed on the proposed label. Mr. Westmoreland \n     raises the concern that clever labels and such a restricted \n     authority might pave the way for cigarette products to enter \n     the market, with less stringent controls, having (apparently) \n     met the tests for safety and effectiveness. The commentator \n     states, ``Under the terms of subsection (b), the FDA would \n     not be allowed to look behind the conditions of use. \n     Consequently, a cigarette manufacturer with a clever proposed \n     statement of use may be able to force the FDA to classify or \n     reclassify the cigarette as an approved Class I or Class II \n     medical device with relatively few controls.''\\16\\\n       Under the bill, to a certain extent, the Secretary would be \n     required to make the relevant determination based on the \n     ``intended use included in the proposed labeling.'' \\17\\ \n     However, the result proposed by Mr. Westmoreland may be \n     unlikely since the hypothetical product would need to have \n     the same intended uses as the predicate device upon which \n     the claims of substantial equivalence are based. Current \n     law provides that substantial equivalence means that the \n     device has the same intended use as the predicate device \n     and that the Secretary by order has found that the device \n     (i) has the same technological characteristics as the \n     predicate, or (ii) has different technological \n     characteristics and the information submitted that the \n     device is substantially equivalent to the predicate \n     contains information, including clinical data if deemed \n     necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates that the \n     device is safe and effective as a legally marketed device \n     and does not raise different questions of safety and \n     efficacy that the predicate device.\\18\\\n       The more likely scenario would be that based on the prongs \n     of the substantial equivalency test, the agency would not \n     find substantial equivalence to a predicate device that had \n     different characteristics or raised different questions \n     without the requisite supporting data. And, under the Act, in \n     most cases, a new or the hypothetical product would be \n     automatically classified in class II.\\19\\ A new type of \n     cigarette that, say, reduces nicotine levels or has a unique \n     filter, could very well have ``different technological \n     characteristics'' that would probably not give rise to a \n     finding of substantial equivalence. Thus, under this prong of \n     the substantial equivalent assessment, the agency would not \n     be overly confined in its judgement. In the context of \n     cigarette and tobacco issues, S. 830 could potentially, but \n     would not appear to affect drastically these determinations \n     by the FDA.\n       The FDA's final tobacco rule and explanatory statements in \n     the Federal Register shed\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\n     some light on the FDA's view of ``intended use'' for tobacco \n     products. In the ``label'' section of the rule, the FDA \n     requires that each cigarette or smokeless tobacco package \n     that is offered for sale, sold or otherwise distributed shall \n     bear the following statement: ``Nicotine-Delivery Device for \n     Persons 18 or Older.'' \\20\\ The explanatory statement that \n     accompanies the final rule indicates that initially, in the \n     proposed rule, the agency indicated that it would exempt \n     these products from the statement of identity and labeling \n     for intended use. However, based on comments received, FDA \n     reconsidered and concluded that it is appropriate to require \n     that the intended use statement noted above must appear on \n     the label. The FDA stated that as with all over-the-counter \n     devices, cigarettes are required to bear the common name of \n     the device followed by an accurate statement of the principal \n     intended action/s of the device. ``As over-the-counter \n     devices, cigarettes . . . are legally required to comply \n     with this provision.''\\21\\ To reflect the ``permitted \n     intended uses'' of these products, the agency requires the \n     statement: Nicotine Delivery Device for Person 18 or \n     Older. The agency stated further: ``The statement of \n     intended use, in essence, incorporates the statement of \n     one of the principal restrictions FDA is imposing on these \n     products.'', i.e., restrict and eliminate youth smoking.\n       These agency statements tie in with what are considered \n     ``adequate directions for use'' of the products. The FDA \n     acknowledged in the final rule that it is very difficult to \n     establish adequate directions for use for cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco, primarily because of the inherent nature \n     of the products, their addictiveness, the numerous hazards \n     associated with their use, and because the behavior of each \n     user, e.g., depth of inhalation, duration of puff, whether \n     the filter holes are covered, length of time in mouth, \n     determines the amount of tar and nicotine delivered to the \n     user from the device. The FDA has stated:\n       ``Tobacco products have a very long history of use in this \n     country, and they are one of the most readily available \n     consumer products on the market today. Consequently, the way \n     in which these products are used is common knowledge. FDA \n     believes that the public health would not be advanced by \n     requiring adequate directions for use. . . . In the agency's \n     view, the warnings mandated by the Cigarette Act and the \n     Smokeless Act satisfy this requirement. Additionally, the \n     Surgeon General's warnings provide information warning \n     against use in persons with certain conditions, i.e., \n     pregnant women.''\\22\\\n       The FDA has chosen to regulate tobacco products as \n     ``restricted devices'' under section 520(e) of the Act and is \n     authorized to require that a device be restricted to sale, \n     distribution or use only upon the written or oral \n     authorization of a practitioner licensed by law to administer \n     or use such device or upon such other conditions as the \n     Secretary may prescribe in regulation if, because of its \n     potentiality for harmful effect or the collateral measures \n     necessary to its use, the Secretary determines that there \n     cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety and \n     effectiveness. Moreover, as a restricted device, the label of \n     the product shall bear ``appropriate statements'' of the \n     restrictions required by regulations under the noted \n     paragraph as the Secretary may prescribe.\n       Returning to section 404(b), the current text would not \n     appear to obviate or reduce the agency's authority in a \n     manner that would ensure that the hypothetical cigarette \n     product (for occasional use) would reach the market with \n     little controls or by default. The agency could utilize the \n     full range of its authority, briefly discussed above, with \n     regard to the test for substantial equivalency, \n     classification or reclassification of these products, as well \n     as the enforcement and definition sections of the FFDCA. \n     Moreover, the agency has been granted additional authority \n     reserved for restricted devices under section 520.\n       Section 604 of the bill as reported raises similar issues \n     regarding the Secretary's authority and discretion to \n     evaluate a product and assign its classification. Mr. \n     Westmoreland's memorandum indicates that this section, \n     operating with section 404(b) of the bill, may limit the \n     Secretary's authority and force the agency to rely only on \n     the manufacturer's statement of intended conditions of use \n     when classifying or reclassifying the product. In brief, this \n     section allows manufacturers who have a class III designation \n     to request the agency to reclassify the product to less \n     stringent control levels, e.g., class I or II. The Secretary \n     then has 60 days to respond to the request. Based on the \n     foregoing and the current provisions of the FFDCA, the view \n     expressed by the second commentator would appear to be the \n     more likely scenario. The FDA would not be limited to the \n     proposed labeling and would employ what it considers to be \n     the appropriate evaluation of safety and effectiveness for \n     class designation.\n       Additionally, the concern was raised that the bill, \n     particularly section 402, may interfere with the FDA's \n     regulation of ``combination products'', e.g., a combined drug \n     and device product. This is raised in light of the fact that \n     the FDA intends to regulate, and is regulating, cigarettes \n     and smokeless tobacco products as combination products \n     whereby the nicotine is the drug and the cigarette is the \n     delivery system and device. The bill would establish a \n     procedure for the FDA when assigning the product is \n     appropriate designation, e.g., drug, device biologic, etc., \n     thereby placing it within the proper sphere or center for \n     regulation within FDA's structure. Many features of the bill \n     are currently being performed via inter-center memoranda of \n     understanding of FDA. Section 402 does not expressly state a \n     person may request the designation of combination product. \n     Further drafting attention may be merited to add that \n     clarity, however its absence would not appear to remove that \n     authority from FDA's powers. Under current law and policy, \n     the FDA is authorized to designate and regulate combination \n     products and assign the product to the appropriate center for \n     its primary regulation. More express language may be \n     desirable in order to remove any hint of ambiguity and to \n     avoid some unintended or unforeseen consequences.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Based on the foregoing analysis and the current text of S. \n     830, it appears that the bill would not interfere with or \n     lessen the agency's authority to regulate tobacco products by \n     the agency. Current provisions of statutory and regulatory \n     law upon which the FDA basis its jurisdiction to regulate \n     tobacco, would continue to be viable and would appear to \n     support the FDA's actions regarding these products. The two \n     memoranda raise valuable insights by discussing and relating \n     various sections of the law so that a more clear \n     understanding is gained. However, it is reasonable to \n     conclude that the highlighted provisions of S. 830 would not \n     appear to operate in a manner that would reduce the agency's \n     tobacco authority in a weakening manner. Although some issues \n     await judicial resolution, the explanatory statements that \n     accompanied the proposed and final tobacco rules issued by \n     the agency, as well as other subsequent analysis indicate \n     that the provisions of the law upon which the FDA bases its \n     jurisdiction, would continue to support, as least at this \n     point the FDA's regulatory actions governing cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco products. Notwithstanding some \n     unforeseeable circumstance, S. 830, in its current text, \n     would not appear to alter drastically that approach. Finally, \n     in addition to any drafting changes or clarifications of \n     text, further explanation of congressional intent regarding \n     these sections or the bill in its entirely may be included in \n     report language, in order to guide a legal challenge in which \n     the court might be called upon to discern the intent of the \n     law, if enacted.\n\n                                               Diane T.

The FDA stated in the final tobacco \n     rule that it would apply the general controls provisions of \n     the Act to cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, including \n     restrictions on their distribution, sale, and use under \n     section 520(e) of the Act governing restricted devices. These \n     controls will be in place while the agency's decision on \n     classification is pending.

This clearly sets out that, in their opinion, it would \nappear\n\n[[Page S8860]]\n\nthat, in its current form, our bill would not interfere or \nsubstantially negatively affect any of the FDA tobacco authority.\n  In addition to that, just to be double and triple sure, we, in the \nbill, say it can't apply to tobacco and that the FDA has full authority \nin the tobacco area. So that is why we got the 89 to 5 vote today. Yet, \nI certainly commend the Senator from Massachusetts, and others, who \nwant to make darn sure that we are really doing the job we think we are \ndoing. I appreciate that and I think it is healthy. The harder that \nSenator Kennedy fights, the more the public will be aware of that, and \nI hope we have as good a vote this time.\n  Mr. President, with that, on behalf of the majority, I will yield \nback the time that we have today, except that I will provide the \nSenator from Minnesota 5 minutes at his disposal, at such time as he is \nappropriately available to make a statement. I would be happy to make \nthat time available for the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 830, the Food \nand Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act.\n  While this legislation covers many areas under the FDA's \njurisdiction, as chairman of the Medical Device Caucus, I want to focus \nprimarily on the provisions relating to the regulation of medical \ndevices.\n  The medical device industry is an important asset to Minnesotans. I \nam proud to say that many of the world's leading and most innovative \nmedical device companies call Minnesota home. In fact, there are over \n500 medical device manufacturers in Minnesota.\n  In my State, the medical device industry has created more than 16,000 \nmanufacturing jobs. Minnesota ranks fifth nationally in total \nemployment for medical devices--and since 1988, the number of medical \ndevice manufacturing jobs has grown faster in Minnesota than in the \nrest of the Nation. In 1994 alone, 53 new medical device companies were \ncreated in Minnesota.\n  Yet, despite all the successes, there are significant hurdles the \nindustry must clear in order to succeed in the increasingly competitive \nglobal marketplace.\n  Medical device manufacturers face incredible barriers that too often \nprevent them from marketing new products, creating jobs, researching \nand developing the latest technologies, and most tragically, from \nproviding U.S. patients the best medical technology in the world.\n  Mr. President, it is easy for debates on reforming or modernizing the \nFDA to develop into an FDA bashing session which does nothing to \npersuade or accentuate the positive results of suggested changes made \nin the FDA reform measure, S. 830.\n  I want to be very clear: The individuals charged with ensuring the \nsafety of medical devices, drugs, biologics, food, and cosmetics are \ngood people, trying their best to do a difficult job. The pace at which \nnew technologies are introduced in the medical community is \nstaggering--and at best, difficult to keep up with.\n  This legislation will give the FDA the tools they need to keep pace \nwith technology and ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, \nmedical devices, food, and cosmetics well into the 21st century.\n  I would like to thank the Labor and Health and Human Services \nCommittee for drafting what is a well-balanced and meaningful FDA \nmodernization package in addition to reauthorizing the Prescription \nDrug User Fee Act.\n  The User Fee Act has proven itself as an example of how an agency and \nan industry can work together to bring highly regulated products to the \nmarket more quickly and more efficiently--without sacrificing safety.\n  However, the regulatory burdens imposed on the medical device \nindustry have had a chilling effect on the industry and its customers--\nthe patients. As a result of regulatory delays, device manufacturers \nare falling behind their foreign competitors or moving their production \nand development overseas.\n  While approval of devices in Europe takes only 6 to 8 months, the \nsame device can be caught up in the regulatory process for years here \nin the United States. What this means is that Europeans have access to \nthe most up-to-date technologies while patients in the United States \nare forced to wait.\n  If this continues, we will not be able to claim that the United \nStates has the world's best health care for very much longer.\n  Many will say we need a strong FDA. I agree. I would argue, however, \nthat far too many Americans have become victims of the Government's \nbureaucracy because they were denied access to devices which have been \navailable and safely used in Europe for years.\n  We can no longer allow ourselves to perpetuate out-of-date rules and \nregulations which ultimately harm the patient, nor can we allow those \nsame rules and regulations to force American jobs, technologies, and \nhealth care overseas.\n  The FDA Modernization and Accountability Act is a solid piece of \nlegislation which will ensure American patients' access to the most \nadvanced medical devices as well as create jobs and strengthen the \neconomy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there are no other speakers on our \nside of the aisle wishing to come to the floor and talk about the \nsubject today. So, on behalf of the manager of the bill, the Senator \nfrom Vermont, and the majority, I yield my time and the remainder of \nthe majority's time.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for a \nquestion on my time?\n  As I understand, Minnesota has passed a hazardous product labeling \nbill requiring warning of all products that are ignitable, corrosive, \nreactive, or toxic, and that that this legislation will effectively be \npreempted--Minnesota's passage of that particular legislation.\n  I was just interested in the Senator's reaction to that. That has \nbeen a judgment made in Minnesota by Minnesotans and passed by their \nlegislature, is now current law, and has not been grandfathered into \nthis legislation. It effectively would be eliminated.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I would have to defer to the author of the bill and to the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I am not aware of the details of that. I \nwould have to look that up to understand it fully.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I think we had earlier comments by \nour chairman, which we welcome, about the fact that California has been \nable to be grandfathered in and they will have the protections. But \nMassachusetts, my State, is about to pass this legislation. The people \nof my State of Massachusetts are concerned about the public health of \ncitizens in that State, and want to provide the protection for those \npeople. The action here in this legislation, as it is prepared, will \nbasically wipe out those protections.\n  I have been on this floor so often and have heard that we want to get \naway from the Washington solution to these problems, that what we want \nto do is get away from this one-form-fits-all solution; what we want to \ndo is let the States make judgments and decisions. And here we are \nwriting legislation that is going to preempt States from taking action \nin the future. We grandfather in one State, California, but are denying \nany other State the opportunity to take action.\n  I find that very difficult to understand, or to be able to accept.\n  (Mr. JEFFORDS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will give my assurance that if there is a Senator on \nthe other side coming over here on the floor and wants some time, we \nwill be delighted to make sure they have an opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont. \nWe have worked long and hard on this issue, although there are areas \nwhere we do have differences, and I mentioned those here today. It is \nvery important. It doesn't negate the point of the substantial progress \nthat has been made on a wide variety of different matters, which we all \nbelieve will make a difference in terms of the health of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I want to just, first of all, address and respond to \nsome of the comments made by my friend from Indiana, Senator Coats, \nabout the FDA, come to their defense because it was a rather blistering \nassault on the FDA. I have heard those comments made by the Senator on \nprevious occasions. But as we are here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nI want to say a few words\n\n[[Page S8861]]\n\nabout the FDA and where it is now. Perhaps those comments might have \nbeen relevant some years ago. I don't believe that they are relevant \ntoday.\n  Out of fairness not only to the men and women that work at FDA day-in \nand day-out and toil to protect the American consumer because the \nprotection for the American consumer sets an example for the rest of \nthe world, and for the agency itself, and for respect for that agency, \nI would like to point out that there are few more important agencies of \nthe Federal Government than the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA \nis responsible for assuring that the Nation's food supply is pure and \nhealthy. The FDA provides a guarantee that the drugs and devices we \nrely on to cure and treat diseases are safe and effective. It does its \njob.\n  The FDA can speed miracle drugs from the laboratory bench to the \npatients' bedside. If the agency does its job poorly, it can expose \nmillions of Americans to unsafe devices and medical products and \njeopardize our food. I think even the most zealous supporters of the \nFDA recognize that there have been troubles in the past. But we would \nalso recognize there has been the sincerest effort to address those \ndeficiencies in the past. To listen to some of the speeches we have \nheard on the floor today, you would think that the FDA was a regulatory \ndinosaur, mired in the past, cumbersome and bureaucratic, imposing \nunnecessary and costly regulatory burdens on industry and denying \npatients speedy access to life-saving drugs. That is a myth. Those who \nwant to destroy the FDA in the service of an extreme ideological \nagenda, or in the interest of higher profits at expense of patients' \nhealth, would love you to believe that. But it isn't true.\n  The FDA's regulatory record is the envy of the world. It sets the \ngold standards for the protection of patient health and safety. The \nagency's recent performance under the leadership of former Commissioner \nDavid Kessler and the Clinton administration represents a model of how \nto transform the regulatory process so that it is more flexible, \nresponsive, and speedy, while maintaining the highest standards of \npatient protection. Indeed, a large number of the positive elements of \nthis legislation simply codify or extend actions the agency has \nundertaken administratively.\n  The landmark PDUFA reauthorization contained in this bill was \nessentially negotiated by the agency and the industry, working \ncollaboratively with the bipartisan efforts here in the Senate and in \nthe House of Representatives. I welcome the chance to work closely with \nSenator Hatch in the passage of this legislation to improve the review \nprocess.\n  In recent years, in partnership with Congress and the administration, \nFDA has responded to growing criticisms of delay in approving new \nproducts by taking impressive steps to improve its performance. The \nPDUFA Act of 1992 was one of the most effective regulatory reforms ever \nenacted. The bill established a new partnership between the agency and \nthe industry. The industry agreed to provide additional resources and \nagreed to measurable performance standards to speed the review of \nproducts. This was unique instance where, in receiving the additional \nfunding, they established criteria to be measured by over a period of \ntime and those were strict criteria and a strict challenge. Every goal \nset by the legislation has not only been met, but it has been exceeded.\n  Today, the FDA is unequaled in the world in its record of getting new \ndrugs quickly to market without sacrificing patient protection. In \nfact, last year, the average review times in the United States were \ntwice as fast as in Europe. Fifty new drugs were approved in both the \nEuropean Union and in the United States. In 80 percent of the cases, \nthe United States approved the new drugs either first or at the same \ntime as the European Union. More companies chose the United States for \nthe introduction of breakthrough drugs than any other country.\n  In addition, to speeding the review times, the FDA has taken far-\nreaching steps to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on industry and \nmodernize its regulatory process. More needs to be done, but these \nsteps have added up to a quiet revolution in the way the FDA fulfills \nits critical mission. When PDUFA was originally passed, the device \nindustry refused to agree to user fees that would give the FDA the \nadditional resources and performance standards that have contributed to \nso much to the agency's outstanding record on drugs and biologics.\n  I remember the negotiations. They were unsatisfactory, regrettably. \nBut even in the device area, the FDA's recent achievements have been \nimpressive. The so-called 510(k) applications, devices approved based \non their substantial equivalence to a device already on the market, \naccounts for 98 percent of all the device admissions. FDA has now \nessentially eliminated its backlog. Last year, it reviewed 94 percent \nof these devices within the statutory timeframe, compared to only 40 \npercent just 4 years ago.\n  Even in the area of class 3 devices, where the most problems remain, \nthe FDA has improved its performance substantially. According to a \nstudy by the General Accounting Office, median review times dropped 60 \npercent between 1991 and 1996. In a recent survey of device industry \nexecutives reported that the business climate for the industry is in \nthe best shape in the 5-year history of the survey. I introduced that \nin the Record in our markup. The industry publications are virtually \nuniform in terms of the progress that has been made and the atmosphere \nthat has been created and the current very positive atmosphere. The \nsponsor of the survey attributes this favorable response in large \nmeasure to improvements at FDA and concludes that the agency has not \nonly reduced the delays to allow new products to be introduced but, \nmore importantly, has also greatly reduced executives' and investor's \nuncertainty about the timeliness of future product introductions.\n  So, Mr. President, the FDA must continue to improve many of the \nprovisions in this legislation. The idea that the reforms in this \nlegislation must be passed at whatever cost, because the agency is \ndoing a bad job, is simply incorrect.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to just return to what I consider the most \ntroublesome part of our legislation. We have had very important \ndiscussions and representations by our colleagues and friends, the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed and Senator Durbin, on \nparticulars of the legislation, which I think need further attention. \nIn my remaining time here, I would like to talk again about the whole \nissue of protection of the health and safety of the American consumer \nas it relates to cosmetic products. That is the most egregious and, I \nbelieve, unjustified provision in the bill, which would effectively \ncripple consumer protections by preempting State regulations on \ncosmetics.\n  I note for the Record that these provisions, as I mentioned, were not \nin the chairman's mark, they were not the subject of significant \nhearings, and they have no place in the bill, whose primary purpose is \nto reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. That is the \nprincipal purpose of the bill, the reauthorization of that program and \nto try and accept these adjustments, incorporate into the law some of \nthe measures which have been so successful administratively by the FDA. \nAnd also to incorporate the great majority of the measures which have \nbeen included in the bill that relate to pharmaceutical products and \ndevice products.\n  If the Congress were earnest about addressing over-the-counter drug \nand cosmetic regulation, it would have undertaken a serious and \ndetailed inquiry into the regulatory structure and authorities which \nassure that consumers are adequately protected before even remotely \ncontemplating the possibility of preempting active and essential State \nprotections.\n  The preemption of cosmetic regulation is especially outrageous and \nshows a callous disregard for the health of American men, women and \nchildren. Cosmetics are broadly used by Americans, far more broadly \nthan prescription drugs and medical devices and biological products.\n  Mr. President, I want to mention why we find ourselves where we find \nourselves today and why this issue is of such importance. I have here \nthe testimony of Commissioner Young from some years ago, 1988. It \npoints out that Congress, in 1938, recognized the public health \nproblems associated with cosmetics and addressed them in the laws\n\n[[Page S8862]]\n\nthey enacted based on the science available to them. But science and \nthe cosmetics industry have changed. In 1938, at most, only a few \nhundred ingredients were used to formulate cosmetics, and the industry \nwas small in numbers of manufacturers that marketed products. Today, \ntens of thousands of cosmetics are in distribution, and the number of \ningredients used has risen to an estimated 4,000 for producing a \nmultitude of base formulation in equal number for compounding \nfragrances. Regulatory sciences have also progressed. When the law \nregulating cosmetics was enacted in 1938 the science was based on a \nless sophisticated concept for evaluating the safety of chemicals used \non the skin. If you saw a reaction, you treated it; then avoid it. \nToday, science can take into account the effects produced under chronic \nlong-term exposure to trace contaminants in addition to acute toxic \neffects, such as immediate skin irritations, contact allergic reaction, \nsystematic reaction resulting from inhalation and ingestion. In 1938, \nthe skin was considered to be an impenetrable barrier to cosmetics or \nother substances.\n\n  As the number of ingredients and products has multiplied through \nscientific and technological innovation, our ability to measure minute \namounts of residual contaminants and unwanted substances also has taken \na quantum leap. At the same time science has developed more precise \nways to assess risk, taking into account relevant factors such as use \nand exposure over a lifetime.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was pointing out how the change in the \ncomplexity of the different products had taken place from 1938 and the \nnumber of products that were out there; the number of potentially \ndangerous products that were out there and the progress that had been \nmade from the time when there were only a few hundred of them; back to \n1938.\n  Listen to what we have now at the present time. This is according to \nthe Food and Drug Administration and the studies that have been done. \nThe number of cosmetic ingredients in the industry's own inventory is \nover 7,500. The industry has been adding new ingredients at a rate of \n1,000 per year for the last few years. Virtually none of these \ningredients have been properly tested for safety. The industry's safety \nreview process has reviewed only 450 of the most commonly used cosmetic \ningredients. That is about 20 a year. At this rate, even using the \nindustry's own process, it will be many years before new ingredients \nare considered for safety.\n  So the sheer number of cosmetic ingredients in products makes safety \nassurance difficult. And most adverse reactions for cosmetics are \nimmediate burns or irritation--long-term effects which do not show up \nfor many years, such as cancer or reproductive effects are even more \ndifficult to determine. They require special studies designed to \nmeasure this risk, while many ingredients are studied for only short-\nterm effects when they are added to products. Risk of cancer or \nreproductive effects are not available for the vast majority of \ncosmetic ingredients.\n  Mr. President, we have been talking here this morning and this \nnoontime about the authority and responsibility of different agencies. \nWe have been talking about the power of the States. We have been \ntalking about rules and regulations. But, when we are talking about \nhealth and safety, we are talking about real people.\n  Let me give you the kinds of examples that we are dealing with.\n  A woman from Santa Rosa--this is 1995, April 22--complained about an \nacrylic product which is for nails. She had the product applied to her \nnails. The product burned, and the cosmetician tried to remove it. \nSince the incident, six of her nails have fallen out.\n  That was according to the California Department of Health Services, \nin April 22, 1995.\n  Here is another one.\n  On her 29th birthday, a woman from New Jersey was supposed to retire \nfrom the career she loved. She was a hairdresser for 11 years until a \nseries of ailments, including difficulty breathing, burns in her \nsinuses and severe headaches prompted her to quit in August 1985. Her \ndoctors had concluded that the beauty products she used on the job led \nto her medical problems. She had no idea what was actually in the \nproducts which she used in her beautician job. Lack of labeling is \nneither unusual nor illegal, although cosmetic manufacturers are \nrequired to list ingredients containing products sold to consumers. \nThey need not do so for products sold for use only by professionals.\n  Another case is Carolyn, a secretary from Rockville, MD. She arrived \nat a wedding shower and realized the permanent she had received at a \nbeauty salon the day before resulted in a red swollen, face. Carolyn's \nis a case of cosmetic contact dermatitis, also known as acute allergic \ninflammation of the skin caused by contact with various substances \nfound in cosmetics, including materials used by the hair stylist. This \nis a case that was reported to the FDA.\n  A 33-year-old housewife consulted her dermatologist because of \ninflammation of her hands, face, and neck. She had experienced two \nsimilar episodes earlier in the year. After the skin properly healed, \nthe physician determined through appropriate testing, that Swedish \nformula lotion had caused the adverse reaction.\n  A telephone company supervisor was hospitalized after a 2-year \nhistory of chronic irritation of her eyelids. She received a variety of \ntopical medications without relief. Her contact history revealed a long \nlist of cosmetic eye drops, and multiple spray perfumes. All the \ncosmetics were removed from her hospital environment, and after her \nskin healed, patch testing showed lanolin in her creams--lanolin in her \ncreams--was causing her condition.\n  That is from a subcommittee hearing on health.\n  The use of chemical skin peeling products caused severe injuries, \nincluding reports of skin burns from using a product called Peel Away. \nFDA sources said such products can penetrate the skin too deeply \ncausing severe skin damages. In several cases persons have been \nhospitalized with severe burns, swelling, and pain. In one case, a \nCalifornia woman suffered seizures, shock, and second-degree burns \nafter a combination of skin peel chemicals was applied to her legs by a \nbeautician. Skin peeling procedures used to be carried on by plastic \nsurgeons.\n  However, they are now being done by nonmedical professionals, by \nbeauticians and some using newly marketed preparations. Many have \ninadequate instructions. None has been approved by the FDA as being \nsafe and effective. Again, an FDA consumer report.\n  A letter from the CDC cited nine cases of eye infections due to \nmicroorganisms contained in mascara. One was a 47-year-old woman who \ndeveloped a corneal abscess within days of scratching her eye with a \nmascara wand. The woman eventually needed a corneal transplant.\n  As I understand it, it is because of the failure to be able to \nindicate that mascara needs an expiration date.\n  So, Mr. President, this list goes on. I want to show what the States \nhave been doing with regard to the protection for the American \nconsumer. The issue now that is before the Senate on the FDA reform \ndeals with the medical devices and pharmaceuticals and the extension of \nwhat we call the PDUFA, which will help to expedite the consideration \nof those measures.\n  By and large, there is strong bipartisan agreement to those \nprovisions. There are several that have been identified today that need \nfurther attention, but men and women of good will can work that out and \nwork it out with the administration so that we can have a successful \nconclusion. But what was not considered in the original bill is the \nprovisions that apply to preempting the States from giving protections \nto their consumers on the use of cosmetics. What we have recognized in \nthis debate is that the Food and Drug Administration does not today \nhave the authority, power, or personnel to protect the American \nconsumer on the issue of these cosmetics.\n  What we know overwhelmingly today is that the number of dangerous and \ntoxic products and the number of carcinogens has expanded exponentially \nand is continuing to expand. All you have to do is look at the past \nrecord, of the numbers that have been introduced, and it is continuing \nand continuing to grow and those products are not being tested \nadequately today.\n\n[[Page S8863]]\n\n  So who has been protecting the American consumer? Who has been \nprotecting the American public? The States have been doing it, and \nprimarily California has been doing it, under the legislation which \nthey have passed. How important that has been. It has not ended up with \nactions that have been taken by the State of California as the result \nof very extensive studies that products have been removed. What has \nhappened is that the producers and the manufacturers have withdrawn the \nproduct, addressed the problem, put it back on the market, and by and \nlarge, if you look at the advertising, they would say the product is \nbetter today than it was yesterday.\n  That has been the record. That has been the record. And that is why \nthis is so important. Just review with me, Mr. President, the extent of \nthis preemption--as I mentioned before, the extent of this preemption \nof the cosmetic industry in the States. This is the language that there \nwill be the preemption for--``labeling of cosmetics shall be deemed to \ninclude any requirement relating to public information or any other \nform of public communication relating to the safety or effectiveness of \na drug or cosmetic.''\n  There it is in the legislation. They are effectively saying no to the \nStates in providing public information or any public communication \nrelating to safety. If the States are trying to protect their people \nand they develop public information on the basis of scientific studies, \nthey are prohibited under this legislation. I don't know what the \npenalties are. I don't know what the civil penalties are, but they must \nbe in there. They are prohibited from providing public information or \nany form of public communication relating to safety or effectiveness.\n  That is what the cosmetic industry is doing in this legislation. That \nis the disdain that the cosmetic industry has for those in the States \nwho are trying to protect the public. That is the arrogance that this \nindustry has for legislators or Governors or attorneys general or \nmedical professionals who are interested in the public.\n  This is what this says. You cannot do it. You cannot provide public \ninformation even with regard to safety. That is arrogance. That is \ngreed. That is the greed of a $20 billion industry.\n  What do the States say? Well, why are you so worked up, Senator? It \nisn't just myself. Again, we have shown we have the letters from the \nGovernors, the State legislators. This is not just one Senator's \nposition. This happens to be the position of the Governors and the \nState legislators.\n  Yes, I listened to the comments of my friend and colleague, Senator \nJeffords, about the general statements of two of the Governors with \nregard to the health provisions on pharmaceuticals and devices, that \nis, an admirable job has been done. I think we still have areas to deal \nwith. But I would certainly sign on to that. But what we are talking \nabout is what we are saying to the States. The cosmetic industry is \nsaying to the States you are not going to stick your nose in and \nprotect the consumers there. What have they done in the past? Why are \nthe other Governors worked up about it? Because of what these two \ncharts demonstrate, Mr. President.\n  Here we have the issue of lead which is known to cause birth defects \nand has also been found in hair dye. That is the result of State \naction, of State analysis, of various hair dyes that are out there that \ncontain lead product. Initially, when there was the analysis, they \nsaid, well, this really isn't dangerous because it is just on the \nscalp. Then they did additional kinds of studies and found that the \nlead got into the individuals, obviously, who were using it. That lead \nwas passed on to pets, children playing with pets, children ingesting \nit and when people are washing their hair day after day after day it \ncauses a birth defect. Lead is one of the principal causes of mental \nretardation among children, period. We find, as a result of State \nactivity, they have found it and it has been changed in many, many of \nthe products--not all of them, because the cosmetic industry was able \nto get an exclusion from some participation.\n  Mercury, which can cause mental retardation, has been found in \nlipstick and nail polish--lipstick and nail polish, mercury. With all \nthe implications that has in terms of women's health and in terms of \nsafe pregnancies, it is found in lipstick and nail polish. That was \nanother study that was done in California.\n  Alpha hydroxy, a known carcinogen, has been found in face creams. \nThat was not done by the Food and Drug Administration. That is a result \nof State activities. There is not a physician in this country who does \nnot know the dangers of lead and mercury and the alpha hydroxy to the \nAmerican consumer, primarily women. There isn't a doctor who will not \ntell you that. Yet this legislation is saying, no more. \nThis legislation is saying, no more. ``Any requirement relating to \npublic information or any other form of public communication relating \nto safety or effectiveness of the drug or cosmetic''--preempted. So we \nare saying, if you find this out, we are preempting you. You are not \ngoing to have to tell the public.\n\n  As a result of State regulation protecting consumers, we have seen \nthat States forced the removal of reproductive toxins from lipstick and \nnail polish. That is a result of State action. You have to admire the \nresourcefulness, the innovativeness, the persistence of the leaders in \nStates that have had the courage and the determination and have been \nwilling to take on the cosmetic industry, the cosmetic industry that by \nits own agreement spends 70 percent of its lobbying dollars in the \nStates rather than on the Federal Government. You can understand that, \nbecause we haven't got any power over it, so they have targeted it in \nthe States. Yet you find the courage of State public health officials \nwho have been willing to force the removal of reproductive toxins from \nlipstick and nail polish. They didn't take the products off the \nmarkets. The manufacturers took them off the market and they addressed \nthose issues.\n  States forced the removal of harmful lead from hair dyes and antacids \nand calcium supplements. The States forced the removal of mercury from \nsuppositories. These are just examples.\n  How do we know how many other dangers there are out there when we \nhave an explosion of dangerous products that have been agreed to by \nRepublican and Democratic leaders of the FDA over the period of years--\nincreasing exponentially with the dangers of toxins and carcinogens. \nThe problem isn't getting less. The problem and the danger is getting \nmore as every consumer understands the range of additional kinds of \nproducts that are out there and available to them. Nonetheless, we are \nasked on the floor of the Senate to say no to the States. We are not \ndoing it at the Federal level.\n  As I mentioned before, if you said, well, we are going to have a \nwhole review, regulatory review, we are going back to say, OK, we will \npreempt the States but we will find out what we are going to do with \nregard to providing protection--we have had, as I mentioned earlier, \nthe GAO studies that have been done 10 years ago which made a series of \nrecommendations to the Congress about steps we ought to take if we are \ngoing to protect the public--then maybe, maybe then it makes some \nsense. But we have not done that. We have not done that. The FDA has \nbeen starved in resources to even fulfill its requirement for \nprotection in terms of the American consumers in medical devices and \nwith regard to pharmaceuticals.\n  So we have a situation where we have limited, limited, limited \nauthority under the FDA to protect the public for a range of these \ncosmetics. We find a record today where you are getting the explosion \nof these dangerous products, of toxins and carcinogens. Carcinogens \ncause cancer--cause cancer. We are seeing those numbers expand. We are \nfinding completely inadequate policing by the cosmetics industry. We \nfind the only breath of air that is out there to protect the public is \nthe States. California is leading the way. Thank God, at least \nCalifornia has been grandfathered in.\n  What we are saying is California is grandfathered in, but my State of \nMassachusetts, which is just about to pass a similar law, is out. We \ncannot protect people. Washington knows best. Washington is saying to \nMassachusetts, no matter how you want to protect your consumers up \nthere, you can't do it because we are preempting you.\n  Come on, Mr. President. This is a health issue. This is a safety \nissue.\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\n This involves primarily women, it involves children, and to some \ndegree men in our society. But it involves health and safety.\n  We have thousands and thousands of complaints about various products. \nI indicated earlier today--maybe I didn't--about the number of people--\nthere were 47,000 cosmetic-related injuries in the emergency rooms in \nAmerican hospitals in 1987--47,000. I wonder how many today, with \ngreater utilization of cosmetics, greater danger, more toxins, more \ncarcinogens. These are just the emergencies. These are not the kinds of \nsituations that maybe--they may be--have long festering, long lasting \nkinds of implications and have been festering for a long period of \ntime.\n  That is what is happening out there--47,000 cosmetic-related injuries \nin the emergency rooms. How many others where people go back to their \ndoctor and do not go through the emergency room? How many others?\n  We have scores, scores and scores of complaints that have come to the \nFDA, and they go down the list. Thousands of consumer complaints in \n1996 alone: Equate Baby Oil--these are complaints to the FDA--their \ncomplaints are eye tissue damage. Disney Kid Care Bubble Bath: \nurogenital track reactions. Nat Robins Eye Shadow Pencils: eye rash, \nburns and irritation. Flame Glow No Mistake Eyeliner Pen, black magic \ncolor: Rash, burns, and irritation. Incredible Lex Mascara, Eye \nPerfector, Dramatic Timing Faceneck, Covergirl Professional Advanced \nMascara: rash and burns.\n  These are the companies. You have the Disney Co., the Reckitt & \nColman Co., Softsoap Enterprises, Great American Cosmetic. They produce \nNat Robins eye shadow pencils.\n  You have Del Laboratories, Estee Lauder eye shadow; Avon products; \nProcter & Gamble, rash and burns.\n  You have Helene Curtis, Salon Selective Styling, flammable, resulting \nin thermal burns.\n  You have American Pride, hair relaxer, Alberto Culver lotions, hair \ntissue damage and hair loss.\n  You have Clairol, Clairol Infusion 23 Shampoo, hair loss and hair \ntissue damage;\n  Del Laboratories;\n  You have Products Naturistics Mango Shampoo, hair loss and damage;\n  Helene Curtis, Suave Balsam and Protein Shampoo, hair loss, hair \ndamage.\n  Vigoral--we find hair loss and tissue damage.\n  Alberto Culver Co., VO5, hot oil concentrated treatment, hair loss \nand tissue damage;\n  Hydrox Laboratories, Fresh Moment Mouthwash, mouth infections--mouth \ninfections;\n  Carter Wallace, Arrid deodorant, bleeding and infection with \nutilization;\n  Apollo Health Care, Baby Bear Lotion, pain, including itching, \nstinging, burning, and soreness.\n  Mr. President, these are just some of the items. I may very well \ninclude the whole list in the Record on Monday. These just give an \nexample of some of the leading companies.\n  Some may say, these are not really accurate. We would know whether \nthey are accurate if we were able to give the assurances that we had \nthose in the States who were looking into this and be able to say, \n``Look, this isn't a problem.'' But now we are not going to know \nbecause all the States are preempted. Now we are going to find these \nreports are going to come in more and more. We will have to just \npresume that they are accurate, because the cosmetic industry will not \nlet us find out whether they are or are not accurate. They will not \npermit the publication of information that is going to reflect poorly \non either safety or effectiveness.\n  Mr. President, these are just some of the items that I think form the \ncompelling case for State action. I think we will on Monday go through \nsome of the particular cases in more detail on the California \nsituation, because I think that they have really had the soundest \nrecord. It isn't easy to get this kind of information, but we will go \nthrough it. These that I just mentioned are some of the thousands of \nconsumer complaints to Government agencies. This is only for a few \nmonths of the year, and I have read just a very few of them. I will \nperhaps get into even more of them later on.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned earlier a study by the General Accounting \nOffice which reported that more than 125 ingredients used today are \nsuspected of causing cancer. We have scores of cosmetic ingredients \nthat can damage the nervous system, including headaches, drowsiness, \nconvulsions.\n  To all of those watching this program I would say, ``don't discount \nthe fact that perhaps some of your ailments--headaches, drowsiness, and \nconvulsions--may actually be resulting from the use of cosmetics.'' \nDon't discount that, because the record shows that cosmetics \nmanufacturers are including ingredients that can cause those symptoms. \nYou don't know, your State won't know, the Federal Government won't \nknow, we won't be able to tell you because of the power of the cosmetic \nindustry in foreclosing that kind of study and the publication of \ninformation about the real health implications.\n  The GAO found that additional Federal authority is necessary to \nprotect the public. That is the General Accounting Office. It is not \nthis Senator from Massachusetts, not a Democrat, it is not a \nRepublican. Here is the General Accounting Office reaching the \nconclusion, after reviewing this whole subject matter, that if you want \nto protect the public, you need greater Federal authority--we are not \ngetting that today. The only authority that we have out there is at the \nState level, and this bill is taking that away.\n  How much do we have to yield to the greed of this industry? How much? \nAnd why? Why should we do it? We patch together something that will \ntake care of California because they passed their law a couple of years \nago. But we say to the other 49 States, ``You can't, you are never \ngoing to be able to do it again, never be able to do it again, ever.'' \nThey have been able to protect their consumers. Hopefully, they will be \nprotecting the people of Massachusetts, because that is the only way we \nare going to be protected, not at the Federal level, but through their \nown leaders, legislature, and representatives. No, we are just saying \nabsolutely not.\n  So, Mr. President, the cosmetic industry wants the public to believe \nthat no effective regulation is necessary or desirable. They are \nmasters of the slick ad and expensive public relations campaign, but \nall the glamour in the world cannot obscure the facts.\n  Mr. President, I just showed what the results of some of these \nactions are in terms of affecting people. I mentioned the peelaway \nproduct. This is a before and after appearance and complaint of the \npeelaway product. You can take a look and see what happens to people.\n  These are various ingredients which have been put on an individual's \nfeet. Look at the reactions to it. We are saying, no, we are not going \nto permit the States to try and do something about that kind of \nactivity. And we could have had a whole series of charts up here.\n  I mentioned just a few moments ago what was happening in terms of \nburns and irritations that are occurring with skin products and what is \nhappening to eye tissue and what is happening with rash and burns and \nhair tissue and hair loss and mouth infections and bleeding--the list \ngoes on and on.\n  We could have had charts all around this room. Generally speaking, \nwhen you have this kind of circumstance, we would be in here debating \nwhat to do about it. Instead of thinking about what we are going to do \nabout it, we are talking about what we are not going to do about it.\n  Mr. President, here we have seen what the States have done, what the \nproblems have been, what the dangers are to the American consumer in \nterms of mercury, lead, and other substances in products that everyone \nknows are dangerous and are health hazards. Here we have a problem, and \nit is getting bigger. The products that are being produced for the \nmarket are more dangerous. Yet, we are doing less and less and tying \nthe hands of the local communities to act in our stead.\n  We allow States to decide whether your bottles are going to be \nrecycled or whether they are going to be buried. We permit the States \nto decide what they are going to do about licensing barbers. States \ndecide and have rules and regulations and laws about pets. We have \nStates that have rules and regulations about how close to the crosswalk \nyou can park your car. We have regulations in the States about\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\nwhat store hours are going to be, how late a store can be open. But \nthis bill would prohibit the States from protecting consumers from \nlipsticks, hair creams and the soaps, hair dyes, mascara, and \ndeodorants that can give you cancer or can catch you on fire as a \nresult of flammable ingredients, or cause serious birth defects.\n  Now, does that make any sense at all? Does that make any sense at \nall? When you have the most serious dangers in terms of health and \nsafety, we are denying States the opportunity to do something about it, \nbut we will let them go ahead and look after these other kinds of \nissues which are not related in any particular way to health and \nsafety.\n  It just doesn't make any sense. It makes no sense at all. The \nproponents of this provision know they couldn't pass this legislation \nif it wasn't tagged on to the Food and Drug Administration bill. They \nwouldn't dare bring this legislation out here on its own. The reason \nthey tagged it on this bill is because they knew the importance of food \nand drug reform. They knew that we had to pass the extension of PDUFA, \nwhich is a key program to provide sufficient resources to the Food and \nDrug Administration to get the qualified people who can help expedite \nthe more rapid consideration of new products, new pharmaceuticals in \nthe Food and Drug Administration and has been very creatively utilized \nover there.\n  So what do they do? They tag this on to that train. This legislation \nwould be laughed out of this body if it came up here on its own. Why \ndon't they try to bring it up on its own? We have Members in the Senate \nsay, ``We don't understand, there are just one or two Senators troubled \nby this.'' All the Governors seem to be troubled by it, and you can't \nblame them. They have the fundamental responsibility for protecting \nhealth and safety. That has been fundamentally a responsibility at the \nState and local level. It is a fundamental responsibility that is as \nold as this country. So the Governors don't buy into this.\n  The administration understands that this thing is a phony grab, a \ngreedy grab for profit, because that is what it is. It will mean that \nthe various cosmetic industries are not going to have to be altering or \nchanging their products because you are not going to have the research \nbeing done or the authority in the States to bring changes that would \nmake products safer. It is going to mean more profits. On the one hand, \nmore profits for the cosmetic industry and much greater health threats \nin terms of safety, in terms of potential birth defects for infants, \nfor various kinds of ingested products with a whole range of \nsensitivity to the body--eyes, mouth, ears, hair--and the problems of \nlips and the ingestion of various products that are dangerous.\n  (Mr. COVERDELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It just defies any logic. So, as we all know--we have \nbeen around here--hopefully even the newer Members understand this one, \nwhere you get something that is going through and can't make it on its \nown, and is added at the last or next-to-last markup with just a \nfraction of the discussion as we have had to date out here today during \nthis consideration, and it is locked in.\n  That cosmetic industry is just smiling. They are smiling now with the \nvotes that they had down there saying, ``Well, it seems we've got \nthrough this hurdle.'' I am just telling you, this is a long, long \nprocess. And they better get used to the fact there is going to be a \nlong process, because this issue is not going to go away. It is not \ngoing to go away today, and it is not going to go away when we talk \nabout this some more on Tuesday and get more information. It is not \ngoing to go away on Tuesday and not going to go away in terms of the \nconsideration of the legislation. It is not going to go away for a \nlong, long time.\n  Amazing about how a measure like this can slow something down over a \nlong time so that the American people can begin to understand what is \nreally at risk. I do not believe that they do. I wonder how many \nMembers of this body have read through the legislation and understood \nexactly what was included in terms of the cosmetic program.\n  So with this particular proposal in there, we are going to have to \nensure that we are going to have the kind of full awareness and \nunderstanding, not only by our colleagues here but the American people \nas well, as to what the health implications are.\n  This has important and significant health implications. We deal with \na variety of different proposals in terms of education--the HOPE \nscholarship, the tuition credit, the work-study programs--and we debate \nthose and discuss those and allocate resources to those, trying to \ndecide how much we are going to provide in terms of the Head Start \nProgram. Will it be 59,000 new children this year or 100,000? At the \nend of the day we may understand that our side does not win, others \nprevail on it, but we know that we have made the battle and made the \nfight, and the people that are going to be disadvantaged may be those \nchildren who are not going to get that benefit in terms of education. \nAnd that is a tragedy in terms of a mind developed.\n  But here we are talking about something else that is even much more \nimportant. You are talking about the vital health of the American \npeople and the safety of the American people. You are talking about the \ndangers to children and infants and about the birth of healthy \nchildren. You are talking about the dangers to children's eyes, and you \nare talking about the dangers to people who are trusting just what they \nsee on the shelves of American pharmacies across the country.\n  I would say that 9 out of 10 Americans who walk into any pharmacy \nthis afternoon and see a product on the shelf are saying, ``Well, this \nis just sort of like my medicine or just about like the other products \nthat I'm buying here. Somebody's looked at it, the Food and Drug \nAdministration or somebody's looked at it, and it is safe or it \nwouldn't be out there.'' That is baloney. It is true for prescription \ndrugs. And by and large it is true about over-the-counter drugs. True \nabout medical devices, by and large. You can flyspeck and find \ninstances, but that is true about those. We have the safest regulatory \nsystems in the world. But it is not true for those products that are on \nthose shelves that so many millions of people are using and have \nresulted in, in 1 year, 46,000 people going to the emergency room.\n  People do not go to the emergency room unless it is serious. I do not \nknow whether it is $300, $800 to go to an emergency room to get any \nkind of attention. People might go back to their doctors with good \nhealth insurance, go back to their dermatologists to ask them to do it, \nbut how many people are going to the emergency room? Someone with a \nlittle burn is not going to that emergency room. Particularly if you \nare working families and have children and you do not have health \ninsurance, you are not going to be going down. How many other people \ndid not go and still were adversely affected? But we say, ``Oh, no, no, \nno, we're not going to do anything about that.'' Whatever was being \ndone out there by the States--that is out now. You cannot go forward \nwith it.\n  So, Mr. President, the cosmetics industry wants the public to believe \nthere is no effective regulation that is necessary or desirable. They \nare masters of the slick ad and expensive public relations campaign. \nBut all the glamorous pictures in the world cannot obscure the facts. \nThis is an industry that is underregulated and its products are too \noften hazardous.\n  The severe reactions may be only the tip of the iceberg. Long-term \nillnesses, ranging from cancer to birth defects, may not be linked to \ntheir underlying cosmetic-related causes. As the GAO points out, \n``Available estimates of cosmetic-related injuries do not accurately \nreflect the extent to which consumers are exposed to toxic cosmetic \nproducts and ingredients. Because symptoms of chronic toxic effects may \nnot occur until months or years after exposure, injury estimates \ngenerally account for only acute toxic effects.''\n  The GAO is saying that with those 46,000 people that are going to the \nemergency room, that is only the tip of the iceberg. And Lord only \nknows, if you did not have State action in taking away the lead and the \nmercury and the other kinds of poisonous products that are cancer \nforming there would be even a much more dramatic number for it.\n  Here we have the GAO effectively saying that because the symptoms of\n\n[[Page S8866]]\n\nchronic toxic effects may not occur until months after exposure, injury \nestimates generally account for only acute toxic effects. We see that \nin 1987 we had 46,000 of what we know now was the exponential increase \nin the danger of all these products. We can imagine the dangers that \nexist out there today.\n  In light of this limited authority and even more limited resources to \nprotect the public, you would think Congress would want to encourage \nStates to fill the regulatory vacuum. You would think we would be out \nhere asking, what can we do to help, if anything, the States that are \ntrying to address protections for their consumers? What can we do with \nthe Centers for Disease Control to help Massachusetts, to help Georgia, \nhelp North or South Carolina? What are the resources that are out there \nto assist your State legislatures, Republican and Democrat, to provide \nprotection from some of these toxic or carcinogen problems?\n  But, oh, no, we are not out there asking that this afternoon. We are \nout there putting more roadblocks in front of the States in their \nattempt to do so. In fact, the language is so extreme the States have \nbeen barred, as I mentioned, from establishing ``any requirement \nrelating to public information or any other form of public \ncommunication relating to the safety and effectiveness of a drug or \ncosmetic.''\n  So, Mr. President, the last time the Senate looked at the issue of \ncosmetic regulation was in the late 1970's. We held extensive hearings, \nand we debated the issue, and we passed a comprehensive bill that \nincluded additional authorities for the FDA. Today, we are considering \na bill that resulted from no hearings, where there has been little \ndebate, no expert testimony in a product area that touches the American \npublic every day.\n  It should be made clear to anyone that cosmetics are as deserving of \nadequate regulation as they were 20 years ago. It defies logic that our \nsingle action in this important consumer product area is to preempt the \nStates from acting where there is wide agreement that FDA has neither \nthe authority nor the resources to adequately fill the field. An \nattorney, now with Procter & Gamble, wrote in a 1996 Food and Drug Law \nJournal article that although cosmetics are regulated by the Food and \nDrug Administration, ``the agency's regulation is extremely lenient.'' \nIf lenient regulation led to the chamber of horrors documented in the \nSenate hearings 20 years ago, it is difficult to imagine the impact of \npreempting the States from acting.\n  The proponents of the bill will tell you their language preempts \nState safety regulations only--remember we heard that during the course \nof the day--that their language preempts safety regulations only where \nthe Federal Government has acted. But the actual statutory language is \nvery broad and demonstrates a different intent. The industry admits \nthat the language is drafted specifically to undermine Federal judges \nthat have narrowly interpreted the Federal preemption.\n  For instance, if FDA sets a standard for lead in hair products, this \nbill would direct a conclusion that the lead level sets the standard \nfor other, unrelated products that might have different routes of \nexposure. So we know what the industry was doing. You can talk about \nthese issues in generalities, but you have to look at the specific \nlanguage here.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt the industry will argue that any \nlittle action on FDA's part will preempt State action. Yet we have no \nassurance the FDA is actually up to the task of filling the void left \nby the States. Again, we have had no hearings, no public record, no \nexpert testimony. In fact, the industry cannot cite one example of a \nburdensome State regulation that this law preempts. I hope that if that \nis not the case, that this record will be clarified. The industry \ncannot cite--you have not heard in this debate here this afternoon the \nindustry citing one example of a burdensome State regulation. Instead, \nthey suggest that the benefit of this law is prospective. They claim \nthey are concerned about what the States might do in the future. This \nis legislation for a problem that does not exist. But they see that \nthis was the chance to get on this particular train, and they are \nriding it.\n  The stark reality is that, according to the cosmetic industry itself, \nthe industry spends 70 percent of its lobbying dollars influencing \nState legislatures. I suppose we should really call this the FDA \nLobbying Relief Act. I find scarce comfort in the fact that this bill \nwill relieve cosmetic lobbyists from having to lobby 50 States, who can \nnow focus on Congress. Even worse, if this provision is enacted, the \ncosmetic lobbyists will spend their time getting FDA to act in some \nsmall way on a safety issue simply to create a broad scope of Federal \npreemption of the State in that area.\n  This is irresponsible deregulation, putting the proverbial cart \nbefore the horse. Let me emphasize that if we want to truly reform the \nFDA's regulation of cosmetics, we should start with ensuring they are \nprotecting the American public from unsafe cosmetic products. Once the \nAmerican people can be confident that FDA has the authority and the \nresources to protect them, that FDA is up to the task, then we can talk \nabout State preemption. That is the way we have always approached State \npreemption in the past, and that is the only way to approach it now.\n  The proponents of this provision claim that by permitting States to \npetition for exemptions, there is adequate protection for States \nrights. In reality, the high procedural hurdles in this provision, \nespecially the extreme, burdensome requirements of formal rulemaking, \nensures a lengthy process where industry will entangle States in years \nof hearings. Given the lack of Federal presence in the area of cosmetic \nregulation, it is unconscionable to make the States jump through hoops \nin order to continue to protect and warn their citizens.\n  They finally say, ``Well, OK, you can make some progress and deal \nwith this, but you're going to have to jump through all these hoops.'' \nHow many times have we been hearing on the floor about rules and \nregulations and the bureaucracy of Federal regulatory agencies, and \nhere we have those that support this proposal on cosmetics setting up \nhoops for any of the States to jump through--hoops and landmines--hoops \nfor the States to jump through in order to continue to protect and warn \ntheir citizens?\n  I assure my colleagues that this is only the first instance of where \nyou will witness efforts at sweeping preemption in the absence of \nsignificant Federal activity. We will be faced with a barrage of bills \nseeking to preempt State authority in the area of public health \nregulation. It is certainly ironic that this Congress is so determined \nto undermine States rights.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize again how this provision hinders \nStates from protecting their citizens at the end of the day. The \nlabeling and packaging of a cosmetic is preempted completely under this \nlanguage. States will be unable to communicate safety concerns in the \nmost effective and sensible manner--through labeling and packaging. \nEven if the States retain some vestige of authority over cosmetic \nsafety, this bill ties their hands and prevents them from giving the \npublic the information it needs to make informed choices. ``Right to \nknow'' under this provision means ``right to no information.''\n  What about the FDA? Today, the FDA has fewer than two people working \non labeling and packaging. In fact, most of the 30 people working in \nthe FDA Office of Cosmetics work on the regulation of color additives \nand not actually on cosmetics. The reason for this underwhelming \npresence is simple: FDA has put limited resources in the cosmetic \nprogram because they simply do not have adequate legal authority to \naddress cosmetic safety. If you can't enforce the law because there is \nno enforcement authority and because the standards are basically \nnonexistent, you are not going to squander valuable personnel where \nthere are drugs and medical devices to approve, and foods to keep safe.\n\n  For example, if the FDA suspects a cosmetic safety problem exists, as \nthey do with the use of alpha-hydroxy, acid face creams, the agency \nfaces high hurdles in bringing any kind of regulatory action. The FDA \nbears the burden of demonstrating by its own testing that the product \nis injurious to health. The FDA cannot make the company demonstrate \nthey are selling a safe product. That is important, Mr. President. The \nFDA cannot come in and say to the company, ``Show us the information \nfor the product you are testing to\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\ndemonstrate this is a safe product.'' No, they do not have that power \nor authority. The FDA cannot require the companies to come in, and the \nFDA, by its own testing has to demonstrate that the product is \ninjurious to health.\n  Today, the FDA knows how many milligrams of aspirin are in a tablet \nand they know how much sodium is in human or animal food and can \nrequire disclosure of this information to consumers, but the FDA does \nnot have to know how much alpha-hydroxy acid is in face cream. The \nagency cannot even require the cosmetic companies to disclose the \npresence of a known carcinogen like alpha-hydroxy acid to consumers. We \nneed to understand, Mr. President, that the agency cannot even require \nthe cosmetic companies to disclose the presence of a known carcinogen--\nthey cannot do it--like alpha-hydroxy, to consumers.\n  It is, frankly, no wonder that 70 percent of the cosmetic industry \nlobbying takes place in the States because that is where the action is. \nThat is where the standards are being set. That is where the standards \nare being set and enforced.\n  My colleagues do not have to take my word. We have a letter from the \nNational Governors' Association, Association of Food and Drug \nofficials, and the Association of State Legislatures, voicing strong \nopposition to this whole provision. We have a letter from the \nconservative Republican Attorney General of California, Dan Lundgren, \nstrongly opposing this provision, and speaking eloquently about the \nimportance of State laws on cosmetic safety.\n  In my own State we have a bill that would extend the same public \nhealth protections enjoyed by California under their right-to-know law, \nProposition 65. Proposition 65 is so successful and so popular with \nCalifornia voters that the committee has excluded it from preemption. \nNo one has refuted the positive impact Proposition 65 has had on the \npublic health. No one has. But instead of taking a law that is working \nso effectively to protect the public and encourage other States to \nemulate California today, we are debating whether to preempt every \nState but California.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed satisfaction with grandfathering \nProposition 65. They should delay their celebration. This bill \ngrandfathers Proposition 65 in its current form, which applies to \nreproductive toxins and carcinogens. But California cannot react to \nfuture scientific developments by warning its citizens against other \nhazardous substances.\n  I will include the whole letter and I ask unanimous consent the \ncomplete letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              State of California,\n\n\n                                        Department of Justice,\n\n                                   Los Angeles, CA, July 14, 1997.\n     Re S. 830, FDA Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997--\n         Potential Preemption of California Health and Safety \n         Laws.\n\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Hart \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: It has come to our attention that S. \n     830, the FDA Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997, is \n     moving rapidly through Congress. We understand that this \n     omnibus bill, which covers the entire gamut of FDA authority, \n     also contains language in section 761 on National Uniformity \n     for Non-prescription Drugs to the effect that no state may \n     establish or continue in effect any requirement ``that \n     relates to the regulation of a drug intended for human use \n     that is not subject to the requirements of section 503(b)(I) \n     or a cosmetic'' unless is it identical to the Act. While this \n     is only a small portion of a major piece of legislation, we \n     are concerned that this provision may be construed to preempt \n     states from imposing any requirements on cosmetics or over-\n     the-counter drugs, and could therefore prevent the State of \n     California from enforcing significant laws dealing with the \n     health and safety of its citizens in the absence of a \n     specific FDA exemption. California laws which could \n     potentially be affected by the FDA Modernization Act in its \n     current form include the Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law, \n     and the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 \n     (``Proposition 65'') as they apply to manufacturers of \n     cosmetics and over-the-counter drugs.\n       Regulation of health and safety matters has historically \n     been a matter of local concern and the federal government has \n     been reluctant to infringe on state sovereignty in these \n     traditional areas of police power. As noted by the Supreme \n     Court in United States v. Lopez, 154 U.S. 151, 131 L.Ed.2d \n     626, 633 (1995), ``a healthy balance of power between the \n     States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of \n     tyranny and abuse from either front.''\n       Thus, many federal statutes that preempt state regulation \n     in the traditional health and safety area do so narrowly, if \n     at all. For example, the Federal Insecticide Fungicide, and \n     Rodenticide Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act \n     preempt only labeling requirements and the Medical Device \n     Amendments to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act \n     preempts state requirements only if there is an existing, \n     very specific federal requirement in effect. In contrast, \n     the ``National Uniformity'' provision of S. 830 as \n     currently proposed, appears to generally preempt all state \n     requirements, not just labeling requirements, even when \n     there is no existing federal requirement in effect.\n       As noted above, S. 830 would, in the absence of specific \n     FDA exemption, appear to prevent the State of California from \n     enforcing both the Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law as \n     well as Proposition 65, a state ``Right to Know'' statute, \n     passed by the voters of California in 1986. Proposition 65 \n     requires that persons who expose others to certain levels of \n     carcinogens or reproductive toxins give a clear and \n     reasonable warning.\n       Proposition 65 has been used successfully to reduce toxic \n     contaminants in consumer products and has repeatedly been \n     instrumental in creating positive changes in products \n     regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The federal \n     government has at least twice in the past ten years followed \n     the lead of the State of California after the state entered \n     into various settlement agreements under Proposition 65 that \n     required lower levels of contaminants in various products. \n     For example, in 1990, after California filed suit under \n     Proposition 65 concerning lead leaching from ceramic dishes, \n     the Food and Drug Administration (``FDA'') adopted stricter \n     lead standards for dishware. In 1991, the state brought an \n     action concerning lead-foil wine bottle caps, resulting in \n     industry-wide agreement to convert to tin or plastic caps. A \n     year later, the FDA adopted a standard barring lead-foil \n     caps.\n       Most recently, this office entered into settlements, just \n     approved by the court, with the major manufacturers of \n     calcium supplements and antacids (a non-prescription drug), \n     both of which are taken in large quantities by pregnant women \n     and many of which contained lead at levels that caused \n     concern for the health of the fetus. The settlements require \n     the manufacturers to lower the lead levels in their products \n     substantially below previously mandated food and \n     pharmaceutical levels. The manufacturers intend to make these \n     changes on a nationwide basis. As has been the pattern in the \n     past, the calcium settlements have served as a model for \n     federal action, and the FDA is now considering changes to the \n     federal standards for lead in calcium supplements and \n     antacids.\n       While we appreciate the need for national uniformity of \n     regulation in certain areas, the provisions of Proposition 65 \n     have been in existence for over ten years and have repeatedly \n     been found not to be preempted by federal law.\\1\\ In June of \n     this year, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration approved Proposition 65 in the California \n     workplace, ruling that it did not impose an undue burden on \n     interstate commerce.

Lundgren,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n     Theodora Berger,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reading from the last paragraph:\n\n       Proposition 65, as well as the Sherman Food and Drug Law \n     are examples of the type of State regulation that protects \n     the health and safety of its citizens and that coexist \n     comfortably with Federal regulation. The States should be \n     permitted to continue in their historic role as guardians of \n     the welfare of their citizens. We therefore respectfully urge \n     you to seek modification of your bill to address this issue.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President, from the attorney general of California, \na conservative Republican, who understands as a person that has been \nworking and implementing this legislation why this proposal is rotten \nand why it ought to be adjusted.\n  Mr. President, a few years ago, the agency proposed establishing a \ncosmetics hotline to receive consumer complaints. The FDA hoped to fill \nin gaps\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\nbecause their voluntary cosmetics adverse event reporting systems had \ndismal compliance rates of well below 40 percent. The majority of all \ncosmetics health problems were going unreported, and here was an \ningenious solution. The reason the reporting systems were all voluntary \nis because the FDA does not have the authority to require companies to \ntell consumers what kind of problems consumers are having. Put Congress \nand some heavy lobbying together and you get a congressional \nprohibition forbidding FDA from establishing the hotline. So we were \ndenying the FDA from having a hotline.\n  When will it stop, Mr. President? We are preempting all of the \nStates, except California, from taking any steps to give the FDA any \nkind of additional authority. Then when there was the effort to just \nestablish a hotline so people could call in and register their \ncomplaints, the funding for that hotline was dropped. I wonder why? I \ncan tell you why. I gave you some examples of why, just a few moments \nago, with the consumer complaints to various agencies, including the \nFDA, with people writing in. No, we are not going to hear from the \npublic.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there was some reference earlier about \nmedical device legislation in Europe. We often hear about FDA's \nregulation of drugs as the international gold standard. I refer to our \ncountry's regulation of cosmetics as the fool's gold standard. Cosmetic \nregulation in other countries is far superior to our own. The European \nUnion requires full ingredient listing on packaging, documentary proof \nof good manufacturing practice, and similar proof that extensive \ntesting has been carried out on all products. Mexico recently adopted \nregulation mandating expiration dates on all cosmetics. Although New \nYork recently adopted just such a rule, it may live a short life--the \nbill before the Senate would preempt that regulation even if FDA does \nnot have its own regulation in place.\n  Let's continue on our world tour. Canada requires that manufacturers \nsubmit data showing that a product is safe under normal use conditions. \nSweden is initiating product registration for cosmetics and Denmark is \nconsidering a similar law. Malaysia requires mandatory registration of \ncosmetics. The list goes on, but the point is clear. We are not content \nto lag behind other countries in protecting our citizens. We prefer to \nbuck the trend and expose them to greater hazards. As experience has \nshown in other countries and in California with Proposition 65, the \nindustry can readily comply with meaningful safety standards when they \nare imposed.\n  Unlike food or drugs, cosmetics are not essential to our health. We \nuse them because their benefits are so clear. We need only mention this \nsummer's unprecedented beef recall to illustrate that our food supply \nis not perfectly safe. But cosmetics are a different matter. We are not \ncompelled to use them. For that reason, we should be far less willing \nto accept injury and death from such products.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier I reviewed for the Senate the \nactions that have been taken by the States which have resulted in \nadditional kinds of protections for safety for the American consumer in \nthose States, primarily in California. I reviewed some of the items \nthat posed the principal health hazards for citizens--the lead, the \nmercury, and other items and what has happened by the States when \nremoving those items.\n  Then I also mentioned, Mr. President, the limitations we have in \nterms of the Food and Drug Administration in taking any actions to \nprotect people and the power of the cosmetic industry in refusing to \neven have a hotline. We have hotlines in so many different and \nimportant areas for American people. We have them with regard to \nbattered women, as one of the principal sponsors for that. We are not \ncomparing that need with this one but there is enormous importance and \nenormous justification and that has been a powerful, powerful \ninstrument for battered women in our society.\n  We wanted to try and have at least a hotline for people that might be \nable to have been impacted adversely by these cosmetics. We mentioned \nalready that there are 46,000, at the last count, people going to \nemergency rooms--46,000. And we know the dangers which are out there in \nterms of impacting the American consumer and they have increased \ndramatically with the increase in products. It has been recognized by \nthe companies and the industry itself by the number of products and the \ncomplexity and the toxins that have been included.\n  So the only real opportunity that we have other than going to the \nStates and reviewing the kind of complaints that they have has been \nfrom the various agencies of government. I mentioned just a few moments \nago about these various items and I will go into greater detail with \nthe companies and what the allegations are and what the results are on \nMonday. I have them here but I will not take the additional time.\n  The fact is, these are the kind of results we are having, Mr. \nPresident. When California runs into those circumstances they can do \nsomething about it. When California found out about a particular \nproduct, the State was able to do something about it. Now, under this \nlegislation, on this preemption, 49 States will not be able to do \nsomething about it. California has been grandfathered in, but all of \nthe rest of us that come from other States will not be able to get that \nkind of a protection.\n  Now, I just mention the kind of injury complaints that have been \nincluded. They include, going through this code which we are gradually \ngoing through, injury code 14 includes rash, redness, swelling, \nblisters, sores, weeping, lumps, inflammation, sunburn, chemical burn \nand irritation; code 19, pain, to include itching, stinging, burning, \nsoreness, and tingling; injury code 20, tissue damage--other than \nthermal burn, peeling, splitting, cracking, hair, or nail breakage; \ncode 21, discoloration; code 22, infection; code 23, nervous system \nreactions, to include dizziness, headache, irritability, nervousness, \nnumbness; injury code 24, respiratory reaction, to include choking, \ncoughing, sneezing, shortness of breath, wheezing; code 25, digestive \nsystem reaction, upset stomach, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, \ndiarrhea; code 26, bleeding, code 27, urinary tract infections; code \n28, flammability resulting in thermal burns; code 29, blurred vision; \ncode 30, death as a result of inhalation or sniffing deaths, and code \n31.\n\n  These are serious, Mr. President. These are serious health hazards. \nBefore we in this body and the House of Representatives see a piece of \nlegislation tagged on to the important Food and Drug Administration, \nthe medical device and the pharmaceuticals which are so important, on \nwhich we have made so much progress, on which all of us are hopeful \nwill finally result in a bipartisan agreement, we see the greed of the \ncosmetic industry go right out there and tag on this amendment as one \nof the last amendments to preclude the States--they have gotten the \nGovernment effectively precluded, unlike the European countries. The \nEuropean Union, and most of the other industrial countries of the \nworld, have some protections. They have been able to preclude the \nFederal Government, and now they are precluding the States from \nprotecting the consumers and putting them at risk for all those kinds \nof illnesses and sicknesses that I have talked about here that are \nresulting from all of those products.\n  That is what we are being asked to embrace. That is what we are being \nasked to embrace. For those that understand the importance--the \nAttorney General of the State of California, who has been working on \nthis, makes it so clear: Don't do it, Senator. Don't do it, Senate of \nthe United States. Don't do it in the Congress and Senate. Mr. \nPresident, don't sign that legislation. He wants to be able to protect \nthe people in California, as other public health officials want to be \nable to protect their people in the other 49 States. That is the issue. \nThat is the issue.\n  We are going to come back to it again and again and again, Mr. \nPresident, because it is of such enormous importance to the health and \nsafety. The other side of the balance is the\n\n[[Page S8869]]\n\nquestion of greed by the cosmetics industry. Usually, when we are \nmaking tough decisions around here--and we have made them--we have \nlimited funding; for example, for the food programs for our elderly \npeople. We have to make a judgment, are we going to treat more people \nin congregate sites where you can feed more elderly people with limited \nresources, or are we going to carve out some and feed them at home, \nwhich means you will get to less people, you will get those people that \nare homebound. What do you do under those circumstances? You are \nplacing needy people of one side against needy people on the other.\n  No easy answers on this. Painful judgments and decisions on that. We \ndon't always get it right. We understand that. People of good will can \ndiffer on that and feel strongly about it, and we respect them here in \nthis body. But under this circumstance, we are talking about the \nprofits of the cosmetics industry and the risk to the American \nconsumer. That is what the balance is. That is what is unacceptable. \nThat is what is outrageous and that is why that cloture vote was \nnecessary, so we begin to wake up America as to what is happening to \nthese States. That is what we are going to have an opportunity to \ndebate as we go to this bill, plus the other measures.\n  Mr. President, the last unacceptable element of this bill is an \nassault on the basic environmental protections contained in the \nNational Environmental Protection Act, which is a key Federal \nenvironmental statute that regulates the Government's own actions \nthrough environmental impact statements. Under NEPA, Federal agencies \nmust undertake a comprehensive environmental planning process for every \nmajor action they take. This law is a crucial statutory assurance that \nthe work of the Government, the actions of regulated industries are \nconsistent with the guiding principles of environmental protection.\n  Section 602 of the bill broadly exempts FDA's activities from \nenvironmental impact assessment under NEPA. This is the first \npreemption of NEPA in a regulatory agency and is the beginning now of \ncutting back very, very important environmental issues. For what \nreason? Why are we, in our committee that is responsible in terms of \nthe education and the health and basic research, and the basic \noversight of laws dealing with labor and management, pensions, and some \nof the older Americans activities --why in the world are we going \naround here in terms of preempting NEPA from the FDA? Who do you think \nwas interested in that? Perhaps some of the industries who want to get \nout from under filing the environmental impact statement. If we are \nstarting off with this agency, we know exactly what is going to happen \nin each of the other agencies.\n  This week, I spoke with the Vice President who expressed his serious \npersonal concerns about this provision. Just a few sentences: This bill \nopens the door to weakening environmental protection, and lays a \nwelcome mat down for future exemptions and attacks on the effective and \nessential environmental statute. This is an act of environmental \nextremism, which should have no place in this or any other bill.\n  The reauthorization of the prescription drug and user fee is \ntremendously important to assure that the FDA will have the resources \nto review the new drugs. That is what we ought to be addressing.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 55 minutes \n28 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I thank the Chair. I want to prepare to yield back \nthe balance of my time this afternoon. As I understand, from a previous \nagreement, we will have time to continue this debate, I believe, on \nMonday next for a period of 4 hours, with the time evenly divided, \nstarting at 11 o'clock, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

She was a woman of enormous tenderness, \ngentleness, faith, and spirituality.\n  I had the chance to visit with her in Calcutta in the late 1970's and \nwas first exposed to her extraordinary work with the homeless and \ndestitute in that community. I saw how she was able to minister unto \nthe poorest of the poor in ways that were absolutely inspiring, in \nterms of her gentleness and in terms of her capacity for caring. Anyone \nwhose life she touched will never forget her. She was really a very, \nvery special person. This world is a better world because of her life. \nI know that all Americans will feel deeply about the loss of Mother \nTeresa. I just hope that we will all say a prayer for her.

With Mother Teresa's death, \nanother bright light has gone out in the world.\n  Someone once asked St. Francis what a person needed to do to please \nGod. He answered, ``Preach the Gospel every day. If necessary--use \nwords.'' Mother Teresa lived just that sort of life. She was a living \nreminder to all of us that faith is more than words. It is the good \ndeeds we do in this world.\n  She was a tiny woman, but she was an enormous inspiration. In the \nsame way we can best show our respect for Princess Diana by supporting \nthe ideals she believed in, the best way to honor Mother Teresa is to \nreach outside of ourselves and try to show a little more compassion in \nour own lives.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/05/senate-section/article/S8869-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8870]]\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend subpart 8 of part A of title IV of the \nHigher Education Act of 1965 to support the participation of low-income \nparents in postsecondary education through the provision of campus-\nbased child care; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           THE CHILD CARE ACCESS MEANS PARENTS IN SCHOOL ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nlegislation to provide new support to needy college students struggling \nto balance their efforts in college with their role as parents. The \nCAMPUS--Child Care Access Means Parents in School Act will support the \nparticipation of low-income parents in college by supporting campus-\nbased child care. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator \nSnowe and Senator Kennedy.\n  The stereotypical college student is no longer an 18-year-old high \nschool graduate. Increasingly, nontraditional students--older, with \nchildren and various job and life experiences--are filling the ranks of \ncollege classes. These students recognize the importance of college to \nfuture success.\n  But these students face new barriers unheard of in earlier times. \nMany are parents and must provide for their children while in school. \nCampus-based child care is a vital necessity for parents attending \ncollege. It is conveniently located, available during the right hours, \nand of high quality and lower cost. Unfortunately, it is unavailable at \nmany schools. Even where programs exist, they are often difficult to \naccess, particularly for low-income parents who struggle with the \ncosts.\n  In the wake of welfare reform, new pressures are also coming to bear \non low-income student parents. With the work requirements of the \nwelfare reform bill, it will become increasingly difficult for students \nwho are low-income parents to obtain Federal child care funds. States \nare likely to shift these funds to support welfare recipients returning \nto work, rather than to support low-income parents pursuing higher \neducation. This outcome is particularly perverse given the impact of \nobtaining a college education on family earnings over time. Studies are \nclear: public assistance recipients who attend college are \nsignificantly more likely to leave welfare permanently.\n\n[[Page S8871]]\n\n  This bill will offer new hope to these students. It will provide \nsupport to campus-based child care programs serving low-income parents. \nColleges can apply for these 3-year grants to assist the institution in \nsupporting or establishing a campus-based child care program serving \nthe needs of their low-income students. Funds will be targeted to \ninstitutions serving low-income students and programs focused on \nmeeting these needs.\n  Mr. President, this is a modest measure that will make a major \ndifference to students. I am hopeful that it can be considered and \nenacted as part of the Higher Education Act which we will consider \nlater this year. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move \nthis important measure forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CAMPUS-BASED CHILD CARE.\n\n       Subpart 8 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070f) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 420C.

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to introduce the Child Care Access \nMeans Parents in School Act [CAMPUS Act]. Senator Dodd and I have \nworked together to ensure access to quality child care, and this bill \nrepresents the next step in our shared commitment to this important \nissue. I am also pleased Senator Kennedy  has joined us as a cosponsor \nof this legislation, which provides grants to colleges in order to \nprovide child care for low-income students.\n  Mr. President, this is the time of year when countless American \nstudents return to college. At this time, we should remind ourselves \nthat many Americans face obstacles that prevent them from participating \nin higher education. The absence of affordable and accessible child \ncare is, unfortunately, one such obstacle.\n  For many parents with young children, the availability of oncampus\n\n[[Page S8872]]\n\nchild care services is central to their ability to attend college. \nCampus-based child care is conveniently located, available at the hours \nthat fit students' schedules and often available at a lower cost than \ncommunity-based child care centers. Student parents rate access to \ncampus-based child care as an important factor affecting their college \nenrollment. Unfortunately, such services are often in very short \nsupply, particularly for low-income parents who may find the cost of \nexisting services prohibitive.\n  Moreover, in order to meet the high demand for child care created by \nthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n1996, States may divert funds away from programs currently providing \ncampus-based child care services for low-income students and use the \nfunds to provide child care to welfare recipients, because educational \nactivities do not count as work under the act. This may leave students \nwith less access to child care services. If we want to fulfill the \ngoals of the welfare reform act and ensure that families are able to \nremain financially self-sufficient, we need to ensure that low-income \nparents have access to higher education and affordable and convenient \nchild care. This is crucial given that people who receive public \nassistance and then complete college are far more likely to leave \nwelfare permanently than those who do not.\n  There is no question that a person's earning potential increases \ndramatically with a college degree. According to the Census Bureau, in \n1990 the average income for high school graduates was almost $18,000. \nThose who had 1 to 3 years of college education, however, earned an \naverage of $24,000. And those who graduated from college received an \naverage salary of $31,000.\n  Higher education is crucial to getting a job in today's global job \nmarket. More than half of the new jobs that have been and will be \ncreated between 1995 and 2000 will require education beyond high \nschool. While nearly 40 percent of American jobs are currently in low-\nskill occupations, only 27 percent will fall in that category by the \nyear 2000. Over the same period, high-skill occupations will grow from \n24 to 41 percent of the work force. Getting the skills necessary to \nmeet these market demands simply requires higher and higher levels of \neducational achievement.\n  For many low-income students who are parents, the availability of \ncampus-based child care is key to their ability to receive a higher \neducation and thus achieve the American dream. Student parents are more \nlikely to remain in school, and to graduate sooner and at a higher rate \nif they have campus-based child care. Child care services are \nparticularly critical for older students who choose to go back to \nschool to get their degree or to improve their skills through advanced \neducation. This is especially important in today's economy where people \nneed to continuously train and retrain in order to meet the demands of \nhigh-technology jobs.\n  Children placed in campus-based child care also reap numerous \nbenefits, given its very high quality. In fact, children in high-\nquality child care exhibit higher earnings as adults, higher rates of \nsecondary school graduation, lower rates of teen pregnancy, and a \nreduced need for special education or costly social services. We also \nknow that quality child care is cost efficient--the public saves $7 for \nevery $1 invested in child care.\n  The bill we are introducing today will help bring the American dream \nwithin the reach of numerous American parents who need child care in \norder to attend college. The CAMPUS Act will amend title IV of the \nHigher Education Act to help provide campus-based child care to low-\nincome parents seeking a college degree. Under the bill, the Secretary \nof Education will award 3-year grants to institutions of higher \neducation to support or help establish a campus-based child care \nprogram serving the needs of low-income student parents. The Secretary \nwill award $60 million in grants--equal to 1 percent of total Pell \ngrant funding--based on an application submitted by the institution, \nand the grant amount will be linked to the institution's Pell grant \nfunding level.\n  Under the bill, Pell grant recipients will be eligible for child \ncare, to ensure that services target low-income students. In 1995-96, \nthere were approximately 3.6 million Pell grant recipients, and almost \n17,000 Maine residents received Pell grants.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The condition of our Nation's public pre-kindergarten \n     through grade 12 school facilities play an enormous role in \n     the educational development of our children as there is a \n     relationship between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. In addition to their educational value, \n     neighborhood public schools that are structurally safe and \n     sound, and well-supported by the community can act as \n     important civic and social institutions within our \n     communities.\n       (2) The financing of public pre-kindergarten through grade \n     12 school construction and renovation has historically been \n     primarily a local function. Typically, tax-exempt bond issues \n     must be approved through a referendum reliant on local \n     property taxes and are sold to finance capital spending. \n     However, recent national trends indicate a decrease in bond \n     referenda approval to pay for school construction projects. \n     The General Accounting Office reports that 33 percent of \n     school districts have had an average of 2 bond issues fail in \n     the past 10 years.\n\n[[Page S8873]]\n\n       (3) The United States is currently experiencing a 20-year \n     rise in public elementary and secondary school enrollments \n     which is projected to peak at over 54,000,000 students by \n     2006 from less than 40,000,000 in the mid-1980's.\n       (4) The General Accounting Office has reported the \n     following conditions regarding education facilities \n     construction in the United States:\n       (A) Approximately $112,000,000,000 is needed in order to \n     make necessary infrastructure repairs to our Nation's schools \n     and to comply with current Federal mandates.\n       (B) One-third of schools nationwide are in need of \n     extensive repair or replacement and 60 percent of schools \n     nationwide reported needing at least 1 major building feature \n     extensively repaired, overhauled, or replaced with most of \n     these schools requiring multiple features repaired.\n       (C) 60 percent of students in the United States attend \n     school in buildings with at least 1 unsatisfactory \n     environmental condition, with heating, ventilation, and air \n     conditioning systems being the most frequently reported \n     building feature in need of repair. It is estimated that \n     nearly $2,400,000,000 is required to comply with new \n     regulations on asbestos management.\n       (D) Often the schools with major renovation and \n     rehabilitation needs are least prepared for 21st century \n     technology learning and teaching needs, with over 14,000,000 \n     students attending approximately 40 percent of our schools \n     which report not being able to provide facilities to well \n     meet the functional requirements of laboratory science or \n     large-group instruction.\n       (5) As the result of the school enrollment increases, the \n     need to prepare postsecondary academic institutions for the \n     influx of these new students will be ever more important.\n\n     SEC. ____02. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL COMMISSION ON PUBLIC \n                   EDUCATION FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION AND \n                   REHABILITATION.\n\n       There is established a Commission to be known as the \n     ``National Commission on Public Education Facilities \n     Construction and Rehabilitation'' (in this title referred to \n     as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. ____03.

SEAN FOGARTY\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nsay farewell to an outstanding naval officer, Comdr. Sean Fogarty, who \nhas served with distinction for the past 24 years in naval service. It \nis a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements \nand to commend him for the superb service he has provided this \nlegislative body, the Navy, and our great Nation.\n  A native of Idaho Falls, ID, and a 1977 graduate of the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, Commander Fogarty comes from a patriotic family who has \ncontributed immeasurably to our Nation's defense. His father was a \ncareer submariner and also a U.S. Naval Academy graduate.\n  Commander Fogarty's service at sea includes a division officer tour \naboard U.S.S. Harold E. Holt FF-1074, department head tours as \nOperations Officer aboard U.S.S. John Young DD-973 and U.S.S. Callaghan \nDD-994, and an executive officer tour aboard U.S.S. Downes FF-070.\n  Commander Fogarty's duties ashore included scheduler for the \ncommander in chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, exercises and plans officer for \nthe commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet, and the Office of Legislative Affairs.\n  As Assistant Director of the Navy's Senate Liaison Office for the \nlast 5 years, Commander Fogarty has provided timely support and \naccurate information on Navy plans and programs. Working closely with \nthe U.S. Senate, he has helped maintain the best trained, best \nequipped, and best prepared Navy in the world. His consummate \nleadership, integrity, and tireless energy serve as an example for us \nall.\n  Mr. President, Sean Fogarty, his wife, Anita, and daughters, Larissa, \nColleen, and Megan have made many sacrifices during his 24-year naval \ncareer. They have made significant contributions to the outstanding \nnaval forces upon which our country relies so heavily. During his \nillustrious career, Commander Fogarty has been the recipient of many \nawards and commendations including the Legion of Merit.

HORSKY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Mr. Charles Horsky, former \nadviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson on the District of Columbia, \npassed away during the August recess. I rise today to pay honor to this \nman who devoted himself to improving our Nation's Capital.\n  Charlie Horsky was the ``Mayor of Washington.'' And yet, he looked \nforward to giving that up and getting home rule for the city of \nWashington. He accomplished a great deal toward that end. Mr. Horsky \nwas instrumental in redeveloping Pennsylvania Avenue, in promoting the \nconstruction of a metropolitan subway system, and he played a crucial \nrole in establishing the initial home rule for the citizens of \nWashington.\n  Further, he led the establishment of the National Building Museum, \nthe John F. Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts, the University of \nthe District of Columbia, and urged the preservation of Union Station.\n  I first arrived in Washington over three decades ago. Since those \ninitiatory days, I was most fortunate to have known and worked with \nCharlie Horsky. He was as fine a gentleman as we have seen in our \nCapital, and his tireless efforts are reflected in so many rejuvenated \naspects of the city around us. When thinking of this great man we do \nwell to recall the epitaph of Sir\n\n[[Page S8875]]\n\nChristopher Wren at St. Pauls Cathedral, London: ``Si monumentum \nrequiris, circumspice.'' (If you would see his monument, look around).\n  I ask that an obituary from the New York Times from August 24 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n       Charles A. Horsky, 87, Dies; Left Imprint on U.S. Capital\n\n                          (By Irvin Molotsky)\n\n       WASHINGTON--Charles A. Horsky, a lawyer and former \n     Government official who helped redevelop the nation's capital \n     during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died \n     Wednesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was \n     87 and lived in Silver Spring.\n       The cause was kidney failure, said his daughter, Margaret \n     Horsky Burns.\n       Mr. Horsky argued many cases and held many important \n     positions in a law career that began in 1934, but it was his \n     work as adviser to the President for national capital affairs \n     from 1962 to 1967 that had the greatest impact on those who \n     live in or visit Washington, an impact that will be felt for \n     years to come.\n       President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the White House \n     job and Lyndon B. Johnson carried him over when Johnson \n     succeeded to the Presidency in 1963. During Mr. Horsky's time \n     at the White House, he pressed for switching money from a \n     highway project to the construction of a subway system, and \n     the resulting Metro is now regarded as one of the best in the \n     world.\n       He worked on the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue, a \n     project that was begun after the 1961 inaugural parade and \n     Kennedy determined that America's Main Street had become \n     seedy and unworthy of a great nation. That project is just \n     being completed with the opening soon of the Ronald Reagan \n     Building.\n       Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who served in the Kennedy \n     Administration with Mr. Horsky, recalled that they were \n     reviewing plans for the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue \n     on Nov. 22, 1963, when they received the word that the \n     President had been shot. The plans were to be presented to \n     Kennedy for his approval the next day.\n       Another of Mr. Horsky's accomplishments is enduring a \n     melancholy chapter. For years, Washington was run as a \n     virtual fiefdom of Congress, with residents having no say in \n     its government. During the Johnson Administration, a push was \n     made to establish home rule for Washington and it was Mr. \n     Horsky who played the pivotal role in getting legislation for \n     it through Congress.\n       Mr. Moynihan, reached at his home in upstate New York, \n     said: ``Charlie Horsky was `Mayor of Washington.' He looked \n     forward to giving that up and getting home rule for the city \n     of Washington, and he accomplished a great deal toward that \n     end.''\n       In recent years, however, with the District of Columbia's \n     budget deficit ballooning out of control, Congress has taken \n     back much of that power and placed it in the hands of a \n     control board.\n       Mr. Horsky's other activities included establishing the \n     Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, rescuing Union \n     Station and opening both the National Building Museum and the \n     University of the District of Columbia.\n       He was born in Helena, Mont., graduated from the University \n     of Washington 1931 and received a law degree from Harvard \n     University in 1934. He served as a lawyer in the Solicitor \n     General's office until 1939, when he joined Covington & \n     Burling, one of Washington's leading law firms, staying there \n     for the rest of his career except for his White House years.\n       After World War II, Mr. Horsky served as an assistant \n     prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes trials and argued many \n     cases before the Supreme Court, including a case that \n     challenged the wartime internment of Americans of Japanese \n     ancestry.\n       ``I was trying to persuade the Court that there was no \n     legitimate basis for the Army to arrest citizens,'' Mr. \n     Horsky said in a 1989 interview with The Washington Post. ``I \n     couldn't get enough information to make it stick.''\n       Mr. Horsky lost his argument before the Supreme Court, but \n     in 1988, Congress approved and President Ronald Reagan signed \n     a bill that offered the nation's apologies to Japanese \n     Americans and provided payments to those who were interned.\n       A partner at the firm, David B. Isbell, said that Mr. \n     Horsky took senior counsel status, that is, a reduced work \n     load, in 1981 and that until he was slowed down by illness \n     two years ago, he had kept active in the firm by arbitrating \n     railroad disputes.\n       His wife of 58 years, Barbara Egleston Horsky, died two \n     years ago.\n       Besides his daughter, Ms. Burns, a resident of Falls \n     Church, Va., Mr. Horsky is survived by a sister, Flora Wertz \n     of Missoula, Mont., and two grandchildren.\n       Despite his advancing years, Mr. Horsky maintained a rugged \n     regimen. ``He never wore an overcoat, even on the coldest \n     day,'' Mr. Isbell said of his colleague. ``I don't think he \n     had one. It may have had something to do with his coming from \n     Montana.''\n       That Great Plains frame of mind prevailing as recently as \n     1989, when he drove around in the middle of winter in his \n     1962 Ford convertible, often with the top down. When asked in \n     the interview in The Post about his lack of an overcoat, he \n     said, ``I am sure I had one in college.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/05/senate-section/article/S8874-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MAYOR DONALD ARONSON\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe mayor of my hometown, Englewood, NJ. Mayor Donald Aronson's \ndedication to the Englewood community and the State of New Jersey make \nit an honor to be able to recognize him. After being elected mayor of \nEnglewood three times he has decided not to stand for reelection. As \nhis term comes to an end, I would like to convey my good wishes to a \nfriend and valued colleague.\n  Donald has made innumerable contributions to the residents of \nEnglewood and to the State of New Jersey as a whole through numerous \ncommunity service positions. He has served as commissioner and \nsecretary of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, president of the \nBergen County League of Municipalities, and he has sat on the board of \ntrustees for the American Red Cross. In addition, he has been a member \nof the Englewood Board of Adjustment, Englewood Chamber of Commerce, \nand Englewood Economic Development Corp. The list of his community \nactivities is endless. The extent of his service to State and local \norganizations is evidence of his lifelong commitment to public service.\n  Now, Donald is preparing for a new position as the president of the \nEnglewood Chamber of Commerce. I ask that you join me in recognizing \nMayor Donald Aronson for all of his hard work and his service to the \nState of New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/05/senate-section/article/S8875-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF ROBERT CHARLES CHAMBERS TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                   SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
