Mr. President, I have requested to speak in morning \nbusiness to talk about our President's policies, to talk about this \nadministration and the policies that impact all Americans.\n  As we know, the Senate has convened at a very interesting, unique, if \nnot sad, day in the history of this Nation's Presidency. I will not \ndwell on that. It would be very inappropriate for me to do so. What I \ndo want to talk about is an agenda that we have attempted to handle \nappropriately on the floor for the last several weeks; that is, to do \nthe business of this Congress and to do the business of Government, to \nmove the appropriations bills in an orderly fashion as our public and \nas the citizens of this Nation expect of us.\n  For the last 2 weeks, we have attempted to deal with an \nappropriations bill appropriating money to the Interior Department and \nto its ancillary agencies, to in large part administer policy and \nmanage the public land resources of this country. But anyone watching, \nand certainly the majority leader, who just left the floor, knows how \nfrustrating it has been in an attempt to responsibly move this \nlegislation, only to have our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nlargely oppose it. Oppose it because within the bill are corrective \nmeasures that reflect an attempt to adjust the misguided policies of \nthis administration as it deals with our public land resources.\n  We have made proposed changes. Why? Because the people of the public \nland West are saying, ``No longer does this administration reflect our \ninterests or our concerns or our economies.''\n  Why am I speaking uniquely to the West? The appropriations bill \nlargely deals with western public land and States' interests. But in my \nState of Idaho, where 63 percent of the land base is owned by and \nmanaged by the Federal Government, public land policy is critical, and \nmine is only a 63-percent ownership. In other States, like Nevada, it \nis much higher. So goes the Federal Government, so manages the land, so \ngoes the economy and the lifestyles and the character of those States.\n  I would like to spend the next few minutes discussing those policies \nand our concern about the attitude of this administration as it has \nimpacted our policies.\n  The provisions that I am talking about in the appropriations bill, if \nwe can ever get back to it, are necessary, in my view, and appropriate, \nbecause many of us feel this administration has gone around Congress, \nthe States and the local officials in an effort to place broad \nrestrictions on the use of public lands for productive economic use, \nsuch as mining and forest products and grazing and even recreation. \nRecreation, a relatively benign use of the public land, is now being \nshaped, directed and oftentimes characterized by new policies of this \nadministration. We believe strongly that the provisions that we have \nplaced in the Interior appropriations bill are necessary, as I \nmentioned earlier, to block the administration's arrogant abuse of \npower and its failure to acknowledge that our States ought to have a \nsay in the use of our natural resource bases.\n  During the past 175 years, the United States has undergone an \nastonishing period of physical and economic growth. We acquired the \nLouisiana territory, bought Alaska from the Russians, and fought a war \nwith Mexico over the Southwest and California. During that time, \nAmericans moved westward, pursuing dreams of economic independence and \nthe opportunity to raise their families in a new land.\n  Our Government encouraged the westward movement of these hardy people \nby creating opportunity through the Homestead Act or the Timber and \nStone Act or the mining law of 1872. These statutes, and others, were \ndesigned to encourage people to seek a new life, to build the wealth of \na nation by developing its vast store of natural resources. And the \neffort was successful beyond any nation or any people's wildest dreams \nand imaginations.\n\n  Thousands of American farmers and shopkeepers and clerks and grocers \nand professionals took up the challenge and moved West. They busted the \nsod of the central plains and established an agricultural wonder, the \nbreadbasket of the world, never known before by man. They established \nenormous cattle and livestock operations from Texas to Kansas and \nMontana and throughout the Rocky Mountain States, including my State of \nIdaho.\n  Thousands of prospectors fanned out across the West in search of \ngold, silver and other minerals. What these early miners found at \nSutter's Mill in California or at Telluride in Colorado or at Silver \nCity in Nevada or in the Boise Basin of Idaho, and hundreds of other \nboomtowns across the West, galvanized the Nation.\n  Thousands more ordinary Americans got caught up in the gold rush, \ntoo. Most were not successful in finding their bonanza. Instead, they \nformed the backbone of the new West because they brought other skills \nand talents with them. These are the people who built the great cities \nof Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise, Helena, Houston and San Francisco. \nThey became the merchants, the bankers, the doctors, and the educators \nwho helped ensure the success of the intermountain and the coastal \nwest.\n  These Americans built the great transcontinental railroad to bring \nadditional settlers into the growing cities and towns and to move the \nexploding basket of western-produced goods to the markets of the East.\n  Throughout the balance of the 19th century, as well as the 20th \ncentury, both Federal and private lands in the West contributed \nmightily to the economic success of our great Nation. In addition to \ngold and silver, deposits of lead, nickel, molybdenum, iron, and other \nminerals were discovered and developed.\n  In the 1920s and 1930s, oil and natural gas deposits were found in \nColorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah and New Mexico. And, of course, the \nforest products and the livestock industries continued to grow and to \nprosper providing building materials and food for our growing Nation.\n  These achievements were not realized by the U.S. Government but by \nthe women and the men who accepted the challenge who had the vision and \nwho had the courage. They took enormous risks. And with their lives and \nwith their fortunes they built new businesses, opened mines, started \nranches and farms, and began new lives and created a new culture, a \ntradition, a western culture tradition, based on wise and sustainable \nuse of the land and its resources.\n  Mr. President, I can talk about this firsthand. My own family is a \npart of that tradition of independence and determination. One hundred \nyears ago next year, my grandfather set foot in Idaho and took \nadvantage of the Homestead Act and began to build a ranching operation \nthat flourished and raised a family with that ranching operation to be \npassed on to a future generation.\n  The western tradition recognized the value of land and its resources \nand the need to husband those resources carefully and sustainably. No \none can honestly believe that we who live on and depend on these \nprecious lands would seek to strip them of all of their values and deny \ntheir use and their beauty to the rest of Americans. You see, my \ngranddad taught my father that tradition; and my father taught me that \nthe land was a sacred resource that should be managed wisely.\n\n  Indeed, with forest products, mining, oil and gas production, and \nother forms of resource-intensive multiple uses in place, recreational \nopportunities began to flourish, began to increase. More and more \nAmericans are coming to enjoy the natural beauty and the resources of \nthe intermountain West. They come to enjoy our hunting and our fishing, \nour sightseeing, our camping, our mountain climbing, and to just be \nplain quiet; in other words, to search for and find solitude.\n  These opportunities were once available only to those of us who lived \nin these great States of the West--the Idahos and the Wyomings and the \nMontanas and other Rocky Mountain and Pacific States--or to the wealthy \nwho could afford the time and expense associated with recreational \njourneys to our States.\n  Now our recreational-based economies have grown greatly and are \nsupplementing our traditional economies devoted to forest products \nharvest, mining and agriculture. In fact, last year about 8.1 million \nvisitors came to my State of Idaho alone. That\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\nis more than six times my State's population of 1.2 million.\n  Federal law acknowledges and encourages the diverse activities that \ntake place on the lands about which I have talked. It has formalized \nthe concept in a policy called multiple-use which was defined in the \nMultiple-Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960 to mean managing the natural \nresources in our public forests for the combination of uses that best \nmeet the needs of the American people. It has long been recognized that \nmultiple-use policy is in the best public interest because it enables \nthe resources to continue to produce benefits while conserving the \nvalue of that resource.\n  Mr. President, while all of this suggests the western public land \nStates are enjoying a life of beauty and economic success, I want to \nlet my colleagues and the rest of America know that we in the West are \nfacing a terrific threat. Unfortunately, that threat is our own Federal \nGovernment and the policies of this administration.\n  When the current administration took office, the Federal agencies \nresponsible for managing Federal lands began an all-out assault on the \nconcept of multiple-use in favor of preservation and limited use. They \nhave relentlessly pursued a philosophy of returning these lands to \nsomething they call ``presettlement conditions.''\n  They have shut out local governments from land use planning \ndecisions. They have reduced Federal land managers to messengers \ndelivering land use policy decisions from Washington, DC, down to the \nlocal level, as if Federal authorities here know best how to manage \nspecific tracts of Federal forest or other Federal land units.\n  This arrogant behavior is not occurring just in Idaho but it is \nrepresented and reflected across the public land States of the West. \nThe Forest Service is proposing to limit boating experiences on the \nSnake River in Idaho. The Service is trying to remove from use \nthousands of acres of grazing land in Arizona and New Mexico through a \nconcept and a contract with environmental groups, ignoring current \npermittees and State governments and the historic laws and policies \nformulated and passed by Congresses and by this Congress.\n  Also, having been denied the opportunity to shut down the mining \nindustry by Congress' refusal to accept punitive changes in the mining \nlaw of 1872, Secretary Babbitt has stopped new mining activities on \npublic lands by slowing the permit process to a crawl. And when he must \noperate within the context of the current law, he hops on a soapbox on \nWall Street and demagogues the very action that the laws require him to \ntake. As a result, no new jobs are being created and no new revenues \nare coming to either the States or the Federal Treasury.\n  Mr. President, some Federal use managers and national environmental \ngroups also have stymied local efforts to resolve disputes over how to \nmanage Federal lands. A group called the Quincy Library Group, \nencompassing forest product company employees and local authorities and \nenvironmentalists, developed a plan to protect roadless areas and old \ngrowth areas in the Plumas and Lassen National Forests in northern \nCalifornia while still allowing selective cutting on about 240 million \nboard feet of forest products.\n  The Forest Service dragged its feet, would have nothing to do with \nthe concept or the idea. It had to be changed here by the legislative \neffort. And let me tell you how popular it was. It passed the House by \na 429-1 vote. It is pending here in the Senate. The administration was \ndragged into it kicking and screaming because the public outcry for the \nsupport of this balanced policy was so great.\n\n  Mr. President, another example of the arrogance of this \nadministration's approach to land use policy is its decision to declare \nby proclamation a new unit in the protection category of Federal lands, \nthe Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. If you haven't heard \nabout this, you haven't been listening to the cries coming from the \nWest. The President unilaterally took 1.7 million acres of Federal and \nState land and included these acres in a new monument without \nconsulting any of Utah's elected officials--not one, not Senator \nBennett nor Senator Hatch nor Utah's three Members in the House, not \nUtah's Governor. In fact, no one--well, except a few local \nenvironmental groups--knew of the President's plan, the plan that we \nonly heard about when he stood on the banks of the Grand Canyon to \nproclaim it on the eve of his last election.\n  Now, as chairman of a Public Lands Subcommittee here in the Senate, I \nheld hearings on a Utah wilderness bill. The State of Utah had worked \nto incorporate all interests, from the grassroots to the very highest \nlevels of their Federal delegation, to try to preserve this area. They \nhad been working on the way that public policy should appropriately be \nformed. Yet the President, with the sweep of a pen and the denial of \nlocal input, decided that he alone would lock up this land.\n  At a hearing on May 1, 1997, on legislation introduced to make sure \nthat the President keeps his promise he made to Senator Bennett, Louise \nListon of Garfield County, UT, the local community elected commissioner \nsaid:\n\n       We feel that the creation of this monument was deliberately \n     fabricated behind closed doors without consulting or \n     notifying any member of the Utah congressional delegation, \n     the Governor, or any local official. I have no doubt that \n     history will single it out as the best or perhaps I would say \n     the worst example of the entire Clinton Presidency of \n     irresponsible and indefensible policy making in the natural \n     resource area. I certainly would hope that we do not see \n     anything worse in the next 4 years.\n\n  I could go on and on with examples, and there are many. However, \nseveral of our colleagues have now joined me. I know they have other \ntopics to visit that demonstrate the misguided positions of this \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, I turn to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Idaho for sharing this \ninformation with us. I have, of course, in the course of my tenure as \nSenator in the last 2 years, had some of the same experiences in \nAlabama with plans for managing Federal lands. I believe we can do a \nbetter job of it. I thank him for sharing that with us.\n  This morning, the President has appeared at the United Nations and \nspoken to that body. While he is there, I hope he will take the time to \ntake a second look at his proposal to build a new United States mission \noffice at the United Nations.\n  The Environmental and Public Works Committee, on which I serve and \nwhich deals with public buildings, had hearings last week and was asked \nto approve a resolution which would allow funding to be provided to \ndesign a new Federal building to house the U.S. mission to the United \nNations. The Clinton administration's proposal makes clear that \nfrugality and respect for the taxpayers' money is not a part of this \nplan.\n\n  The current building, which is just 40 years old, is located at 799 \nUnited Nations Plaza, just across the street from the U.N. building in \nNew York. The prospectus, the proposal, of the General Services \nAdministration, who had managed the building of the new structure, \nrequests our committee to approve a plan that would call for the \ndemolition of the existing building and the construction of a new \nbuilding which would be the most expensive office building per square \nfoot the U.S. Government has ever built.\n  I asked Ambassador Burleigh and the representative from GSA about \nthis. They did not dispute my assertion that this would be, in fact, \nthe most expensive office building in history. According to the General \nServices Administration, the U.N. mission building total project costs \nfor the 141,000-square-foot building would amount to $53 million, or \n$378 per square foot.\n  However, this estimate does not tell the whole story. The rest of the \nstory is that there is another part of the Federal Government that will \nbe contributing to this situation. The State Department is seeking an \nadditional $24 million to spend on security, telecommunications, and \nthe overall State Department oversight of this construction. These \nadditional costs will bring the total project costs for this United \nStates mission--which is really an office building--to the United \nNations to at least $77 million, or a whopping $548 per square foot.\n  To put $548 per square foot into perspective, consider that the \nIslip, NY, courthouse, complete with all kinds of\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\nsecurity features to keep judges and juries and defendants separate \nwithin its halls, came in with a total project cost of $262 per square \nfoot, and that was extraordinarily expensive.\n  The Foley Square Court House in New York City, accused by many to be \ngrossly overpriced and a waste of taxpayers' money, has a record \nproject cost of $440 per square foot.\n  Now, courthouses are somewhat expensive. They are and should be \naugust buildings. Courtrooms have to have high ceilings. You don't want \na big courtroom looking like a little office space. You do need to have \nsome marble, good paneling, big courtrooms. Every judge needs a \ncourtroom to try the case and do the people's business. So courthouses \nare not really good comparisons to an office building because they \nought to be more expensive. But this $548 exceeds any Federal \ncourthouse expenditures we have.\n  Now, they say, this is in Manhattan and real estate is expensive \nthere and that explains the cost of this building. But that is not so \nbecause we already own the land. This land was given to the United \nStates for the U.S.-U.N. mission office by the Rockefeller family many \nyears ago. So we have no real estate costs in this project.\n  The U.S. mission to the U.N. building would be 141,000 square feet; \nthe occupiable square footage, according to General Services \nAdministration and the Department of State, would be 107,000 square \nfeet for its 292 current employees. Now, that would amount to 366 \nsquare feet for each employee. My colleagues should note that in our \noffices here in the Russell, Hart, and Dirksen Buildings, we have a \nnumber of employees and we have a lot of visitors. Our occupiable \nsquare footage--and we have checked it for my staff and myself--is 131 \nsquare feet per employee. That is about one-third of what they are \nasking for in New York, and they are spending $548 per square foot.\n  Before we move ahead and authorize the construction of the most \nexpensive building ever constructed by the taxpayers that I am aware \nof, a mere office building, we need to be certain that this tremendous \nexpense is justified and that all other options--including maybe \nreleasing some space nearby for certain parts of the operation, if they \nneed more space or renovation, if that is the appropriate thing, they \nhave been examined closely and have proven not to be workable, and that \nthere is no other way to build this building for less cost. I can't \nimagine there would not be. Just because the staff at the United \nNations are involved in important issues does not mean they are masters \nof the universe and does not mean that they are entitled to palatial \naccordance.\n\n  Most of us in our personal lives have to deal with housing that is \nless than we desire. Our offices have to be less than we wish we could \nafford. Families and businesses all over America have to make tough \nchoices. Working Americans do it every day. They ask whether they \nshould buy a house with that one more bedroom so their children won't \nhave to share a bedroom. They worry about that kind of thing, and \nrightly they should. They are frugal, they work hard, and they have a \nhuge tax burden. Our people have to work until April, or later, every \nyear just to pay their taxes--before they even start making money for \ntheir own families.\n  I think we have a responsibility. I ran for office just 2 years ago \nand I traveled all over my State of Alabama and talked to people. They \nare willing to pay some money up here and send tax money up here, but \nthey want it used wisely. They want it to be used--if we have a \nsurplus--to strengthen Social Security and pay down our debt. They want \nus to give them some tax relief. They don't want us to be spending this \nkind of money on office space when we don't need to. I believe it is a \nvery important issue. And I see other buildings of that kind.\n  We have the Patent Office Building that is coming in and coming \nthrough our committee at an extraordinary cost in itself, and it is \nright here in Washington, DC. I think we are going to have to give a \nreal hard look at the Patent Building. A lot of people are concerned \nabout that.\n  People have raised a lot of concern about the $400 million cost \noverrun on the big Reagan Office Building here in Washington, DC. It is \na magnificent building, but it was expensive. I just had the numbers on \nit. It is right here, three blocks from the White House, which is some \nof the prime real estate in America. In this Reagan International Trade \nCenter Building, which will house nearly 7,000 Federal employees, the \nconcrete used in the building would pave 106 miles of a two-lane \nhighway. The atrium ceiling, with 1,240 pieces of glass, is 125 feet \nhigh. The basement is 7.7 acres. That building comes in at $264 per \nsquare foot, which is less than half of what they are talking about for \na little office building in New York City, and it would house 7,000 \nemployees.\n  So, Mr. President, these are matters that symbolize to the American \npeople whether or not we in this Congress are managing their money \nwisely. It is a solemn commitment, a deep commitment that I have, and I \nhope every Member of this body has, and the President ought to have--\nhow we are going to manage their money, and manage it wisely, is a \nresponsibility that is deep.\n  I wish that all Americans could have a nice home. I wish every \nAmerican could have a mansion. They won't have it in this life, but I \nwish it were possible. But we have to make compromises with reality. We \ndon't have enough money to do everything we would like to do.\n  Mr. President, I will just say this. The President is in New York \ntoday. I hope he has had an opportunity to review this proposal that is \nbeing sent forward. I believe our committee, which may be voting on it \nthis week, needs to give it a very hard look. I, for one, have not been \nconvinced at all by our hearing last week that this is justified. I \nintend to do all I can--and I think others will join--to make sure we \ndon't rush into this kind of boondoggle and take money from decent, \nhard-working Americans to fund a palace at the site of the United \nNations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to tell Senator Sessions how well he \nserves the taxpayers of our country and this Congress for bringing \nthese issues to the floor. We do not, at a time of fiscal austerity and \nattempting to balance the budget and stabilize Social Security and \nstrengthen it for the future and give some tax cuts, need to be \ncommitting ourselves to the building of palaces. I appreciate him \nbringing that issue to the floor, again, in the theme that there are \nother practices of this administration that deserve to be brought to \nthe forefront for the American people to understand.\n  Let me turn to the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my friend and \ncolleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, the chairman of the Senate \nRepublican Policy Committee, for arranging this opportunity to address \nsome of the key accomplishments of the 105th Congress.\n  In just a matter of weeks, we will close the curtain on a productive \nand arguably historic Congress. Certainly, our most significant \nachievement was passage of the first balanced budget plan in a \ngeneration. Few pundits took us seriously when the Republican Congress \ncame to power pledging to balance the budget by 2002. We were not only \nserious, but we're on the verge of success. A strong U.S. economy, \nspurred in part by a Congress committed to ending runaway deficit \nspending, has brought us to a balanced budget four years ahead of \nschedule. Now, for the first time, we're having debates on government \nsurpluses, not government deficits.\n  We've changed the debate on taxes as well. Last year, we passed the \nfirst real tax cut in 16 years. We provided a $500-per-child tax credit \nfor working families; inheritance tax relief; capital gains tax relief; \nflexible individual retirement accounts (IRAs) to encourage savings; \nand Alternative Minimum Tax relief for all businesses--large and small. \nAnd we're far from finished. We're on the verge of putting an end to \nthe marriage penalty, and giving small business owners and family \nfarmers the ability to fully deduct health insurance--something that is \nlong, long overdue. And I know the current occupant of the Chair has \nbeen very much involved with that throughout the years.\n\n  We've not only changed the Tax Code, we've also reformed the tax \ncollector. Our IRS reform bill will put a\n\n[[Page S10639]]\n\nstop to IRS abuses against law-abiding citizens, create an improved \nmanagement structure for the IRS, and establish new protections and \nrights for all taxpayers.\n  Ours has been an agenda designed to make a difference in the lives of \nordinary Americans. I'd like to talk about three achievements I have \nfocused on--issues that will improve and save lives, and further move \nour country forward.\n\n\n                              Job Training\n\n  Let me begin with our long-overdue--and far-reaching--reform of our \njob training system.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1995, I have devoted a great deal of my \ntime to job training reform. Last month, these efforts paid off when \nthe President signed our bill into law. I am convinced that its \nenactment came not a moment too soon.\n  Our economic future depends on a well-trained workforce. Employers at \nevery level are finding it increasingly difficult to locate and attract \nqualified employees for high-skilled, good-paying jobs--as well as \nqualified employees for entry-level positions.\n  Right outside Washington, DC, in northern Virginia, 19,000 high-tech \njobs remain unfilled because individuals lack the skills to fill them. \nHowever, even with this shortage here, I hear radio ads during my \nmorning drive urging people to move to North Carolina to fill high-tech \njobs there.\n  My home state of Ohio faces a similar challenge. Manpower \nIncorporated recently released a poll which indicated that the Dayton \narea had a bright future in terms of job growth: 42 percent of area \ncompanies plan on hiring more manufacturing workers. However, the \navailability of skilled workers to fill those jobs remains low.\n  And, according to the Manufacturers Alliance's Economic Report \npublished in January, the mismatch between available jobs and available \nskilled workers is growing. While wages have increased for those who \nhave the skills in demand, many jobs still go unfilled and the median \nduration of unemployment for those who lack the skills remains at \nrecession levels.\n  Nationwide, the number of unfilled high-tech jobs is estimated to be \n350,000. The increasing labor shortage threatens our Nation's economic \ngrowth and productivity.\n\n  Clearly, we need to do much more to prepare America's workers for \ntomorrow's jobs. The problem is our job training system is not simply \nup for the challenge. That is what our bill aims to address.\n  The current system is a fragmented and duplicative maze of narrowly \nfocused programs, administered by numerous Federal agencies that lack \ncoordination, lack a coherent strategy to provide training assistance, \nand lack the confidence of the two key consumers who use these \nservices--workers seeking training, and businesses seeking to hire \nthem.\n  That's why our reform bill is so important. It will fundamentally \nreform our ineffective job training programs, transforming them into a \ncoordinated, accountable, and flexible workforce investment system.\n  The historic 1996 welfare reform bill was based on the principle that \npower ought to be devolved to States, communities, and individuals. It \nshould go back to the local community. Our job training bill represents \nthe final, essential chapter of welfare reform, by empowering States \nand localities--giving them the tools and flexibility they need to \nimplement real reform, reform that will allow them to move people off \nwelfare and into good-paying permanent jobs.\n  The bill promotes free market competition, eliminates government \nbureaucracy and promotes personal responsibility. It provides training \nassistance through individual training accounts or vouchers, in order \nto allow individuals seeking assistance to have a say about where, how, \nand what training they will receive. These programs should be tailored \nto individual needs, not to Washington bureaucracies.\n  This legislation will help real workers and real businesses build \nAmerica's economy. One major Ohio newspaper called it ``a bill that \nworks.'' That's exactly right. The Congress can be very proud of this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                              saving kids\n\n  Let me now turn to a second piece of very important legislation this \nCongress can be proud of.\n  I might say this is a piece of legislation that my colleague from \nIdaho, Larry Craig, was so very instrumental in getting passed. I don't \nthink it is really a stretch at all to say that but for Larry Craig \nthis bill would not have been law--would not have been passed by this \nCongress, and would not have been signed by the President.\n  Let me tell the Members a little bit about it.\n  Last November, we passed a bill that will enable more of America's \nchildren to grow up in safe, stable, loving, and permanent homes.\n  Far too many children are spending their most important, formative \nyears in a legal limbo that denies them their chance to be adopted--\nthat denies them what all children should have--the chance to be loved \nand cared for by parents.\n  We are also sending too many children back to dangerous and abusive \nhomes. We send them back to the custody of people who have already \nabused and tortured them.\n  Every day in America, three children actually die of abuse and \nneglect at the hands of their parents or caretakers. That's over 1200 \nchildren every year. And almost half of these children are killed after \ntheir tragic circumstances have come to the attention of child welfare \nagencies.\n  Why is this happening? Obviously, many factors are to blame. There \nare many excuses. But as we were working on our bill, it became \nincreasingly clear that some of the tragedies in the child welfare \nsystem are the unintended consequences of a small part of a 1980 \nFederal law. Under this law, for a state to be eligible for federal \nmatching funds for foster care expenditures, the state must have a plan \nproviding that ``reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the \nplacement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need \nfor removal of the child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for \nthe child to return to his home.'' These are ``reasonable efforts.''\n  In other words, no matter what the particular circumstances of a \nhousehold may be--the state had to make reasonable efforts to keep it \ntogether, and to put it back together if it falls apart.\n  There is strong evidence to suggest that in practice, reasonable \nefforts have become extraordinary efforts. Efforts to keep families \ntogether at all costs.\n  Our bill changed the law in order to change this practice, to make it \nabsolutely clear that the best interests of the child come first. This \nnew law simply states: ``In determining reasonable efforts, the best \ninterests of the child, including the child's health and safety, shall \nbe of primary concern.''\n  With this new law, Congress put children first. This is a law that I \nbelieve will truly save young lives. It is a law that Congress should \nbe very proud of.\n\n\n                              War on Drugs\n\n  Finally, let me turn to the third item of which I think this Congress \ncan be very proud. I would like to talk about the progress Congress has \nmade in saving young lives from the often fatal scourge of illegal \ndrugs.\n  Last year, I joined with my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and \nmy Ohio House colleague, Congressman Rob Portman to introduce and pass \nthe Drug-Free Communities Act which supports community-based \ninitiatives to educate children about the dangers of drugs. Youth \nsubstance abuse has more than doubled in the past five years. We must \ndo more to protect our children from this threat to their health and \nsafety. We believe that this bill will strike a major blow for our \nchildren's interests by empowering the people who work with our \nchildren on a daily basis, at the grass roots, at the community level \nin our neighborhoods.\n  Drug prevention is an important element of any comprehensive \nchildren's health policy. And in the long run, treatment and education \nis our best investment in getting serious users off drugs. However, to \nbe successful now and over the long term, we need a balanced anti-drug \nstrategy. We must have a strong commitment in each of the following \nareas: prevention, treatment, education, domestic law enforcement, and \ninternational eradication and interdiction efforts.\n  Over the last few years, our efforts to keep drugs from coming into \nthe country have been lagging seriously behind the other components of \nour drug\n\n[[Page S10640]]\n\nstrategy. And the results of this imbalance--this lack of emphasis in \ninternational eradication and interdiction--has been devastating: A \ndecline in cocaine seizures, a decline in the price of cocaine, and an \nincrease in drug use. This alarming trend has to change, and requires \nleadership here in Washington. While drug education, treatment and \ndomestic law enforcement are efforts done at the federal, state, and \nlocal levels, the Federal government is solely responsible to keep \ndrugs from entering our country.\n  That is our responsibility solely, and it cannot be shared. And if we \nin Washington fail to do our job outside the country, we're making it \nfar more difficult and far more costly for state and local governments \nto do their part.\n\n  This past July, Congressmen McCollum and Hastert, and Senators \nCoverdell, Graham, Grassley, and I introduced the Western hemisphere \nDrug Elimination Act--legislation designed to restore a balanced drug \ncontrol strategy, and revive our sole responsibility to stop drugs from \nreaching our borders. This legislation calls for an additional $2.6 \nbillion investment in international counter-narcotic efforts over 3 \nyears. Specifically, the bill calls for a comprehensive eradication, \ninterdiction and crop substitution strategy. The objective is to \ndramatically reduce the flow of drugs into the United States by driving \nup the price of drugs and hence reducing drug consumption. I believe \nthat through this legislation, we can accomplish this very important \ngoal.\n  We have to make it far more difficult for drug lords to bring drugs \nto our nation, and make drugs far more costly to buy. We need to raise \nthe cost of doing business for drug traffickers.\n  Our bill would do this. It was passed by the House of Representatives \njust last week, and I have been working with my fellow cosponsors here \nin the Senate to increase funding for drug interdiction programs during \nthe current appropriations process.\n  This effort is one key example of how this Congress has made a huge \ndifference in the lives of America's children.\n  Mr. President, all of the measures I have just discussed have one \nthing in common: They are components of an overall vision of what our \ncountry can be--the kind of country our children deserve. I am very \nproud to have been a part of all these efforts, and I look forward to \nmaking further progress on these and other issues as we continue to \nmake a positive, lasting difference in the lives of all Americans in \nthe 106th Congress.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Idaho for arranging the time, and I \ncongratulate him for the role he has played in all three of these bills \nand these efforts. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for those \nkind remarks. If it had not been for his leadership in the key areas he \nmentioned, we would not be dealing with them in the way this Congress \nis now and should be. These are the kind of programs that directly \nimpact the lives of many of our citizens, and Congress should be \naggressively pursuing many of the projects and pieces of legislation \nthat the Senator from Ohio has discussed.\n  I now turn to Senator Grams from Minnesota who, I understand, wants \nto talk to us about tax cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10636-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10640-S10641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TAX CUTS AND THE GOOD GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk a little bit about tax \nrelief and the obligation I feel this Congress has to the American \npeople in the remaining days of this session.\n  I also compliment the Senator from Alabama, who now occupies the \nChair, for talking about the need to be better stewards of the tax \nmoney we do collect from Americans today.\n  Instead of beginning with the American experience, I will start \noverseas for just a moment, and that is in Japan.\n  After years of rapid economic growth, which many called an ``economic \nmiracle,'' Japan's economy is now stagnating. To a large degree, the \nsickening Japanese economy has dragged the world economy down with it.\n  The U.S. government has been pushing Japan to pursue vigorous reforms \nto boost the economy again. One of the recommended measures is tax \nrelief. President Clinton and Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, \nhave repeatedly asked Japan to permanently reduce its income tax. As a \nresult, the Japanese government proposed a tax cut of 7 trillion yen, \nbut it is now suggested that this tax relief is too small and that \ndeeper cuts are needed. I think this is a sound policy and the right \napproach to helping cure Japan's ills and I commend the administration \nfor such advice. I just wish they would have that same advice for \nCongress. The question is, if tax relief will work for Japan as it has \nworked for many other countries, including our own during the Reagan \nadministration, why do we not we pursue that same policy here in this \ncountry once again?\n  Mr. President, what these two events tell us is, first, the Federal \ntax burden has grown too high, too ridiculous. And second, the best \nsolution to maintaining economic growth in this country is tax relief.\n  We have debated this issue in this Chamber again and again and the \nconclusion is clear to me: a high tax burden distorts economic \nbehaviors. It discourages work, saving, and investment. It slows \nproductivity and growth and decreases our competitiveness. Tax relief, \non the other hand, does just the opposite. It will benefit millions of \nAmerican families and will keep our economy healthy and strong.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that it is still critical to provide \nmeaningful tax relief for the American people this year. The average \nAmerican family today spends more on taxes than it does on food, \nclothing, and housing combined. A typical median-income family can \nexpect to pay nearly 40 percent of its income in Federal, State, and \nlocal taxes. This means more than 3 hours of every 8-hour working day \nare dedicated just to paying taxes. In 1996, an average household with \nan annual income between $22,500 and $30,000 paid an average of $9,073 \nfor food, clothing, and housing, and paid $11,311 in total taxes. \nHouseholds with incomes ranging from $45,000 to $60,000 averaged \n$16,043 for basic necessities, and paid the tax collector $25,276.\n  If the ``hidden taxes'' that result from the high cost of government \nregulations are factored in, a family today gives up more than 50 \npercent of its annual income to the Government.\n  When the Government takes more, families get less. Between 1989 and \n1995, the typical American family's real income fell by 5.2 percent. \nMost economists point out that the decreased income was the result of \nslow economic growth, a direct result of higher Federal taxes.\n  The American taxpayers desperately demand real tax relief and reform. \nThey ushered in a new congressional majority in 1994 on our pledge that \nwe would provide that relief. While we have delivered on a portion of \nour promises, much work remains to be done. Reforming the tax system \nfor the taxpayers who sent us here begins with cutting their taxes. Our \nmission has not yet been completed.\n  We should not walk away from our obligation to the American taxpayers \nto pursue a Federal Government that serves with accountability and \nleaves working families a little more of their own money at the end of \nthe day. We must pass meaningful tax relief this year.\n  In the next 5 years, for example, the Federal Government will take in \nmore than $9.4 trillion from the pockets of the American people. The \nCongressional Budget Office has projected that in the next 10 years, we \nwill have a $1.6 trillion budget surplus. Even after excluding the \nSocial Security surplus, we will still have a surplus of $169 billion. \nThe Government has no claim on any surplus because the Government did \nnot generate it--it will be the result of the hard work of the American \npeople, and it therefore should be returned to them in the form of tax \nrelief.\n  I agree that reforming the Social Security and Medicare programs to \nensure their solvency is vitally important. Any projected budget \nsurplus should be used partly for that purpose. Yet, I believe strongly \nthat the surplus alone will not save Social Security and, therefore, \nfundamental reform is needed to change it from a pay-as-you-go system \nto a fully funded one.\n  What truly bothers me, Mr. President, is Washington's continuation of\n\n[[Page S10641]]\n\nits tax-and-spending policies. Despite a shrinking Federal deficit, the \nGovernment is getting bigger, not smaller. Total taxation is at an all-\ntime high. So is total Government spending.\n  The White House and my colleagues have been talking about fencing off \nthe budget surplus to save Social Security, but even as they talk, they \ncontinue to spend this budget surplus. Before the surplus even \nmaterialized, Washington had already spent $6 billion of it in the last \nsupplemental bill. It is reported that another proposed supplemental \nbill will spend another $18 to $20 billion of this budget surplus.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to Federal spending, Washington rarely \nasks how the American taxpayers can afford to give up more of their \nincome to Government, and how such excessive spending will affect a \nworking family's budget and finances. Equally upsetting is the fact \nthat when it comes to tax relief, Washington is always reluctant to \nact. Congress even goes so far as to require the tax cut advocates to \npay for any tax relief via Washington's PAYGO rule that requires \nincreasing taxes in order to cut taxes. Increase taxes on some \nAmericans so we can get tax relief to others, but that is the only way \nthat the system can work. Nothing is more ridiculous than this \nrequirement of the PAYGO rule. We must repeal it so we can shrink the \nsize of the Government and we can let working families keep more of the \nmoney they earn, to spend on their priorities--not Washington \npriorities.\n  Washington's tax-and-spend policies have systematically ignored our \nchildren's future and severely undermined the basic functions of the \nfamily. We must abandon those policies and help restore the family to \nan economic position capable of fulfilling its vital responsibilities. \nTherefore, we must provide American families with meaningful tax \nrelief, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  I commend our colleague in the House, Chairman Archer, Chairman of \nthe Ways and Means Committee, for his so-called ``90-10'' plan. The \nproposed plan includes many good tax relief measures that will help \nworking Americans. I think this is a step in the right direction.\n  However, there are two things in the proposal that concern me.\n  First, the proposed $80 billion in tax relief over 5 years is just \ntoo small, compared with the possible budget surplus and total \ngovernment spending.\n  By the way, an $80 billion surplus, or $80 billion in tax relief, \nover the next 5 years amounts to about $4 per person per month. That is \nnot real tax relief, that is token tax relief. We need to do more.\n  It leaves only $30 billion for relief of the $150 billion marriage \npenalty tax, and this means millions of American couples will continue \nsuffering from this tax injustice. We can and should do better.\n  Second, I do not have any problem at all returning some of the budget \nsurplus to the taxpayers. In fact, I have argued repeatedly that the \nbudget surplus should be returned to the taxpayers in the form of tax \nrelief, Social Security reform and debt reduction. But what bothers me \nis that the proposed plan does nothing to reduce Government spending. \nIn fact, we are talking about spending billions of dollars of the \nsurplus in a supplemental spending bill this year. I believe we should \ncut the Government's wasteful programs and overhead, and let the \ntaxpayers benefit from a more efficient, effective Government.\n  In the next few weeks, I will work with my colleagues to improve the \nHouse tax bill and deliver tax relief at the highest possible levels to \nAmerica's families.\n  My final point is that we must pass a contingency plan to avoid a \nfuture government shutdown, and we must do it this year.\n  I have asked both the Senate majority and minority leaders several \ntimes to honor the commitment they made during the consideration of \nlast year's disaster relief legislation to support an automatic CR to \navoid a Government shutdown. But so far there is little interest in \nthis good Government legislation. We need to pass that.\n  And here we are again, with just a few weeks left in this session, \nwith only one appropriations bill signed into law. Clearly, we will not \nhave a budget conference report this year, and I sincerely doubt we \nwill complete all the appropriations bills before this fiscal year \nends.\n  So tell me--do you not think we need a contingency plan, something to \navoid the end-of-session battles that often result in more government \nspending?\n  Different priorities on spending and tax cuts often prevent us from \ncompleting all of the appropriations bills. Competing policy \ndifferences, particularly during an election year, make our budget and \nappropriations process more uncertain.\n  We need a contingency plan to avoid a government shutdown. There are \nessential functions and services of the federal government we must \ncontinue regardless of our differences in budget priorities.\n  Mr. President, I will wrap this up quickly. I know our time is \nrunning out. But let us not hold the American people hostage because of \ndisagreement in Washington. I urge the leadership to support a sizable \ntax cut this year and take up the good Government legislation that \nwould prevent a shutdown.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from \nIdaho for securing this time for us to be able to talk this morning.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nside be allowed to continue until 1:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. With that, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for that \nexcellent speech. In my opinion, he is right on about the effective use \nof a surplus to grant tax relief and to shore up the Social Security \nsystem to reform it. Clearly, we have to hold down on the issue of \nsupplemental spending.\n  With that, I now yield to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Allard, \nto wrap up this special order with his observations as to welfare \nreform--truly one of the great successes of our Republican Congress.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Idaho for yielding to me to make \na few comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10640-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10641-S10643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise with good news about \nAmericans on welfare. It is clear that the hard labor we put forth \nduring the 104th Congress to enact welfare reform has been paying off \nwith big returns. The system so many had grown to use as a crutch and a \nburden to self-sufficiency for 62 years was finally removed in July of \n1997.\n  States are now showing that Americans can achieve financial \nindependence when given the right tools. I thought it would be of \nbenefit for the Members of the Senate to hear a review about Colorado's \nexperience with changing the welfare program.\n  In 1982, I was elected to the State Senate of Colorado and found that \none of the first issues I was involved in was the idea that we needed \nto change welfare. I was approached by one of the counties I \nrepresented at the time that had a very frustrating problem. They saw \ntheir budget escalating out of control, and there was not anything they \ncould do about it.\n  So they said to the Colorado legislature at the time, and they said \nto me also, ``Look, if you will give us some local control, we have \nsome ideas on how we can change the welfare system to make it better \nand save the taxpayer dollars and actually get people to work and be \nself-sufficient.''\n  They had two phases that they wanted to go through. First of all, \nthey wanted to go through a reorganization of their county government. \nThey wanted to consolidate those agencies that dealt with employment \nand welfare. And they wanted to put these agencies together and under \nthe guidance of one individual. They happened to select Walt Speckman \nat the time who was in charge of finding jobs for people in Weld \nCounty. This was the county that had come to me and was trying to do \nsomething about reforming their welfare system.\n  They were putting him in charge because he was used to looking for \njobs instead of putting people in a position where they were becoming \nput in a position to rely on government. This individual was used to \ngetting them off of government and getting them into a self-sufficient \nprogram. And having been prepared to do that type of reorganization, \nthey had to come to the State legislature to get some legislation \npassed. And I was involved in that.\n\n[[Page S10642]]\n\n  Another part of that process was that they had to go to the Federal \nGovernment and they had to get a waiver in order to be able to waive \nsome Federal laws and regulations that were being applied to the State \nof Colorado as well as the county.\n  As a result of that legislation--which we passed in a Republican \nlegislature, by the way, from both the House and the Senate, and which \nwas reluctantly signed by a Democratic Governor of the State of \nColorado--we began to put the program in place. And as it moved along, \nwe found that it was beginning to move people off of welfare into the \nworkplace. It was working in this county at a time when there was a \nlarge amount of unemployment because one of the major employers in Weld \nCounty at that time had found it necessary--they were in a labor \ndispute, so they found it necessary to close their large plant.\n  We also recognized in this program that we needed to provide some \nday-care services for many of the women who were on welfare. Most of \nthe people in Colorado who were on welfare were young women who had \nchildren. We had to provide educational opportunities for them as well.\n  This experience in Colorado gave us an example, those of us who were \nserving in the Congress at that time. After I left the Senate in the \nState of Colorado, then in 1990 I got elected to the House of \nRepresentatives, and it gave me a good example to point to my \ncolleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives about how welfare \nreform could work if managed properly. And my colleague at that time \nwas Senator Hank Brown from Colorado, who was from Weld County and also \nworked hard on welfare reform as a Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and in the U.S. Senate.\n  When I had the opportunity, as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, to work on welfare reform, I was thrilled because I \ncould see what could happen if you would just turn the responsibility \nover to the States. If that State, in turn, would turn the \nresponsibility over to the county, miracles could happen. And that is \nexactly the type of thing that I proposed in the 1994 election when the \nRepublicans were putting forward the Contract With America.\n  I had a good deal to do with putting in a lot of the provisions that \nwere in the Contract With America on welfare reform because I could \npoint to the experience in Weld County and the experience of Colorado \nand the tremendous success that happened out of that program. So I was \nabsolutely delighted to see that the Republican Congress was beginning \nto adopt that idea.\n  Finally, as I mentioned in my opening comments, in 1997 it was a \nRepublican Congress, with a Republican Senate and Republican House, \nthat finally had a reluctant President who was willing to sign some \nlegislation on welfare reform. And it is working.\n  The Johnson era and the decades following this taught us that the \navailability of Government welfare only feeds poverty, digging a deeper \nhole for those who grow to depend on it. By returning power to the \nStates and giving them the flexibility to design and administer welfare \nprograms tailored to the needs of their citizens, Americans are seeing \nthe fruits of liberating the public from welfare dependence.\n  Some skeptics would say our strong economy and low unemployment are \nresponsible for the decline in welfare cases, but they forget that the \nflourishing economy of the 1980s barely put a dent in the welfare \nrolls. It is clear that our new laws are working.\n  From January 1993 to March 1998, the number of welfare recipients in \nthe Nation declined by 5.2 million, or 37 percent, from 14.1 million \nindividuals in 1993 to 8.9 million in 1998.\n  Since welfare reform was enacted in August of 1996, the number of \nrecipients has declined by 3.3 million individuals, which is 27 \npercent, while the number of families on welfare has declined by 1.2 \nmillion, also 27 percent, since welfare reform was enacted.\n  I am proud to say that Colorado continues to be one of the front \nrunners in the progress of welfare reform. Colorado is the only State \nwhich has block-granted all welfare funds directly to the counties.\n  Since 1995, Colorado's caseload has declined by nearly 50 percent.\n  I have a number of other examples that I will point out to my \ncolleagues in the Senate on the success of the Colorado program.\n  Each county in my state has been experimenting with various programs \nwhich comply with the Colorado state law. Our law requires that an \n``individual responsibility contract'' be signed by each of the 32,000 \nwelfare recipients in Colorado. The contract describes each recipients \nprogram for obtaining a job. What makes Colorado's program work is the \nlocal flexibility and control handed to counties to carry out the new \nlaws.\n  In addition, counties have used their leverage power through their \ncontracting and procurement activities to help create more jobs in the \nprivate sector.\n  Counties in Colorado tell me they had to re-think their purpose in \ndistributing welfare. Now, they see their role defined more by \nencouraging recipients to make a commitment to immediate work and \nimposing a shorter time limit for cutting off those who don't cooperate \nwith this commitment. They are accomplishing this by reeducating \nrecipients, creating new incentives to get off welfare, and contracting \nout job training.\n  Since implementation of ``Colorado Works,'' our new version of the \nformer Federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, welfare \ncases dropped 28 percent in just one year.\n  Several counties in Colorado have shown remarkable progress:\n  El Paso County has renamed its welfare office the ``Family \nIndependence Center'' and has moved into the same building that houses \nGoodwill Industries. They have developed a philosophy of empowerment of \nparticipants to care for their own families and seek employment as soon \nas possible, not as a last step in the self-sufficiency process.\n  Boulder County has taken new strides in implementing reform. In July \nof 1997, they had 715 cases. At the end of June 1998, the caseload was \n562. 257 people were placed in jobs. The average wage of the former \nrecipients was $7.82 an hour.\n  Three of those former welfare recipients have found permanent jobs \nwith Boulder County's own employment and training center.\n  Mesa County has gone even further with a reduction of 40 percent in \ntheir welfare rolls. They tell me it's working because the county \ncommissioners and social services staff have remained committed to \ngetting people off welfare and into jobs. Plus, businesses and human \nservices agencies in the county have pitched in to help find jobs for \nformer welfare recipients. In several Colorado counties, the leading \ncivic organization in welfare-reform efforts is the Chamber of \nCommerce. Communities are pulling together resources to help new \nreforms become a success.\n  Colorado welfare cases have continued to drop since June of this year \nto an all-time low of 17,990 cases in the month of August. That is \n10,000 fewer welfare cases than we had in 1983--15 years ago. But on \ntop of that, this phenomenon has been taking place while population in \nColorado has been increasing. According to the Census Bureau, our \npopulation has increased 13 percent from 1990 to 1995. Although \ncaseload reduction is not the only measure for success in this area, \nthe fact that we have reduced our welfare reform by more than 50 \npercent in just the last five years is worth talking about.\n  Caseworkers in my state applaud this work-first model. They stress \nthat there has been a large increase in child care utilization and \nexpenditures--yet another sign that Colorado residents are being put to \nwork.\n  Since July, 1997, statewide child care expenditures have increased \nfrom $3 million to $6 million per month. Also, the number of families \nreceiving child care assistance increased from 8,200 to 12,600 per \nmonth during the same period.\n  But I think more than anything else, we should acknowledge that there \nis a clear-cut change in society's opinion about behavior we once just \naccepted. It's no longer acceptable for large chunks of our tax dollars \nto serve as a permanent wage to those who choose to lean on welfare.\n  People are not helpless, as the welfare state has told them. In fact, \npredictions that we would see a massive increase in the homeless \npopulation have not come true.\n  Instead, we see now that for years, our laws underestimated the \nabilities\n\n[[Page S10643]]\n\nof welfare recipients to work and care for their own families by \nearning their own money.\n  Mr. President, changing the work ethic of the welfare community is \nnot a simple process, but the results so far are impressive. The state \nand local governments are proving that they can accomplish this goal \nwhen we give them the latitude to do so. I'm proud to have been a part \nof this historical policy change.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for the \nexamples he brings and the issue about which he speaks. There is no \nquestion that we are finding here the ideas that percolate from local \nand State governments which are really the laboratories of change that \nwe have been able to bring and incorporate into public policy at this \nlevel, and welfare reform is the prime example. I am pleased that \nSenator Allard would speak to that this morning.\n  I recognize his leadership in that area.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, as I make this statement today, it is \ndoubtful that many in the press or the public are paying attention to \nthe proceedings of the Senate. While many are watching every nuance and \nlistening to every syllable of the President's videotaped testimony \nbefore the still-sitting grand jury, I want to talk about what I \nbelieve is a more important issue--the basic fairness of the process of \nwhich the videotape is a part.\n  Since we Senators may be called on to consider various allegations in \njudging articles of impeachment, I will not speak here about the \nsubstance of what is alleged, or about whether the allegations \nconstitute adequate grounds for impeachment.\n  But I believe each of us has an immediate obligation to concern \nourselves with the process that is being followed. My purpose today is \nto call for fairness in that process; fairness in the procedures \nCongress follows as it prepares to consider these allegations; fairness \nin the treatment afforded the President. Regardless of what disposition \nis finally made of the allegations leveled against the President by the \nIndependent Counsel, it is in the interests of everyone--especially \nfuture Presidents--that basic fairness be maintained. And to my mind it \nis impossible to conclude that the process to date has been fair.\n  What ``unfairness'' am I talking about? Frankly, the lack of basic \nfairness in these proceedings has been so pervasive that it is hard to \nknow where to begin. But here are three significant ways in which the \nprocess has lacked basic fairness.\n  The first is that the accused has been denied the secrecy of grand \njury testimony. Second, the Independent Counsel's report was issued as \na sensational narrative, not as a legal document. And third is the rush \nby both the Independent Counsel and the House to publish and publicize \nall the material unfavorable to the President before the House has \nreviewed it and before any determination that impeachment proceedings \nare warranted.\n  First, the actions of the independent counsel have had the effect, \nand possibly the purpose, of denying this accused, the President, the \nbasic right to secrecy concerning testimony given to a grand jury.\n  While the grand jury was considering the matter, the pattern of \nleaking information about testimony was clear for all to see. Once the \ntestimony was concluded, the Independent Counsel sought and gained \nauthority to deliver to the House of Representatives his report and all \nmaterials he chose, regardless of their relevance to particular \ncharges. I firmly believe the Independent Counsel did this with the \nexpectation that the Republican leadership of the Congress would \nquickly make public any and all material in its possession that \nportrayed the President unfavorably.\n  Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires \nprosecutors to keep secret the testimony given before grand juries. And \nwith this grand jury, the Independent Counsel assured the President and \nall witnesses that the testimony they gave was subject to the secrecy \nrequirements under the rule.\n  The secrecy requirement recognizes the fact that grand jury \nproceedings are anything but fair and balanced legal proceedings. \nWitnesses before a grand jury are not entitled to legal counsel who can \nobject when the rights of the witness are being violated. There is no \nopportunity for a person who is the target of a grand jury proceeding \nto cross-examine witnesses against him or to present testimony he \nconsiders favorable to his position.\n  In the case of this prosecutor and this grand jury, there was no \nsecrecy, at least as to evidence damaging to the President. The \nsubstance of every witness's testimony was eagerly made known to the \npress and, in turn, eagerly reported.\n  As if to ensure that the full impact of the accumulated damaging \ntestimony would be felt by the American public before any chance for \nrebuttal testimony could arise, the Independent Counsel then rushed to \nobtain court approval and to deliver to the House of Representatives \nthe report and the accompanying documentation which he alone chose to \ninclude. The speedy delivery to the House of the report and materials \nthe Independent Counsel selected, freed the grand jury testimony from \nthe limitations of Rule 6(e), and gave the public the full brunt of the \nprosecution's case without any opportunity for the accused to question \nthe testimony on which it was based.\n\n\n                     Basis for Claiming Unfairness\n\n  Second, the Independent Counsel presented his report, not as a legal \ndocument which should have set out the asserted grounds for impeachment \nand then summarized the evidence supporting each ground as well as the \nevidence arguing against it. Instead, he chose to present his report in \nthe format of a narrative where facts are presented in a manner \ndesigned to arouse the greatest public revulsion. The narrative is one-\nsided in that it summarizes the evidence damaging to the President and \nomits all other. It contains damaging and salacious testimony \nconcerning the President and others even when that testimony is not \nrelevant to any asserted ground for impeachment.\n  The third basis for claimed unfairness is that the House, as of \ntoday, has made public the Independent Counsel's report, the \nPresident's videotaped testimony, and 2,800 pages of other grand jury \ntestimony. This comes before the House has even made a determination to \nbegin an impeachment inquiry. The effect of this action, and possibly \nits purpose, is to undermine any fair and objective assessment of the \nevidence and the allegations. The result is to try and convict the \nPresident in the court of public opinion long before there is any \nopportunity for the President's counsel to counter the accumulated \nweight of this evidence.\n  The rush by the House to disclose all, has pressured the media, us \npoliticians, and the public to come to judgment before the defense can \npresent its case.\n  Our system of justice requires that an accused person, first will be \ncharged, second will be tried, and then if convicted, will be sentenced \nfor the crime.\n  In this case, this procedure--this due process--is being trampled \nupon. The Independent Counsel has charged the President and every \neffort is being made to have the public convict and pronounce sentence \non him before any trial occurs.\n  One final plea: we must constantly remember that the procedures \nfollowed in this case are not just procedures which will affect this \nPresident and this impeachment inquiry. What actions we take here will \nset a precedent\n\n[[Page S10644]]\n\nfor future Presidents and high government officials, and for future \nimpeachment proceedings. If this President is not entitled to be \ntreated fairly, then why should future Presidents expect fairness?\n  Mr. President, there is a certain mob mentality that has taken hold \nof some here in our Nation's capital. And in that atmosphere it may be \nfoolhardy to think that a call for ``fairness,'' for ``due process,'' \nfor the ``rights of the accused,'' will be given much heed.\n  But just as this President justifiably is going to be judged by the \nAmerican People and by history for his actions, we in Congress are \ngoing to be judged as well. If we deny the President basic fairness, \nthat judgment on this Congress will be harsh, regardless of the final \nverdict on this President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10643-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10644-S10645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILD NUTRITION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to give my full support for \nthe Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act. This important legislation \nauthorizes and allows for continued funding for important child \nnutrition programs for the next 5 years, until the year 2003.\n  I want to commend Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar and our \nranking member, Senator Harkin, and my colleagues on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for working cooperatively in what I believe is a \nvery excellent bipartisan spirit to unanimously pass this bill out of \ncommittee. I also want to thank my Senate colleagues for passing this \nvital legislation unanimously on the floor this past week. Clearly, \nthis legislation demonstrates our commitment to feeding our Nation's \nchildren in an effective and cost-efficient manner.\n  The Child Nutrition Reauthorization legislation provides funding for \nthe National School Lunch and Breakfast Program, for the Child and \nAdult Care Food Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the Women, \nInfant and Children (WIC) Program, along with many other nutrition food \nprograms to feed our Nation's young people.\n  One of the provisions in this legislation that I worked on with a \nparticularly focused effort during this debate was a provision that \nprovides for a detailed research and pilot project on how school \nbreakfast programs impact a child's academic success and behavioral \nattitudes.\n  This research provision is a modified version of S. 1396, the Meals \nfor Achievement Act, which I introduced this last November. The \nresearch provision provides for the mandatory funding for a school \nbreakfast research project to further test the impacts of school \nbreakfast on children's academic and behavioral patterns.\n  This provision will require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a \n5-year school breakfast study in six different school districts \nthroughout the United States, involving approximately 15,000 \nschoolchildren.\n  As I have stated before, the research on the impact of children \neating school breakfast, so far, points overwhelmingly to a positive \nresult. Not only do our research studies so far indicate that the \nacademic scores in reading, writing, and math improve, but levels of \nhyperactivity and tardiness are greatly reduced.\n  The purpose of the study contained in this legislation is to further \nanalyze the existing data and to provide the additional research and \ndata at a national level and to provide the positive impacts--to show \nwhat the positive impacts are, in general, of eating a school \nbreakfast.\n  It is important to note that the funding for the research provision \nwill require no new additional expenses and maintains our balanced \nbudget discipline. It is not my intention that this research project \ncreate any new Federal bureaucracy. However, once the researchers have \ncompleted a 5-year study and find, as I believe they will, that \nbreakfast does indeed improve a child's academic success, we as Federal \nlawmakers can work with local and State officials to create guidelines \nof how school breakfasts can improve success in all of the schools \nthroughout our Nation.\n  The rationale for this provision is very simple: In order for the \nUnited States to compete effectively in the world, we must have an \neducated and productive workforce. We have far too many children who \nare simply not prepared at the beginning of each schoolday to succeed \nwith their schoolwork.\n  In 1994, the Minnesota Legislature directed the Minnesota Department \nof Children, Families and Learning to implement a universal breakfast \npilot program integrating breakfast into the education schedule for all \nstudents. The evaluation of the pilot project, performed by the Center \nfor Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of \nMinnesota, showed that when all students are involved in school \nbreakfast, there is a general increase in learning and achievement.\n  Again, researchers at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital \nrecently completed a study on the results of a universal free breakfast \nat one public school in Philadelphia and two in Baltimore. The study, \npublished this week in the Archives of Adolescent and Pediatric \nMedicine, which is a journal of the American Medical Association, found \nthat students who ate breakfast showed great improvement in math \ngrades, in particular, but also in attendance and punctuality. The \nresearchers also observed that students displayed fewer signs of \ndepression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and other behavioral problems.\n  This study is reflected in an article in this week's Economist \nMagazine, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Economist, September 19, 1998]\n\n  Your Mother Was Right (Again)--Free Breakfasts May Be a Good way to \n                   Help Poor Kids Do Better at School\n\n       When it was shown recently that fat people eat more than \n     thin people, some laughed, some jeered and some bawled their \n     indignation that money had been spent on discovering anything \n     so obvious. But if the results had been different, they would \n     have been very interesting: so it is not always wasteful to \n     do research that tells you something you thought you knew all \n     along. In any case, even if the results are expected, it \n     sometimes takes such research to get people to pay attention \n     to a problem.\n       So it is with a paper published this week in Archives of \n     Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Michael Murphy, a \n     psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, \n     and his colleagues have proved that what your mama told you \n     all along is true: breakfast is good for you.\n       Dr. Murphy and his colleagues looked at a programme of free \n     breakfasts in three inner-city state schools--one in \n     Philadelphia and two in Baltimore. At these schools, 80% of \n     children are so poor that they are eligible for a free school \n     breakfast anyway; yet before the start of Dr. Murphy's \n     programme, only 15% were eating one. Dr. Murphy says that \n     this is because there is a stigma attached to showing that \n     you are so destitute that you have to eat free. Also, because \n     breakfasts are provided before school starts, they may be \n     over by the time the school bus arrives, making it impossible \n     for many pupils to benefit. Unlike free school lunches, which \n     have a higher consumption rate, breakfast is not part of the \n     normal school day.\n       The programme Dr. Murphy was studying provided breakfast \n     free of charge for everyone regardless of their means, and \n     changed the timing so that the meal was eaten after roll-\n     call. Within four months of these innovations, participation \n     had almost doubled, to 27%.\n       More significant, however, were the benefits of eating \n     breakfast. Before the programme started, the researchers \n     interviewed a sample of more than 100 school-children (the \n     average age was just over ten) from the three schools, and \n     also their parents and their teachers, to assess each child's \n     sense of well-being, anxiety and depression. They also \n     collected data on school attendance, tardiness, academic \n     grades and breakfast consumption. Four months later, they did \n     it all again (although this time they interviewed only a \n     subset of those previously questioned).\n       The researchers found that kids who started eating \n     significantly more breakfast (defined as an increase of at \n     least 20% over their previous consumption) were doing better \n     at school, particularly in mathematics. This result confirms \n     earlier studies on the benefits of breakfasting on academic \n     performance. But Dr. Murphy and his colleagues also found \n     that those children who started eating more breakfast were \n     significantly less likely\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\n     to feel anxious or depressed or to be described by their \n     teachers as hyperactive or disruptive, than those who \n     continued not to eat breakfast. Both regular and new members \n     of the breakfast club were also less likely to play truant or \n     be late for school. On the strength of these results, 20 \n     schools in Maryland are now introducing free breakfasts for \n     all.\n       Of course, without depriving some children of the \n     breakfasts they were already eating--an ethically dubious \n     experiment--it is hard to separate cause and effect. It may \n     be that children who are not late are more likely to eat \n     breakfast anyway; skipping school presumably translates into \n     skipping breakfast too. This, more than eating breakfast per \n     se could account for the improvements in grades.\n       But it may not matter whether eating breakfast improves \n     mood and performance directly through its nutritional \n     effect--or indirectly, simply by getting more pupils to \n     arrive at school on time. Breakfast is no panacea, but it may \n     be a cost-effective way to help the children who most need \n     help. In America's inner cities, between one-third and two-\n     thirds of children go hungry at least some of the time. \n     Besides this, they frequently have to cope with difficult \n     family circumstances and other severe problems. Learning is \n     low on their list of priorities. Yet learning is perhaps \n     their only real ticket to a better life.\n       If by eating breakfast children do better, feel happier and \n     find it easier to learn, then increasing the take-up of \n     school breakfasts by making them free for all is surely a \n     good idea. Bring on the buttered toast.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, The Economist notes that:\n\n       The researchers found that kids who started eating \n     significantly more breakfast . . . were doing better at \n     school, particularly in mathematics. This result confirms \n     earlier studies on the benefits of breakfasting on academic \n     performance. But Dr. Murphy and his colleagues also found \n     that those children who started eating more breakfast were \n     significantly less likely to feel anxious or depressed, or to \n     be described by their teachers as hyperactive or disruptive . \n     . . less likely to play truant or be late for school. . . . \n     Breakfast is no panacea, but it may be a cost-effective way \n     to help children who most need help.\n\n  And so the provision of the Johnson school breakfast amendment, in \nour overall nutrition authorization, will build on already-existing \nresearch in individual school districts around the country and create a \nmore comprehensive research strategy. But I believe that the facts that \nwill be found are already apparent to us in the smaller research \nstudies that have already been conducted.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to build further on this \ninformation and this broader research from this larger pilot program \ncontained in this legislation, to what ultimately will be a universal \nfree breakfast program for all schoolchildren throughout the Nation. I \nthink the research already is very apparent that this could be a very \ncost-effective, efficient way of enhancing academic performance and \nminimizing behavioral difficulties throughout all the schools in the \nUnited States. Obviously, this program would be constructed, as I \nenvisioned, on a voluntary basis, from school district to school \ndistrict, so there is no federalization or mandate. Yet, there is an \nopportunity for a constructive partnership to exist between the Federal \nGovernment and its nutrition programs and our individual school \ndistricts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10644-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10645-S10646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE ADMINISTRATION'S FARM RELIEF PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to touch on the status of \nagricultural disaster legislation this morning, which is pending in \nboth the Senate and in the other body.\n  As many know, for the last several months the northern plains--in \nparticular including my home State of South Dakota--have suffered \nthrough an extraordinarily difficult time in the agricultural sector. \nWe face extremely low prices in both the grain and the livestock side \nof agriculture. Many parts of the northern plains as well have suffered \nfrom grain disease, as well as flooding and other natural calamities \nthat have further caused extreme stress on agricultural producers in \ngeneral. Now we find prices at remarkably low levels.\n  I received a report just recently from Winner, SD, indicating that \ncorn there was bringing only $1.10 a bushel, and wheat in Alpena, SD, \nwas bringing in around $2. Cattle in our State, as they are throughout \nmuch of the country, are bringing in the mid-$50 range. This represents \na loss for each animal raised by our producers, and it creates a \nsituation where hedging those losses with profitability in the grain \nsector is not possible either. It is a double-barreled hit. It is one \nthat is unique--one that is not common. Even though we all understand \nthat there are cycles of price in both the grain and livestock sector, \nfor them to both be at the calamitously low level, complicated by \nfurther natural disasters at the same time, is just simply wreaking \nhavoc across much of rural America and the United States.\n  My farm State colleagues and I have twice brought up our legislative \nresponse. We have, frankly, had mixed success on the floor of this body \nand in Congress in general. The economic relief package that we earlier \noffered would have provided a lift in the caps on marketing loan rates \nand an extension of terms of those loans from 9 to 15 months, a \nstrategy that I believe is the most effective strategy that has been \ndebated on this floor relative to addressing the problem of grain \nprices.\n  There is much that we can do in terms of disaster relief, and much of \nthat is fine and good. But I think anyone who doesn't understand that \nthe crisis we face both in livestock and grain is reflective of price \nsimply doesn't get it. While disaster relief will tide some people over \nand address the cash flow problems that they face now over a short \nterm, this body needs to be addressing the long-term problem of price \nin grain and livestock. And anything that doesn't do that is simply \nbuying us time for yet another calamity to come down the road sometime \nsoon.\n  A second provision in our package that provided disaster indemnity to \nassist producers who suffered from multiyear disasters--natural and \notherwise--is a provision to provide market transparency through \nmandatory price reporting of livestock sales and mandatory labeling of \nbeef and lamb products for their country of origin. We were successful \nin incorporating several of these provisions into the agricultural \nappropriations bill when it was considered on the floor of the Senate. \nThe one measure that we were not successful with, unfortunately, was \nthe lifting of caps and the extension of the marketing loan rates on \ngrain. We have twice now voted on that marketing loan provision, and \ntwice we have been defeated.\n  The Senate passed a $500 million indemnity program which, as is now \nagreed on by everyone essentially, is inadequate given the scope of the \nlosses that have taken place, not just on the northern plains but in \nTexas, Louisiana, and other parts of the country that have suffered \nfrom the dire drought circumstance.\n  This legislation now is tied up in conference committee. It is my \nhope that we will see sufficient bipartisanship and statesmanship on \nthe part of the conferees that a final product will return to the House \nand Senate that will, in fact, be constructive. In the meantime, \nhowever, released this weekend and announced this morning is an \ninitiative promoted by the administration that I think this body and \nthe conferees need to look at with the greatest care.\n\n  I applaud my colleague, Senator Daschle, in particular, for his \nunstinting work on the agriculture crisis problem and for his work with \nthe administration to promote yet another constructive, positive \napproach to the kind of prices we face. Senator Daschle, who could well \nhave been in our home State campaigning in his own reelection campaign, \nchose instead to remain here working around the clock and through the \nweekend with the administration, with our colleagues on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, with both political parties, trying to see what \nwe could do to augment the relief that had earlier been discussed and \nwhich had partially been passed by the Senate.\n  I again applaud Senator Daschle's extraordinary leadership, his \nwillingness to stick with the real business of getting this legislation \ninto shape, for getting it to the floor of the Senate, and for working \nwith the administration to make sure that it has both congressional and \nadministration support.\n  This relief package would come to slightly over $7 billion for 1 \nyear. It would involve, again, uncapping of the\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\nmarketing loan rate, which I have discussed and which I think we need \nto revisit, as the single best strategy available to us to address the \nissue of inadequate prices in the grain sector. It would lift these \ncaps and extend the loan terms from 9 to 15 months. I think it would \nhave an enormously positive economic impact all across rural America.\n  Second, it would tie our relief to production agriculture, which I \nthink is important.\n  There is an alternative disaster package being talked about currently \nthat would amount to augmenting the transition payments for producers--\nactually not the producers so much as it would be for landowners.\n  I applaud all efforts to go forward. I am not going to make the \nperfect the enemy of the good. I think there is urgency here that is \ncritical. We need to proceed in an expeditious fashion as much as \npossible. I understand it may involve some give and take and will \ninvolve some of each side's strategy. But when I look at what the \nuncapping of the loan rates would do, even at this modest level, it is \nclear to me that it is a superior alternative.\n  The wheat price, which is currently capped at $2.58 per bushel under \nthe Democratic plan, goes to $3.22. That is up 64 cents per bushel. \nThat is under the Democratic plan and the plan proposed by the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The alternative to that through the AMTA payments, if you were to \nequate it on a per bushel basis, would be not a 64-cent increase but a \n23-cent increase.\n  On corn, the current cap is at $1.89. The Democratic proposal would \nincrease that to $2.25, up 36 cents. The alternative through the AMTA \npayment increase would equate to about a 10-cent increase rather than a \n36-cent increase.\n  The soybean cap would be increased modestly--from $5.26 per bushel to \n$5.33 a bushel, up 7 cents. But under the alternative AMTA approach, \nsoybean producers would stand a chance of getting nothing if their \nsoybeans were not planted on former base acreages.\n  The AMTA augmentation also suffers from the problem of what to do \nabout renters. Some 43 percent of the crops being grown in America are \nbeing grown by farmers on rented land. It has been our experience in \nthe past that if we do the AMTA payment approach, there may be a great \nmany instances where the money will go exclusively to the landowner but \nnothing to the farmer who actually is growing the crop.\n  The Freedom to Farm legislation touted in the 1996 farm bill \ndelivered planting and management flexibility to farmers. They have \nbeen able to take care of that flexibility. I think that has been \npositive. It has been a positive step in the right direction. I applaud \nthat. No one is suggesting that we back up and retreat from that level \nof flexibility, that we back into some sort of micromanaged world out \nof Washington.\n  But the fact is when Freedom to Farm passed, wheat prices were nearly \n$6; not gaining--around $2 in many parts of the country. Corn was in \nthe $3 range. It is far less than that; it is in the $1 range now.\n  Circumstances have changed. Many of us would say, ``I told you so.'' \nThere is a certain amount of foreseeability that those prices were not \ngoing to stay at that high level in perpetuity. Now we find that with \nFreedom to Farm, although it contains some positive things, it is, \nfrankly, grossly inadequate in terms of providing the safety net, \nproviding some kind of stability for family producers.\n  Now we find that declining transition payments and then ultimately a \npat on the back and a ``good luck,'' reducing America's commitment to \nfamily agriculture from $26 billion at a high water mark over a decade \nago to $5 billion and ultimately to nothing, while our European allies \nspend $50 billion to sustain agriculture there, because they know what \nit is like to be hungry, puts U.S. producers at an incredible \ndisadvantage.\n  It is my hope, again, that we will find the bipartisan will to deal \nwith this in an urgent manner in the coming week or two of this \nCongress. The administration and the Democratic proposal, on top of \nthese past efforts at meat labeling, price transparency, disaster \npayments and raising the marketing loan cap--which, by the way, is a \nmarketing loan and not the kind of loan that results in massive grain \nbuildup in supplies and inventory we suffered under in previous years--\nthis disaster package also includes significant funds for Farm Service \nAdministration operating loans for producers who have been hit by a \ndisaster, for land compensation for flooded lands, for payment for crop \nlosses on uninsured crops and for the additional FSA county staff \nsupport that will be necessary to implement all of this in an effective \nand efficient manner.\n  The bottom line, in my view, is price. We need to address both, \nhowever--the long-term strategy of what to do about price, as well as \nthe short-term cash flow crisis that we have in rural America.\n  I believe that the previous package which was adopted only in part \ntook us a long ways in the right direction. The current package, which \nwas announced this morning by the administration, by Senator Daschle \nand Senator Harkin, I think moves us far beyond the debate that has \ntaken place so far. It is far more constructive. It is far more helpful \nas we deal with this crisis in rural America.\n  I again applaud Senator Daschle's extraordinary leadership, the work \nof Senator Harkin and other members of the Ag Committee, Secretary \nGlickman and the Clinton administration for focusing with this kind of \nintensity in a timely manner on what needs to be done relative to \nAmerican agriculture this year; not next year, not 5 years down the \nroad, but this year.\n  I am hopeful, again, that the conferees will evaluate this proposal \nwith the greatest amount of care and earnestness, and that when we \nadjourn this coming October, we will, in fact, have addressed this \nissue in a bipartisan fashion and in a cost-efficient fashion in this \nbody and that it will be on the President's desk and that the President \nwill have an opportunity to sign ag disaster legislation which, in \nfact, is meaningful and timely and sufficient to get our family \nproducers down the road into another productive year in the coming \nplanting season.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself all of the time remaining on the \nDemocratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10645-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10646-S10647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MURIEL HUMPHREY BROWN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Muriel Humphrey Brown was an outstanding \nwoman, and all of us who knew her and had the opportunity to serve with \nher in the Senate mourn her loss today. The people of Minnesota have \nlost one of their finest public servants, and this country has lost one \nof its finest crusaders.\n  Muriel was an outstanding campaigner for her husband, Hubert \nHumphrey, who was a great Senator himself, and a great Vice President \ntoo. Together, they made a extraordinary team. She was the soft-spoken, \ngentle, guiding force behind Hubert's mayoral, Senatorial, Vice \nPresidential and Presidential campaigns. In fact, Muriel changed the \nrules of Presidential campaigning by becoming one of the first wives to \nspeak out by herself on the Presidential campaign trail. Muriel's \neloquence and wisdom could still be heard in recent days, as she \ncelebrated the victory of her son, Skip, in the primary last week in \nhis campaign to became the next Governor of Minnesota.\n  Muriel was an eloquent activist in her own right. She became the \ntwelfth woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, when she was appointed in \n1978 to complete the unexpired term of her husband. During her service \nin the Senate that year, Muriel's courage, wisdom, and ability enabled \nher to carry on the high ideals and important social programs of her \nhusband.\n  She was an able leader on issues important to women, and her vigorous \nsupport for legislation to extend the deadline for States to ratify the \nequal rights amendment was a major step\n\n[[Page S10647]]\n\nforward for women's rights throughout the Nation.\n  As a member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Muriel \nintroduced civil service reform amendments to protect employees who \nprovided information on illegal Government activities and \nmismanagement. Her proposals became the foundation for the well-known \n``whistleblower'' protections that employees have today.\n  Muriel also actively supported the passage of the Comprehensive \nRehabilitation Amendments in 1978, which provided a wide range of new \nservices for the handicapped and the retarded. Prior to her service in \nthe Senate, she became a leading crusader for the disabled.\n  She had served on a committee for mental retardation during the \nadministration of President Johnson, and she encouraged many reforms to \nimprove mental health and care for the mentally ill.\n  And above all else, Muriel Humphrey was deeply committed to the \nenactment of the Humphrey-Hawkins full employment bill. Its goal was to \ndo more to reduce unemployment in communities across the country, and \nthe enactment of this legislation was a major accomplishment for Muriel \nand the entire Nation.\n  In every respect, Muriel was a wonderful wife, mother, Senator and \nleader. She served the American people for 34 years as the wife of our \ndistinguished colleague, Hubert Humphrey, and also in her own right as \na highly respected Member of the Senate. She had a remarkable grasp of \nthe issues and a genuine interest in helping others. She earned the \nrespect and admiration of all of us who had the privilege to serve with \nher, and her spirit and courage and determination will be long \nremembered by the American people.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the Humphrey family. America has \nlost a unique leader, and the Kennedy family has lost a wonderful \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10646-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10647-S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another matter, on tomorrow we will \nhave an opportunity to address the issue of an increase in the minimum \nwage for working Americans, at 2:15 p.m. Starting at 10:30 in the \nmorning, the amendment will be before the U.S. Senate, and we will have \nthat opportunity, with the time equally divided before the luncheon \nbreak, to make the case for the increase in the minimum wage for \nworking Americans, those who are on the lower rung of the economic \nladder.\n  This afternoon, in the time which is available, I would like to \nanticipate and respond to a number of our colleagues who will raise \nquestions about whether it is appropriate to increase the minimum wage \nat this time.\n  Throughout the history of the minimum wage, our opponents have \nclaimed that raising the minimum wage will add to the rate of \ninflation. Those who oppose fair increases in the wages for working \nfamilies also claim that unemployment will increase among the workers \nin this country and, therefore, be counterproductive to the various \npeople we are trying to help.\n  We have raised it on five different occasions since the end of World \nWar II. So it is fair enough for us to look back on the history of the \nincreases in the minimum wage to find out if there is validity to those \nparticular arguments. And, quite clearly, those arguments have to fail \non their face. And I will have an opportunity briefly this afternoon \nand in a more detailed way to respond to these arguments on tomorrow.\n  But a basic, fundamental point, Mr. President, that is at the heart \nof this whole issue is whether we in this country really honor work and \nwhether we think that Americans who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of \nthe year ought to live in poverty, that they ought to live in poverty \nand that their children should live in poverty.\n\n  As Americans, we have experienced the most extraordinary economic \ngrowth over the period of the last 6 years, with economic growth, price \nstability, low interest rates, low rates of inflation, declining \nunemployment. We are also experiencing the longest period of economic \ngrowth and price stability in the history of this Nation.\n  I think we were reminded a week or so ago when we found out that the \nstock market went down some 300 points. People were saying we lost $1 \ntrillion in terms of value, and then it bounced back the next day. We \nsee these extraordinary fluctuations. We see the extraordinary creation \nof wealth in just about every population, except for the low-income, \nworking families in this Nation. They have not been a part of the \ngrowth of economic prosperity.\n  If we look at what happened in this country in the immediate post-war \nperiod, from 1948 into the late 1950s through the 1960s, and actually \nup to 1972. If we divided the economic incomes into what they call \nquintiles and divide by five, and look at the relative growth in terms \nof income over a 30-year period, in the post-war period where we had \ntimes of recession, inflation, a variety of economic shocks, we come to \none very basic and fundamental conclusion. All of those quintiles went \nup, and went up together. There was merely a 5-point or 10-point \npercent difference between those at one level and those at another \nlevel. All Americans went up together. The rising tide raised all the \nboats. We did not have this period of economic growth and price \nstability.\n  What has happened in the more recent times? In more recent times we \nhave seen the enormous accumulation of wealth among the most fortunate \nindividuals in this country and the wealthiest corporations and an \nactual decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage workers. \nThey have been the big losers. They haven't just been holding steady, \nthey have lost in terms of purchasing power.\n  We have an opportunity tomorrow to say whether this is fair, right \nhere in the United States of America, among our fellow citizens who are \nworking hard and trying to provide for their families and have hopes \nand dreams like every Member of this body.\n  It is interesting that just this last year Members in the U.S. Senate \naccumulated, with our rate of inflation on our own salaries, the \nequivalent of more than $1.50 per hour in 1 year. Do we understand \nthat? Every Member in this body this last year got an increase of more \nthan $1.50 an hour. And they all effectively took it.\n  We are talking about the men and women in this country who work as \nteachers' aides, in nursing homes, and who clean these facilities that \nwe have here in buildings all across America. They are also child care \nworkers or assistants to children. We are asking to provide these \nworkers an increase of 50 cents in January and 50 cents the following \nyear.\n  We, in the Senate, have taken $1.50 for ourselves, and I didn't hear \nmany voices in opposition to that. But we will hear a lot of opposition \ntomorrow about providing 50 cents for these hard-working Americans next \nyear, and 50 cents the following year. We will hear opposition and we \nwill have a vote here in the U.S. Senate. I will be frank and say it is \nstill an uphill battle. We are continuing to make that case, and we are \nhopeful we will be successful.\n  How can we possibly justify voting ourselves $1.50 more an hour, but \nnot for the child care workers, not for the teacher assistants, not for \nthose working in nursing homes and looking after our parents? Why? \nBecause they will say they are worried about inflation and are worried \nabout the impact of the increase of the minimum wage on our total \neconomy--an $8 trillion total economy. Ten million Americans will get \nthe equivalent of another $1, spread over a 2-year period. The proposed \nincreases in the minimum wage would amount to a tiny fraction of our \ntotal economy.\n  We are going to hear from some who will say we cannot afford it \nbecause it will be an inflator in terms of our economy. It wasn't an \ninflator when we had an increase for ourselves, but it will be an \ninflator if we are going to provide the increase for these working \nfamilies. Many are working, single mothers who are trying to provide \nfor their children. Sixty percent are women who have two or three jobs \nto try to provide for their families.\n  We hear a lot on the floor of the U.S. Senate about family values. \nWhat about that mother who doesn't have the time to spend with that \nchild on their homework or doesn't have the time to take that child for \na walk in the park on a Sunday because they\n\n[[Page S10648]]\n\nhave to go to another job? When that child asks to go to a birthday \nparty, and the mother says, ``You can't because we can't afford a \npresent,'' what about those family values? What about those family \nvalues?\n  Raising the minimum wage is a fundamental issue of fairness. Are we \ngoing to honor work? Are we going to say to our fellow citizens that \nwe, as a nation, have enough sense of common purpose and direction that \nwe believe that many of our neighbors who may not have the kind of \ntraining or the education, may have had a life that has been \nchallenging and difficult, may be struggling to try to provide for \ntheir families, are not even going to be able to be lifted out of \npoverty?\n  We have seen the greatest accumulation of wealth in the history of \nthis Nation, and we have seen the greatest growth of disparity between \nthe most affluent and those who are the neediest workers in our \ncountry, and we have seen this disparity grow to be greater than it has \never been in the history of this Nation. This is a very, very small \nstep to try to do a little something about it. In past years, raising \nthe minimum wage has been a bipartisan effort.\n  This chart reflects basically the points I have been making in the \npast few moments. This chart shows about where the minimum wage was, in \nreal, constant dollars, from 1955-1998 and beyond, to the year 2000. In \n1955, we got the increase in the minimum wage. It went to almost $6. \nFor the period of the late 1950s, to the 1960s, the 1970s, beginning \ninto the early 1980s, in all that period of time, for some 30 years, \nthe purchasing power for the minimum wage was far above what it would \nbe if we were able to pass the legislation tomorrow to increase the \nminimum wage by 50 cents next year and 50 cents the following year.\n  All we are trying to do is get to the bottom, not to the top, of what \nit would be--$7.38 in purchasing power. We are trying to just get into \nthe zone. We will still be at the lowest for a period of 30 years, at a \ntime of economic prosperity. These increases that have taken place \nsince 1955 have had Republican and Democratic support. It didn't used \nto be a partisan issue. But we are just trying to get there.\n  We have to ask, Is that so unreasonable, Mr. President? Look what \nhappens if we are not successful. If we are not successful in getting \nthe increase in the minimum wage, the purchasing power of the minimum \nwage, drops back to $4.82 an hour. By 2000, it drops back to $4.82. We \nare just trying to get the minimum wage up to $6.15. Even by 2000, it \nwill only be worth $5.76. It will still be well below what the \npurchasing power has been in here, Mr. President.\n  This is an extremely modest bill. This gives you the history on this \nchart. These are working families and individuals, who will and can \nwork, who play by the rules, go out to earn a modest living every \nsingle day. If these workers miss a paycheck, they miss paying the \nutilities. If they miss a paycheck, they can't afford to provide for \nthe kind of attention to meet health care for a child. If they miss a \npaycheck, there is no opportunity to provide for children. Nor can they \ngive them a night out at the movies. That is how close this figure is, \nMr. President.\n  Do you know what this $1 increase represents, Mr. President? That $1 \nincrease, most of all, means dignity to these workers. That is our No. \n1 reason. These workers can free themselves from the reliance on \nsupport programs. It gives them a sense of dignity. That is important. \nWe spend a great deal of time around here adding and subtracting and \nlooking at balances. Once in a while, we ought to look at what the real \nimpact is in terms of human quality. It is dignity. It is the fact that \nmen and women can look at their families and know that they have a job \nthat offers them an opportunity to live with some dignity. That is what \nthis is really about.\n  But look at what this $1 represents. Some people might say, well, \nthat is not an awful lot. It certainly is for these families. It \nrepresents about 6 months of groceries for a family. It represents \nabout 7 months of rent, on average, for a family. It represents two-\nthirds of the tuition for a community college so that one of their \nchildren can go on to a community college. That is the kind of hope and \nopportunity it means for these families. It is a big deal. It is \nimportant. We talk about a billion dollars here and a billion dollars \nbeing real money. But this 50 cents and 50 cents--another dollar, over \nthe period of 2 years--is a lot of money for working families.\n  So, Mr. President, the other issue I will mention very briefly here \nis whether this adds to the rate of inflation. Mr. President, I want to \naddress these two issues very quickly; that is, what the impact of the \nincrease in the minimum wage is on inflation.\n  Raising the minimum wage does not fuel inflation. It says on the top \nof this chart, right here, going back to 1996, in January of 1996 we \nhave three-tenths of 1 percent. This is the inflation rate increase per \nmonth during this period of time. It is three-tenths of 1 percent. It \ndropped here. Then it went up. But, generally speaking, for a period \nbefore 9 months, it was three-tenths of 1 percent. It increased it to \n$4.75.\n  Look at what happens to the rate of inflation. It drops back and \ndrops, and it settles on in here. Instead of three-tenths per month, it \ndrops down to two-tenths per month. Then we increase it to $5.15, and \ndown it goes again, and then up, and then down again. This spans from \nJanuary of 1996 through June of 1998. That is a pretty clear indication \nthat the two last increases, with the rate of inflation, when we didn't \nhave as favorable an economy as we do today--that effectively there has \nbeen no impact on the rate of inflation.\n  If we look at what the impact of the minimum wage has been on the \nunemployment rate, again, this chart here represents--these are Bureau \nof Labor statistics and they are authenticated. If you look back in \nOctober of 1996, what the rate of unemployment was, it was just above 5 \npercent--about 5.2 percent. We saw the increase in the minimum wage and \na little blip here, and then we see how it has declined, below 5 \npercent. It was increased to $5.15, and the chart settles in now to \nabout 5.5 percent. I think, if we look at the most recent figures, it \nis down to 4.3 percent.\n  So the two major arguments have been that it adds to the unemployment \nrate and it adds to the inflation rate.\n  The final point I will make, since this is an argument that is raised \nmost recently, as well--maybe it doesn't add to inflation, but let's \nlook at this. The minimum wage doesn't harm small business, it says on \nthis chart. This is a Jerome Levy Economic Institute 1998 survey of 568 \nsmall businesses. ``Did the recent increase in minimum wage affect \nhiring or unemployment decisions?'' Mr. President, 6.2 percent said \nyes, 79 percent said no. ``Would raising the minimum wage cause you to \nlay off or hire workers?'' Three percent said yes, 93 percent said no. \nThey have a longer study which basically supports this.\n  We have had the Restaurant Association that has talked about how this \nwas going to be ``devastating.'' But they have increased their \nemployment by 230,000 restaurant workers over this period, although \nthey had predicted an absolute disaster in terms of the restaurant \nbusiness. That is done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So it is \nimportant that we try to put this into some kind of perspective.\n  The basic issue in question is: Are we going to be fair to working \nAmericans? Do we believe that these Americans who are at the lower \nlevel of the economic ladder should be able to participate, to some \ndegree, in terms of economic prosperity? Tomorrow, we will have an \nopportunity to answer that question. I hope that the Senate will vote \nin favor of providing it.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As the Republican manager for this legislation, I want \nto speak to an amendment which was offered Friday by the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, but also to speak generally about the behavior \nof the bankruptcy bar as it relates to the amount of bankruptcies that \nare being filed, which were at a historical high of 1.4 million last \nyear. That was a 30-percent increase. There was probably a 25-percent \nincrease in 1996 over 1995. As we all know, there is an explosion of \nfilings for consumer bankruptcy.\n  I have blamed some of that on the law of 1978. That is why we have \nthis bill before us, to change the law so it is not so easy to go into \nbankruptcy.\n  In 20 years, I have had hundreds of people talk to me about it being \ntoo easy to go into bankruptcy. It ought to be harder, in their \njudgment. I have not had one person say to me that it ought to be \neasier to go into bankruptcy, and I have had people who have gone \nthrough bankruptcy tell me how easy it is to get into bankruptcy.\n  I think the law of 1978 is at fault to some extent. I think the \nsituation we have with Congress with 30 years of deficit spending, that \nGovernment doesn't have to live within its income, sends a signal to \npeople in this country that it is all right for individuals to live \nbeyond their income and avoid paying for it.\n  We have had a general lack of shame or personal responsibility that \nused to be associated with paying bills or not paying bills and the \nfiling of bankruptcy. That is no longer the situation, although that \ncan be somewhat to blame for Government not setting a good example in \nthis area.\n  I also think there is more than just the downfall of personal \nresponsibility. We have heard lots of speeches about how the credit \nindustry, particularly the credit card industry, has not been very \ncareful in the number of requests they have granted for bankruptcy, or \nthe willy-nilly approach--I know they will say it is not willy-nilly. \nThere is a very careful study they have of who ought to be mailed a \ncredit card or not mailed a credit card. But as a practical matter, \nthey have been pretty darn fluid with the number of credit cards that \nhave been going through the mail.\n  All of these are reasons why we have this legislation before us. All \nof these are reasons why this bill was voted out of committee on a vote \nof 16 to 2. All of these are reasons why a very strong bill passed the \nHouse of Representatives by a veto-proof margin. And all of these, I \nthink, are reasons that, hopefully, on Tuesday or Wednesday of this \nweek we will pass this bill by a very substantial margin.\n  As I indicated, we have as one of the amendments that we will be \nvoting on tomorrow an amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  In my earlier statements on the Senate floor, I have alluded to the \nrole of the overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers plague in fomenting \nthe current crisis in our bankruptcy system. Last Friday, Senator \nFeingold offered an amendment which will insulate bankruptcy lawyers \nfrom fines when they encourage bankruptcy abuse.\n  As reported by the Judiciary Committee, the Consumer Bankruptcy \nReform Act fines--in other words, penalizes--bankruptcy lawyers who \nsteer high-income people who can repay their debt into chapter 7. Under \nthe bill, in the narrow circumstance where a chapter 7 trustee is \nsuccessful in getting a chapter 7 case dismissed or converted to \nchapter 13, the lawyer for high-income bankruptcy will be fined if his \nor her case is not substantially justified. That is our bill.\n  This fine will reimburse the chapter 7 trustee for expenses incurred \nwhile detecting abuses of the bankruptcy system. I think any reasonable \nperson will say that lawyers who file bankruptcy cases which are not \nsubstantially justified ought to be required and will be required to \nhelp defray the costs of these frivolous cases. That is all this bill \ndoes. Senator Feingold wants to cut this reasonable effort to control a \nbankruptcy bar which is seriously out of control.\n  Mr. President, in order for my colleagues to understand the \nimportance of imposing some reasonable controls on the conduct of \nbankruptcy lawyers, I want to give a little background on the conduct \nof bankruptcy lawyers.\n  Today, many lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy view bankruptcy as \nan opportunity to make big money for themselves. This profit motive \ncauses bankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy as the only option even \nwhen a financially troubled client has an obvious ability to repay his \nor her debts. In other words, this profit motive creates a real \nconflict of interest where bankruptcy lawyers push people into \nbankruptcy who don't belong there simply because they want to make a \nquick buck.\n  As one of the members of the National Bankruptcy Commission noted in \nthe Commission's 1997 report, many who make their living off the \nbankruptcy process have forgotten that declaring bankruptcy should have \na moral dimension.\n  As I have already said, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains \nreasonable penalties for lawyer misconduct. These penalties will cause \nlawyers to think twice before they willy-nilly cart their client off to \nbankruptcy court and pocket a nice profit. Bankruptcy lawyers get paid \nahead of anybody else if there are assets or, obviously, they charge \nbefore they are going to help you.\n  Some lawyers, in their rush to turn a profit, operate what are known \nas bankruptcy mills. These bankruptcy mills are nothing more than \nprocessing centers for bankruptcy. There is little or no investigation \ndone as to whether an individual actually needs bankruptcy protection \nor whether or not a person is able to at least partially repay some of \nhis debt.\n  Recently, one of these bankruptcy attorneys from Texas was sanctioned \nin bankruptcy court. According to the court, this attorney had very \nlittle knowledge of bankruptcy law, but advertised extensively in the \nYellow Pages and on television. Apparently, his advertising worked, \nbecause he filed about 100 new bankruptcy cases a month. Most of the \nwork was done by legal assistants with very limited training. The court \nconcluded that the attorney's services ``amount to little more than a \nlarge scale petition preparer service for which he receives an \nunreasonably high fee.''\n  The practices of these bankruptcy mills are so deceptive and sleazy \nthat last year the Federal Trade Commission went so far--our Federal \nTrade Commission--as to issue a consumer alert warning consumers of \nmisleading ads promising debt consolidation.\n  Mr. President, I think there is a widespread recognition that \nbankruptcy lawyers are preying on unsophisticated consumers who need \ncounseling and help in setting up a budget and who do not need to \ndeclare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy lawyers are the fuel which makes the \nengines of the bankruptcy mills run. It is not surprising that \nbankruptcy lawyers are leading the charge against this bankruptcy \nreform legislation.\n  I want to point to some other evidence of lawyers playing a prime \nrole in this effort to get people into bankruptcy and to avoid the \npayment of debt.\n  We have previously heard complaints from some on the Senate floor \nabout whether our bill does enough to protect child support and also to \nprotect alimony during bankruptcy proceedings. I\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\nhave already spoken to that topic on a previous occasion, but for now, \nI want to point out that some bankruptcy lawyers actually advertise \nthat they can help deadbeat dads get out of their child support and \nother marital obligations. One bankruptcy lawyer has even written a \nbook entitled, as you can see, ``Discharging Marital Obligations in \nBankruptcy,'' by James P. Caher, Esquire.\n  I think it is outrageous, Mr. President, that bankruptcy lawyers are \nhelping deadbeats to cheat to force spouses out of alimony and to cheat \nchildren out of child support. That is a recipe for promoting poverty \nand human misery. Those who want to help the collection of child \nsupport during bankruptcy proceedings should join me in rejecting the \nFeingold amendment to protect bankruptcy lawyers. Those who are \nconcerned about protecting child support should join me to ensure \nlawyers who engage in predatory conduct are subject to stiff fines.\n  Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join me \nin moving child support from No. 7 in the bankruptcy priority list to \nNo. 1. This is the only way to get people's attention. This is the only \nway to restore professionalism to the bankruptcy bar.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, how far these practices have gone. \nFirst, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nfrom the Consumer Bankruptcy News dated June 18 of this year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Consumer Bankruptcy News, June 18, 1998]\n\n Bankruptcy Reform Presents Marketing Opportunity for Debtors' Counsel\n\n       By now, you are well aware of the proposed bankruptcy \n     amendments and how they could affect the relief available to \n     consumers. But how aware of these changes is the general \n     public, especially those people who consulted with you and \n     decided to not file for bankruptcy at that time?\n       James P. Caher, who represents debtors in Eugene, Ore., \n     suggests that you go through your files to check for cases in \n     which you might have recommended that a client wait before \n     filing for bankruptcy, such as if there was recent credit \n     card use or preferential payments to be preserved. Those \n     debtors might be able to discharge their credit card debts in \n     Chapter 7 today, but will they even be eligible for Chapter 7 \n     relief a month from now?\n       Caher recommends that you send them a letter like this one \n     that he recently sent to about 150 people who had consulted \n     with him.\n\n\n                   Possible Changes in Bankruptcy Law\n\n       My records show that you discussed your financial problems \n     and bankruptcy options with me on ________.\n       During the last few months, lobbyists for the credit card \n     companies have been incredibly successful in pushing their \n     idea of bankruptcy ``reform'' through Congress. Bills have \n     been recommended by the judiciary committees of both Houses \n     of Congress and a vote is possible as soon as next month.\n       I fear that some versions of these ``reforms'' will pass, \n     and, if it does, bankruptcy will be much more difficult, more \n     expensive and probably embarrassing.\n       If you've been able to solve your financial problems \n     without the need for bankruptcy, congratulations. However, if \n     you are still considering that option, you should keep an eye \n     on what's going on in Congress, and consider filing before \n     this new restrictive legislation passes.\n       Many of the people who received Caher's letter are trying \n     to do the right thing by paying their bills and avoiding \n     bankruptcy. It would be ironic if legislation that is \n     intended to dissuade debtors from filing for bankruptcy \n     actually encouraged it.\n       Caher acknowledged that there would be some satisfaction in \n     seeing the bills backfire on the credit card industry that \n     has spent so much time and effort in pushing them, but he \n     added that he--like his clients--would much rather see the \n     bills go away.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In this article, bankruptcy lawyers are advised to send \nout letters to anyone who has visited them recently asking about \nbankruptcy. This form letter encourages people to declare bankruptcy \nbecause if Congress passes bankruptcy reform, ``Bankruptcy will be much \nmore difficult, more expensive and probably [even] embarrassing.''\n  I hope this bill does make bankruptcy more embarrassing--and more \ndifficult. In fact, I plead guilty that that is a motive behind our \nlegislation. The American people want people who voluntarily incur \ndebts to pay those debts as agreed. Bankruptcy should be difficult, and \nthe moral stigma that used to be associated with bankruptcy ought to be \nresurrected.\n  Do we say that never is anybody entitled to a fresh start? No, you \nnever say ``never.'' We have not in 100 years. The bankruptcy code, the \nnational bankruptcy code, is 100 years old--when it was first passed. \nThere has always been a concept that, maybe because of natural \ndisaster, maybe because of a lot of illness, maybe even in some cases \nbecause of divorce, but things beyond your control, that you ought to \nhave a fresh start. And we do not detract in this legislation from that \n100-year tradition.\n  But we do say no to bankruptcy lawyers who advise this way or \nbankruptcy lawyers who send out notices that say, ``You had better file \nfor bankruptcy right now because Congress might pass a bill and make it \nmore difficult to do it.'' Or we respond positively to the FTC sending \nout a warning to people: ``Beware of people in the bankruptcy bar who \nare not acting in a responsible manner.''\n  I will give you another example of what is wrong with our bankruptcy \nsystem. A few weeks ago, the Washington Times quoted a local bankruptcy \nattorney advising his clients, ``. . . anybody who's going to file \nbetter do it now. Get in while the getting's good.''\n  What has happened to the notion of bankruptcy then as a last resort? \nWhat has happened to any sense of personal responsibility? How can \nanyone describe filing bankruptcies as ``getting in while the getting's \ngood''? Mr. President, the getting may be good for the lawyers when \nsomeone else files for bankruptcy, but the rest of us have to pay the \nprice--a $40-billion-a-year cost, $400 per family of four. That means \nany family of four is paying $400 more every year for increased costs \nof goods and services, because there is no free lunch when it comes to \nbankruptcy; somebody pays. The consumers of America are paying. It is a \nhidden tax.\n  Our bill will never do away completely with that hidden tax, but this \nlegislation will reduce that hidden tax and hopefully be a small step \ntowards the reestablishment of the principle of personal \nresponsibility.\n  So the rest of us have to pay the price. This kind of attitude about \nbankruptcy represents some of what is wrong with our bankruptcy laws \nand why the current laws need to be changed. Not only do the current \npractices of bankruptcy lawyers do a disservice to their clients, they \nalso cheat society as a whole. The integrity of the bankruptcy system \ndepends in part upon the honesty and the competence of bankruptcy \nlawyers.\n  The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act makes necessary changes to correct \nabuses of the system by bankruptcy lawyers. It requires that attorneys \ninvestigate the financial resources of their clients. The bill holds \nattorneys responsible if they do not honestly determine that their \nclients really need bankruptcy protection.\n  In other words, we are just asking that lawyers do what they are \ntrained to do, and that is to counsel people, counsel people in a \nresponsible way. And just willy-nilly putting people into bankruptcy \nthrough some bankruptcy mill is not that sort of responsible \njurisprudence.\n  If we want to keep bankruptcy available to those who really need it--\nin other words, the fresh start that for 100 years people have been \nentitled to--we have to address these misuses of the system by \nbankruptcy lawyers. This bill does exactly that. And in order for this \nbill to work, we need to reject the Feingold amendment and keep the \nincentives for responsible lawyer conduct currently in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have seen a lot of home runs hit \nlately--McGwire, Sosa, Griffey and company--but I think the Senator \nfrom Iowa has hit a home run. He is bringing to this Senate body his \ndeeply held values arising out of his Midwest background about \nresponsibility and integrity, making a system work like it ought to \nwork, and standing up with courage and challenging those who would \nabuse the system.\n  I think sometimes Congress passes laws that make it easy for people \nto abuse the system. Senator Grassley is taking the lead as the prime \nsponsor for this bill, with Senator Durbin, to\n\n[[Page S10651]]\n\ncorrect some imbalances. I have been honored to have served on the \nsubcommittee with him and the other members of that subcommittee and to \nsee a bankruptcy bill come forward that actually improves the \nbankruptcy process while at the same time not denying those who need \nbankruptcy the right and opportunity to file bankruptcy as is provided \nfor in our Constitution.\n  With regard to these attorneys' fees and to one of the provisions \nthat would be eliminated by Senator Feingold's amendment, I would like \nto make a couple comments.\n  First of all, the Feingold amendment would say that if somebody filed \nunder chapter 7--that is, straight bankruptcy that wipes out all of \nyour debts--and they were not substantially justified in that \ncircumstance, then the trustee would have to file a motion to object \nand have a hearing and be paid for out of his funds. And if he \nprevailed, it would go into chapter 13, where the person filing \nbankruptcy would at least have to pay back a substantial part of his \ndebts on a monthly basis in a payout plan, which we need more of in \nthis country.\n  But the point is this. If the lawyer was not substantially justified \nin filing his client under chapter 7, and we had to conduct a court \nhearing to get the case transferred to chapter 13 because of his error, \nthen who ought to pay? Under the Feingold amendment, the people who \nloaned money to the debtor would pay for the cost of getting the case \ntransferred, instead of the lawyer who filed it. It doesn't just say \nthe lawyer was in error. It said he was not ``substantially justified'' \nin filing.\n\n  The judges know who these lawyers are. They see them come before the \ncourts all the time. The judges are going to give the lawyers a fair \nshake on these matters. They are not going to hit them every time a \ncase is certified from chapter 7 to 13. But, if the attorney was not \nsubstantially justified in filing the case under Chapter 7, the debtor \nought to pay. There is no free lunch. Somebody will pay.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa is correct. The Feingold amendment does \nundermine the integrity of the system. It takes the burden off of the \nlawyer, allows him to freely file wherever he wants. There is no burden \non him to file it under the right act.\n  Once again, this is a historic bill and a good bill. I wish we could \ndo some additional things which I believe are important. However, it \ndoes many, many things that are important and will improve a bankruptcy \nsystem that is out of control. It is to Senator Grassley's credit that \nat a meeting with Members of the other party he agreed to a long list \nof amendments to be debated; I think 16. We need to move this bill. I \nthought we were down here this afternoon for people to offer \namendments; they would offer them and debate them so we could vote on \nthem and get on with this bill.\n  I have been in this body less than 2 years now, but it seems to me \nthere are people who just don't want anything to pass. They want to go \ninto November and say, ``The Republicans don't want to pass any \nlegislation. They have a majority. We can't get legislation passed.''\n  If people have a right to present amendments and won't come to the \nfloor, how will we get the bill up for a vote? It is almost a \nfilibuster in secret--an underground filibuster.\n  I have been on Senator Grassley's subcommittee and I care about this \nbill. We are interested in approving the bill if the amendments are \ngood, and we need to oppose the amendments if they are not good. I \nthink it is time for people who say they want good legislation to \nimprove justice in America to present amendments. Let's get on with \nthis legislation. The House has acted. It is time for the Senate to do \nour job. The result will be something good for America.\n  It was not a partisan bill in committee. It had overwhelming support \nin the subcommittee and came out of the full Senate Judiciary Committee \n16-2, Democrats and Republicans alike joining in this amendment. I \ndon't know why we aren't able to proceed and bring it to a vote and \npass it. We have the kind of bill that will help this country. We ought \nnot wait any longer. It is time to pass it.\n  I just note for the record that the Presiding Officer is a member of \nthe Judiciary Committee and has been very supportive of this \nlegislation and helped work hard to improve it. I thank the Chair for \nhis leadership and skill as an attorney to contribute to this debate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask to speak for 15 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10649-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10651-S10652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DRUGS AND KIDS\n\n  Mr. GRASSELY. Mr. President, this past month, while we were away for \nthe August recess, there was more bad news on the illegal drug front. \nIt seems like the administration waits until no one is looking to \nrelease bad news. The administration waited until late in August and \nwaited until a Friday afternoon to release the data. Needless to say, \nthe President did not discuss this data on his regular radio show. I \nwonder why that is.\n  On Friday, 21 August, the annual Household Survey on Drug Abuse made \nits appearance. I want to share with my colleagues some of the data \nfrom that study. The information is based on a national survey of \nhouseholds in 1997. In this most recent survey, 24,000 people were \ninterviewed, with an expanded survey for California and Arizona. For \nthose of us concerned about drug use among our young, the numbers are \ndisturbing.\n  Before I go into more detail on these numbers, let me explain \nsomething else. In this survey, as in all the others from this \nadministration, there is an attempt to hide the pea. Most of my \ncolleagues will remember the old carnival shell game. In the game, the \nobject was to guess under which of three walnut shells the dealer hid \nthe pea. Keep your eye on the shells.\n  According to the 1997 survey, 13.9 million Americans were current \nusers of illicit drugs. A current user is someone who reported using in \nthe past month before the survey. The survey notes that this is not a \nsignificant increase over 1996 when the number was 13 million. It also \nnotes that this number is half of what it was in 1979, when the number \nwas at its highest. Now, perhaps in someone's book an increase of \n900,000 people is not statistically significant. But not in my book. It \nis even more significant that most of that increase is occurring among \n12-17 year olds. The numbers are going up.\n  In 1992, there were 11 million current users. In 1993, there were 12 \nmillion. There are now almost 14 million. And these numbers may not \ntell the whole truth. Based on preliminary reviews of these household \nnumbers by ONDCP, this type of survey is prone to undercounting. If \nthat is true, then our problem could be very much more serious than we \nthink. In addition, the administration is still trying to hide these \nnumbers in happy talk about the reductions in drug use since 1979.\n  I am glad that we have not yet returned to the levels of reported use \nwe saw in 1979. But let's remember something about how we got to those \nhigh levels then. They were the result of ignoring or making little of \nthe fact that the United States had become a drug-using culture. In the \nearly 1960's, there was no drug problem in this country. Less than 2 \npercent of the population indicated any regular drug use.\n  By 1979, that number had increased to over 10 percent, a fivefold \nincrease. Those were the years of arguments that drugs were okay. That \nthey did not hurt anyone. That you could use drugs responsibly. Our \npopular culture and many in our cultural elite made much of the \nbenefits of using drugs. And who was the target audience for this \nmessage? It was kids, mostly aged 16-20. This age group began to \nexperiment with illegal drugs in ever-increasing numbers. What that \nmeant was that the increase in drug use between 1965 and 1979, while \nonly 11 or so percent of the overall population, fell \ndisproportionately on the young. This age group accounted for less than \n25 percent of the population but bore most of\n\n[[Page S10652]]\n\nthe increase in drug use. The consequence was and remains a natural and \nnational disaster.\n  Most of our addict population today comes from that cohort of users. \nMuch of our increases in crime and domestic violence trace back to this \nsource.\n  That episode of rapidly expanding drug use also created a continuing \nmarket in this country for illegal drugs that keeps the drugs flowing \nto our streets. It also created a builtin lobbying group that seeks to \nlegalize drugs and make them available to yet more kids to this day.\n  Despite this, after 1979, when we woke up to the problem, we made \nmajor strides in reducing use among young people. We were very \nsuccessful. It is interesting that today's legalizers try to cover up \nthat fact. They would have us believe that since you cannot make a \ndifference, our only rational choice is to make drugs widely available. \nNever mind that this is patently not true. As others have discovered, \nthere is a benefit in relying on public amnesia on certain issues and \non the useful lie. The simple fact is, that in the 1980's and early \n1990's, with Just Say No and the war on drugs, we reduced drug use \namong kids by over 50 percent. We reduced cocaine use, which was the \ndrug of choice, by 70 percent.\n  These were phenomenal gains made in just a few years. It is that \nsuccess that the present administration is trying to invoke to paper \nover bad news.\n  Let me cite some of the current numbers: In 1997, 11.4 percent of \nyoung people 12-17 reported using an illegal drug in the 30 days before \nthe survey. In 1992, that number was 5.3 percent. What that means is \nthat we have seen a doubling in the current use of an illegal drug \namong the most at-risk population in just 5 years. But the \nadministration takes heart in the fact that the 11.4 percent number is \nstill lower than the 14.2 percent number in 1979. The problem is, after \n1979 the numbers started going down in response to public and \ngovernment efforts. Today the trend is against us.\n  But there's worse. Between 1996 and 1997, current illegal drug use \nincreased significantly among 12- and 13-year-olds, rising from 2.2 to \n3.8 percent. We are now seeing the onset of drug use among younger and \nyounger kids. And we know from studies and experience that the earlier \nthe onset of use the longer drug use lasts. The earlier the onset the \nmore serious are the physical, psychological, and health consequences, \nand the harder it is for treatment to have any effect. And more and \nmore young people are trying drugs.\n  Based on these numbers, the rate of first use of marijuana among \nyoung adults was at the highest levels since 1980.\n  The estimated number of new heroin users among the young was at the \nhighest levels in 30 years.\n  The rate of first use of cocaine among youth was at its highest level \nin 30 years.\n  These use numbers are bad enough but there's another trend that makes \nthem even scarier. One of the things that predicts increases in use is \nattitudes toward the dangers of using drugs. When people think using is \nrisky and bad, fewer people use. We see this correlation in the years \ndrug use among 12-17-year-olds was declining. But in the last several \nyears more and more kids see no danger in using drugs.\n  Somewhere between 1992 and today we lost our clear, consistent, \ncoherent anti-drug message. As a result, 1998 is beginning to look a \nlot like 1968 in terms of attitudes toward drugs. We are seeing bolder \nand better-funded efforts by legalizers to push drugs in the public \nmarketplace. Many in Hollywood and the recording industry are back with \nthe them that drugs are your friend. The culture and intellectual elite \nare back to arguing pro-drug themes.\n  We are also the beneficiaries of ambivalent messages from the \nadministration on drug use. It has favored needle giveaway programs. It \nhas been largely inert on the effort to legalize marijuana by calling \nit a medicine. It has downgraded or deemphasized our law enforcement \nand interdiction programs. And it has consistently tried to whitewash \nthe bad news with happy talk. When you see numbers like these, repeated \nyear after year, you've got a trend. The trend is against us. Where is \nthis administration on this issue. What is it going to do? Clearly, \nwhat it has done so far is not working.\n  This is not right. It is not good. We are today well on our way to \ncreating a drug-using population of young people to pass on to the next \ngeneration of policy makers and politicians. We are in the process of \ncommitting many of the same mistakes we learned to correct just a few \nyears ago. I have no doubt we will eventually realize the mistake, but \nhow many kids are we going to sacrifice to this new learning before we \nrecover our senses?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10651-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10652-S10653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DRUGS IN THE HEARTLAND\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during the last week of the August \nrecess, I traveled around Iowa launching a statewide antidrug coalition \neffort. I have been working on putting this program together for the \nlast 2 years. It is an effort to bring together elements from all \nacross my State from all areas of life to deal with the growing drug \nproblem. I have spoken often about this problem here and in many of my \npublic speeches. While we often hear about drug use in our inner \ncities, we are, perhaps, a little less prepared to learn about major \ndrug use problems in our rural areas. Well, it's here and it is every \nbit as serious as drug use in our major urban centers. On my trip \naround Iowa, a young man named Josh, all of 15 years old, joined me.\n  Josh began using drugs at 11 and was an addict before he was a \nteenager. He began using marijuana. His friends told him it was \n``cool.'' He moved from that to just about every drug you can name. His \nstory is becoming all too common. Last April, I held a field hearing in \nCedar Rapids. The star witness at that hearing was a young woman of 17 \nwho was a methamphetamine addict at 15. She was not only a user, she \nwas also a pusher.\n  Today, methamphetamine use in Iowa is twice the national average. \nIowa is the target for Mexican criminal gangs pushing this drug every \nbit as much as San Diego or Los Angeles. Iowa and other States in the \nMidwest are also becoming home to an epidemic of meth-producing \nlaboratories.\n  Many of these are located on farms or in small towns little prepared \nto be drug-producing emporiums.\n  If you talk to local sheriffs or police officers in even tiny towns, \nthe story is shocking. I had a letter recently from a policeman in \nOttumwa, Iowa, the home of Radar O'Reilly. What he tells me is that \nmeth is now a major problem in this community of 30,000. It's not just \na problem of users. It is increasingly a problem of producers. Many of \nthe meth addicts have gone into the business of making their own. It's \nall to easy. If they can't get advice on how to make meth from their \nfriends or contacts, why, they can simply pull it down off the \nInternet. Try it, if you don't believe me, it's that easy. You can put \na small lab together in your kitchen.\n  You can use common household chemicals or chemicals used in \nagriculture, a frying pan, coffee filters, and a microwave.\n  Police have found labs in trailers, in vans, and sport vehicles. \nAccording to the policeman from Ottumwa, hardware stores there are \nhaving a problem keeping supplies of drain cleaner in stock because it \nis popular with the kitchen-lab crowd. Farmers across Iowa are having \ntrouble with people stealing anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is \nused as a fertilizer to help fix nitrogen in the soil to grow corn. It \nis also used to produce meth. Local addicts and producers are stealing \nit from farms. County farm bureau organizations are having to issue \nadvisories to farmers how to spot these thefts. This is only one of the \nchemicals. Many of these are carcinogenic. They are all dangerous and \npolluting.\n  This means the lab sites are toxic and dangerous and expensive to \nclean up. In many cases, the toxic waste materials are dumped into the \nground or poured down the kitchen sink.\n  One of the major farming magazines in Iowa, Wallaces Farmer, devoted \nmost of its September issue to this problem. Wallace Farmers does not \nnormally deal with drug questions. But the most recent issue has a 20-\npage special on how meth is tearing apart the heartland. This should \ntell us something about what's happening. This story is increasingly \ncommon not only in Iowa but throughout the Midwest and the West. It is \na problem moving eastward.\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\n  Along with cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and inhalants, we are seeing a \nresurgence in drug use in this country. I will have more to say on this \nlater. Like our earlier epidemic, most of this increased use is \noccurring among the young, between the ages of 12 and 20.\n  Drug use among this age group has doubled in the past 5 years. We are \nwell on our way to recreating the drug epidemic of the 1960's and \n1970's.\n  There are some people who seem to welcome this development. The \nfinancier, Mr. Soros, is spending some of his fortune to promote drug \nlegalization. He has convinced others to join him. He has a lobbying \ngroup that uses funds to promote legalization in the States, \ninternationally, and to give the idea intellectual legitimacy. He is \njoined in the argument to make drugs legal and therefore available by \nworthies like Milton Friedman and William F. Buckley, Jr. Hollywood, \nTV, and our recording industry recognize the market potential of this \nand have begun pushing drugs in movies, music, and entertainment.\n  Now, many of these people will tell you that they don't mean to sell \ndrugs to our kids. They mean it for adults. I have a problem with that, \nbut it's not the central concern. The chief problem is, few adults \nactually start using drugs. That's a risky behavior we find almost \nexclusively among young people before the age of 20. By divorcing this \nreality from the argument to legalize, these people are little \ndifferent from tobacco company executives. At least, privately, the \ntobacco companies were prepared to acknowledge that the primary market \nfor new smokers was teens and preteens. They did not hide behind polite \nfictions and intellectual smoke screens.\n  What we are seeing in my State today and across this country is the \nfruits of these labors. The most recent reports on teenage drug use \ncontinue a disturbing cycle. That is why I began work to fight back. \nWhile I think there are many things government can and must do to deal \nwith this problem, it is not solely or even wholly something that \ngovernment can do. We need parents, schools, business, and other folks \nat the community level engaged in dealing with this problem. We need to \nbe doing a lot more. This is not just a money problem. Resources are \nnecessary but they are not sufficient. This is a people problem and we \nneed to engage people to fight back. If we don't we are going to find \nourselves in a drug problem every bit as serious as our last one. We \nare perilously close to that now.\n  In closing, let me read something that Ben Stein, host of a TV game \nshow, wrote recently about his young son. He took him to what he \nthought was a safe retreat in rural Idaho, far from his native Los \nAngeles, for a summer vacation. What he discovered there was that his \n11-year-old was being exposed to drug use every day. The source of that \nwas other kids. The users and pushers were kids telling kids that drugs \nwere cool. After all, that was the message everywhere. They were also \nproviding the drugs. Stein wrote how it made him feel:\n\n       I don't like being under siege about my boy's future. . . . \n     I wish I had some help here from my Hollywood, my home, my \n     workshop. I'd like some help from ``The Simpsons'' and \n     ``South Park'' in telling my son that dope smoking is for \n     losers and fools, that being high is stupid and unnatural and \n     unhealthy, and that the cool people take life as it comes, \n     sober and healthy and in some control of their own destinies.\n\n  There are a lot more people out there under siege. We need to be \ndoing something about that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the bankruptcy bill, \nS. 1301.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nfor up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I say to my good friend, Senator \nGrassley, I was here for most of his speech and discussion. I commend \nhim for not only what he said today, which many, many people ought to \nread, but because of his constant effort in the Senate and, obviously, \nback in his home State directed at trying to get our young people some \nhelp with reference to this siege that is upon them with reference to \nillegal drugs. I commend the Senator from Iowa for it.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2503 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, over the course of the past several \nmonths, I have come to the Senate floor on three occasions to discuss \nwhat I believe is the most important national security challenge we \nface today--reducing the risks associated with the spread and potential \nuse of weapons of mass destruction. The depth and urgency of this \nchallenge were dramatically illustrated in a recent article from \nScientific American by Drs. Bruce Blair, Harold Feiveson, and Frank von \nHippl. I am quoting from that article:\n\n       [M]ilitary technicians at a handful of radar stations \n     across northern Russia saw a troubling blip suddenly appear \n     on their screens. A rocket, launched from somewhere off the \n     coast of Norway, was rising rapidly through the night sky. \n     Well aware that a single missile from a U.S. submarine plying \n     those waters could scatter eight nuclear bombs over Moscow \n     within 15 minutes, the radar operators immediately alerted \n     their superiors. The message passed swiftly from Russian \n     military authorities to the Russian President, who holding \n     the electronic case that could order the firing of nuclear \n     missiles in response, hurriedly conferred by telephone with \n     his top advisors. For the first time ever, that nuclear \n     briefcase was activated for emergency use.\n       For a few tense minutes, the trajectory of the mysterious \n     rocket remained unknown to the worried Russian officials. \n     Anxiety mounted when the separation of multiple rocket stages \n     created an impression of a possible attack by several \n     missiles. But the radar crews continued to track their \n     targets, and just a few minutes short of the procedural \n     deadline to respond to an impending nuclear attack, senior \n     military officers determined that the rocket was headed far \n     out to sea and posed no threat to Russia.\n\n  As I noted, this chilling excerpt was not taken from Tom Clancy's \nlatest techno-thriller. It happened. The event described did not occur \nduring the heart of the Cold War. It happened January 25, 1995. It was \nnot an isolated incident. According to public sources, Russian nuclear \nmissiles have automatically switched to launch mode several times.\n  A look at the record since the January 25, 1995 incident demonstrates \nthat, if anything, our concerns about Russia's early warning system, \ncommand and control system, and the morale of the people assigned to \noperate these systems, have only grown. That record is clear. No longer \nshould anyone believe Russia's nuclear forces are exempt from the \nneglect and disarray that has been experienced by her conventional \nforces. A leading member of the Russian parliament, Lev Rokhlin, best \nsummed up this deterioration: ``[Russia's] strategic nuclear forces are \nheaded for extinction. There are no means to maintain the forces.'' The \ndramatic economic downturn in Russia's economic circumstances will only \nexacerbate this situation. Some may be tempted to take joy in this \nsituation. They should not. As the event of January 25, 1995 reminds \nus, U.S. security is dependent on the reliability of Russia's strategic \nwarning and launch control systems.\n  Reasonable people can only ask the obvious question: with the Soviet \nUnion dissolved and the cold war over\n\n[[Page S10654]]\n\nfor nearly seven years, how can the United States and Russia continue \nto be one bad call away from a nuclear disaster?\n  It is precisely for this reason that last September I sent a letter \nto the Congressional Budget Office asking them to assess the budget and \nsecurity consequences of a series of measures designed to reduce the \nspread of nuclear weapons and the likelihood that they will ever be \nused. On Friday I received preliminary results from CBO on one means to \naccomplish this objective--improving Russia's confidence that it is not \nunder attack by providing it with a global awareness of missile \nlaunches.\n  CBO reaches several conclusions in its report. First, there are a \nnumber of deficiencies in Russia's ground- and satellite-based early-\nwarning systems. According to CBO, ``Russia's early warning radars will \nnot detect all missile attacks, especially missiles launched on shallow \ntrajectories from submarines.'' The situation is similar with respect \nto Russia's space-based platforms. Quoting CBO, ``Russia's satellite-\nbased early-warning system also has shortcomings . . . CBO has \nestimated that its [satellite] fleet currently provides coverage of the \nU.S. missile fields for less than 17 hours a day. Thus, Russia cannot \ndepend on its fleet to detect a U.S. missile launch.'' Second, CBO \nstates that, ``shortcomings in Russia's early-warning system can have a \ndirect effect on the security of the United States.'' Nothing \ndemonstrates this reality better than the Norwegian missile launch. \nThird, there are a variety of options available to the United States \nand Russia to address deficiencies in Russia's early warning system. \nAlthough CBO rightly asserts that further study is required to ensure \nthat U.S. security is enhanced, not compromised, CBO lays out 5 options \nfor U.S. policymakers. I ask that all of my colleagues take a look at \nthis excellent study.\n  It must be noted at this point that during the recently concluded \nU.S.-Russia summit, just days before CBO released its analysis to me, \nthe Administration and the Russians reached agreement to implement the \nfirst of CBO's 5 options--sharing early warning information on the \nlaunch of ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles. I commend the \nAdministration for this initiative. I believe it is a small but useful \nstep. However, it does not fully address the underlying weaknesses in \nRussia's early warning systems. The proposal will give the Russians \naccess to some of our early warning data but does nothing to improve \nRussia's own ability to collect and assess this same information.\n  Therefore, much more needs to be done, not only in the area of early \nwarning but elsewhere, if we are to reduce the risk of the spread and \nuse of weapons of mass destruction to an acceptable level. As I stand \nhere today--nearly 8 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \nend of the Cold War--the United States and Russia still possess nearly \n14,000 strategic nuclear weapons and tens of thousands of tactical \nnuclear weapons. Even more alarming, both sides keep the vast majority \nof their strategic weapons on a high level of alert, greatly increasing \nthe likelihood of an unauthorized or accidental launch.\n  Russia's current economic and fiscal woes only add to my sense of \nconcern. Numerous press accounts point out that Russia's early warning \nsensors are aging and incomplete, its command and control system is \ndeteriorating, and the morale of the personnel operating these systems \nis suffering as a result of lack of pay and difficult working \nconditions. The Washington Post ran an article just yesterday that \nillustrates how increasingly dire economic circumstances in Russia \naffect U.S. security. According to the Post, street protests are \npopping up all over Russia, including a town called Snezhinsk, home of \na nuclear weapons laboratory where workers said they have not been paid \nfor 5 months.\n  I believe reducing the risks posed by weapons of mass destruction in \nRussia and elsewhere must be our number one national security objective \nin the post-Cold War era. In this regard, there are 3 initiatives the \nUnited States could take immediately that begin to address these risks: \nde-alerting a portion of the U.S. and Russian strategic and nuclear \nweapons, ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and pushing for \nmuch deeper reductions in nuclear weapons than currently contemplated \nin START II.\n  However, these measures alone are not enough. We must vigorously \npursue other possible avenues, many of which may lie outside the \ntraditional arms control process. Therefore, I have asked the \nCongressional Budget Office to explore the budgetary and security \nimplications of numerous other ``non-traditional'' proposals. I \nunderstand this work is nearing completion and hope to report back to \nthe Senate on CBO's findings before we adjourn. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and the Administration in the next session \nof Congress to fully explore these proposals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10653-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has \nreported that for the week ending September 11 that the U.S. imported \n8,694,000 barrels of oil each day, 667,000 barrels a day less than the \n9,371,000 imported during the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly \nless foreign oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied \non foreign oil for 58 percent of their needs last week.

During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign \noil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in \nthe United States, if and when, foreign producers shut off our supply--\nor double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the \nUnited States: now 8,694,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately \n$104,154,120 a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10654-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10654-S10656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SECRETARY OF EDUCATION DICK RILEY'S ``BACK TO SCHOOL'' ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on September 15, 1998, at the National \nPress Club, Secretary of Education Dick Riley, delivered an impressive \n``Back to School'' Address on the state of education in the nation.\n  No one has been more thoughtful and effective in the effort to \nimprove public schools for all children. I believe all of us will be \ninterested in seeing this important address, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n\n  The Challenge for America: A High Quality Teacher in Every Classroom\n\n       Good afternoon. At the beginning of every school year, I \n     have the good fortune to come to the National Press Club to \n     give my ``Back to School'' address. I have been traveling \n     from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest as part of my annual \n     back to school push, and I can tell you that America's \n     schools are overflowing with children. It is an exciting time \n     for children and parents; but in too many cases our schools \n     are overcrowded, wearing out and in desperate need of \n     modernization.\n       As I noted in our annual report on the ``baby-boom echo'' \n     which we released last week, we are once again breaking the \n     national enrollment record. There are currently 52.7 million \n     young people in school and more on the way. And in the next \n     ten\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\n     years we will need to recruit 2.2 million teachers to teach \n     them.\n       This is why I believe that the education of our children \n     should be this nation's number one national priority in this \n     time of peace and prosperity. I also believe that this is the \n     patriotic thing to do as well.\n       Like many of you I had the opportunity to see the movie, \n     ``Saving Private Ryan.'' It is a wonderful movie that \n     acknowledges the sacrifice of a generation of Americans who \n     did their duty in World War II. Tom Hanks plays Captain \n     Miller, an English teacher, who does what he has to do, even \n     at the risk of his own life. I believe that the new patriots \n     of our time will be those Americans, young and old, who go \n     into teaching to educate this generation of children.\n       And I will tell you this--as I travel around the country, \n     parents tell me again and again that they have very clear \n     priorities about what we should be doing here in Washington. \n     They want safe schools, our help in building new schools and \n     modernizing old ones, smaller classes, and the assurance that \n     there is a good teacher in every classroom. This is the \n     nation's business and we need to get on with it.\n       If Congress is serious about getting dollars to the \n     classrooms, I urge them to enact our legislation to modernize \n     our schools and reduce class size by hiring 100,000 new \n     teachers. Rearranging existing programs, which seems to be \n     the intent of the Congress, does nothing to address the real \n     challenges facing schools today. In addition, Congress should \n     fund the President's initiatives in the Appropriations bill \n     that they are now considering.\n       The focus of my speech is on what we must do to prepare the \n     next generation of teachers and this is why I am releasing a \n     report today entitled ``Promising Practices'' which \n     highlights new ways that we can improve teacher quality. This \n     publication was developed following a national search for \n     models of excellence that address the needs at every stage of \n     a teacher's career.\n       In preparing my remarks I have had the good advice of three \n     members of my staff--two former National Teachers of the \n     Year--Terry Dozier and Mary Beth Blegen--as well as that of \n     Paul Schwarz, the former principal of a nationally recognized \n     high school--Central Park East in New York City. Like all \n     good teachers Terry, Mary Beth and Paul have clear opinions \n     about how we can improve American education. In other words, \n     they do not mince words. So I won't either.\n\n\n              Missing the Mark in Recruiting New Teachers\n\n       I am concerned that we are missing the mark when it comes \n     to preparing the next generation of teachers. We do not seem \n     to recognize the magnitude of the task ahead. In the next ten \n     years, we need to recruit 2.2 million teachers. One-half to \n     two-thirds of these teachers will be first time teachers.\n       We have more than a million veteran teachers on the verge \n     of retiring. The first chart attached to my speech makes this \n     point very vividly. By my reckoning, we are about five years \n     away from a very dramatic change in our teaching force.\n       The vast majority of these experienced teachers who are \n     about to retire are women. This, in fact, may be the last \n     generation of women who went into teaching because there were \n     limited opportunities in other fields. In 1998, women have \n     many more career options--and that is a very good thing for \n     our nation. These new opportunities for women will require \n     us, then, to work much, much harder to recruit and train a \n     new generation of teachers.\n       Many people ask me whether we have a teacher shortage. My \n     answer is yes. We face a shortage of high quality teachers. \n     We are already seeing spot shortages developing in specific \n     fields of expertise--math, science, special education and \n     bilingual education. The recent news that New York City \n     recruited math teachers from Austria highlights this growing \n     dynamic.\n       School districts usually find a way to put somebody in \n     front of every classroom, and that is the problem. Too many \n     school districts are sacrificing quality for quantity to meet \n     the immediate demand of putting a warm body in front of a \n     classroom. This is a mistake. Even now, too many school \n     districts are issuing emergency licenses.\n       Many of these emergency teachers are dedicated and want to \n     do their best. But I have heard about and read too many \n     horror stories about provisional teachers who are teaching by \n     the seat of their pants with no preparation and no guidance.\n       The coming wave of retirements has enormous implications in \n     our continuing effort to raise standards, to develop \n     successful recruitment strategies, and prepare new teachers. \n     We also need to recognize that the teaching profession is \n     dramatically changing--the use of computers, teaching in \n     teams, and the recognition that children learn in many \n     different ways--are just three of the many factors reshaping \n     this demanding profession.\n       Three other dynamics also require our attention: the \n     increasing diversity of our classrooms and the lack of \n     diversity of our teaching force; the increasing number of \n     special education children and Limited English Proficient \n     (LEP) children in the regular classroom and teachers who lack \n     the training to teach them; and the need for many more \n     incentives to keep veteran teachers up-to-date and in the \n     classroom.\n\n\n                     what is wrong with the system\n\n       I believe we also need to take a hard look at the very \n     structure of our current teaching system and get on with the \n     task of modernizing it as well. We cannot allow an outdated \n     teaching system to frustrate and even destroy the hopes and \n     dreams of too many teachers.\n       The task is multi-dimensional. For example, too many \n     teacher education programs are focused on theory and not \n     enough on clinical experience.\n       Also, the current certification process is a cumbersome \n     obstacle course that has little to do with excellence and \n     much more to do with filling out paperwork.\n       And once a new teacher enters the classroom we allow a \n     perverse ``sink or swim'' approach to define the first years \n     in teaching. New teachers are usually assigned the most \n     difficult classes in addition to all the extra-curricular \n     activities that no one else wants to supervise. Then we \n     wonder why we lose 22% of new teachers in the first three \n     years--and close to 50% in our urban areas.\n       This churning process and over-reliance on emergency \n     teachers just doesn't cut it in my opinion. Imagine the \n     outcry if a quarter of all new doctors left the profession \n     after their first three years. This is why I encourage local \n     school districts to develop some type of long-term induction \n     or mentoring program to help new teachers stay in the \n     profession.\n\n\n                    creating a national partnership\n\n       Education, as I have said many times before, is a state \n     responsibility, a local function and a national priority. We \n     cannot address the task at hand in a piecemeal fashion. We \n     need a nationwide partnership among K-12 leaders, our higher \n     education community, and political leaders at all levels.\n       Now a great deal of effort has gone into improving and \n     supporting the teaching profession in the last decade. The \n     National Commission on Teaching led by Governor Jim Hunt of \n     North Carolina and Linda Darling Hammond has provided an \n     excellent ``road map'' to improve the teaching profession. \n     This is all to the good. But now we need to make things \n     happen and go to a new level of intensity.\n       And I assure you--we will place a very strong emphasis on \n     teacher quality when we ask the Congress to reauthorize the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act next year. The \n     bipartisan leaders of the Congressional education committee \n     understand that need, and we will be working with them to \n     shape that legislation.\n\n\n                         improving recruitment\n\n       There are other steps we can take now to encourage more \n     Americans to enter the teaching profession.\n       The Clinton Administration strongly supports the Feinstein-\n     Boxer Amendment to the Higher Education Act that will provide \n     Pell Grants for a fifth year to those college students who \n     want to become teachers and need another year to meet state \n     fifth year requirements. This is particularly important to \n     the state of California which has the daunting task of \n     recruiting 250,000 teachers in the next decade.\n       I am pleased that strong support is developing in the \n     Congress for improvements in teacher education and standards. \n     The Administration will continue to press the Congress to \n     pass our proposals to recruit nearly 35,000 teachers over the \n     next five years for underserved areas. As members meet today \n     to advance this higher education legislation, I urge them to \n     support our recruitment proposals.\n       This important piece of legislation will almost certainly \n     include valuable new teacher loan forgiveness provisions that \n     have been championed by Senator Kennedy.\n       I also urge Congress to fund the President's initiative to \n     train new teachers in technology.\n       I support the creation of some type of national job bank to \n     match teachers with districts with a growing shortage of \n     quality teachers. There are wide regional variations in the \n     need for teachers. We can do a lot to help get teachers in \n     different parts of the country matched with school districts \n     in other regions that are facing growing shortages.\n       At the same time, the increasing mobility of Americans is \n     going to require states and school districts to take a \n     serious look at the portability of teacher credentials, their \n     years in service, and pensions. We do not need artificial \n     shortages developing because states have not brought their \n     policies up-to-date.\n       Our federal efforts to enlist millions of Americans to go \n     into teaching can have an impact. Our best hope, however, is \n     the strong encouragement of parents and grandparents whose \n     lives have been touched by good teachers. I get distressed \n     when I hear stories about parents discouraging their \n     children from going into teaching. Teaching is about \n     serving your country and being patriotic.\n       I also challenge the myth that teaching is only for those \n     who can't cut it in other professions. Anyone who has ever \n     spent an hour in a classroom full of demanding second graders \n     or had the challenge of motivating a group of teenagers knows \n     how difficult the job can be.\n       America's teachers are some of the most idealistic and \n     patriotic Americans in this country. I am extremely proud of \n     them. So many of them have entered teaching because they want \n     to change the world and many of them do.\n       What are our other challenges?\n\n\n           challenges to america's higher education community\n\n       I challenge the leaders of America's great colleges and \n     universities to make teacher\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\n     education a much higher day-to-day priority. Teaching \n     teachers has to be the mission of the entire university.\n       Our nation's colleges of education can no longer be quiet \n     backwaters that get a mere mention in the annual report to \n     university trustees. College administrators who complain \n     about the high cost of remedial classes would do well to pay \n     more attention to how they prepare teachers. Here several \n     suggestions come to mind.\n       First, colleges of education should give basic skills tests \n     to students entering teacher education programs prior to \n     their acceptance and at the same time hold themselves more \n     accountable for their graduates. This is why I endorse the \n     thrust for accountability by Senator Bingaman and \n     Representative George Miller.\n       Second, stronger links must be developed between our \n     colleges of arts and sciences and colleges of education. \n     Future teachers should major in the subject they want to \n     teach, and that type of course work takes place in the \n     colleges of arts and sciences.\n       Third, I urge teacher prep programs to put a much stronger \n     focus on giving future teachers rigorous grounding in \n     developing the skills they need to teach. It is harder than \n     you think. Knowing your content is not enough. There is a \n     skill and a craft to it all, and that is especially true when \n     it comes to teaching reading. This is why I believe that \n     every teacher who is seeking a certificate in elementary \n     education should have solid preparation in reading.\n       One of the major aspects of the reading bill now up in the \n     Congress is strong support for increased professional \n     development for reading. I support this effort and ask the \n     Congress to pass this needed legislation. We will never raise \n     standards if we just stay with the status quo when it comes \n     to improving literacy.\n       Fourth, colleges of education need to recognize that our \n     special education and LEP populations are growing and deserve \n     much more of their attention as they prepare teachers.\n       Finally, I urge colleges and universities to develop much \n     stronger links with local schools. The El Paso school \n     district, which we feature in our report ``Promising \n     Practices,'' has dramatically improved its test scores by \n     working hand-in-hand with the University of Texas in El Paso \n     to improve teacher education.\n\n\n       challenges to state government and local school districts\n\n       State governments and local school districts have a \n     powerful role to play in reshaping the teaching profession.\n       This is why I challenge every state to create a demanding \n     but flexible certification process. Becoming a teacher should \n     not be an endurance test that requires future teachers to \n     overcome a bureaucratic maze of hoops and paperwork.\n       I believe a much stronger focus should be placed on \n     assessing the knowledge and skills of future teachers however \n     they got them. This is why I support rigorous alternative \n     pathways to teaching which can be so helpful in recruiting \n     mid-career professionals to the teaching profession.\n       I challenge every state to eliminate the practice of \n     granting emergency licenses within the next five years. You \n     cannot set standards and then immediately discard them when \n     the need for another warm body arises. New York State has \n     taken the lead in doing away with emergency licenses and \n     other states should follow this good example.\n       At the same time, we cannot challenge high poverty schools \n     to raise their standards and then shortchange them by doing \n     nothing to help them recruit the best teachers. This is why \n     we are pushing the Congress to pass our strong teacher \n     recruitment initiative. At the same time, our nation's urban \n     areas have to do their part as well. Outdated hiring \n     practices sometimes seem to be the reason that they are \n     losing good candidates for teaching positions to suburban \n     school districts.\n       State and local school districts must also end the practice \n     of teaching ``out of field.'' (Over 30 percent of all math \n     teachers, for example, are now teaching out of field.) I \n     believe that every teacher, at a minimum, should have a minor \n     in the subject that they teach.\n       I cannot even begin to tell you how baffled foreign \n     education ministers are who visit me when I explain our \n     unusual habit of allowing teachers to teach ``out of field.''\n\n\n                    incentives for veteran teachers\n\n       As we seek to raise standards for our students, we need to \n     work much harder at giving veteran teachers the opportunity \n     to keep on learning. Current professional development courses \n     with their emphasis on workshops that put a premium on ``seat \n     time'' really need to become a thing of the past.\n       We are developing more and more evidence that school \n     districts that invest in quality professional development for \n     their teachers see positive results in the classroom. The \n     good work of Tony Alvarado in District 2 in New York City, \n     who made sure learning new skills was an everyday experience \n     for his teachers is a wonderful national model.\n       We need other incentives as well. The current system of \n     providing salary increases for credits earned seems flawed. \n     There is often no connection between the credits earned by a \n     teacher and what he or she actually teaches in the classroom. \n     And, there is little incentive to encourage teachers to gain \n     more knowledge or improve specific skills for their \n     classrooms. Excellence, in a word, is not rewarded.\n       Only 14 states, for example, currently provide salary \n     supplements to those teachers who set out to become master \n     teachers through the National Board Certification process. As \n     a result many of the best teachers leave the classroom to get \n     a bigger paycheck as a school administrator.\n       This is why I ask states and local school districts to take \n     a good look at a new and developing concept called \n     ``knowledge and skill-based pay.'' Put simply, teachers are \n     paid extra for new skills and knowledge they acquire. \n     Teachers under this system get rewarded for specific skills \n     and knowledge that help a school reach its own established \n     goals.\n       Now, a word about teacher salaries. As I have said many \n     times before, we cannot expect to get good teachers on the \n     cheap. Mary Beth Blegen, the national teacher of the year in \n     1996, was being paid a $36,000 salary with 30 years of \n     experience--a fraction of what she deserved--and what other \n     professionals expect after years in service.\n       If we are going to entice more Americans to enter teaching \n     we need to offer them fair and competitive salaries. And, if \n     we are going to ask teachers to meet new and demanding \n     standards we also need to pay them for their effort.\n       States like Connecticut and North Carolina have had the \n     good sense to raise standards for teachers and raise salaries \n     at the same time. The results in the classroom are promising. \n     I believe every state would be wise to follow their good \n     example.\n       If we really want to recruit and retain good teachers we \n     need to let them teach in first class school buildings. What \n     kind of message do we send our children and our teachers when \n     we ask them to go to a run down school building just a mile \n     down the road from an immaculate prison? President Clinton \n     has proposed a very strong school construction initiative. \n     Congress needs to get off the dime and pass it.\n       In this speech, I have challenged many different groups to \n     come forward and join a national partnership for excellence \n     in teaching. It seems appropriate to end my remarks by taking \n     a moment to talk to America's teachers. You are the heart and \n     soul of the renaissance of American education. As I travel \n     throughout the country, I have the opportunity to meet many \n     of you. Each time I am struck by how important, yet how \n     difficult, your job is.\n       As teachers, you are being asked to know more and do more \n     than ever before. Please continue your good work and go out \n     of your way to recruit new teachers. Let others know the joy \n     you get from teaching. Help the struggling teacher to \n     improve--and help to counsel out of the profession those who \n     cannot. And make the effort to measure yourselves against the \n     best.\n       I end now with a quote from an old friend of mine from \n     South Carolina, the writer Pat Conroy. This quote is from his \n     novel ``Prince of Tides.'' In this passage, Tom, a teacher \n     who is the main character of the book is asked why he chose \n     to ``sell himself short'' when he was so talented and could \n     have done anything in his life.\n       Tom's reply goes like this, ``There's no word in the \n     language that I revere more than `teacher.' '' None. ``My \n     heart sings'' he says, ``when a kid refers to me as his \n     teacher and it always has. I've honored myself and the entire \n     family of man by becoming a teacher.''\n       With that I thank all teachers on behalf of the American \n     people. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10654-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Child \nCustody Protection Act. Nearly half the States have adopted laws which \nrequire some kind of parental involvement in their minor daughter's \ndecision to have an abortion. Increasingly, these laws are being \nundermined by adults who take a pregnant girl across State lines for a \nsecret abortion.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act will make it a Federal offense for \nsomeone, other than the minor girl's parent, to transport her knowingly \nacross State lines in order to usurp her home State's abortion parental \nnotification or consent laws. It does not impose any new parental \nnotification or consent requirements on any State. It merely prevents \nthe undermining of parental involvement laws in States that have them.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act is a parental rights bill. It \nprevents the circumvention of State laws, a policy all of us should \nsupport. It protects our daughters against manipulation and abuse. I \nurge the support of this legislation by all of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10656-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10656-S10657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment over the Senate's failure to override the President's \nveto of legislation which would ban the inhumane procedure known as \npartial-birth abortion.\n  A majority of the Congress agrees that the partial-birth abortion ban \nis\n\n[[Page S10657]]\n\nnot about the politics of pro-life and pro-choice. It is legislation \nthat addresses a far more fundamental issue--our intolerance, as a \ncivilized community, to allow this unparalleled cruelty to continue.\n  I thank Senator Santorum for his heartfelt dedication and \ndetermination to making this issue a priority for the Senate this \nsession. His sincere, passionate speeches delivered during floor debate \nspoke directly to the hearts of his colleagues and to the American \npeople.\n  This is the second time the Senate has voted on an override of a \nClinton veto of a prohibition on partial-birth abortion. The will of \nboth Houses of Congress, and of the American people is clear. I am \ndedicated to passing the partial-birth abortion ban, as I know are most \nof my colleagues in the Senate. We will continue this fight until we \nhave succeeded, and I urge the Senate leadership to make the ban on \npartial-birth abortions the first piece of legislation we take up in \nthe 106th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10656-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                    enrolled joint resolution signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 18, 1998, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled joint resolution:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to provide for \nprotection of certain original designs; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             The Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1998\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill \ncosponsored by Senators Mack and Faircloth entitled the Vessel Hull \nDesign Protection Act of 1998. This bill will attempt to stop a very \ntroubling problem facing America's marine manufacturers--the \nunauthorized copying of boat hull designs. Such piracy threatens the \nintegrity of the United States marine manufacturing industry and the \nsafety of American boaters.\n  A boat manufacturer invests significant resources in creating a safe, \nstructurally sound, high performance boat hull design from which a line \nof vessels can be manufactured. Standard practice calls for \nmanufacturing engineers to create a hull model, or ``plug'', from which \nthey cast a ``mold''. This mold is then used for mass production of \nboat hulls. Unfortunately, those intent on pirating such a design can \nsimply use a finished boat hull to develop their own mold. This copied \nmold can then be used to manufacture boat hulls identical in appearance \nto the original line, and at a cost well below that incurred by the \noriginal designer.\n  This so-called ``hull splashing'' is a significant problem for \nconsumers, manufacturers, and boat design firms. American consumers are \ndefrauded in the sense that they do not benefit from the many aspects \nof the original hull design that contribute to its structural integrity \nand safety, and they are not aware that the boat they have purchased \nhas been copied from an existing design. Moreover, if original \nmanufacturers are undersold by these copies, they may no longer be \nwilling to invest in new, innovative boat designs--boat designs that \ncould provide safer, less expensive, quality watercraft for consumers.\n  In the past, a number of States have enacted anti-boat-hull-copying, \nor ``plug mold'', statutes to address the problem of hull splashing. \nThese States include my State of Louisiana, as well as Alabama, \nCalifornia, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, \nTennessee, and Wisconsin. However, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141 (1989), \ninvalidated these State statutes on the basis that they infringed on \nthe federal government's exclusive jurisdiction over the protection of \nintellectual property. In essence, the Supreme Court held that vessel \nhull design protection may be a legitimate goal, but it is Congress' \njob to provide it, not the States. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday is designed to do that job.\n  Such initiatives as this one are not new to Congress. In 1984, \nCongress acted to protect the unique nature of design work when it \npassed the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act. This act was designed to \nprotect the mask works of semiconductor chips, which are essentially \nthe molds from which\n\n[[Page S10658]]\n\nthe chips are made, against unauthorized duplication. I believe that \nthe approach Congress took in that legislation should also be applied \nto protect boat hull designs. The Boat Protection Act of 1998 would \nwork in concert with current federal law to protect American marine \nmanufacturers from harmful and unfair competition.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to take note of the fact that an \nidentical bill, H.R. 2696, has already been passed in the House of \nRepresentatives by unanimous consent. I want to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1998 and to join in \nthis effort to protect the American public and the marine manufacturing \ncommunity from the dangers and impropriety of hull splashing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2502\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Presidential Commission to determine \nthe validity of certain land claims arising out of the Treaty of \nGuadalupe-Hidalgo of 1848 involving the descendants of persons who were \nMexican citizens at the time of the Treaty; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n        Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Equity Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the bill I am introducing today is the \nfirst step in addressing a longstanding unfairness that has blemished \nthe conscience of New Mexico's history. It is an injustice that dates \nback to the time when Jefferson Davis, Daniel Webster, and Sam Houston \nwalked the Halls of the Capitol as Senators.\n  In 1848, the United States signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo \nwith Mexico. Under this treaty, the United States acquired the \nterritory that is now California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, \nColorado, and Wyoming. The Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo solved some \nproblems but created others. It failed to adequately protect the civil \nand property rights of the people living in the newly annexed \nterritory.\n  This bill is a very important piece of legislation. It is the \nopportunity to reverse the heritage of ill-will between the Hispanic \npeople and the Federal Government. Hispanic descendants have been \nwaiting for 150 years to get the Federal Government to fairly look into \nthe land grant situation.\n  We ratified a treaty with property rights guarantees provisions \nwhich, in retrospect, have turned out to be inadequate. John R. Van \nNess, described the treaty as an enormous real estate deal, but the \nland grant claimants were led to believe that their property rights \nwould be honored and protected. Some officials with the Federal \nGovernment, on the other hand, expected to get clear title to most of \nthe land it was paying for regardless of the existing property rights \nof the Mexicans.\n  The land grant applicants have endured hostile government officials. \nAt one point, President Cleveland appointed William Andrew Sparks, as \nsurveyor general for New Mexico. Sparks has been described by \nhistorians as ``steeped in prejudice against New Mexico, its people and \ntheir property rights.'' We had corrupt lawyers, and a confederation of \nopportunists who used long legal battles to acquire empires that \nextended over millions of acres--all at the expense of Hispanics.\n  In 1891, the Surveyor General was replaced by the Court of Private \nLand Claims. The situation went from bad to worse because the court's \nprocedures heavily favored the Government and the result was injustice.\n  The New Mexico Court of Claims required that claimants prove that the \nSpanish or Mexican granting official had the legal authority to issue \nthe land grant. Consequently, many New Mexico land grants were held to \nbe not legitimate. As a result, the New Mexico court rejected two-\nthirds of the claims presented before it. Ultimately, by one account \nwritten by Richard Griswold del Castillo, only 82 grants received \ncongressional confirmation. This represented only 6 percent of the \ntotal area sought by land claimants. The Court of Private Land Claims \nenlarged the national domain of the Federal Government at the expense \nof hundreds of Hispanic villages, leaving a bitter legacy.\n  This bill is based on legislation recently passed by Congressman Bill\n\n[[Page S10662]]\n\nRedmond. This is a major piece of legislation, and I commend \nCongressman Redmond. He came to Washington, and he quickly identified \none of the most important and longstanding disputes that his \nconstituents have had with the Federal Government and he took decisive \naction. He passed a major bill to begin the process of seeing what \nthese claims were all about and adjudicating them, if possible.\n  Members retire from 20- and 30-year careers and never achieve the \npassage of an important piece of legislation, and yet, Congressman \nRedmond got this bill passed in the House in his first term.\n  Congressman Redmond's bill creates a Presidential commission to \nadjudicate the community land grants located in New Mexico. It is \ndesigned to benefit descendants of Mexican citizens who settled in Mew \nMexico before the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. The purpose of the \nlegislation is to determine which community land grants could be \nreconstituted from land currently held by the Federal Government--and I \nrepeat, from land currently held by the Federal Government. The \nlegislation finally implements the spirit of Treaty of Guadalupe-\nHidalgo.\n  I told Congressman Redmond that I would sponsor his bill in the \nSenate, and today I am introducing the companion bill. I am proud to do \nso.\n  I have made some changes and only a couple of additions in the \nversion of this bill that I am introducing today.\n  The changes are based on the lessons I have learned from talking to \nthe heirs of some of the land grants; and from reviewing the history; \nand from talking to scholars, historians, and land grant lawyers.\n  I want to thank Roberto Mondragon, Max Cordova, Estevan Arellano, \nJoyce Guerin, Georgia Roybal, Juan Sanchez, Pedro Gutierrez, Jr., and \nRoberto Torrez for their invaluable help.\n  I have also asked the Indian leaders to review the legislation in \ndraft form. While I have not yet received their comments, I want them \nto know that I view their issues to be important, and I look forward to \nworking with them and for them.\n  First, it seems to me that the Federal Government needs to take an \naffirmative role in obtaining the necessary documentation needed to \nprove the validity of the community land grant claims. Unfortunately, \nmany of the New Mexico documents were destroyed during the Pueblo \nrevolt. But scholars have told me that the Mexican and Spanish \ngovernments have ever-improving archives that may indeed contain what \nthese New Mexicans need. This bill requires the Secretary of State to \nnegotiate an agreement with Mexico and Spain for access to the \ndocuments. It seems especially appropriate that in 1998, as New Mexico \ncelebrates its 400th anniversary of the first Hispanic settlement, that \nour Government would begin negotiating the necessary agreements for \naccess to these critical and historically significant documents.\n  In reading the histories it seemed to me that there was a lot of \nambiguity in the treaty and even more ambiguity and discretion in the \nstatutes establishing the Surveyor General and the Court of Private \nLand Claims.\n  I believe history supports my view that ambiguity works to the \ndetriment of the land grant claimants. Therefore, I propose that before \nthe commission begin its work on adjudicating specific claims it first \ndevelop clear and concise rules so that everyone will be treated \nfairly. This legislation requires the Presidential commission to be \nformed and then to develop a Code of Land Claims Procedure that would \nbe reviewed by the Energy Committee to insure that it is fair in the \nSenate and its counterpart in the House.\n  Once the documents are available and the rules have been spelled out, \nthe commission would be ready to adjudicate the land claims.\n  Trying to do justice 150 years after the fact is complicated. This \nlegislation holds harmless private land owners and the Indians of New \nMexico with reference to their claims, their lands, and with reference \nto access to their sacred sites. It makes sure that title companies and \nlenders will be satisfied that this legislation and any petitions for \nreconstituting the land grants will not adversely affect private \nproperty. It makes sure that our State Engineer is satisfied with the \ncriteria used to deal with land claims without upsetting our system of \nwater rights. I believe we can all agree that we do not want to have \nthe Federal Government interfering in these various areas.\n  The legislation calls upon the commission in its Code of Land Claims \nProcedure to have a clear set of rules for what can and cannot be done \nfor our Indian people.\n  I am hopeful that this bill can address what has for too long been a \ntale of land loss and denial without creating new problems or \ninjustices.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and \na Spanish translation of my remarks appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2503\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--For purpose of this Act:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the \n     Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Commission established \n     under section 3.\n       (2) Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.--The term ``Treaty of \n     Guadalupe-Hidalgo'' means the treaty of Peace, Friendship, \n     Limits, and Settlement (Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo), between \n     the United States and the Republic of Mexico, signed February \n     2, 1848 (TS 207: 9 Bevans 791).\n       (3) Eligible Descendant.--The term ``eligible descendant'' \n     means a descendent of a person who--\n       (A) was a Mexican citizen before the Treaty of Guadalupe \n     Hidalgo;\n       (B) was a member of a community land grant; and\n       (C) became a United States citizen within ten years after \n     the effective date of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, May \n     30, 1848, pursuant to the terms of the Treaty.\n       (4) Community Land Grant.--The term ``community land \n     grant'' means a village, town, settlement, or pueblo \n     consisting of land held in common (accompanied by lesser \n     private allotments) by three or more families under a grant \n     from the King of Spain (or his representative) before the \n     effective date of the Treaty of Cordova, August 24, 1821, or \n     from the authorities of the Republic of Mexico before May 30, \n     1848, in what became the State of New Mexico, regardless of \n     the original character of the grant.\n       (5) Reconstituted.--The term ``reconstituted'', with regard \n     to a valid community land grant, means restoration to full \n     status as a municipality with rights properly belonging to a \n     municipality under State law and the right of local self-\n     government.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) New Mexico has a unique history regarding the \n     acquisition of ownership of land as a result of the \n     substantial number of Spanish and Mexican land grants that \n     were an integral part of the colonization and growth of New \n     Mexico before the United States acquired the area in the \n     Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n       (2) Various provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo \n     have not yet been fully implemented in the spirit of Article \n     VI, Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (3) Serious questions regarding the prior ownership of \n     lands in the State of New Mexico, particularly certain public \n     lands, still exist.\n       (4) Congressionally established land claim commissions have \n     been used in the past to successfully examine disputed land \n     possession questions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Sr. Presidente, el proyecto de ley que estoy \nintroduciendo hoy es el primer paso de progresion en corregir una \ninjusticia del antiguo que ha manchado la conciencia de la historia de \nNuevo Mejico. Es una injusticia que se remonta al tiempo en que \nJefferson Davis, Daniel Webster, y Sam Houston andaban en los pasillos \ndel Capitol como senadores.\n  En 1848, los Estados Unidos firmaron el Tratado de Guadalupe-Hidalgo \ncon Mejico. Con este tratado, los Estados Unidos adquirieron el \nterritorio que ahora es California, Nevada, Arizona, Nuevo Mejico, \nColorado, y Wyoming. [El Tratado de Guadalupe-Hidalgo soluciono algunos \nproblemas pero creo otros. No protegio adecuadamente los derechos \nciviles y de propiedad de la gente que vive en el territorio nuevamente \nanexado.]\n  Este proyecto de ley es un pedazo de legislacion muy importante. Es \nla oportunidad de invertir la herencia de la mala voluntad entre la \ngente hispanica y el gobierno federal. Los descendientes hispanicos han \nestado esperando 150 anos para inducir al gobierno federal para mirar \ncon justticia las concesiones de la tierra.\n  Ratificamos un tratado con las provisiones de las garantias de los \nderechos de propiedad que, en retrospeccion, han resultado ser \ninadecuadas. John R. Van Ness describio el tratado como reparto enorme \nde las propiedades inmobiliarias, pero condujeron a los demandantes de \nla concesion de la tierra a creer que los derechos de propiedad serian \nhonrados y protegidos. Algunos funcionarios con el gobierno federal, \npor otra parte, esperaban para obtener titulo claro a la mayoria de la \npista que lo pagaba, sin importar el derecho de propiedad existente de \nlos mejicanos.\n  Los demandantes de la concesion de la tierra han aguantado a \noficiales hostiles del gobierno. En una punta, el Presidente Cleveland \ndesigno Guillermo Andrew Sparks como el agrimensor general para Nuevo \nMejico. Sparks han sido descrito por los historiadores segun lo \n``empapado en prejudicar contra Nuevo Mejico, su gente, y los derechos \nde propiedad.'' Teniamos abogados corruptos y una confederacion de los \noportunistas que utilizaron batallas legales largas para adquirir los \nimperios de tierra que extendieron muchos millones acres--todos a \nexpensas de los hispanos.\n  En 1891, el Agrimensor General fue substituido de la Corte de las \nReclamaciones Privadas. La situacion fue de malo a peor porque los \nprocedimientos de la corte favorecieron fuertemente el gobierno. El \nresultado fue injusticia.\n  La Corte de Reclamaciones de Nuevo Mejico requirio que los \ndemandantes prueben que el funcionario espanol o mejicano que concedio \ntenia la autoridad legal para publicar la concesion de la tierra. Por \nlo tanto, muchas concesiones de la tierra de Nuevo Mejico fueron \nllevadas a cabo sin ser legitimas. Consecuentemente, la Corte de Nuevo \nMejico rechazo dos tercios de las reclamaciones presentadas. En ultima \ninstancia, por una cuenta escrita por Richard Griswold del Castillo, \nsolamente las concesiones del ochenta-y-dos recibieron la confirmacion \ndel Congreso. Esto represento solamente seis por ciento del area total \nbuscados de los demandantes. La Corte de las Reclamaciones Privadas de \nla Tierra agrando el dominio nacional del gobierno federal a expensas \nde los centenares de aldeas hispanicas, dejando una herencia amarga.\n  Esta proyecto de ley se basa en la legislacion aprobada recientemente \npor Congressman Bill Redmond. Este es un pedazo de legislacion \nimportante, y aplaudo Congressman Redmond. El vino a Washington, \nidentifico rapidamente uno de los conflictos mas importantes y de \nmuchos anos que sus componentes han tenido con el gobierno federal, y \nel tomo una accion decisiva--el aprobo una cuenta importante para \ncomenzar el proceso de juzgar estas reclamaciones.\n  Algunos miembros se jubilaron de 20- y 30 anos y nunca alcanzan el \npaso de legislacion importante, pero, Congressman Redmond consiguio la \naprobacion de esta cuenta en la Casa de Representantes en su primer \ntermino.\n  La cuenta de Congressman Redmond crea a una Comision Presidencial \npara juzgar las concesiones de la tierra de la comunidad situadas en \nNuevo Mejico. Se disena para beneficiar a descendientes de los \nciudadanos mejicanos que colocaron en Nuevo Mejico antes del Tratado de \nGudelupe-Hidalgo. El proposito de la legislacion es para determinarse \nque concesiones de la tierra de la comunidad se podrian reconstituir de \nla tierra tenida actualmente por el gobierno federal. La legislacion \nfinalmente pone el espiritu del Tratado de Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n  Dije a Congressman Redmond que patrocinaria su proyecto en el Senado, \ny estoy introduciendo hoy el proyecto del companero. Estoy orgulloso \nhacer tan.\n  He hecho muy pocos cambios y solamente un par de adiciones en la \nversion de este proyecto que estoy introduciendo hoy.\n  Los cambios se basan en las lecciones que he aprendido de hablar con \nlos herederos de algunas de las concesiones de la tierra; de repasar la \nhistoria; y de hablar con los eruditos, historiadores, y los abogados \nde la concesion de la tierra.\n  Deseo agradecer a Roberto Mondragon, Max Cordova, Estevan Arellano, \nJoyce Guerin, Georgia Roybal, Juan Sanchez, Pedro Gutierrez Jr., y \nRoberto Torrez por su ayuda inestimable.\n  Tambien he pedido los caudillos de los Indios para repasar el \nbosquejo, y mientras que yo todavia no he recibido sus comentarios, \nquisiera que supieran que creo que sus asuntos son muy importantes, y \nmiro adelante a trabajar con ellos.\n  Primero, me parecia que el gobierno federal necesita tomar un papel \nafirmativo en la obtencion de la documentacion necesaria para probar la \nvalidez de las concesiones de la tierra de la comunidad. \nDesafortunadamente, muchos de los documentos de Nuevo Mejico fueron \ndestruidos. Pero los eruditos me han dicho que los gobiernos mejicanos \ny espanoles tienen archivos siempre mejorando. Esta proyecto requiere a \nla secretaria del estado negociar un acuerdo con Mejico y Espana para \nel acceso a los documentos. Se parece especialmente apropiado que en \n1998, cuando Nuevo Mejico celebra su 400o aniversario del primer \nestablecimiento hispanico que nuestro gobierno comenzaria a negociar \nlos acuerdos necesarios para estos documentos criticos e historicamente \nsignificativos.\n  En la leyenda de las historias, me parecia que habia mucha ambiguedad \nen el tratado, y aun mas ambiguedad y discrecion en los estatutos que \nestablecian el agrimensor general y la corte de las reclamaciones \nprivadas de la tierra.\n  Creo que la historia sostiene mi opinion que la ambiguedad trabaje al \ndetrimento de los demandantes. Por lo tanto, propongo que antes de que \nla Comision comience su trabajo sobre el juicio de reclamaciones \nespecificas, primero se convierte reglas claras y sucintas por lo tanto \ncada uno sea tratado con justicia. Esta legislacion requiere a la \nComision presidencial ser formada y despues desarrollar un Codigo del \nProcedimiento de las Reclamaciones de la Tierra que seria repasado del \nComite de la Energia para asegurarse de que todo es justicia.\n  Cuando los documentos sean disponibles y se han explicado las reglas, \nla Comision serian listas para juzgar las reclamaciones de la tierra.\n  Tratar de hacer la justicia 150 anos despues del hecho es complicado. \nEsta legislacion sostiene inofensivos a propietarios privados de \ntierra. Se cerciora de que las companias de titulo y los prestamistas \nsean satisfechos que esta legislacion no afectara al contrario la \ncaracteristica privada. Se cerciora de que nuestro Ingeniero del\n\n[[Page S10665]]\n\nEstado este satisfecho con los criterios usados a encargar de las \ndemandas de la tierra sin trastornar nuestro sistema de los derechos \ndel agua. Creo que podemos todos convenir que no deseamos que el \ngobierno federal interfiera con nuestro sistema de los derechos del \nagua!\n  La legislacion requere a la Comision en su Codigo del Procedimiento \nde las Reclamaciones de la Tierra para tener una coleccion clara de \nreglas para lo que se pude hacer o no se puede hacer para los indios.\n  Estoy confiado que este proyecto que tiene demasiado tiempo sin dar \ncuenta de la perdida de la tierra y de la negacion se resolvera sin \ncrear nuevos problemas o injusticias.\n  Gracias, Sr. presidente.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S.J. Res. 56. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress in \nsupport of the existing Federal legal process for determining the \nsafety and efficacy of drugs, including marijuana and other Schedule I \ndrugs, for medicinal use; read the first time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. \n        Hatch):\n  S.J. Res. 57. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress in \nsupport of the existing Federal legal process for determining the \nsafety and efficacy of drugs, including marijuana and other Schedule I \ndrugs, for medicinal use; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n  expressing the sense of congress in support of the existing federal \n     legal process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send to the desk a joint resolution. \nThis joint resolution is being introduced with the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, who is now in the chair, to address \na very important issue. It is not an easy one to grasp on its face. \nThis is largely because of an effort by some to misrepresent the facts \nof the case. In offering this resolution and asking my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting and passing it, I would like to make some things \nvery clear.\n  What this resolution expresses is the sense of the Congress for \nsupporting existing procedures for determining the safety and efficacy \nof drugs made available to the public.\n  Specifically, it puts the Congress and the administration on record \nopposing the legalization of dangerous drugs such as marijuana, heroin, \nand LSD.\n  As we consider this language, we are likely to hear from many of the \ndrug legalization lobbies. They are going to try to misrepresent their \ntrue goals and the meaning of this resolution. We have already seen \nsome of these tactics in the House earlier this week. They are going to \ntell you that this resolution opposes sick people. They are going to \ntell you that they only want to make medicine available to the \ndesperately ill. They imply, of course, that the rest of us are opposed \nto helping the sick. But the agenda here is not about helping sick \npeople; it's about drug legalization.\n  Let's look at who's lobbying against our resolution. Since this is \nsupposed to be about medicine, who's lobbying Congress? It is not the \nAmerican Medical Association. It is not the American Psychiatric \nAssociation. It is not the American Cancer Society, the Glaucoma \nSociety, the American Pediatrics Association, or any professional \nassociation of treatment specialists and scientists. It is the Drug \nPolicy Foundation which opposes it, and the Marijuana Policy Project, \nthe magazine High Times, and the marijuana legalization lobby, NORML--\nthe National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. All of \nthese groups are drug legalization lobbies. And have been for years. \nNone of these groups are medical associations or have any scientific \nexpertise. What they rely on is anecdotes, scare tactics, and \nmisinformation. Now, what is the agenda here? Is the goal medicine or \nlegalization?\n  Their agenda and their goal is not medicine, but it is legalization \nof drugs.\n  Let me note who's supporting our resolution. It is the Nation's drug \nczar. It is Gen. Barry McCaffrey. It is national parent groups, like \nNational Families in Action and Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of \nAmerica. It is the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, or \nPRIDE. It is supported by virtually every anti-legalization group \nacross the country in every state in the Union. They know the answer to \nmy question.\n  But, let's consider another point. How do we normally make a \ndangerous drug with a high potential for abuse available as a \nlegitimate medicine? Normally we do so with scientific validation. We \ndo so by prescription. We control the quantities, the quality, and the \ndistribution. We do not permit self-diagnosis and treatment. We do not \nlicense private citizens to manufacture the drugs in their kitchens or \nbathrooms. But what is happening with the efforts to make marijuana and \nother Schedule I drugs legal?\n  In most states where this effort is afoot, there is no prescription \nrequirement. There is no scientific validation required. There are no \ncontrols and no supervision. People are authorized to grow marijuana, \nfor example, at home. They are authorized to self administer it in any \ndose for any length of time for any ailment they think necessary. This \ndoes not mean for the terminally ill or those with desperate \nconditions. It means for any condition, from migraines to athlete's \nfoot. Is this the way we treat Valium or anti-depressants? Is this the \nway we treat heart medicine or blood pressure medicine? Is this about \nmedicine or about legalization? The answer is all too clear.\n  Our resolution addresses the effort by the drug legalization lobby in \nthis country to get marijuana and other dangerous drugs on the streets, \nin our homes, and in our schools. These groups have been trying to do \nthis for years. Sadly, they have been somewhat successful.\n  They have failed because the public won't have anything to do with \nlegalization. The public overwhelmingly opposes efforts to legalize. \nKnowing this, the legalization lobby has hit upon a subterfuge to slip \nlegalization through by calling it a medicine. It is a cynical and \ndeceptive campaign.\n  What is being done here by these groups is to manipulate the public's \nconcerns for the desperately ill. In efforts across the country, well-\nfunded lobbying groups are promoting initiatives to declare marijuana \nand other dangerous drugs medicine. They are exploiting compassion to \npush their drug agenda. This effort is as fully sincere as anything we \nsaw from the tobacco companies in their efforts to sell cigarettes.\n  What our resolution does is to put the Congress and the \nadministration on record opposing this effort. We are taking this step \nto protect the present and future generations of young people from \nillegal drugs. The resolution passed the other body on Tuesday 310 to \n93. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nGeneral McCaffrey, the Nation's drug czar, to me. He endorses this \nresolution. The administration supports it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     review your proposed Joint Resolution regarding the medicinal \n     use of marijuana. The Office of National Drug Control Policy \n     applauds your continuing contribution to the nation's drug \n     policy. We at ONDCP offer our support for this important \n     resolution and urge the Senate to send a clear signal to \n     those who advocate for legalization of marijuana when the \n     resolution comes to the Floor for a vote.\n       State ballot initiatives that define marijuana as a \n     ``medicine'' fail to address the negative impact such \n     legislation would have on the health of our youth or the \n     nation's scientific process of approving medications. \n     Designating medicine through ballot initiatives would \n     undermine the long-established process which ensures that \n     substances provided to the American public as medicines have \n     undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny. This procedure \n     protects Americans from unproven, ineffective, or dangerous \n     treatments. Making an exception for marijuana would create a \n     dangerous precedent. Medicine must be based on science rather \n     than ideology.\n       Proponents of marijuana initiatives present marijuana as a \n     benign substances. However, the latest scientific evidence \n     demonstrates that marijuana is not. Smoked marijuana damages \n     the brain, heart, lungs,\n\n[[Page S10666]]\n\n     amd immune system. It impairs learning and interferes with \n     memory, preception and judgment. Smoked marijuana contains \n     cancer-causing components and has been implicated in a high \n     percentage of automobile crashes and workplace accidents.\n       As your resolution points out, marijuana is also associated \n     with behavior leading to more extensive drug use. \n     Legalization of marijuana as medicine sends a confusing \n     message to America's children at a time when drug use by \n     young people has increased at an alarming rate. The increase \n     in youth marijuana use has been fueled by a measurable \n     decrease in the proportion of young people who perceive \n     marijuana as dangerous.\n       Some Americans are unclear about what the scientific \n     research shows about the effects of marijuana. To clarify \n     this issue, ONDCP has commissioned a comprehensive study by \n     the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. It \n     is crucial that America tell the truth to our children about \n     the dangers of drug use. Toward that end, we congratulate you \n     and the other sponsors of this Joint Resolution.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Barry R. McCaffrey,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, drug use among kids is growing \ndramatically. In the last few years, after a decade of decline, drug \nuse is on the rise among 12- to 17-year-olds. The age for first use of \nillegal drugs has dropped. Today, the first-use of marijuana by 12- to \n17-year-olds is the highest since we've been keeping records. The same \nis true for cocaine, heroin, and hallucinogens. We need to be talking \nseriously about how to stop this. This is why we ask our colleagues to \nsupport our resolution.\n  I send that resolution to the desk. I send it to the desk and ask \nthat it be read for the first time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 56) expressing the sense of \n     Congress in support of the existing Federal legal process for \n     determining the safety and efficacy of drugs, including \n     marijuana and other Schedule I drugs, for medicinal use.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I now ask for its second reading, and I object to my \nown request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator \nGrassley and Senator Hatch, to introduce this joint resolution, which \npassed the House of Representatives last Tuesday by a vote of 310-93.\n  It has been endorsed by the administration's drug czar, Gen. Barry \nMcCaffrey, and is part of our legislative response to the recent and \nsignificant increases in drug use, especially among our young people. \nIt is this subject to which Senator Grassley spoke earlier this \nafternoon.\n  Before I explain what this resolution is about, let me explain how it \ncame about. In March of this year, Senator Grassley and I convened an \nantidrug legalization roundtable. Attendees included Bill Bennett, \nSenator Mack, and 21 other people representing the Drug Czar's Office, \ncivic groups, family groups and law enforcement officials. At that \nmeeting, we learned about efforts all across the country to legalize \ndrugs, including marijuana and other Schedule I drugs. Schedule I drugs \ninclude things not only like marijuana but LSD and heroin.\n  The groups asked why Congress, which, after all, enacts Federal drug \nlaws, and the administration, which enforces Federal drug laws, have \nbeen relatively silent in the face of these ever bolder attempts to \nlegalize drugs around the country. They urged us to step up to the \nplate and exert some leadership. They were correct in that request.\n  This joint resolution is but one step in the effort to demonstrate to \nour youth that the U.S. Congress strongly opposes drug abuse and \nefforts to legalize drugs. This resolution, I believe, will help send a \nvery clear message that so long as marijuana, heroin, LSD, and others \nremain Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, that \nFederal law should not be altered through adoption of statewide ballot \npropositions that would legalize these drugs.\n  Consider these statistics relating to drug use, especially among \nchildren: Marijuana use has more than doubled nationally since 1991. \nHeroin usage for 8th and 12th graders has more than doubled in the last \n5 years. A 1997 survey by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse \nat Columbia University showed that 500,000 8th graders began using \nmarijuana in the 6th and 7th grades. Even more alarming are the \nstatistics in my own State of Arizona, where one out of six youths has \nused illegal drugs within the past month. This is one-third higher than \nthe national average. Over 13 percent of Arizona children between the \nages of 12 and 17 said they have used marijuana in the past month. \nAlmost 17 percent admitted to having used any illicit drug, including \ncocaine, heroin, or inhalants, according to the National Household \nSurvey on Drug Abuse.\n  Attempts to legalize drugs by way of State ballot initiatives \ninhibits us from getting drugs out of our schools, out of our \nworkplaces, and out of our communities.\n  How can we expect our children to resist the lure of drugs if harmful \ndrugs like marijuana are legalized under the guise of medicinal use, \neven though the FDA has not approved those drugs for medicinal use? How \ncan we expect to have safe, drug-free workplaces if employees can smoke \nmarijuana on the job, claiming it is medicine? How can we expect to \nhave successful drug treatment programs if someone can light up a joint \nduring a joint discussion, claiming marijuana is, after all, medicine?\n  In my own State of Arizona, the voters passed a ballot initiative, \nProposition 200, in 1996 which legalized all Schedule I drugs for \nmedicinal purposes. These would include marijuana, heroin, LSD, and all \nof the other Schedule I drugs. This year, there is another proposition \nwhich, if passed, will require the FDA to approve the efficacy of \nSchedule I drugs before they could be prescribed. That, of course, \nwould be consistent with Federal law. I have been in strong support of \nthat proposition.\n  Over $1.5 million was spent in Arizona by the prolegalization forces \nin the last election, the most prominent of whom were not from Arizona. \nArizona is not the only State that is now a target of drug \nlegalization. Other States that currently have pending legalization \ninitiatives or legislation are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, \nthe District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, \nNew York, and Washington.\n  This joint resolution that we have introduced puts Congress and the \nadministration firmly behind the existing Federal legal process for \ndetermining the safety and efficacy of drugs, including marijuana and \nall other Schedule I drugs for medicinal use.\n  Under current law, marijuana, heroin, LSD, and more than a hundred \nother drugs are classified as Schedule I because they have a high \npotential for abuse and lack any current accepted medical use.\n  Federal law [Controlled Substances Act] prohibits Schedule I drugs \nfrom being manufactured, distributed, or dispensed. This resolution re-\naffirms the law. It says that before any drug can be approved as a \nmedication, it must meet extensive scientific and medical standards \nestablished by the FDA to ensure it is safe and effective. Marijuana \nand other Schedule I drugs have not been approved by the FDA to treat \nany disease or condition, though studies are being conducted to \ndetermine if there is any potentially appropriate treatment using \nmarijuana. Attempts to legalize drugs fly in the face of established \nprocedures for approving the safety and efficacy of drugs. Most \nimportant, legalization sends the wrong message to youth about the \nhealth and safety risks of using drugs.\n  I have joined with Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and my colleagues \nin the House, Representative McCollum and Representative Cox in \nintroducing this resolution because I believe we must reassert \nleadership in this area.\n  I am particularly pleased that the administration supports this \nresolution, and I would just like to take a moment to single out \nGeneral McCaffrey for the good work that he has done in improving the \nnation's drug-control policy.\n  I would urge my colleagues to pass this important piece of \nlegislation and send it to the President for his prompt signature.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I request that the Senator from Arizona \nand I might enter into a colloquy on the question of our resolution.\n  Do I understand correctly that the effort in Arizona would not only \nlegalize marijuana it would also make\n\n[[Page S10667]]\n\navailable as a so-called medicine heroin, LSD, and over 100 other \ndangerous drugs?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is the Senator's understanding that there is no \nrecognized medical use for heroin or LSD?\n  Mr. KYL. To my knowledge, neither of these drugs, which would be made \nlegal in Arizona for medical use, have any recognized medical utility. \nIn addition, both of these substances are illegal to prescribe as \nmedicine under federal law and no doctor is authorized to prescribe \nthem as a treatment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Am I correct in believing that it is also illegal to \nprescribe marijuana, as a Schedule I drug, under Federal Law?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct. Under the Controlled Substances Act, which \ngoverns how we deal with all drugs in this country, no Schedule I drug \nmay be prescribed as a medicine. Schedule I drugs are placed in this \ncategory because they have no recognized medical use and have a high \npotential for abuse. These drugs are illegal because they are \ndangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is my understanding that we have the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and other laws \ngoverning the manufacture and sale of drugs in order to ensure they are \nsafe and effective for public use.\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct. Many of these laws are on the books because \nat one time anybody could market any product to the public and call it \na drug. Those were the days of snake oil salesmen who made the wildest \nclaims for their products. They, of course, called their products \n``medicine'' and sold them as cure-alls for every possible ailment. In \nmany cases, in the early years of this century, those products \ncontained large quantities of alcohol, opiates or cocaine. As a result, \nthis country experienced a major drug epidemic centered largely on \nwomen and children who mostly used these products. None of the products \nwere subject to regulation, they did not treat any diseases, there were \nno cures, but they did create a lot of addicts. Later, in response to \nthis situation, Congress passed laws regulating these products to \nensure that the public was not the victim of bad medicine, false \nclaims, and snake oil.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The purpose of those laws was to ensure that we didn't \ndeclare anything a medicine until it had been scientifically evaluated, \nclinically tested, and proven effective, is that right?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. Sometimes the time it takes to do this is frustrating, \nbut the purpose is to ensure that we provide safe and effective \nmedicine to the public.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As part of that process, when a medicine is found to \nwork but is also found to be dangerous or subject to abuse, how is that \nnormally dealt with?\n  Mr. KYL. Apart from over-the-counter medicines, we regulate access to \ndrugs. This is what prescriptions are for. For dangerous drugs with a \npotential for abuse, we license their use and only permit people to use \nthem based on a physician's prescription and under the continuing care \nof a doctor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In many of the efforts we currently see to declare \nmarijuana a medicine, I believe there is no requirement for a doctor's \nprescription?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator is correct. In most of these efforts, what is \ncalled for is a doctor's recommendation. Frankly, that could mean \nanything.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That's certainly an unusual practice but if I \nunderstand many of these efforts, not only is no prescription required \nbut users are authorized to grow marijuana at home for their own use.\n  Mr. KYL. The language differs in the various states, but that's \nessentially correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I believe that it is the case in some states or here in \nthe nation's capital, a so-called care giver or up to three or four \ndifferent care givers are authorized to grow marijuana at home and give \nit out. Let me see if I understand just what that means. If, for \nexample, I was taking insulin to control diabetes, the parallel would \nbe for me to be authorized to make it at home or to have three or four \nof my friends make it and give it to me when I wanted it.\n  Mr. KYL. That's about it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So, there would be none of the normal controls or \nquality checks or physician-supervised treatments that we expect when \nwe talk about medicine, especially medicine for the very ill?\n  Mr. KYL. That's right. But there is another big difference. These \nefforts do more than authorize that practice you describe. They place \nno limits on who would be eligible to receive these ``treatments'' and \nthey do not limit the ``illnesses'' for which you may take the drug.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So, this drug can be used for anything anyone feels the \nneed, they do not have to have a terminal illness or any serious \ndisease?\n  Mr. KYL. That's just one more thing about these efforts that \ndemonstrate what is really behind them. The real motive here is to \nlegalize these drugs, not to make medicine available.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with the Senator. If this effort succeeds, it \nlooks to me like it could have a major effect in sending signals to \nyoung people about drug use.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator is correct. We are already seeing the highest \nrates of first-time use of marijuana among teens and pre-teens in over \n30 years. We are on the verge of a major, new drug epidemic. I do not \nthink this is the time to be sending the kind of mixed message we see \nin these efforts to legalize marijuana or other Schedule I drugs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am working in my state to develop a statewide anti-\ndrug coalition. In doing this, I have seen personally what is happening \nall across my state because of growing illegal drug use. This doesn't \njust affect kids, although they are the most vulnerable for use. Drug \nuse affects whole families and communities. I agree that we must speak \nout against efforts to make our drug problem worse than it already is. \nWe need to blow the whistle on these efforts to legalize by indirect \nmeans. I want to thank my distinguished colleague for taking the time \nto help me think through these issues.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to thank the Senator for his efforts and I look \nforward to working with our colleagues to pass this resolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would also like to thank the Senator for all his \nefforts on this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10657-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10667-S10668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 361\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Robb) was added as a cosponsor of S. 361, a bill to amend the \nEndangered Species Act of 1973 to prohibit the sale, import, and export \nof products labeled as containing endangered species, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2017\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Maryland \n(Mr. Sarbanes) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2017, a bill to amend \ntitle XIX of the Social Security Act to provide medical assistance for \nbreast and cervical cancer-related treatment services to certain women \nscreened and found to have breast or cervical cancer under a Federally \nfunded screening program.\n\n\n                                S. 2180\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the names of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Baucus), and the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) were added \nas cosponsors of S. 2180, a bill to amend the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to \nclarify liability under that Act for certain recycling transactions.\n\n\n                                S. 2190\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the names of the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 2190, a bill to authorize qualified \norganizations to provide technical assistance and capacity building \nservices to microenterprise development organizations and programs and \nto disadvantaged entrepreneurs using funds from the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2339\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Ohio \n(Mr. DeWine) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2339, a bill to provide for \npension reform, and for other purposes.\n\n[[Page S10668]]\n\n                                S. 2433\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the names of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Allard) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 2433, a bill to protect consumers and financial \ninstitutions by preventing personal financial information from being \nobtained from financial institutions under false pretenses.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 260\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the names of the Senator from Iowa (Mr. \nGrassley), the Senator from New York (Mr. D'Amato), the Senator from \nOregon (Mr. Smith), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), the Senator \nfrom Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) were \nadded as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 260, A resolution expressing \nthe sense of the Senate that October 11, 1998, should be designated as \n``National Children's Day.''\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 278\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bingaman, the names of the Senator from \nWashington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein) were added as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 278, a \nresolution designating the 30th day of April of 1999, as ``Dia de los \nNinos: Celebrating Young Americans,'' and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10667-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10668-S10669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TORRICELLI AMENDMENT NO. 3603\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. TORRICELLI submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill (S. 1645) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \nprohibit taking minors across State lines to avoid laws requiring the \ninvolvement of parents in abortion decisions; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

GEORGE VERNON IRONS, SR.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to eulogize and \ncelebrate the life of one of Alabama's great native sons--Dr. George \nVernon Irons, Sr., who passed away July 21, 1998.\n  Dr. Irons was Distinguished Professor of History and Political \nScience Emeritus at Samford University, having served the University \nfor 43 years. During that time, he taught a record number of University \nPresidents, 17.\n  Dr. Irons was the oldest member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame \nand one of Alabama's athletic greats---the only Alabama track and \ndistance star inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame from the \nUniversity of Alabama. Mr. President, only three men have been inducted \ninto the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame on the first ballot: Ralph Shug \nJordan, Paul ``Bear'' Bryant, and Dr. George Irons.\n  Dr. Irons is survived by his wife, Velma Wright Irons, a \ndistinguished educator and nominee for the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame \nat Judson College; two sons: Dr. George Vernon Irons, Jr., a \ncardiologist in Charlotte, North Carolina; and William Lee Irons, a \nprominent Birmingham attorney. Dr. Irons and his son William are the \nonly father and son to be selected for the 1998 Who's Who in America \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. President, Dr. George Vernon Irons Sr., gave tirelessly of \nhimself to God and country. He was a man of great distinction, and I \ntake great pride in offering this tribute on his behalf.\n  Mr. President, the following tribute, edited to meet Congressional \nRecord length requirements, was written by Dr. Irons' son. It provides \na comprehensive and detailed account of Dr. Irons' life and many \naccomplishments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the tribute written by \nDr. Irons' son William be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                Tribute to Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr.\n\n                         (By William L. Irons)\n\n       Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr., arrived at Birmingham's \n     Howard College (now Samford University) in 1931. At that \n     time, the school was experiencing serious financial \n     difficulty, owing more than $400,000. Dr. Irons' first \n     assignment for the troubled school began when University \n     President Neal called him in and explained that the school \n     had been noticed for foreclosure. ``Your job, Irons, is to go \n     to the banker and stop this foreclosure,'' President Neal \n     directed.\n       Dr. Irons persuaded the banker, after much deliberation, to \n     grant the university a two-year extension. The rest is \n     history. Today, Samford University is the largest privately \n     endowed Baptist school in the world, and is the only Baptist \n     institution in America with an inspiring domed school of \n     divinity.\n       As a result of Dr. Irons' key role in assisting Howard \n     College to grow into an internationally acclaimed university, \n     he was elected by the Samford University faculty to serve as \n     Grand Marshall of all academic, graduation and commencement \n     exercises. Leading the academic processional for 15 years. In \n     1976, he was recognized by Samford University Faculty \n     Resolution for ``his impeccable character and qualities of \n     modesty, humility, kindness, and selfless service to the \n     University.''\n       While the final years of service often ebb, this was not \n     the case for Dr. Irons. In the last few months of his life, \n     at nearly 96 years of age, Dr. Irons secured a $100,000 \n     scholarship contribution to Samford University as a perpetual \n     memorial to his academic excellence as Distinguished \n     Professor for 43 years.\n       In addition to his tireless efforts on behalf of Samford \n     University, Dr. Irons is known as a sports legend. In the \n     early 1920's, George Irons kept the athletic flame burning at \n     the University of Alabama as its ``Knight of the \n     Cinderpath.''\n       As a Junior in 1922, Irons won the prestigious A.A.U. Road \n     Race in Atlanta. That same year, Irons broke the A.A.U. \n     record,\n\n[[Page S10670]]\n\n     running four miles in 17-minutes and 24-seconds---an average \n     of four, four-minute 21-second miles in succession. The four \n     minute mile record would not be broken until 30-years later.\n       Irons then won the All Southern S.I.A.A. Road Race in \n     Birmingham--a grueling three mile event over solid pavement. \n     In a hard, driving rain, he broke the record by more than 20 \n     seconds. This record has never been equaled nor broken.\n       For his prowess on the track field, Irons ran himself into \n     the Alabama record books, including his addition to the \n     Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1978 on the first ballot--the \n     only track and distance runner ever inducted into the Hall of \n     Fame.\n       While at the University of Alabama, Dr. Irons was a Phi \n     Beta Kappa honors student, and the University's nominee for \n     the Rhodes Scholarship in 1924. From there, he went on to \n     Duke University where he earned his doctorate degree in \n     history.\n       To his friends, Dr. Irons was the quintessential American. \n     With large inviting hands, captivating smile and charming \n     gentleman's demeanor, he radiated a generous spirit \n     accessible to everyone. Witty and charming, he always made \n     the other person ``look good,'' even if to his own detriment. \n     Eager to listen, never critical or negative, he could \n     penetrate the soul of another and give an inspiring uplifting \n     word of encouragement or silently go about doing good. A \n     generous heart who cared deeply and passionately about the \n     loves of his life and consecrated his energies to them. A \n     braveheart of Scottish ancestry, he had the heart of a lion \n     when his interests were challenged.\n       A consummate gentleman with the ``can do'' American spirit \n     on any endeavor--interested in what you were doing and how he \n     could help accomplish your objectives. With foresight he \n     encouraged female colleagues to pursue their professional \n     goals long before it was a popular undertaking.\n       He was a genteel man ever sensitive to another's hurt. He \n     went about assisting without being asked. Dr. Irons had an \n     unlimited capacity to give his endless energies to any task. \n     His crisp walks across the Samford campus at near running \n     gait were legendary among his students and the faculty. He \n     had a great fighting heart for his beliefs and often referred \n     to his middle initial ``V'' as ``V for victory.'' Dr. Irons \n     had an elegance rarely seen rivaling the beauty and grace of \n     a swan, yet strong with the swift power of a lion if called \n     upon.\n       Loyal and faithful, easy to greet, he was at ease before a \n     large convocation audience or content to enjoy cherished time \n     of solitude.\n       In addition to his other accomplishments, Dr. Irons, who \n     was also Colonel Irons, proudly defended the United States in \n     war and in peace for over one-third of the 20th Century. Dr. \n     Irons, who achieved the rank of Lt. Col., served in the Anti-\n     Aircraft Artillery branch of the U.S. Army and reserves.\n       Devoted to God, Dr. Irons gave selfless service to his \n     Church as deacon, Sunday school teacher, and Chairman of the \n     Board of Deacons. He was elected as lifetime Deacon, \n     Southside Baptist Church. His life reflects his depth of \n     devotion in word, deed and thought. Dr. Irons was an icon of \n     virtue and a legendary role model for Samford students for \n     almost a century.\n       Dr. Irons' life was one of sacrificial service. From his \n     service to our nation, to his work on behalf of Samford \n     University students and faculty, Dr. Irons was a figure of \n     character, devotion to cause, and exemplary standards of \n     honor, duty and integrity. His life is an inspiration to all.\n       Funeral services for Dr. Irons were conducted at Mountain \n     Brook Baptist Church Chapel on July 27, 1998 by Dr. Irons' \n     former student, Dr. James D. Moebes, Senior Minister.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10669-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF ACHIEVEMENTS OF SAM HOWARD\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the achievement \nof Mr. Sam Howard, Chief Executive Officer of Phoenix Healthcare \nCorporation, who was recently selected to serve as Chairman of the \nNashville Chamber of Commerce. Aside from the general prestige which \naccompanies attaining such an honor, Mr. Howard bears the distinction \nof being the first African American to hold this position. His talent \nand skills will certainly benefit the city of Nashville.\n  As the first African American to hold this position, Mr. Howard has a \nunique opportunity to encourage minority membership within the Chamber \nof Commerce and to promote minority entrepreneurs. The Urban Journal's \nJuly 1, 1998 edition highlighted Mr. Howard's top goals, including the \ndevelopment of a foreign trade mission, as well as focusing attention \non public education and investments in the field of biomedicine and \nbiotechnology.\n  Mr. Howard serves with me as a member of the National Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare. The Commission has held a number \nof field hearings in Tennessee to gather the views and concerns of \nindustry leaders and beneficiaries in the state. Mr. Howard's \nperspective as CEO of a health maintenance organization, which \ncontracts with companies, Medicare and the TennCare program, is \nappropriate and useful for the Commission's goal of identifying \nchallenges facing the Medicare program and for creating potential \nsolutions.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Howard on this worthy achievement \nand thank him for serving as a role model for the next generation. I am \nproud of his optimistic view toward life, and his perseverance and \ndedication toward overcoming obstacles. I wish him well throughout his \ntenure as Chairman of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10670-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10670-S10671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I introduced this bill last July on behalf \nof the administration. S. 2317 makes several changes to the National \nWildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. First, it removes \nthree areas from the Refuge System that have lost the habitat value \nthat led to their being incorporated into the Refuge System. Second, it \nchanges the name of the Klamath Forest National Wildlife Refuge in \nOregon to the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. The current name \nleads visitors to believe that it is a national forest, causing \nconfusion over what activities are permitted.\n  Mr. President, although no one like to see areas removed from the \nRefuge System, the three areas in question have truly lost their \noriginal wildlife value. Thirty-seven acres within the Upper \nMississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge has been developed \nfor recreational purposes when it was leased to the Army Corps of \nEngineers (Corps). The area in question would be transferred to the \nCorps, which owns the adjoining lands, and its recreational use would \nbe continued.\n  In 1934 an Executive order established the Killcohook Coordination \nArea as a migratory bird refuge as long as the Corps could continue to \nuse the area as a dredge disposal site. Sixty years later this area is \ncompletely covered with piles of spoil and, not surprisingly, no \nremaining waterfowl habitat. This bill would eliminate the Fish and \nWildlife Service's secondary jurisdiction.\n  The final change will revoke an easement that allows the Fish and \nWildlife Service to prohibit hunting of migratory birds at Lake Elsie, \nNorth Dakota. The easement was granted in 1939 and the surrounding land \nis privately owned and the State owns the lake. Due to substantial \ndevelopment, the area is no longer suitable for migratory birds.\n  S. 2317 will also reduce the penalty for unintentional violations of \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. Currently, all \nviolations of the act are class A misdemeanors, regardless of whether \nor not it was an intentional violation. Unintentional violations will \nnow be a class B misdemeanor.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments \nbe agreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2317), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/21/senate-section/article/S10670-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1998\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
