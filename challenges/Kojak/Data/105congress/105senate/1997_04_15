The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of \nthe floor be extended to a staff member of mine, Brent Heberlee, \nthroughout consideration of S. 104 and amendments thereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 3 minutes debate prior to \nthe vote on the Bingaman amendment No. 31.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me very briefly address the \nBingaman amendment which I feel introduces some serious loopholes in S. \n104's ironclad process toward a safe, central interim storage facility.\n  The loopholes will be used, as they have in the past, to keep the \nnuclear waste where it is at 80 sites in 41 States, near schools and \nresidential neighborhoods--right where it is today.\n  The history of the nuclear waste issue has taught us some simple \nlessons we must heed: Any decision regarding nuclear waste that can be \ndelayed will be delayed; any decision that can be ignored will be \nignored. That is why we have spent $6 billion over 15 years, and the \nFederal Government is still unable to meet its legal and moral \nobligation to take the waste in 1998.\n  I implore my colleagues: Let us not be fooled again. S. 104 is \ndesigned to make sure there are no trap doors. The chart that I \nexplained to my colleagues yesterday attempts to make a decision, force \na decision now, not leave us with a way out or a copout.\n\n  I suggest to you that the Bingaman amendment as it is structured \nopens a loophole. It opens the process to political pressure. It \ninvites indecision. It\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\ncontinues the legacy of failure that the Department of Energy's nuclear \nwaste program is noted for.\n  It would be my intention, Mr. President, to move to table the \nBingaman amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that Anne \nMarie Murphy, who is a Congressional Fellow on Senator Durbin's staff, \nbe granted privileges of the floor today, April 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered goes to the \nheart of a flaw in S. 104. Without the amendment that I am offering, S. \n104 will send nuclear waste to the site right next to Yucca Mountain \neven if Yucca Mountain fails as the geologic repository. We will then \nhave a permanent aboveground repository rather than a geologic \nrepository and will be able to shuffle off the responsibility for \ndealing with nuclear waste to our children and grandchildren.\n  There is an attempt in the bill to disguise this unfair policy with a \nprovision that allows the President to send waste somewhere else if we \npass a law to that effect within 24 months. But we are not going to \npass a new nuclear waste law in 24 months especially if the reward for \nnot doing so is to keep sending all the waste to Nevada where we can \nforget about it.\n  My amendment stops construction and operation of an interim storage \nsite in Nevada if Yucca Mountain fails as a candidate repository at any \ntime before it opens. If Yucca Mountain is not suitable as a \nrepository, then it is not the right place for interim storage. We must \nhave certainty that our ultimate solution for nuclear waste is based on \nhaving a geologic repository and that any action on an interim storage \nfacility rises or falls with the fate of a permanent facility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to table the Bingaman amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

On the motion to table, Senators voting in the \naffirmative 59, voting in the negative 39. The motion to table is \nagreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 43\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 3 minutes of debate prior to \nthe vote on the Murkowski amendment No. 43.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to protect the \ntaxpayer by making it clear that nuclear waste user fees cannot exceed \n1 mill per kilowatt hour without specified congressional authorization. \nThe spent fuel disposal program is paid for with a fee that is \ncurrently set to 1 mill per kilowatt hour. My amendment simply protects \nthe ratepayer by making it clear that the user fee cannot exceed 1 mill \nwithout congressional authorization. DOE's own budget projections show \nthat a 1 mill fee is sufficient.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in 1982, when this body adopted the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act, we set, as the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee has said, the amount the utilities would pay to build a \npermanent repository at 1 mill per kilowatt hour. In 14 years, we have \ncollected $8 billion. The total cost of the program is $34 billion. The \nutilities' share of that cost is $27 billion. So we are looking for the \n1 mill fee to produce $27 billion. The defense program's share is $7 \nbillion. The interest on the excess that sits in the Treasury is \nexpected to make up the balance.\n  In 14 years, the Secretary of Energy has had the discretion, which we \ngave the Secretary, to raise this 1 mill fee to whatever it would take \nto pay the utilities' share of the program's cost. In 14 years, he or \nshe has never seen fit to raise it. There is no point in tinkering with \nit now because it is working fine.\n  If there ever was a case where we are trying to fix a problem that \ndoes not exist, this is it. Leave the law as it is. We are adding $2 \nbillion to the $27 billion cost now with the Murkowski bill. That is \ngoing to up the ante $2 billion. One mill is fine for now. The \nutilities are happy with it. It is producing the amount of money we \nwant. There is absolutely no reason for this amendment. I do not think \nwe will have to raise it, but we might.\n  Mr. President, I yield back such time as I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] is necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 66, nays 32, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 41 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--66\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\n\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--32\n\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Coats\n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The amendment (No. 43) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 42\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 3 minutes for debate prior \nto the vote on the Domenici amendment No. 42.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent the yeas and nays be vitiated \non the substitute amendment. I understand the underlying Domenici \namendment is acceptable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my amendment is, in effect, a technical \namendment which ensures that any joint resolution addressing a change \nto the fee set out in this bill does not automatically escape Budget \nAct scrutiny.\n  The underlying bill provides fast-track procedures for enacting the \njoint resolution. The procedures provide that all points of order are \nwaived. My amendment provides that Budget Act points of order are not \nwaived: It would be a bad precedent to waive Budget Act points of order \nwhen we don't have the measure before us for review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no future debate, the question is \non agreeing to the Domenici amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 42) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I now ask for the yeas and nays on the passage of \nSenate bill 104.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to further amendment. If \nthere be no further amendment to be proposed, the question is on \nagreeing to the Murkowski amendment in the nature of a substitute, as \namended.\n  The amendment (No. 26), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes for debate evenly divided \nat this time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the question before the body now is \nwhether we want to leave the waste where it is, 41 States in 80 sites, \nor do something about the waste. Do we want the waste to move out again \nbecause of an inability to reach a decision? Where would it move? \nNobody wants it in any of the 50 States. It would move out to the \nPacific. God knows where it would move. Today we must make an important \nenvironmental decision which will lead to a safer future for all \nAmericans.\n  Currently, Mr. President, as I have noted, we have the waste stored \nin 80 sites in 41 States. This is in addition to waste stored at DOE \nfacilities, and it is in our backyards across the land. Do we want that \nwaste to stay there, or do we want to move it? That is the question.\n  Every year that goes by our ability to continue to store nuclear \nwaste at each of these sites in a safe and environmentally responsible \nway diminishes. Our temporary storage facilities were designed for just \nthat--temporary storage. We have struggled with this nuclear waste \nissue for more than a decade. We have collected $13 billion from the \ntaxpayers, but some are unprepared to meet the Government's promise to \ntake the waste by 1998, next year.\n  The administration's position would suggest that we are undermining \nthe permanent repository program. They have not read the bill. The \nreality is that it is the only way to save the permanent repository \nprogram.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's get order in the Senate. The rule requires that the \nChair secure and maintain order in the Senate and in the galleries \nwithout a point of order being made from the floor.\n  I hope the Chair will insist on it, and I hope that Senators will \nrespect the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me remind you that the U.S. court of appeals has \nruled that the Department of Energy has an obligation to take \npossession of the nuclear waste in 1998, whether or not a repository is \nready. Damages for the Department of Energy's failure to perform are \ngoing to cost the American taxpayer tens of billions of dollars.\n  Now, the administration says that S. 104 would effectively establish \nNevada as a site for an interim storage facility before the viability \nassessment of Yucca Mountain as a permanent repository is completed. \nWell, they have not read the bill, Mr. President. S. 104 does not \nchoose a site for interim storage before the viability assessment of \nYucca Mountain is completed. If the viability assessment is positive, \nthe bill provides that the interim storage facility will be constructed \nat the Nevada test site. If the viability assessment is negative, the \nbill provides that the President has 18 months and Congress has 2 years \nto choose another interim storage site.\n  This bill, Senate 104, protects the public health, environment, and \nextends the schedule for siting and licensing. It requires \nenvironmental impact statements. It provides the interim facility will \nbe licensed. It shortens the license term of the interim facility to 40 \nyears; it balance State and Federal laws, preempting only those State \nlaws that are inconsistent with the act; it provides that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency will set standards for a permanent \nrepository, based upon the National Academy of Science recommendation.\n\n  So we have reached a crossroad, Mr. President. The job of fixing this \nprogram is ours. The time for fixing the program is now. Much progress \nhas been made at Yucca Mountain. The 5-mile exploratory tunnel will \nsoon be complete. If Yucca is found on unsuitable or is not licensed, \nit will be vital that we have a centralized interim site. I have a \nsimple bottom line. We must chart a safe, predictable, and sure course \nto interim and permanent waste storage. There can be no trapdoors, Mr. \nPresident. I don't want to have to stand here next year or the year \nafter doing this again. We have to ask ourselves, do we want to move \nthe waste or simply leave it where it is?\n  We can choose now whether the Nation needs 80 interim storage sites, \nor just one. The arid, remote Nevada test site, where we have exploded \nscores of nuclear bombs during the cold war, is a safe and remote \nlocation for a monitored interim site. The time is now. I think S. 104 \nis the answer. So ask yourself, do you want to leave the waste where it \nis, in 40 States at 80 sites? Or do you want to move the waste from \nyour State to one location, and that is the Nevada test site?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for the Senator from Idaho, \nSenator Craig.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time do the opponents of the \nlegislation have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The proponents have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 33 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Chair to advise the Senator when I have used 2 \nminutes.\n  Members of the Senate, you have seen bad legislation in your day, but\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\nthis is the worst. S. 104, as written, was bad. S. 104 in the \nsubstitute form is just as bad. People like Senator Bingaman have tried \nto improve this legislation. Senator Bingaman worked very hard. They \ntinkered with the edges. The proponents tried to pacify Senator \nBingaman and others, and the legislation was not improved upon with \ntheir tinkering.\n  This legislation is bad in its substitute form and in its amended \nform. They have failed to deal with the transportation system at all. \nThey haven't dealt with it. In Germany, in recent months, they tried to \nmove six casks. They called out 30,000 police to take care of that--\n30,000. There were 170 people injured and 500 arrested. It cost $150 \nmillion to move it less than 300 miles. The German parliament is \nreconsidering the program. There is nothing in this legislation to \nallow it to be carried through your State safely. Every environmental \ngroup in America opposes this legislation.\n  The terrorism possibilities with this legislation are replete, as we \nlaid out on the floor yesterday. The Washington Post is only one \nnewspaper that said ``don't do it.'' Many newspapers throughout the \ncountry have said ``don't do it.''\n  The President is going to veto this because it is bad legislation, as \nagreed upon by his Secretary of Energy, head of the EPA, and by the \nCouncil of Environmental Quality. We picked a scientific group to give \nus insight and oversight of this legislation. They have told us that \nthis legislation is bad. We, the Congress chartered these scientists. \nThey are not from Nevada. They are bipartisan scientists, and they said \nthe legislation is bad.\n  The United Transportation Union doesn't like the legislation. Doctors \noppose this legislation. Churches, like the Lutheran Church and the \nBaptist ministry oppose this legislation. A group of environmentalists \nwho deal with Native Americans in this country oppose this legislation.\n\n  This is bad legislation. If you want to cast a good vote, vote \nagainst this. It is a bad bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Time will be charged equally \nagainst both sides.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, what the Senate is asked to do this morning \nis a total repudiation and rejection of good science. S. 104 is opposed \nby the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, a body of eminent \nscientists, created pursuant to an act of Congress. They reviewed it \nlast year in 1996 and last year. They say two things. First, it is \nunnecessary. Second, it interferes with the citing process, which is \ncurrently taking place. We dismantle the environmental laws in America \nif we enact this legislation.\n  In 1992, the Energy Efficiency Act directed the National Academy of \nSciences in conjunction with EPA to develop a standard. They are about \nready to do that. This legislation rejects that standard and proposes a \nlimitation on the ability of the National Academy of Sciences and the \nEPA to develop the standard that would provide minimal protections for \nhealth and safety.\n  The third point that needs to be made is that the Nevada test site is \nfrequently referenced. That is the proposed site for the alternative \nstorage, the interim storage. No study has ever been made that would \nindicate that the Nevada test site is either desirable or suitable as \nan interim storage facility.\n  The fourth point I make is that this legislation, in fact, preempts \nlaws in my own State, unlike it does any other State in America. The \nenvironmental protection laws are essentially delegated to the States \nwith their ability to enforce. This legislation would preempt that \nability. So in Nevada we could not enforce clean air, clean water, safe \ndrinking, RCRA, and other provisions.\n  The fifth point is that the National Environmental Policy Act is \ngutted by the provisions. It is bad legislation. I urge my colleagues \nto reject it, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the sky is not falling. The National \nAcademy of Science adopts standards and EPA uses them. That is in the \nbill. Save $25 to $30 billion. Honor our commitment since 1982 to abide \nby the law and the contracts of our Government and the Federal court \nand find a single, safe repository for nuclear waste. This is the \nnumber one environmental bill this year, if you are concerned about 80 \nsites spread across this country. The issue is good policy. S. 104 is \ngood law. The Senate ought to support it unanimously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 24 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me take 12 seconds. It is late in the \ngame. Any Senator who believes we do not eviscerate and emasculate the \nstandards set by the National Academy of Science, look at page 37, my \nfriends. That is why no environmental organization in America supports \nit; they all oppose it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we have engaged in this debate on the \nnation's strategy to deal with temporary storage of high-level nuclear \nwaste, I have come to several conclusions. Certainly storage is a \ntroublesome issue that has remained unresolved for the past 16 years. \nAs time has gone by, it has become clearer and clearer that the Nation \nneeds a more comprehensive strategy, not a piecemeal strategy, to \nhandle all the issues associated with long-term storage of nuclear \nwaste. Furthermore, given the vehemently strong opinions expressed by \ncitizens, administrators, State and local officials, and others who \nwould be affected by a centralized storage plan, I believe we need to \nhave the utmost confidence in the way we choose to dispose of spent \nfuel.\n  When we began to consider the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, I was \noptimistic about our ability to work toward the common goal of \nproviding guidance on this issue. Supporters of the bill made an \nextremely credible case to me that something needs to be done. The \nNuclear Waste Act of 1982 set up a trust fund to help pay for the cost \nof a permanent geologic repository. As part of the deal, the Department \nof Energy was directed to contract with utilities to accept spent fuel \nat a permanent repository by 1998, but now it cannot. The Nation's \nnuclear reactors have begun to run out of space for spent fuel in pools \nat reactor sites. Soon, more and more utilities will have to build \nabove ground storage casks. I am sympathetic to the frustrations \nexpressed by State governments and utilities over this breach. I am \nsure many of my colleagues agree with me.\n  Another issue that demands attention is the Nuclear Waste Fund. \nCongress has established 172 trust funds financed by taxpayers for \nspecific purposes. Few have maintained their integrity in the spending \nprocess. The Nuclear Waste Fund is one of the few where the Government \nentered into an actual contract to perform a duty--to take on spent \nnuclear fuel by a time certain. Considering the history of this issue, \nI am opposed to the idea that ratepayers, who have already contributed \nover $12 billion to the Nuclear Waste Fund for the construction of a \npermanent repository, should also have the cost of on-site storage \npassed on to them. Louisianians have paid over $140 million into this \nfund since 1982, with no results. This is unacceptable. The public \nshould be getting its money's worth. Otherwise, the money should not be \nspent.\n  Conversely, and most importantly, I am hesitant to commit to the \nconstruction of an interim storage facility if there are uncertainties \nassociated with the designated permanent repository site. So much rests \non a decision to place an interim site near Yucca Mountain. Will we \ntransport the waste more than once if Yucca Mountain is unsuitable? How \nwise is it to ignore this possible outcome? This body several years ago \nrequested a study from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. Their \nfindings were illustrative of the complexity of this effort. It seems \nthat a particular element was found in the exploratory tunnel at Yucca \nMountain. This element is generally present when there is fast flowing \nwater in a location. No one expected this finding. Nor did anyone \nexpect the Board to determine that utilities could go on safely storing \nnuclear waste at reactor sites for another decade. Both these findings \nshow that certainties are hard to come by, even when from all \nindications, a clear outcome is expected. Mr. President, we\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nshould not create a nuclear waste policy based on incomplete \ninformation. This issue is just too important.\n\n  For these reasons, I am unable at this time to support S. 104. I \nbelieve that the rationale for a comprehensive approach to waste \nstorage is evident. The working process I have witnessed over the last \nfew weeks between the leaders on this issue, if continued, could result \nin a measure that addresses all of the concerns raised by industry, \nState and local administrators including tribes, and the \nadministration. I have felt for some time that a compromise on the \nprovisions of S. 104 exists. In fact, a compromise was nearly achieved.\n  Mr. President, it is said that a rolling stone gathers no moss. I \nsubmit that we cannot afford to let moss grow. We need to adopt a clear \npolicy sooner rather than later on this question. I am disappointed \nthat compromise could not be found at this time, but I urge my \ncolleagues to continue to work on finding solutions so that we can have \na sensible nuclear waste policy for this Nation.\n  In closing I will say that permanent storage of nuclear waste is \nsomething that we need to do--we need to do it once and only once. It \nis of paramount importance that it be done correctly and to the \nsatisfaction of all.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about \nS. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997.\n  Last year, I voted against S. 1936, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1996 for several reasons. I felt that the measure rushed to build the \ninterim site before the viability of the permanent site was considered. \nAlso, under last year's bill, NEPA, the National Environmental Policy \nAct, would not have applied until quite late in the game, after great \ntime and resources had been expended. It only would have applied to the \nlicensing of the facility. It wouldn't have applied to construction of \nthe facility at all. Finally, the radiation standards provided in S. \n1936 were too lax, and EPA was virtually shut out of the process of \nsetting such standards. Last year's bill was a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposal, and I chose to leave it.\n  When S. 104 was reported by the Energy Committee earlier this year, I \nhad every intention of opposing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, S. 104, \nagain. But this year, the Energy Committee has worked hard to address \nthe concerns that were raised about last year's proposal. After \nreviewing the changes made in the Murkowski substitute amendment, I \nhave decided to vote in favor of the bill before us. While it is not \nperfect, the substitute is a significant improvement over last year's \nbill and this year's bill as reported by the Energy Committee. Is it a \nperfect bill? Not at all, but it is a far more reasonable solution to a \nterribly difficult situation than we have ever had before.\n  Years ago, Congress rejected reprocessing as an alternative to waste \nstorage. There aren't a lot of options when it comes to disposing of \nnuclear waste. Either it stays on site, or it goes to a centralized \nstorage facility. I support centralized storage of nuclear waste; \nhowever, I believe that the effects of designating a central site must \nbe considered before such a critical decision is reached.\n  The Department of Energy is committed to completing a viability study \nof Yucca Mountain as the permanent repository by the end of next year. \nUntil that study is completed, I feel strongly that there is no reason \nto go forward with an interim facility at the nearby test site in \nNevada. Under last year's bill, as well as the bill reported by the \ncommittee, the viability study was disregarded. Site preparation and \nconstruction would begin upon enactment of the legislation. Senator \nBingaman worked closely with Senator Murkowski and the Energy Committee \nto address this issue. The committee substitute amendment specifically \nprecludes any work, beyond generic design, from going forward at the \ninterim site, before the viability study of Yucca Mountain is \ncompleted. I also supported Senator Bingaman's amendment, which would \nhave ensured that the interim storage facility would not become a de \nfacto permanent repository if Yucca Mountain were deemed to be \nunsuitable. Regrettably, that amendment failed. While I was \ndisappointed with the failure of this amendment, it was not enough to \ncause me to vote against the bill. Simply put, I believe it is highly \nunlikely that the viability study will be negative.\n\n  The substitute also strengthens the role of NEPA. Site preparation, \nconstruction, and the use of the interim facility are no longer exempt \nfrom NEPA. In fact, no construction at the interim site could proceed \nbefore an environmental impact statement is completed by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. This is an enormous improvement over last year's \nbill, which disregarded NEPA at every step prior to the licensing of \nthe facility.\n  The process for setting standards to protect the public from \nradiation at the Yucca Mountain site also is a marked improvement over \nprevious measures. Rather than setting an arbitrary statutory standard, \nthe substitute incorporates recent recommendations made by the National \nAcademy of Sciences in setting an overall radiation standard for the \nrepository.\n  Let me close by saying that the arguments on both sides of this issue \nhave been persuasive. I want to recognize the undaunted persistence of \nSenators Bryan and Reid in articulating the potential implications of \nthe bill and in arguing relentlessly for the interests of Nevada. I \nalso want to commend Senator Murkowski for his hard work and \ndetermination. Senator Murkowski ably managed this very complex measure \nand was willing to accept suggestions and changes from other Senators \nthat vastly improved the bill.\n  The bill, as passed, did not resolve all of my concerns, but it did \nresolve most of them.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. My State of Connecticut is heavily \ndependent on nuclear power. I have long supported this energy source, \nand long been concerned about how to safely dispose of its waste.\n  I support the need for a national, permanent, geological repository \nfor nuclear waste, but I cannot support the bill before us today. The \nNuclear Waste Policy Act mandates construction of an above-ground, \ninterim storage facility even before the scientific findings on the \npermanent repository at Yucca Mountain are completed. The Department of \nEnergy has said that the viability studies for Yucca Mountain should be \ncompleted in 1998.\n  I remain concerned that construction of an interim facility would \neffectively stifle efforts to establish a permanent, geological \nrepository. It is a costly and risky diversion from what should be our \nprimary goal in this area: finding a safe, permanent place to store our \nnation's nuclear waste. We have already spent almost $5 billion on the \npermanent facility and it is not even finished. It is estimated that \nthe interim facility would cost an additional $2 billion.\n  Let me remind you that the interim facility is above ground. If for \nany reason the scientific assessments for Yucca Mountain are negative, \neither the interim facility would become the de facto permanent \nrepository without establishing its suitability as such, or the waste \nwould have to be moved again. Either alternative is unacceptable.\n  One of the main reasons that I cannot support this bill, is my fear \nof what could happen if we must move the nuclear waste multiple times. \nLet us not forget that transporting nuclear waste is inherently risky \nand any accident or act of terrorism could prove disastrous. I do not \nwant our communities in Connecticut and around the Nation to be at risk \nbecause we acted imprudently.\n  The supporters of this bill have tried to assure us that transporting \nnuclear waste is safe, and that environmental safeguards would be in \nplace. I am convinced that this bill does not adequately protect public \nhealth and safety and that too many environmental laws are weakened.\n  In fact, this bill restricts the Environmental Protection Agency's \n[EPA] ability to set a drinking water standard at the nuclear waste \nrepository. Let me remind you that last Congress the Senate passed the \nSafe Drinking Water amendments by a resounding vote of 98-0. Clearly, \nupholding Federal drinking water standards should be a priority in \nNevada no less than in Connecticut. EPA is further restricted in its \nability to adequately protect the population from radiation emissions. \nGranted, EPA can continue to set the\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nannual acceptable dose limit for radiation exposure, but the bill \nremains vague on any further action that EPA could take to protect the \npublic health and safety from dangerous emission levels. Furthermore, \nlanguage in the bill is so vague that it is unclear whether compliance \nwith the Clean Water Act or the Clean Air Act would be required.\n  It seems to me that threatening public health and safety is the price \nof expediency. State laws that could slow the process of interim \nstorage are simply preempted. The National Environmental Policy Act \n[NEPA], passed by Congress in 1969, establishes an environmental impact \nprocess for major Federal projects, like Yucca Mountain. The goal of \nthe environmental impact process is to look at all alternatives to \nensure that the most environmentally sound alternative is chosen. This \nbill severely restricts the NEPA decision-making process regarding \ntransportation and the design of either repository. In effect, the \npublic has no role in the decision-making process.\n  Now, I would like to clarify a few statements that have been made \nduring this debate regarding the State of Connecticut.\n  I recognize the importance of safely storing nuclear waste and the \nimpact this has on my State. It has been said that the situation in \nConnecticut is urgent. However, it is my understanding that there is \nsufficient capacity. The fuel pool at one of the facilities in my State \nshould be able to accommodate waste from the other reactors until the \nend of their licenses and well into the next century. Decisions \nconcerning the fourth facility, Connecticut Yankee, await a final \ndecommissioning plan.\n  Last week, my colleague from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, mentioned a \nHartford Courant editorial that, I might say, only marginally supported \nthe bill. In fact, I believe the editorial was entitled, ``The Lesser \nof Two Evils''--hardly a rousing endorsement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the \nRecord another Connecticut editorial. This one is from the New London \nDay, a newspaper located in the southeastern part of Connecticut, just \ndown the road from three of our nuclear reactors. The editorial, \nentitled, ``Nagging Nuclear Waste Problem,'' states that ``Many safety \nadvocates believe that waste should not be sent to Yucca Mountain \nunless the facility is designated as suitable to hold the material \nlong-term.'' The editorial goes on to say that, ``Otherwise, opponents \nsay, if the site is ultimately found to be unsuitable, waste will have \nto be shipped out again. It doesn't make any sense to have nuclear \nwaste from 109 plants shipped all over the country unless it can be \nshipped once.''\n  Mr. President, I concur with the rationale of the New London Day. We \nshould wait for scientific verification of Yucca Mountain as a \npermanent storage site, before shipping nuclear waste throughout \nConnecticut and our country.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Nagging Nuclear-Waste Problem\n\n       America's difficulty in finding a solution to permanent \n     storage for nuclear waste isn't confined to these shores. \n     Europe is in an uproar about the same issue. A salt mine in \n     the German town of Gorleben has been chosen as an interim \n     storage disposal facility for German nuclear waste. The \n     decision sparked widespread protests.\n       Adding outrage to the protests was the derailment of a \n     train carrying casks holding radioactive material bound for \n     the site. The casks weren't harmed. But the accident \n     illustrated the point of opponents, which is that radiation \n     shouldn't be shipped all over Europe.\n       The Senate Energy Committee is set to vote on a similar \n     interim-storage facility for America, designating Yucca \n     Mountain, Nev., for that distinction. The president has \n     threatened to veto such a bill if it reaches his desk.\n\n\n                          waiting makes sense\n\n       President Bill Clinton is right. Although the country needs \n     a site for nuclear waste, and an interim storage facility is \n     appealing, it probably makes more sense to wait until a \n     permanent facility is approved.\n       Many safety advocates believe that waste should not be sent \n     to Yucca Mountain unless the facility is designated as \n     suitable to hold the material long-term. Otherwise, opponents \n     say, if the site is ultimately found to be unsuitable, waste \n     will have to be shipped out again. It doesn't make any sense \n     to have nuclear waste from 109 plants shipped all over the \n     country unless it can be shipped once, stored * * *.\n       So far, though, the political process has been maddeningly \n     inadequate to handle this touchy subject. Congress for years \n     has forced the nuclear industry to pay billions to help build \n     a storage facility that was supposed to be up and running by \n     the end of this century. Instead, that facility won't open \n     for at least a decade. In the meantime, all over the country \n     nuclear plants' 40-foot-deep, spent-fuel pools are filling up \n     with spent nuclear waste. The pools were never designed for \n     long-term storage.\n       It might make more sense to rebate to the industry some of \n     the many millions it has sent to the government to spend on \n     other things while Congress and the Energy Department delayed \n     building a waste facility. With the money, the nuclear plants \n     can put their spent fuel rods in dry-cask storage, considered \n     an expensive but extremely safe method of storing nuclear \n     fuel.\n       The typical ``cask'' for such a task is 18 feet long, 8\\1/\n     2\\ feet in diameter and made of concrete. It weighs 90 tons \n     fully loaded and holds anywhere from nine to 25 fuel rods. \n     This type of storage is considered safer than spent-fuel \n     pools, because the pools have been known to leak \n     occasionally, risking exposure of the fuel.\n       The best of all possible worlds would be for our political \n     system to prove adequate to such thorny problems as nuclear \n     waste. So far, such has not been the case. So the safest \n     interim solution must be sought. With 109 plants around the \n     country, shipping waste to a temporary facility seems short-\n     sighted. Better to choose the safest temporary solution, and \n     work for a permanent answer.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank those \nwho have worked so hard on this piece of legislation, Karen and Gary \nand several others, as well as my colleagues on the other side, \nprofessional staff, and the two Senators from Nevada. It has been a \ngood debate, and I think we send a message to the administration \nrelative to the reality of whether we are going to leave the waste on \n80 sites in 41 States or do something about it. So we will look forward \nto the House action.\n  Again, I thank all my colleagues who participated.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the manager of the bill, the \nSenator from Alaska, who has been a gentleman during these \ndeliberations these past 9 days. It is a hotly contested issue. We hope \nthere is the ability to use reason in this issue, to go ahead and site \nthe permanent repository wherever it should be and use good science to \njudge. But I do extend my appreciation to Senator Murkowski and his \nstaff for the courtesies they have extended to the Senators from Nevada \nand look forward to working with him in the future on matters of \nimportance.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I extend my thanks to the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee for the tremendous work he has \ndone, very successful work on S. 104. We have picked up votes. Today we \nhad the votes in the Senate to override a Presidential veto, and we saw \nthat action going on right here in the well.\n  I appreciate the work my colleagues from Nevada have done. They have \ncertainly maintained my respect for them and I hope likewise. But \nclearly this Nation needs a permanent repository, and S. 104 moves us \nin that direction. We will now move to the House. I think the value is \nthat the administration now needs to clearly recognize that the \nCongress of the United States in a strong bipartisan way wants to \nresolve this issue and tell the American people it will honor its \ncommitments and its contracts to resolve this major environmental \nissue.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to the chairman, the floor manager, we have had \na spirited and prolonged debate. That is in the best tradition of the \nSenate. I thank him for his personal courtesies in terms of procedure \nin the Chamber so that we were given an opportunity to fully express \nand develop our views.\n  Let me say to my colleagues who voted against this bill, I know that \nfor a number of them it was particularly difficult. That vote was in \nthe interest of good science. I appreciate their courage. I appreciate \ntheir support. Senator Rockefeller could not be here this morning \nbecause he has another matter. We appreciate his support, and he \nreaffirmed his support to us in a message earlier today. Several of my \ncolleagues indicated they would be with us to support us on the veto \noverride if it reaches that point. So I think what we have done is to \nallow science and logic to proceed in the development of what is a \nresponsible nuclear waste policy rather than to respond to the emotions \nof the occasion. I appreciate very much my colleagues who stayed with \nus on this important issue and the floor leader and the chairman for \nhis courtesies in permitting us to proceed in an orderly fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not want to prolong this any further, but I must also \njoin in congratulating the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the Senator from Alaska. He has done a great job. He spent a \nlot of time on this bill, both this year and last year. He has been \npatient. He has done a magnificent job.\n  I also commend the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] for his work, and \nalso again express my appreciation to the Senators from Nevada. I know \nit is a very difficult issue for them. They have been vigorous in their \nposition on behalf of the people in their State to oppose this \nlegislation but have also been gentlemen about it, and I extend my \nappreciation to them.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also rise to commend my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle who have participated in the debate that has \njust now been completed. This is really the way it ought to be. This \nwas a very difficult, emotional, contentious issue, an issue that \ninvolved Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the aisle on either \nside of the issue. It is appropriate that at times like this we commend \nboth sides, both leaders for their civility and for the way in which \nthis issue was presented to this body. It was a good debate, a debate \nin my view that brought out the very complex nature of this \nlegislation.\n  So on behalf of all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I \ncommend Senator Murkowski and the senior Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig], and especially our colleagues from Nevada, Mr. Reid and Mr. \nBryan. They all represented themselves well. They did the debate proud. \nI think it portends well for future debates on just as complex and \ncontroversial issues. I commend our Senators and appreciate very much \nthe manner with which they conducted themselves in the last week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n                            ____________________\n  \n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3135-6", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\n\n\n REGARDING FLOOR PRIVILEGES FOR DISABLED PERSONS REQUIRING SUPPORTING \n                                SERVICES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been working this morning with all \nSenators, including the distinguished Democratic leader, to resolve a \nmatter that emerged yesterday with regard to permitting access to the \nSenate floor of guide dogs and other equipment needed by disabled \nindividuals. The resolution I am about to offer will allow the Sergeant \nat Arms to work immediately with staffers who have the need for guide \ndogs to be able to access the floor on a case-by-case basis. The \nresolution also calls for the Committee on Rules and Administration to \nconsider a formal change in the Senate rules to address the situation. \nA permanent resolution is expected to be brought out of the committee \nbefore the full Senate so that we can have a formal rule on how matters \nof this nature will be handled.\n  Again, I thank all Senators involved for their thoughtfulness in \naddressing the matter immediately. I think it is the right thing to do, \nand I am pleased that with today's action, assuming we can get this \nagreed to, the Senate will address an inequity that has been brought \nbefore us and we will remove roadblocks in the way of individuals \nhelping us to serve the American people in the Senate.\n  The chairman of the Rules Committee has been involved in this \ndiscussion, the ranking member. I believe we have touched bases on both \nsides, and I believe this is an appropriate resolution to an immediate \nproblem but also one that can be addressed by the appropriate committee \nso that the rules will be a little clearer as to how this type of \nsituation will be addressed in the future.\n  Before I ask unanimous consent, I wonder; I see the Democratic \nleader, if he wanted to comment. Would the Senator like me to yield for \ncomment before we get unanimous consent?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for his \nexpeditious handling of this matter. This has only recently been \npresented as a problem to the body, and I think the manner in which the \nmajority leader is handling it represents sensitivity to the issue and \na recognition for the need for some practical application of our \ncurrent rules. And so I am very supportive of the effort that he and \nhis colleagues are making in this regard, and I hope that we can see \nthis matter resolved successfully today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then that an \nindividual with a disability who has or is granted the privilege of the \nSenate floor may bring those supporting services, including service \ndogs, wheelchairs, and interpreters, on the Senate floor, which the \nSenate Sergeant at Arms determines are necessary and appropriate to \nassist the disabled individual in discharging the official duties of \nhis or her position until the Committee on Rules and Administration has \nthe opportunity to properly consider the matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now send a resolution the desk dealing \nwith the same subject and ask that it be appropriately referred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3154-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

April 15, we all know that date; 40 percent of the \nAmerican taxpayers file their returns within the last 48 hours as the \nclosing day comes for filing personal income tax returns. This year, \nfor about the third year in succession, I did my own tax return. I do \nnot know how many of my colleagues in the Senate and House do that. But \nI think it is a good educational experience. Perhaps we should pass a \nlaw that every Member of Congress should complete their own income tax \nreturns. It might urge us on to reform the system and make it simpler \nso that families across America will have a little easier time of it in \npaying their taxes and meeting their responsibility to this Nation.\n  When it comes to responsibility, there is also a responsibility in \nthis Senate Chamber. April 15 is another deadline. April 15 is a \ndeadline for passing a budget resolution. By this time we are required \nby law to have passed a budget resolution and started the \nappropriations process.\n  I have been on Capitol Hill, I guess this is my 15th year, and I do \nnot think I have ever seen happen what has happened this year because \nnow April 15 will come and go without even so much as a real debate on \na budget resolution. The President sent his version to Capitol Hill. I \ndisagreed with some parts of it. But everyone had to concede that his \napproach to balancing the budget would in fact balance the budget. He \nmet his obligation. He started the process. Of course, when it comes to \nCongress, that is not under the President's control, nor should it be. \nThat is the control of the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate. The ball is on their side of the net. It is their time to put \ntogether a budget resolution and to spell out for the American people \nin very specific terms how can we reach a balanced budget.\n  Just a few weeks ago we spent 2 weeks, maybe 3, perhaps 4 weeks, in \nthe Chamber here debating an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States, an amendment which said Congress has no choice; it must \nbalance the budget. I voted against it.\n  I did not think we needed to put into our Constitution an obligation \nwhich we all know we must accept. So many people on the other side, my \nfriends on the Republican side, and a few Democrats stood up and said, \n``No, no, no, we need to have a constitutional imperative to force us \nto act.'' Little did I know that just a few weeks later they would \nprove themselves true. The Republican leadership has been unable or \nunwilling to come forward with their offering about balancing the \nbudget.\n  The other night at the radio/TV correspondents' dinner the President \nhad an interesting observation about how slow the pace is on Capitol \nHill and, frankly, how boring it becomes as we go in, week in and week \nout, in the House and Senate, without addressing the real issues. The \nPresident said that the pace on Capitol Hill is so slow that C-SPAN, \nthe television network which covers our hearings, has decided to play \nreruns from the previous Congress so people will keep up their interest \non Capitol Hill.\n  It is an amusing observation. I do not believe it is necessarily \ntrue, but it does reflect on the fact that for some reason we cannot \nget started up here this year. For some reason, Republican leadership \nhas been unable to come forward with their offering for a budget \nresolution. Why would that be? Why would a party that is so dedicated \nto a constitutional amendment to force a balanced budget have such a \ndifficult time meeting its statutory obligation to produce that budget \nresolution on the floor?\n  The answer is fairly obvious: Because they have set up certain \nconditions for a balanced budget which they themselves cannot meet. \nThey have suggested we should include tax cuts in any kind of balanced \nbudget scenario. Coming out for tax cuts on April 15 may be the most \npopular thing a politician can do. But let's be very honest about it, \nas Senator Dole learned in the last campaign, just promising a tax cut \nis not enough. The American people have to understand it is attainable, \nit\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nis reasonable, it will not in fact blow up our efforts to balance the \nbudget. I think that is the problem that the majority, the Republicans, \nface here--how to meet the obligation of satisfying all of their \nrhetoric about tax cuts and still meet their obligation to balance the \nbudget. Unfortunately, it does not work.\n  They found 2 years ago when they were pushing a tax cut package even \nsmaller than this one, they had reached such a crisis stage that we \nshut down the Government. We shut down the Government for the longest \nperiod of time in our Nation's history. That worries me, because I am \nafraid we may be on that same road again.\n  I have the Durbin plan for dealing with Government shutdowns. There \nare two parts to it. The first part is a piece of legislation which \nsays, ``No dessert until you clean your plate.'' Remember when Mom and \nDad used to say that? I think we ought to say that when it comes to the \nbusiness of Congress. Here is what I am driving at. I do not believe \nthat we should consider the appropriation to keep Congress running on \nCapitol Hill until every other appropriation bill is passed. So, if \nthere is going to be a Government shutdown of any agency, it will \nnecessarily also shut down Congress. I think that will focus our \nattention on the fact that we cannot abide by a Government shutdown or \nimpose on innocent Federal employees that sort of scenario.\n  Second, the last time there was a shutdown under the leadership of \nthe 104th Congress, three of us, I believe, in the House of \nRepresentatives said as long as the Government is shutting down, we are \nnot going to take a paycheck, and we did not. If every other Member of \nthe House and Senate would hew to the same standard, I will guarantee \nyou will never see another Government shutdown.\n  But, now, where are we? Where are the Republicans headed? What is \ntheir plan for balancing the budget? Will they stick with this massive \ntax cut package they cannot pay for? Will they turn around and try to \ncut Medicare again, as deeply as they did last time? Will they make \ncuts in educational programs like college student loans? Will they cut \nenvironmental protection efforts, like toxic waste cleanup? I hope they \nare not on that course. But I do hope they are on the course of meeting \ntheir statutory obligation to produce a budget resolution, as they were \nrequired to under the law, today, April 15, tax day.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be brief. But I just wanted to thank the Senator \nfrom Illinois for, in his very direct way, putting this issue before \nthe American people. The Senator and I served on the Budget Committee \nin the House of Representatives for many years. And I serve here on the \nBudget Committee. I have never seen a situation like this before. The \nSenator talked about the no budget no pay legislation. While he was \nfighting for that in the House, I was here in the Senate fighting for \nthat as well; and some of us over here gave our pay to charity during \nthat period.\n  I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not want \nto have another Government shutdown. As a matter of fact, some of them \nare going to introduce legislation to pass a permanent continuing \nresolution and avoid such a shutdown. Frankly, I am glad they are \nthinking along the lines of avoiding a shutdown. But that really begs \nthe question of the day. That is the cowardly way out. If we cannot get \nour act together, we admit it now, we are introducing legislation to \njust keep the Government going at the old rate even though, by the way, \nthings are changing and we need to react to what the people want. But \nthey will continue it going to avoid the heat of a Government shutdown.\n  The fact is, where is the budget? Tonight, late at night, there will \nbe a rush at mailboxes all across this country of people mailing in \ntheir tax returns. They have to get an extension if they do not meet \nthe deadline. Where is this extension? I have yet to see a budget.\n  In my closing remarks to the Senator from Illinois, I say to him, \ndoes he remember anything quite like this? I know some deadlines have \nbeen missed in the past, but in my memory, that does go back a ways. At \nleast we had a budget out there. We may not have dotted all the i's, \ncrossed all the t's, and come to a conclusion by this time, but we \nalways had that budget document out there.\n  Where we stand today is the President has a budget document out \nthere. It balances by the year 2002, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. The Republicans do not like that budget. Fair enough. \nThat is why they are Republicans. They have different values. They do \nnot want to see the increases in education. They do not want to see the \nincreases for the environment. They want to give tax breaks to the very \nwealthy while the President is targeting those tax breaks to middle-\nclass people who need help sending their kids to college, and so on. So \nthat is fair game.\n  But now I want to see their budget. That is what they have to do. \nThat is their responsibility. They keep saying they want a balanced \nbudget amendment, as my friend said. That did not do anything to \nbalance the budget. It was just a lot of rhetoric, and some of us said \nthat at the time. Where is your plan? The fact is, without one \nRepublican vote we have seen this deficit go down from $290 billion to \nwhat is it now projected to be, $91 billion? That is an extraordinary \nrecord of accomplishment.\n  So all we are saying here in our own way, it seems to me, and what \nthe Senator is saying--and I would ask for his comment --is we have \nnever seen a situation where the majority party was so afraid to offer \na budget; we have never seen a situation where they did not have the \ncourage to lay down their priorities. I wonder if my friend agrees, if \nthis is really an unprecedented situation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from California. She and I served \ntogether on the House Budget Committee, and I agree with her. In 15 \nyears, I have never seen anything like this. For some reason, the \nBudget Committee is on vacation when it is supposed to be on the job. \nThe statute says get moving by April 15, give us a budget resolution. \nWe have an appropriations process to get started in the House, to move \nforward on in the Senate, and it cannot get started until we figure out \nwhat our priorities in spending are going to be. That is a very \ndifficult thing to do with the high-flying rhetoric. The Republicans \nran for the House and Senate saying, ``Let us lead.'' And these steely-\neyed, styptic-hearted conservatives said, ``We know how to balance a \nbudget. Out of the way, bleeding-heart liberals. Give us a chance. \nWe'll get rid of all this red ink. We'll get you on the straight and \nnarrow.''\n  Where is the budget? I don't see it. What do we have to do? As the \nSenator suggested earlier this morning, do we have to send out dogs to \nsniff out this budget? Where is it? Where on the floor? Is it in one of \nthe committee meeting rooms on Capitol Hill? In one of the think tanks? \nDoes the Heritage Foundation have a budget they want to send up here \nfor us to take up? What are we waiting for? The American people met \ntheir obligation today. Some of them are sitting down right now saying, \n``Oh, my goodness, I have to finish this 1040 form. I have a legal \nresponsibility to do it. My family is going to meet its legal \nresponsibility.'' When is this Congress going to meet its legal \nresponsibility to find and prepare a budget resolution which keeps up \nwith the rhetoric which we have heard now time and again in this \nChamber and across the Nation?\n  I thank the Senator for her leadership. I think the President has at \nleast given us a starting document. Now, to my friends in the majority, \non the Republican side, it is certainly your turn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One of the reasons we do not have a budget brought to the \nSenate on time--and today is the date it is supposed to be here--is \nbecause, frankly, the proposal they would offer does not add up, and \nthey know it. They are proposing very substantial tax cuts, the \nmajority of which will go to the upper-income folks in this country, \nand you cannot balance the budget with the kind of tax cuts they \npropose, especially the kind of tax cuts that will go to upper-income \nfolks.\n\n  This morning, on NPR, a Republican commentator said something. I \nwould\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nlike to read it to my friend from Illinois and my friend from \nCalifornia, because I think it is important. He is talking specifically \nabout the capital gains tax cut, and the Citizens For Tax Justice \nprovide a chart to show who gets what from the tax cuts offered by the \nmajority party. The top 20 percent get nearly 80 percent of the tax \ncuts, the bottom 60 percent get about 8 percent of the tax cuts.\n  But here is what Kevin Phillips had to say this morning. He said:\n\n       It's time to put [this issue] on the table--the argument \n     that because Congressmen and Senators want capital gains tax \n     cuts as a payoff to their big contributors, that's a good \n     reason to block it as a powerful beginning for reforming \n     campaign finance.\n\n  This is a Republican, Kevin Phillips, who says this morning:\n\n       Think about it. The experts say that two-thirds of the \n     benefit from the Senate Republican leadership's cap-gain cut \n     proposal would go to the top 1% of Americans income-wise. \n     That's exactly the same crowd that gives big [campaign] \n     contributions. Anybody who believes that linkage is a \n     coincidence probably believes in the tooth fairy, too.\n\n  It is not me speaking. This is Kevin Phillips, a Republic \ncommentator. Let me continue.\n\n       Let me stipulate. The deficit-cutter case against the cap-\n     gain cut is overwhelming, too, because it's such a huge \n     boondoggle. Over the next ten years, the Senate's proposed \n     reduction would cost the government some somewhere between \n     133 billion dollars and 237 billion dollars [in lost income]. \n     The 133 billion dollar estimate comes from the conservative-\n     run Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation and the 237 \n     billion dollar estimate comes from the liberal-run Citizens \n     For Tax Justice. The truth is probably somewhere in the \n     middle, which would be about 185 billion dollars over ten \n     years, which would have to be paid for--literally--with \n     massive cuts in programs for ordinary Americans or with \n     deficit spending.\n\n  Again, Kevin Phillips, a Republican commentator, says this morning on \nNPR:\n\n       Worse still, it's not a worthy outlay. It's just pork for \n     fat-cat political donors. The rate reduction [from capital \n     gains] obviously isn't needed to encourage more investment. \n     The last six or eight years have seen enormous amounts of \n     money invested under the present tax rate. And experts have \n     scoffed at claims in which hired economists say the cuts are \n     badly needed for capital formation. Even Herbert Stein, a \n     former Republican Chairman of the President's Council of \n     Economic Advisers, argues that only economic activity that \n     could be counted on from a cap gains cut would be more \n     activity by accountants and lawyers in converting other \n     income into capital gains.\n\n  Again, Kevin Phillips continuing. He says:\n\n       Cutting the capital gains rate across the board, for every \n     kind of quick-buck tax ploy, isn't policy, it's pandering. It \n     isn't serious legislation, and Congress knows that; it's a \n     payback to big contributors. Relief for small businessmen, \n     like for homeowners, may justify giving every household a one \n     or two hundred thousand dollar lifetime capital gains \n     exemption. But tens of billions of dollars worth of cap gains \n     cuts for the people who've just flooded the Republican and \n     Democratic parties with hundreds of millions of dollars worth \n     of record-level 1995-96 campaign contributions would be the \n     political equivalent of bribery. Blocking that pork feast, by \n     contrast, would send an important message: a message that \n     reform of campaign finance is already underway.\n\n  Again, this is a Republican commentator. Incidentally, his last \nsuggestion is one that I authored as a piece of legislation. I said, \nlet us take, for every American--every American--let us give them an \nopportunity for a $250,000 capital gains income, if they have held the \nasset for 10 years, to be taken with zero tax liability; a quarter of a \nmillion dollars during one's lifetime, zero tax liability if you hold \nthe asset 10 years. But let's not go back to the full-blown capital \ngains approach, where you hold a share of stock for 6 months and 1 day \nand sell it and pay half the tax someone who works all day pays. It's \nthe same old approach by those in this Congress, and there are plenty \nof them, who say: Let us have a tax system that deals with different \ngroups in different ways. Let us decide that those who invest shall pay \nno tax and those who work shall pay a significant tax. In other words, \nlet us have a tax on work but not a tax on investment.\n  What kind of sense does that make? Let us tax work but not tax \ninvestment? There are a lot of streams of income in this country. Guess \nwho has most of the investment income? Most of the folks at the upper \nlevel, the same folks who are giving the campaign contributions.\n  That is why these plans that say, ``Let's go ahead and tax work and \nwe will exempt investment,'' and when they exempt the tax on \ninvestment, what they do is propose plans that give the bulk of the tax \nbenefits to a very small group of upper income taxpayers, and the \nresult of that is, of course, the budgets do not add up.\n  If the budget does not add up to a balanced budget, then you cannot \nmeet the budget deadline of April 15 and bring a budget to the floor \nthat completes what you said you were going to do, and that is balance \nthe Federal budget. The only people in the Senate who have done what is \nnecessary to take this country on a road to a balanced budget are those \nwho, in 1993, stood up here in the face of opposition and in the face \nof criticism and said, ``Count me in, this is a deficit reduction \npackage. I am willing to vote for it and it is tough medicine because \nit cuts spending and does increase some revenue, but count me in, \nbecause I am for reducing the budget deficit.''\n  I was one of those who voted for that. The easiest vote by far would \nhave been to say, ``I'm AWOL, I'm out of here, don't count on me for a \nvote. All I want to do is talk about balancing the budget, and when it \nis time to do something about it, I am gone.''\n  I did not do that, nor did the majority of my colleagues. We passed \nthat bill by one vote. We did not get one vote from the other side of \nthe aisle. Those who talked the loudest about balancing the budget did \nnot offer one vote to reduce the budget deficit. It has been reduced \nwell over 60 percent. Now we need to do the rest of the job.\n  Today is the day by which the budget is supposed to come to the \nSenate to do the rest of the job. Why is it not here? It is not here \nbecause the majority party cannot bring a budget to the floor of the \nSenate that adds up that reaches balance. Why can they not do that? \nBecause they are proposing very large tax cuts that go, in most cases, \nto the largest income earners in this country.\n  The Washington Times had a piece the other day from which I want to \nread a couple of paragraphs:\n\n       Major donors told the national committee chairman, Jim \n     Nicholson, they are fed up with the party's congressional \n     leadership and the party can forget about more money from \n     them unless the GOP lawmakers enact tax cuts.\n\n  Shorthand for that: Give us our tax breaks, and we will give you more \nmoney. This comes from something called ``Eagles,'' corporate eagles \nwho give $20,000 a year and individual eagles who give $15,000 a year. \nWhat they are saying is, ``Give us our tax cuts, we'll give you some \nmoney. Withhold the tax cuts, we'll withhold the political \ncontributions.''\n  It is kind of an interesting and dismaying piece, it seems to me. But \nthe fact is, a budget cannot be put together that proposes the kind of \ntax cuts the majority wants and, at the same time, shows that we are \nbalancing the budget. That is the dilemma.\n  Job one in this country, in my judgment, is to balance the budget. I \ndo not happen to think one side is all right and the other side is all \nwrong; they have no answers, we have all the answers. That is not the \ncase at all. But we spent a month and a half in this Chamber talking \nabout amending the Constitution of the United States to require a \nbalanced budget. I pointed out then if the Constitution were altered 1 \nminute from now, 2 minutes from now there would be no difference in the \nFederal deficit, because changing the Constitution does not change the \ndeficit. The only way you change the deficit and reach a balanced \nbudget is the individual taxing-and-spending decisions. That is why \nasking the majority party who controls Congress and controls our agenda \nto bring a balanced budget to the floor today on April 15, which is the \ndeadline in law for them to do so, is an important and right thing for \nthem to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, Senator Conrad, who has \ncomments on this same subject. I yield him as much time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today is an important day for Americans. \nApril 15 is the deadline for all Americans to file and pay their \nindividual taxes. I know that, I was signing my returns yesterday to \nmake sure they were sent\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\noff. I had to write a check--not as big a check as last year, I was \nglad for that, but, nonetheless, had to pay some additional tax in \naddition to what was withheld. All across America, people are engaged \nin that last moment of frantic scrambling to make sure they file their \ntaxes.\n  Today is another deadline as well. Today is the deadline for the \nCongress of the United States to pass the budget for the year. And that \ngives rise to the question that I put on this chart: Where is the \nbudget? We are not going to pass a budget for the next year here today. \nThere is not even one before the U.S. Senate. But it is even worse than \nthat, because the Budget Committee had a deadline of April 1, and we \nhave not even considered a budget in the Budget Committee.\n  I am a member of the Budget Committee and have been a member for 10 \nyears. There is no budget that the Republicans--who control the U.S. \nSenate and the U.S. House, and, as a result, they control the budget \ncommittees--have put before us. We have the budget from the President \nwhich they have criticized, but we have no budget from them. Mr. \nPresident, it is time for those on the other side of the aisle to come \nforward with their budget proposal.\n  What we have heard from them is endless proposals for tax cuts aimed \nat the wealthiest among us. We have heard the Speaker even assert that \nwe can eliminate capital gains taxes and eliminate estate taxes and \nhave a major tax cut for children, but he does not put forward a plan \nthat shows us how this would all add up.\n  Where would the cuts be to not only eliminate the deficit, but to pay \nfor the tax cuts? There is no plan. It is easy to talk about things we \nwould all like to have if you do not ever have to make it add up. The \ndifficult part of the budget process is to try to come up with a plan \nthat will balance the budget. All of us know that requires spending \ncuts. Spending cuts are painful. We also know that there is a need for \ntax reduction in the country.\n  I have supported a plan. We had the centrist coalition last year, 10 \nDemocrats, 10 Republicans, that worked together for hundreds of hours \nand put together a plan that was a consensus of our group on a \nbipartisan basis. We brought that plan to the floor of the Senate, and \nwe received 46 votes, about evenly divided between Democrats and \nRepublicans. Frankly, that is what it is going to take again this year. \nBut when I hear our friends on the other side of the aisle assert that \nit is this side of the aisle that is responsible for budget deficits, I \nthink we then have to talk about the record and talk about the facts.\n  Here is the record and here are the facts. If we look at the last \nthree administrations and look at the record on the deficit, it is very \nclear who has performed and who has talked.\n  This is the record during the Reagan administration. He took office \nin 1981. The unified deficit for that year was $79 billion. It promptly \nshot up to over $200 billion and largely stayed that way through the \nReagan administration.\n  Then the Bush administration came into office and started with a \nunified deficit of $153 billion. By the time the Bush administration \nwas finished, they had a deficit of $290 billion.\n  Then President Clinton came into office, and the first year, the \nunified deficit was $255 billion, and each and every year, the deficit \nwent down: $203 billion the second year of the Clinton administration, \n$164 billion the third year, and this chart shows $116 billion, but it \nactually wound up somewhat better than that. The deficit came in at \n$107 billion.\n  All of that occurred because we put in place a budget plan in 1993 to \ncut spending and, yes, raise revenue on the wealthiest among us. The \nwealthiest 1 percent of this country were asked to pay somewhat more, \nand we cut spending about $250 billion over a 5-year period. Over 10 \nyears, that deficit reduction package reduced the deficit $2.5 \ntrillion. That is an extraordinary record of deficit reduction. In \nfact, now we are told that the unified deficit this year, the year that \nwill end on September 30, will come in at about $91 billion. That will \nbe 5 years in a row of deficit reduction.\n\n  I just think if we are going to have a serious debate here over who \nhas done what, then we ought to look at the facts, and we ought to talk \nabout who, in fact, did have the courage to stand up and vote for that \n1993 budget package, which the other side said would crater the \neconomy. They said it would increase the deficit. They said it would \nincrease unemployment. They said it would reduce economic growth.\n  They were wrong on every single score. It reduced the deficit every \nsingle year. It reduced unemployment. We have had nearly 12 million \njobs created in the United States since we put that plan in place, and \nwe have had a large economic expansion in this country. That is the \nrecord. Those are the facts.\n  If we are going to finally achieve closure of this and actually \nbalance the budget, then it is going to take both sides working \ntogether, because the Republicans control the Congress, the Democrats \ncontrol the White House, and nothing is going to happen unless we work \ntogether.\n  Last year, those of us who participated in the centrist coalition \nthat involved Democrats and Republicans on an equal basis found the \neffort one of the most rewarding we have engaged in while we have been \nprivileged to be part of this body, because we did work together. \nNobody was running out and holding press conferences attacking the \nother side. Nobody was trying to get over on the other side. There were \nno raised voices. There was calm reasoning to try to achieve a result \nthat we all understood was important for our country.\n  Why is it important for the country? Mr. President, what is at stake \nhere is the economic future of the country. This chart shows our \nchildren's economic position in the year 2035 in terms of the gross \nnational product of the United States. This is on a per person basis.\n  Very recently, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report and \ntold us this: If we fail to act, the per capita size of our economy \nwill be $33,200 in the year 2035. But if we would balance the budget on \na unified basis--and I do not consider a unified balance a true \nbalancing of the budget, but at least it is a step in the right \ndirection--then the per capita size of our economy would be $40,900 in \nthe year 2035. We would have much more income per person in this \ncountry if we moved toward balancing the budget. That is the message of \nthis chart.\n  Why is that the case? It is the case because if we are not deficit \nspending, we are not eating into the societal savings account. The more \nsavings you have, the more investment that is possible. The more \ninvestment you have, the stronger the economic growth. That is the key \nto the future of America's economy, and it is why it is critically \nimportant to actually balance the budget. It is not just some abstract \nidea. It is critically important to the economic future and health of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, we hear some on the other side saying they are going \nto cut this tax, that tax, we are going to cut all taxes. On our side, \nwe say we ought to have targeted tax relief. Middle-class families need \ntax relief. We are in favor of that. When we start talking about \nreducing taxes that primarily are paid by the wealthiest among us, it \nreally does not make sense to do that and jeopardize balancing the \nbudget. Why not? Because the biggest help that we can be to this \neconomy is to balance that budget.\n\n  Let me just indicate that when people start talking about what will \nhelp promote growth in this economy, they look closely at the benefits \nof balancing the budget. Balancing the unified budget is expected to \nreduce interest rates by about 1 percent. In an economy with $14.5 \ntrillion in nonfinancial sector debt, a 1-percent reduction in interest \nrates means an $145 billion boost to the economy in 1 year. That dwarfs \nany of the tax cuts that are being talked about in terms of providing a \nlift to the economy.\n  So the truth of the matter is the best tax cut that we can give, the \nbest tax cut, the most effective tax cut, is one that leads to a \nbalanced budget. The only way we do that, obviously, is to cut spending \nthat has contributed to the budget deficit, and have a revenue stream \nthat balances with the spending. That is how you balance a budget. It \nis not just spending. It is the combination of spending and revenue \nthat has to be in balance.\n  So those who talk about massive tax cuts will have to come down here \nat some point with a plan that shows how\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\nit adds up. They have not done it. They did not do it by April 1 in the \nBudget Committee which was their responsibility. They have not done it \nby today, which is by law their responsibility. So we are waiting. We \nare asking the question, where is the budget? When they come with a \nbudget plan, it needs to add up. That is in the long-term interests of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from North Dakota a \nquestion. Senator Conrad is on the Senate Budget Committee and, as he \nindicated, the legal date for the completion of work on a budget by \nCongress is April 15. In fact, a couple of years ago, we heard some \nfolks here on the floor of the Senate and in the House say, ``The \nPresident is irrelevant. We control the Congress. We will write a \nbudget and we will ram this thing home. It does not matter what the \nPresident thinks.''\n  Now we hear the story, ``What the President thinks matters to us. We \nwill not do a budget unless the President comes to the table.'' The \nPresident submitted a budget, but my understanding is that the Budget \nCommittee in both the House and Senate have not moved forward to say, \n``Here is what we in Congress think ought to comprise a budget.''\n  Again, my notion is that it was not done because there is not any way \nto add this up. If you want to give giant tax reductions, most of which \nwill go to the upper income folks, and say that is what we promised, \nbut we also promised a balanced budget, the best way to avoid the \nconflict of a budget that does not add up is to not submit one, do not \nshow your hand.\n  Is that what is happening in the Budget Committee?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am afraid it is. The law says: ``Before April 15 of \neach year, the Congress shall complete action on a concurrent \nresolution on the budget for the fiscal year beginning on October 1.''\n  We are not just supposed to have completed the budget in this \nChamber. The entire Congress is to have completed the budget plan by \ntoday. We have not even started. We have not even started in the Senate \nBudget Committee to consider a plan. I fear the reason is that our \ncolleagues on the other side and all over America in the last campaign \npromised they would cut this tax, that tax, and every tax, and when \nthey came back here to try to see how it would add up, they find, wait \na minute, it does not add up. In fact, the only way you can get it to \nadd up is to have cuts that are even deeper than the ones they proposed \nlast year in Medicare, education, and environmental protection.\n  So our friends on the other side have a real problem. The problem is \ntheir rhetoric does not match reality. The problem is they do not have \na plan that adds up. It does not balance.\n  As I said in my statement, what is critically important is that we \nwork together to get a plan that does balance. That will be the best \nthing we can do for American taxpayers and the American economy. It \nwill mean greater economic growth. It will mean a stronger economy. As \nI indicated, a 1-percent reduction in interest rates, which is what the \neconomists tell us we will get if we balance the budget, will save \nthose who have debt--corporations, individuals, families--$145 billion \nin a year. That will provide more lift to the economy. That is the best \nlift we can give this economy of anything that we could do.\n\n  We favor targeted tax relief to middle-income folks that, in fact, \nare under a lot of economic pressure. That makes sense. Some of these \ntax schemes the people have floated that give the overwhelming weight \nof the tax reduction to the wealthiest among us, and then do not permit \nyou to have a plan that adds up, does not make any sense. It is not the \nright course for the country. I think that is why they really have not \ncome up with a plan. They have not begun to come up with a plan because \nmost of those who have tried to get these numbers to add up know that \nthey do not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator, did the Senator hear my reading of the \nWashington Times story in which the Eagles from the Republican Party \nsaid to the party chairman, look, we are not going to contribute more \nmoney if you do not give us some of these tax breaks. We are tired of \ncontributing money and getting nothing for it. That is not quite the \nway they said it, but it is how it reads.\n  It reminds me of the movie ``Jerry McGuire,'' toward the end of the \nmovie the fellow is knocked out of the end zone, laying there holding \nthe football, and gets up and rushes around the stadium. If you \nremember his chant during the entire movie ``Show me the money, show me \nthe money.'' That is what that message was in the Washington Times \nreport from the Eagles, ``Show us the money.''\n  The dilemma here is you cannot cut $500 billion or $550 billion in \ntaxes and promise everything to everybody and then come to the floor of \nthe Senate and say, ``By the way, here is our plan to balance the \nbudget.'' Cut your revenue by half a trillion dollars and then balance \nthe budget? No, what you do is create a giant hole and increase the \nFederal deficit.\n  We had a fellow named Laffer who constructed the Laffer curve, used \nin the early 1980's. It turns out to be a ``laugher.'' He said, ``You \ncan cut the taxes, especially for those at the top, because we believe \nin trickle down, where you pour in at the top and it all trickles down \nto help everybody else.'' Some of us believe in the ``percolate up,'' \ngive something to the bottom and it percolates up. Nonetheless, the \nLaffer curve would have substantial cuts, and somehow you balance the \nbudget.\n  What happened was the largest deficits in the history of this \ncountry. Double the defense budget--that was the Reagan recipe, double \nthe defense budget--cut taxes, and you end up with very large deficits. \nThat does not come from me. That comes from David Stockman, who did it, \nwho wrote a book afterward and said what a terrible thing to have done, \nand then we bear the results of that.\n  But those of us who in 1993 cast tough votes for a plan that said do \nwhat is necessary to march down the road to really balance the budget, \nwe have taken tough steps to do this. We have marched in the right \ndirection, but we are not there. We get there when we have balanced the \nbudget. Senator Conrad is talking about the requirement to do that.\n  I personally would like to see us essentially say, balance the budget \nfirst, and then talk about the Tax Code. There is plenty wrong in the \nTax Code to the extent the upper income folks do not pay what they \nshould or to the extent $30 billion that corporations ought to be \npaying, they are not. That means working people are paying higher taxes \nthan they should. We ought to relieve them of that burden.\n  What I would like to do is balance the budget and then turn to the \nTax Code and make the right decisions about the Tax Code. The right \ndecision is not to say those who invest shall be tax-exempt and those \nwho work shall be taxed. In effect, saying as they do every day, tax \nwork and exempt investors. Gee, that sounds pretty good for those \nfolks, because guess who supports them? The investors. They are saying \nexempt the folks who support us, and tax all the working folks. What \nabout exempting workers? Capital gains cut--what about a workers' gains \ncut? Is there not a workers' gain when you have a circumstance where \nyou have an increase in productivity but you have inflation that \ndevalues some of their earnings? What about a workers' gains cut? Why \nis it always capital? They say no, tax work and exempt investors. What \na wrongheaded approach. Yes, help investors, but you do not help \ninvestors by saying, ``By the way, you are a privileged group of \npeople. You get to be tax-exempt,'' because they are so intending to do \nthat in such a significant way there is not any way to add this up.\n\n  There is only one arithmetic book, and you start when you are young. \nAdding is simple. One plus one equals two, two plus two equals four, \nand I can go further than that because I went to a pretty good school, \nbut it does not add up.\n  Today is April 15. The budget is supposed to be here by law. Tonight, \nevery newscast will show there is a traffic jam at the post office \nbecause people are pushing to file their return for April 15, but the \ndeadline to bring a budget to this floor of the Senate is not going to \nbe met.\n  Guess what? The folks that run this place will be sleeping at \nmidnight. They will not be in the post office or\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\ndriving around looking for a mail drop. They will be sleeping. Why? \nBecause their plan does not add up.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe they ought to have to file for an extension.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Maybe we should ask before the 12 o'clock postmark is \nnecessary, maybe at least they ought to file for an extension today.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could just add, I think one of the things that gets \nlost is why balancing the budget has so much merit. If we balance the \nbudget and the economists are correct that that would reduce interest \nrates by 1 percent, that would mean on a typical mortgage, a savings of \n$900 a year. Over 5 years it would be over $4,500 in savings for a \nhomeowner. On a car loan, that would be savings of $400, and \napproximately $1,000 a year in savings to the typical North Dakota \nfarmer because of interest savings.\n  I think we have to keep our eye on the ball here. The first and most \nimportant step we can take is to balance this budget. That will reduce \ninterest expenses on nonfinancial sector debt by $145 billion. That \nwill provide enormous lift to this economy. That is really the single \nbest thing we could do for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the minority will \nexpire at 11:30, so you have 2 or 3 minutes. You can extend that by \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I had asked unanimous consent at 10:45 when we began to \nbegin the hour allotted to the majority leader, and that was my \nintention in the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Chair apologizes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from South \nCarolina, Senator Hollings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3154-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3159-S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRUTH IN BUDGETING\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss truth in \nbudgeting. Let me emphasize ``truth in budgeting.'' We do not \nappreciate, Mr. President, the reality. The reality is that we are \ngiving billions and billions more in Government than we are willing to \npay for.\n  In fact, Mr. President, from the year 1945 when President Truman was \nin office until 1980, when President Reagan came in, the deficits were \nan average of $20 billion. Whereas for the last 16 years, the average \nhas been $277 billion. So for the last 16 years everybody is running \naround and pointing fingers as to the blame, while we have been giving \n$277 billion more in Government than we are willing to pay for.\n  Now, a couple of years ago, my distinguished colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle kept saying, ``If you want to change the Congress you \nhave to change the Congressman. If you want to change the Senate, you \nhave to change the Senator,'' and the American people said ``fine, that \nis what we will do.'' But instead of getting change, instead of getting \na proposed budget where we pay up here for the Government we are \ngiving, we get into this big folderol about leadership and everything \nelse.\n\n  Under the Constitution, the Congress legislates, the President \nexecutes. It is our responsibility to legislate. In fact, the \nconcurrent resolution for a budget is not even signed by the President. \nYet, this weekend I had to listen to the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee on the House side, Mr. Kasich, say, ``If the President \ncould only show leadership and step up to the plate.'' They have all \nthe jargon and litany--``if he can only show some responsibility,'' and \n``if he only had the courage.'' Well, he has put up a budget. He \nmaintains that his budget is balanced by the year 2002. There is a \nserious question about that, obviously. But at least he put up a \nbudget. Now, from January to June, we are still hearing the chairmen of \nthe Budget Committees on both sides of the Capitol asking for \nleadership and courage and everything else, when that is what they \nasked the American people for and received. We have a Republican \nCongress; where is the Republican budget? It is just totally out of \nwhole cloth around here; we can't get the truth about where we are.\n  Now, going right to the point about their being derelict as to their \nresponsibility. All of us have been derelict as to the reality of the \ndeficit. All you need do is the simple arithmetic to find out how much \nthe debt increases each year and to determine your deficit, not this \nunified Mickey Mouse thing which uses borrowed funds. The unified \ndeficit is the one that was used all of last year during the campaign, \nand it was used the day before yesterday on the Sunday morning talk \nshows. David Broder used it in his column, and all the responsible \nwriters use it. The number they use is $107 billion. Totally false. \nTotally false.\n  To get the actual deficit, you just subtract the increase from one \nyear to the next, and you can find that the actual deficit was $261 \nbillion. How do they get to the $107 billion? Well, Mr. President, they \nborrow $154 billion. You borrow $154 billion from Social Security, from \nMedicare, from the civil service retirement, from military retirement, \nand you go right on down the list until you get to $107 billion. Why \nnot borrow that $107 billion and say the budget is balanced?\n  What kind of gamesmanship are we playing? When are we going to get \nthe truth out of the free press in America and quit quoting a silly \nfigure that doesn't reflect the reality. The reality, Mr. President, is \nwhen that deficit grows to $261 billion this year, and you add that \namount to the debt and the existing interest costs, this conduct, along \nwith Mr. Greenspan's, causes your interest costs to go through the \nroof. In fact, right now, interest costs are estimated at $360 billion \nfor 1997. That was the CBO figure before the increase in interest \nrates. So the figure is now around $1 billion a day--$365 billion, or \neven more.\n  Mr. President, today is April 15. Today, everyone is required to pay \ntheir income tax. I just got this table from CBO which says the total \namount paid in individual income tax is estimated to be $676 billion. \nWe are already 6\\1/2\\ months into our fiscal year. Therefore, when I \nsay a billion dollars a day in interest costs, what I am saying is that \nthe people of America worked from October of last year up until today, \nincome tax day, April 15, for what? To pay for the wasteful interest \ncosts in Government, and this charade that continues. Half of our \nNation's income taxes go to pay for interest costs on the national \ndebt. Even if we get a little bit of savings from the CPI, a little bit \nfrom Medicare, we are still way off. I will be joining with the Blue \nDogs; we are working out the figures right now for a budget freeze--no \nincrease in taxes, no cut in taxes, no back-end loading. And even then, \nwithout the borrowings, it is going to take you 5 more years, until \n2007 rather than 2002, for a true balanced budget.\n  The American people should understand that we are playing a game up \nhere to buy the vote, so we can all get reelected again next year. We \nhave been doing that for the past 16 years with this silly Reaganomics \nand the litany of growth, growth. One fellow, Stevie Forbes, wrote \n``hope, growth, and opportunity.'' You turn on all the programs, and \nthe discussions are all about inheritance taxes and the capital gains \ntax. ``Just do away with the IRS and the income tax,'' they say. We are \ntalking out of whole cloth. We act like that is reality. We cannot \nafford tax cuts. Look at the figures. The domestic budget is $266 \nbillion. The defense budget is $267 billion. Look on page 36 of your \nbudget book. Entitlement spending is $859 billion. That comes, Mr. \nPresident, to $1.382 trillion. Then you add interest costs of $360 \nbillion, and that is $1.742 trillion. To get down to CBO's projected \nrevenues of $1.632 trillion, we have to cut $110 billion.\n\n  Now, that's the job that we have at hand--not capital gains, not \ninheritance taxes, not getting rid of the IRS and income taxes. Yes, \ntaxes are too much. Why are they too much? Because of the interest \ncosts on the national debt. If you go back to 1980, it was $74.8 \nbillion. We have literally added just about $300 billion in interest \ncosts on the national debt that must be paid up first. It is just like \ntaxes. You might call them an increase in taxes each day of $1 billion. \nWe are running around here cutting taxes while we are increasing their \ntaxes $1 billion a day. But if you had that $300 billion, Mr. \nPresident, we could balance the budget, we could get improve \ntechnology, we could pave the highways, repair the bridges, give more \nstudent loans, and\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\nwe could have double the research at NIH. We could do all these things. \nTaxes are too high. But why are they high? For the silly charade. There \nis no better word for this off-Broadway show that goes on out here, \nwithout the reality, without the truth in budgeting. These people act \nas if we have the luxury of cutting taxes because they are too high.\n  You have to cut the interest costs on the debt. You have to start \npaying for the Government we have. They have been meeting since January \nto decide how can we get both sides to go along with a fraud; one grand \nfraud is what this is. You know it, and I know it. We will get my \nbudget realities chart up here later on, and I will be glad to give \npeople copies of it.\n  There is no question in my mind that this fraud has to be exposed \nbecause these interest costs, which are really taxes, are eating us \nalive. By cutting taxes, we are really saying ``let's increase the \ndeficit, the debt, and interest costs.'' If the people don't understand \nthat, every one of these writers should tell you that. It is not \ncomplicated at all. All you have to do is go from year to year. And we \nare still going to borrow from the Social Security, which is illegal. \nWe passed a law of the Budget Act, section 13301, that said thou shalt \nnot use Social Security trust funds in order to lower the deficit or in \nreporting it. Yet they violate it.\n  They are running around wanting to know who slept in the Lincoln \nbedroom or who flew on the Air Force One plane. Come on, when are we \ngoing to get to work on the real problem? That is why the American \npeople have no confidence in this institution up here. We don't tell \nthe truth. I remember my friend, Bill Proxmire, who got up here every \nday on a certain treaty. Finally, after about 6 or 7 years, he got some \nattention. I don't know whether people would give me that much time, \nbut I am going to have to start taking time every morning hour to show \nthe reality of what we are doing. No, you can't balance the budget and \npay for the Government this next year, but you can put us on a truth \ncourse. If you saw that chart my distinguished colleague Mr. Conrad \nhad, you will find that the deficit went way down in 1985 and 1986. In \n1985 and 1986 was during Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and this was when we \nreally cut the deficit.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are now into the time reserved by the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes of the time \nreserved by the Senator from Wyoming to speak on the issue of taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3159-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3160-S3167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TAX DAY 1997\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the opportunity \nto be able to address the American people on a very difficult day. I \nwould like to recognize a couple of things that have been said by \nprevious speakers, to start off with.\n  I congratulate the President on the reduction of the overall deficit \nthat has taken place during the past 4 years, because the deficit has \ngone down. But what I also want to point out to the American people is \nthere are a couple of ways of doing this. In the first 2 years of \nPresident Clinton's time in office, with a Democratic Congress, they \ndid it by raising taxes. In the second 2 years, with a Republican \nCongress, we lowered the deficit by cutting spending. Now, you can go \neither way on this; you can raise taxes or cut spending. I happen to \nbelieve that, in the long term, when you raise taxes, you are going to \ncut your revenues and it is going to make things worse. The point of it \nis, on tax day, we should be talking about the level of taxes; they are \ntoo high in this country. The way to reduce the deficit is by cutting \nspending. That is not the way it was done in the first 2 years--by \nraising taxes.\n  The second thing I would like to respond to that has been raised by \nthe other side of the aisle is capital gains taxes. That certainly \nneeds to be cut, along with some others, and along with a $500 per \nchild tax credit for working and struggling families.\n  I find it interesting that, as we look forward to working with the \nissue of Washington, DC, the District of Columbia, and rejuvenating the \nDistrict of Columbia, a metro area that has great difficulties in this \ncountry, one that we have had a lot of problems with which are well \nknown to this Nation--do you know what the other side of the aisle is \nproposing to rejuvenate Washington, DC? What Eleanor Holmes Norton, \nalong with Jack Kemp, is supporting to rejuvenate Washington, DC? They \nare proposing a zero capital gains tax rate on real property. Both the \nleft and the progrowth ring on the right in this Congress are proposing \nzero capital gains for Washington, DC. Why would they do that? If this \nis such a bad thing to do, why are we doing it to Washington, DC? \nBecause they know it will stimulate growth, hope, and opportunity. That \nis being put forth by Eleanor Holmes Norton and Jack Kemp.\n  These are things that I think people have to realize. When you make \nthose sorts of cuts, it stimulates the growth overall taking place in \nthe economy. Now, the month of April--particularly April 15--I think \nserves as a powerful reminder of the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment. Even though America will pay its taxes today, Americans \nwill not be freed from taxation. They will not experience tax freedom \nday until May 9. Last year, it was May 7. This year, it goes up 2 more \ndays, and it won't be until May 9. In other words, on May 9, ladies and \ngentlemen, you finally start working for yourself instead of the \nGovernment. Up until May 9, you are effectively working for the \nGovernment, paying your taxes to carry this huge, large Federal \nGovernment that is too big.\n  The issue is not that we should raise taxes to balance the budget; \nthe issue is, we should cut taxes and cut the size, the scope, and the \nintrusiveness of the Federal Government to liberate the American \npeople.\n  Today, a family of four must send both parents into the workplace to \nprovide for the same standard of living that was once provided by only \none parent. Is that a way to support the family across America, that we \nhave to have both parents going out and working just to support the \nfamily? Is that a way to have strong families across the country? I \ndon't think it is.\n  Unfortunately, even with both parents working, our families are still \noften unable to get ahead. Living paycheck to paycheck has been the \nnorm for American families for as long as our Federal Government has \ngrown as large as it as, consuming more and more.\n  Taxes hurt America's families. They punish good investment, they \nstifle entrepreneurial activity, and they hamper true economic growth. \nThat is why I support a tax limitation amendment and insist that any \nbudget deal must provide for meaningful tax relief.\n  Balancing the budget and cutting taxes are not mutually exclusive \ngoals, as some would have you believe. In fact, balancing America's \nbudget virtually requires that we cut taxes. In the long run, it will \nbe more difficult to balance the budget if we do not shrink the size of \nour Federal Government with significant tax cuts. And what we are doing \ntoday is happening across this country. We have a good economy that is \ngrowing strong. We are having an economy that is producing more \nrevenues coming into the Federal Government. We need that to continue \nto take place if we are going to be able to balance the budget. You \nneed to have growth taking place in the economy. That is the critical \nnature of cutting taxes. It continues to stimulate growth so we can \nhave those revenues coming in and balance the budget, and it is not \nenough to just balance the budget.\n  As my good colleague from South Carolina has pointed out, we need to \nstart paying the debt down so that interest levels can go down.\n  The tax limitation amendment is a simple amendment requiring a \nsupermajority in both Houses in order to raise taxes; in other words, \nmore than a majority. You have to have a supermajority. And we should \ndo that so that we don't just shift this Government from being debt \nfinanced to being tax financed. We need to be able to, overall, force \nthe Government to be smaller and to live within its means instead of \ntaking more of those means from hard-working American families.\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\n  Later today the House will vote on the tax limitation amendment. I \nbelieve this vote will send a strong message to the American people \nthat the Republicans in the House are committed to truly reducing the \ntax burden in America. The Senate had an opportunity to unify with the \nHouse and show their support for this amendment but balked at the \nopportunity late last week. I think that is an unfortunate reality that \ntoo many people lack the wherewithal to stand up to the tax-and-\nspending regimes of this Government and say no--just say no--to future \ntax increases.\n  Because Congress has lacked the will in the past on both sides of the \naisle to stand up to a flawed Keynesian economic principle that our \nGovernment has used in its fiscal policy, that has hurt economic growth \nand that has hurt our families.\n  I think what we have to do clearly in the future is we just have to \nstand up and say no to more big Government programs, to put policies in \nplace that reduce that tax burden, that release the American people, \ntheir opportunities, their entrepreneurial spirit, and their families \nto grow and to prosper. Government must be cut. Taxes must be cut.\n  Mr. President, I want to quote the President of the United States \nwho, a couple of years ago, made a very clear statement to the American \npeople. It was resonating very clearly, which the American people \nwanted to believe. But they know it is just not true yet. And it may \nend up being the signature statement of this President. ``The era of \nbig Government is over.'' Well, the era of big Government unfortunately \nis only over in rhetoric. In practice, it remains, and more is even \nbeing proposed by the President.\n  To end the era of big Government, we must end the era of big taxes \nand a big Tax Code. I want to point out to you, Mr. President, and \nothers about the size of the Tax Code. This is something that Steve \nForbes has made us familiar with. But I think it is pretty good on a \ngraphic.\n  Just look at the words that govern our lives and the important \ndocuments that have taken place. You can see that they do not \nnecessarily have to be documents with a lot of words to have a great \ndeal of meaning. The Declaration of Independence--1,300 words--which \ndeclared our independence and more vision of a National Government.\n  The Holy Bible--773,000 words are in this document that so many \npeople read and go to with reverence.\n  The U.S. Tax Code--this is just the code; this is not the regulations \nthat underpin the code that direct all of our lives. But the Tax Code \nitself is 2.8 million words. If you add the regulations to it that go \nforward with setting out what this code actually means and interpreting \nit, we are up to 10 million words governing our lives.\n\n  The truth of the matter is, on the Tax Code, not only are taxes too \nhigh, but the code is so intrusive anymore that it is more about trying \nto cause you to do something or your business not to do something \nrather than being about raising revenue for the Federal Government. The \nTax Code is about social engineering out of Washington instead of about \nwhat it raises for the Federal Government. You can see that, just by \nthe sheer number of words and the volume of words that are involved in \nthe Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, April 15 is a tough day for a lot of Americans, and \npeople aren't to happy about it. They should not be, because their \nlevel of taxes are too high.\n  I have had people call in on radio call-in shows. I had one in \nSaline, KS, that was so memorable to me. A gentleman called in and he \nsaid, ``You know, Mr. Brownback, I believe in serving my country. I \nhave done everything I could to serve my country. I served in the \nmilitary. I am married. I have two children. I am doing everything I \ncan to work hard. But let me tell you, you guys are just taxing me out \nof my family's existence. I can't continue to support my family off of \nwhat you are taking for taxes. I believe in America and I believe in \nthis country. But I just can't keep carrying this burden. It is too \nheavy. It is too much. Can you lift it off of me?''\n  If we will help that man in Saline, KS, he will not only start \nworking harder and earning more and taking care of that family better, \nwhich is at the core of the cultural renewal that we need to take place \nin the family, but he is going to be even more of a patriot if we just \nrelease him a little bit instead of requiring him to work until May 9 \njust to pay his taxes. Let's let him work a little bit more to raise \nhis family.\n  This day should focus on tax policies, on the failings of tax \npolicies across the United States, on what its impact is, and on the \ntheory that if you tax something, you get less of it, and if you \nsubsidize something, you get more of it.\n  We have too much tax which is hurting too many people. It is hurting \nus in growth. It is hurting families. It is hurting us in the \nopportunity to create an era after era of big Government. And an era \nafter the era of big Government, I think, is one of an unlimited \nAmerica. But it is one in which we have to reduce the tax monster to be \nable to get to that.\n  I am happy to be able to speak about the issue of tax freedom which \nis not with us yet. But it is a day I hope people will recognize the \nimportance of--of what tax policy has done, how much needs to be \nchanged, and how we need to limit taxation taking place in this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry? Is there an order \nfor people to speak at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls the next 46 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I see Senator Kyl. Did he plan to speak next?\n  Mr. KYL. I am ready.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have not spoken yet. How long would he speak?\n  Mr. KYL. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I yield the floor, the Senator from Arizona \nspeaks for 5 minutes, and then I could be recognized for about 7 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, first let me thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I am glad I don't have to follow his remarks. So I am \npleased to speak before he does.\n  Mr. President, T.S. Eliot once wrote that ``April is the cruelest \nmonth.'' Of course, he was referring to the change of seasons--of \n``mixing memory with desire.'' Millions of Americans would probably \nagree with Eliot about April being the cruelest month, but for a far \ndifferent reason. It is, of course, on April 15 that income taxes are \ndue.\n  By midnight tonight, millions of Americans will have finally \ncompleted their income tax returns. According to estimates by the \nInternal Revenue Service, Americans will have spent 5.4 billion hours \non tax-related paperwork. The Tax Foundation estimates that the cost of \ncompliance will approach $200 billion.\n  If that is not evidence that our Tax Code is one of the most \ninefficient and wasteful ever created, I do not know what is. Money and \neffort that could have been put to productive use solving problems in \nour communities, putting Americans to work, putting food on the table, \nor investing in the Nation's future are instead devoted to tax \npreparation. And that is a waste.\n  It is no wonder that the American people are frustrated and angry, \nand that they are demanding real change in the way their Government \ntaxes and spends.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives is today considering a \nproposed constitutional amendment that represents the first step in the \ndirection of the kind of fundamental tax reform the American people \nhave been demanding--it would require a two-thirds majority vote of the \nHouse and Senate to approve tax increases. Why do I say that it is the \nkind of reform the people are demanding? Because a third of the \nNation's population has now imposed such limits on their State \ngovernments, and voters have approved tax limits by wide margins. In \nArizona, for example, tax limitation passed with\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\n72 percent of the vote. In Florida, it passed with 69.2 percent of the \nvote; in Nevada, with 70 percent.\n  The tax limitation amendment, which I introduced in January, now has \n22 Senate cosponsors. It is something that was recommended by the \nNational Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform. The commission, \nchaired by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, advocated a supermajority \nrequirement in its report on how to achieve a simpler, single-rate tax \nto replace the existing maze of tax rates, deductions, exemptions, and \ncredits that makes up the Federal income tax as we know it today.\n  Here are the words of the Commission:\n\n       The roller-coaster ride of tax policy in the past few \n     decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility of \n     real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with \n     Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of \n     the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger \n     when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in less than \n     seven years. The commission believes that a two-thirds super-\n     majority vote of Congress will earn Americans' confidence in \n     the longevity, predictability, and stability of any new tax \n     system.\n\n  Mr. President, tax reform cannot succeed without a supermajority \nrequirement for raising taxes. In the decade since the last attempt at \ncomprehensive tax reform, Congress and the President have made more \nthan 4,000 amendments to the Tax Code. Four thousand amendments. The \nconstant changes have left taxpayers perplexed, unsure how to \ncomply today, let alone how to prepare financially for the future. \nWithout the protection of the tax limitation amendment, taxpayers will \nbe vulnerable to further tax-rate increases, particularly if tax \nreform--which we all hope will occur within the next few years--\neliminates many of the tax deductions, exemptions, and credits in which \nthey find refuge today.\n\n  Let me make a few other points about this amendment. First, the tax \nlimitation amendment itself cuts no taxes. It does not preclude \nCongress from raising taxes in the future. It only raises the bar on \nfuture tax increases.\n  Many people, myself included, believe that taxes are already far too \nhigh, and that we ought to cut taxes. This amendment does not do that. \nAll it says, in effect, is ``enough is enough.'' It makes Congress find \na way to meet its obligations without taking even more from the pockets \nof the American people.\n  Mr. President, here are some astonishing statistics from Americans \nfor Tax Reform. According to the organization's calculations, about 31 \npercent of the cost of a loaf of bread is attributable to taxes. About \n54 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas goes to taxes. About 40 \npercent of the cost of an airline ticket is attributable to taxes, as \nis 43 percent of the cost of a hotel room.\n  Understand that on an aggregate basis, the average family pays more \nin taxes than it does on food, clothing, and shelter combined. \nAccording to the Tax Foundation, Federal taxes amount to about 27 \npercent of the family's budget, and State and local taxes consume \nanother 12 percent--for a total of almost 39 percent. But spending on \nfood, clothing, and shelter totals only about 28 percent of the family \nbudget. And families still have to find a way to pay for everything \nelse they need--for example, medical care, transportation, education, \nand an occasional vacation or dinner out--out of the meager amount that \nis left after taxes.\n  So what the tax limitation amendment says is that Government already \ntakes far too much from hard-working Americans and should at the very \nleast take no more, unless there is a very broad and bipartisan \nconsensus in Congress and around the country.\n  A second point. There is no small irony in the fact that it would \nhave taken a two-thirds majority vote of the House and Senate to \novercome President Clinton's veto and enact the 1995 Balanced Budget \nAct with its tax relief provisions. By contrast, the President's \nrecord-setting tax increase in 1993 was enacted with only a simple \nmajority--and not even a majority of elected Senators, at that. Vice \nPresident Gore broke a tie vote of 50 to 50 to secure passage of the \ntax-increase bill in the Senate.\n  The tax limitation amendment is based upon a simple premise--that it \nought to be at least as hard to raise people's taxes as it is to cut \nthem. What the tax limitation amendment seeks to do is force members of \nCongress to think of tax increases, not as a first resort, but as a \nlast resort.\n  Mr. President, I hope the House will pass the tax limitation \namendment today. And if it does, I hope the Senate will take it up \npromptly and give the States an opportunity to consider its \nratification. While there is much disagreement about whether to cut \ntaxes and how, we should at least be able to agree that we should not \nraise taxes any further. I urge support for the tax limitation \namendment.\n  I hope we will be able to pass that amendment, and I hope we will \nhave an opportunity thereby to ensure that more money is left in the \npockets of hard-working American families rather than being sent to the \nFederal Government here in Washington.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, for his devotion and dedication to doing \nsomething about the tax mess in America. I look forward to supporting \nmany of his ideas here on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I thought today I would speak just a few moments about \nthe history of the income tax law in this Nation, and see if we can't \nall agree without equivocation that something has really gone awry.\n  On October 13, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill \nenacting the income tax law under the authority of the 16th amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States--October 13, 1913. The entire \nlaw was 14 pages long. Slightly more than 1 percent of the population \nhad incomes large enough to be subject to the new tax.\n  The New York Herald predicted that many new taxpayers would proudly \ndisplay their income tax receipts as evidence of the fact ``that their \nvalue and standing in the commercial world was worthwhile.'' So people \nwere pleased to pay their taxes and held up their receipts to indicate \nthat they had accomplished something meaningful in the United States, \nthey had gotten somewhere.\n  According to the Treasury Historical Association, when the first \nincome tax was due--listen to this--throngs of new taxpayers crowded \nthe IRS offices to pay and some of them were glad to be there. There \nare throngs at the post office today mailing in their tax forms. I \ndaresay few are glad to be there.\n  At the time of the enactment, Representative Cordell Hull, the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee, labeled the income tax ``the \nfairest, most equitable system of taxation that has been devised.''\n  Amazingly, most Americans actually agreed and welcomed the tax. \nPerhaps those statements were true in 1913, I say to our new Senator \nfrom Arkansas in the Chamber, but in 1997 they no longer reflect \nreality.\n  The current code is neither fair, equitable, efficient, nor loved. It \nadds one-third to the cost of capital. Capital which makes a modern \neconomy grow and prosper is encumbered by the antigrowth ingredients of \nthis Tax Code such that capital has had added to its cost one-third--in \nother words, one-third is wasted because of the nature of our tax laws. \nIt is hostile toward savings. It is tilted toward debt. Thus, it slows \neconomic growth, prevents jobs from being created, and makes us less \ncompetitive in world markets.\n  The Tax Foundation estimates that complying with the Federal tax \nsystem of the United States will cost the American people--I am not \ntalking about paying the tax. The cost, the waste, the money, the \nenergy--$225 billion in 1996.\n  Based on historical data from the IRS and the OMB--that is the Office \nof Management and Budget--taxpayers will spend 5.3 billion hours \ncomplying with the Federal tax laws.\n  Since 1954, the number of sections dealing with this have increased \ndramatically. Determination of tax liability has grown 1,000 percent; \ndeferred compensation, 1,400 percent; computation of taxable income, \n1,500 percent. Since 1954, there have been 31 major tax bills enacted, \nmore than 400 public laws that have amended the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\n  Two-thirds of the compliance burden is borne by the business sector. \nBecause of the marriage penalty built throughout this code--speak of \nsomething that is antifamily. I would assume if you have a policy that \nis antimarriage it cannot be, by definition, very profamily--most \nworking spouses work primarily to pay taxes rather than to improve the \nstandard of living of the family.\n  Congress will be dealing with tax cuts if we arrive at a budget \nagreement, and that is good because it is obvious the tax take for the \nUnited States, the amount of revenue we are getting from taxes, \ncontinues to rise. But I believe ultimately the country is not going to \nbe as well off as it should be until we do a comprehensive tax reform. \nWe have put together, Senator Nunn and I and many Senators and many \npeople helping, an entire new tax plan. When time comes for reform, it \nwill be on the table. This Congress Senator Dodd has agreed to carry on \nthe work of Sentator Nunn.\n  We call it the USA Tax Plan--Unlimited Savings Allowance. For those \nwho think IRA's are great investment vehicles we ought to be using, I \nagree, but this is an unlimited IRA tax plan because essentially people \nwill pay taxes only on income they spend. Amounts they save or invest \nwill not be taxed until they take it from the savings pool of the \nNation, an investment pool of the Nation, and spend it. The tax would \nbe deferred, in other words, until it is consumed and has become income \nthat is being spent.\n\n  There is talk about tax credits and deductions for education \npurposes. This USA tax recognizes those needs and takes care of that. \nIt provides a tax credit not for some taxpayers but for all, all \nfamilies facing higher education expenses. This plan recognizes \ninvestment in capital should be expensed by the business community. It \nprovides a deduction from taxable income in the year that the \ninvestment is made instead of requiring installment deductions called \ndepreciation, which I assume is the major argument between the business \ncommunity, business people, and the IRS.\n  This plan which I am speaking of today, with its unlimited deferral, \nresults in a capital gains tax rate of zero so long as the proceeds \nremain invested. When they are no longer invested and they are being \nspent, they are listed as income and subject to taxes.\n  The President and Republicans want to provide a $500 tax credit for \nchildren, recognizing that family budgets are stretched most when there \nare children in the family. I should say the President wants to do \nthis, although with less money. And the age that this stops vesting is \nlower in the President's proposal. Nonetheless, they both recognize \nthat families, income tax payers are most stretched when there are \nmembers of the family under this code.\n  The USA tax proposal includes a family living allowance, in addition, \nto the dependent deduction. It does not phase out when a child reaches \n13. It goes on until the child reaches adulthood.\n  Taken together, these two USA tax provisions provide relief \nequivalent to what the dependent deduction would have been if it kept \nup with inflation since the time it was first enacted.\n  So let me suggest that while we are all talking about tax cuts, and I \nhope I have given a bit of the history that should shock us into \nunderstanding that something basically is very wrong.\n  Our current Tax Code is sapping the strength of this country, it is \nsapping the entrepreneurial spirit of people. This country will be \ngreat when the entrepreneurial spirit, when innovation and risk taking \nis maximized. Unfortunately, we have a code that does the opposite, \nobviously, and we ought to get rid of it.\n  For now, we are scheduled this year for some tax cuts. I have \noutlined them heretofore, and the Finance Committee chairman and others \nhave announced them, and the President has his set of proposals. But I \ndo not think we should let today go by without saying that tinckering \nis not enough.\n  What we must do is throw out what we have and do a new one for the \nAmerican people, for growth, prosperity, and peace of mind for the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Tennessee, who \nis next in line and allowed me to go first.\n  I commend my distinguished colleague from New Mexico for his great \nleadership on this issue. He has within his hands the needed mechanism \nto get to tax relief, and that is what I want to address very briefly \nhere today.\n  I follow up his point about the cost of the complexity of today's Tax \nCode by saying we in the Small Business Committee have figures \nindicating that computing taxes, figuring out taxes, takes 5 percent of \nthe revenues of small business. That is not paying the taxes. That is \njust figuring out how much they are.\n  Mr. President, each year the American Tax Foundation computes what \nthey call ``Tax Freedom Day,'' the day of the year when the average \nAmerican can quit working to pay Federal, State, and local taxes and \nstart working for herself or himself. Last year it was May 7. This year \nit will be May 9. This means each day you have worked since the new \nyear has been simply to pay your tax bill for the new year and you \nstill have 3 weeks to go. If that does not make you happy, I do not \nknow what will.\n\n  The American people take too much of their hard earned income to pay \nfor Uncle Sam's spending habits. Why is the tax burden on families so \nhigh? Because Uncle Sam spends too much. It is that simple. Congress \nhas not balanced the budget since 1969. The cumulative effect of all \nthat deficit spending is a tax burden for most families that exceeds \nwhat they pay for food, clothing, housing and automobile costs \ncombined. We need to fix that. We are trying to balance the budget so \nwe can reduce the tax burden for families with children, small and \nhome-based businessowners, family farmers, and frankly, everybody else \nwho is taking part in the economy.\n  The first step in bringing tax relief to middle-class America, \nhowever, is to bring Government spending under control. A balanced \nbudget means a healthier economy, more Government revenue and less need \nfor taxes. As you fill in the amount of tax paid line on your 1040 form \nthis year or as you write out your check to the IRS, think about ways \nyou could use even a portion of that tax money and remember who is \ntrying to balance the budget and who is not because balancing the \nbudget and getting spending under control is the first step toward tax \nrelief.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it seems at this time of year every year we tend to go \nout of our way to criticize the Internal Revenue Service, but I think \npart of the reason for that is that sometimes it seems to take so much \nto get their attention. As the Presiding Officer knows, the General \nAccounting Office has a list of high-risk agencies which they set forth \nas agencies that are more prone to fraud, waste and abuse, and \nmismanagement.\n  The IRS has been on that list now for 6 years in a row, and we had \nhearings last week in order to find out what they intended to do about \nit because not only do they have the normal problems that we all hear \nabout and complain about every year, it seems now that in their attempt \nto modernize their computer system, which is totally outdated; they are \nworking on 1960's technology, but in an attempt to do something about \nthat they have spent billions of dollars and canceled one program after \nanother and are not making substantial progress into getting into the \n20th century much less the 21st century.\n  We also found out that the Internal Revenue Service cannot stand an \naudit. They do not really know how much they have spent on this \ncomputer modernization system and they really do not know how much \nmoney they collect in terms of various categories of collection.\n\n  In addition to that, we have learned more about the security \nproblems. We know that we are all concerned about the browsing problem \nwe have had some discussions about recently, but\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\nnow we learn of the tremendous physical security problems, so much so \nthat they had to classify the report when they sent it over here to us \nbecause they did not want to provide a blueprint, understandably, for \npeople who might wish them ill. It is that bad.\n  Congress has responded with the power of the purse. And last year we \ncut them back some, but that is not the total answer because they are \ngoing to need revenues in order to take care of some of these problems. \nSo we had the hearings. We brought the IRS in. We brought the Treasury \nin, which the IRS, of course, is a part of. Perhaps if there is any \ngood news in this it looks as if for the first time we do have a \nblueprint to work our way out of this.\n  Congress in the past few years has passed some legislation which \nrequires these agencies to come in and report on what kind of progress \nthey are making in solving some of these problems. We have not always \nhad this, but now we have some accountability--what are they trying to \nachieve, and every year come back and tell us and show us in some \ndetail what they are doing to work out of these things.\n  Treasury now says they are going to take a greater oversight \nresponsibility, which they clearly should have done long before. There \nare timetables which they are going to be held accountable to. We are \ngoing to make sure they report back in solving these problems when they \nare supposed to be reporting back. So perhaps we are going to be making \nsome progress for the first time. But this is the reason why we talk \nabout the IRS. It is not just the fact that people do not like to pay \ntaxes. It is just they have the right to have the IRS and all these \nother agencies at least reach the minimal compliance levels they expect \nout of the American taxpayer because, ultimately, our national security \nand our prosperity depend upon our faith in these institutions and \ncertainly the IRS.\n  So with that, I thank the Chair and will relinquish the remainder of \nany time I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just like to take a few minutes \non this important day in our Nation's history, this day that comes up \nevery year, when we are responsible for paying our taxes, to discuss \nthe problems of working families and what they are facing in America.\n  Two years ago, I traveled all over the State of Alabama, campaigning \nfor Attorney General. I talked to all kinds of people. This past year I \ncampaigned throughout the State of Alabama and talked to hundreds and \nhundreds of young families who are struggling throughout our State. \nThey are struggling all over America. People who are doing their very \nbest to live the American dream are not able to do so because of \nfinancial reasons. Many families are calling on their parents to help \nthem with the finances and burdens it takes to raise their children. We \nneed to help those families.\n  I was recently in a committee meeting in which a very wise Senator \nsaid: We look at numbers and we study statistics and we do all these \nkinds of things. But, when it comes right down to it, we need to use \nour judgment about what we believe are the most important problems \nfacing America. In my judgment, no matter what numbers show--and \nnumbers back me up on this--in my judgment, working families are \nstruggling. In terms of income, the numbers have declined in the last 6 \nyears in relative terms, considering inflation. It is more expensive \nthan ever to raise children today.\n  I want to show a chart that illustrates a shocking statistic. In \n1950, due to the personal exemption for children and family members, \nwhich allows you to exempt your income from taxes, 70 percent of the \naverage working family's income was exempt from taxes. They did not \nhave to pay taxes on 70 percent of their income. Today only 30 percent \nof working families' income is exempt from taxes. They must pay taxes \non 70 percent of their income and they are paying at a much higher rate \nthan they paid in 1970. Is there any reason to wonder that working \nfamilies are falling further behind? In 1950, they paid 2 cents of \nevery dollar to the Federal Government. Today, every working family \npays 25 percent of every dollar to the Government. That is \nunacceptable. No wonder families are struggling to raise and educate \ntheir children, who will take care of us in the future.\n  The Republicans have proposed a bold plan to give a $500-per-child \ntax credit to every working family in America. I support that proposal \nand campaigned for it very aggressively. Just a few months ago the \nPresident said he believed in the per-child tax credit and that he \nwould support such a plan because it is needed to bring working \nfamilies' incomes up to the level that they need to be. I ask American \nfamilies today to think about this. What would you do if there were two \nchildren in the family and you had a $1,000 tax credit? That means \n$1,000 extra income to the family, in which there would be no income \ntax or health care taken out--nearly $100 a month, $90 a month extra \nincome that you could spend for your family.\n  It would be available to buy shoes, clothes and for field trips for \nschool. Maybe the car breaks down--you could repair the transmission. \nMaybe you need a set of tires for the vehicle or just grocery money. \nThese are the kinds of things that families struggle with every day. \nThis tax credit would put real money into their hands and drive their \nincomes up in an immediate way. It would put an immediate source of \nincome into the pockets of the people who are making America great.\n  These are the people who are going to raise the next generation who \nwill lead this country. The families today are raising that next \ngeneration that will take care of us and we need to give them some \nrelief. We need to give families some income so that they can do their \njob of raising their children. We need to give them the kind of \ncommitment that our families gave to us.\n  One thing I must say. The President says he is for a tax credit. But \nyou have to look at the small print, as we so often have to do. His \n$500 deduction would only go up to age 13. I have had children under \nage 13. I have had children over age 13. Anyone who has had children in \nthat age group knows it costs more to raise a teenager than it does a \nyounger child.\n\n  That is totally unacceptable. The President says he is for a tax \ncredit. Let's do it. Let us support the teenagers, too. Let families \nhave the kind of money so they can raise their teenagers in the way \nthey should. I feel this is a very important issue for our country. I \nthink it is important that this body recognize that we have penalized \nworking families. It is time to give families some relief and restore \nthem to the position they were in a number of years ago. It is time to \nrestore and strengthen family values in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks \nconcerning April 15. That is today. As all Americans are no doubt \naware, today is tax day. Millions of Americans spent this past weekend \nfinalizing their returns. Today those returns are due.\n  However, while the returns and taxes are due today, the tax burden \ncontinues. According to the Tax Foundation, the average American family \nnow must work until May 9 in order to pay local, State, and Federal \ntaxes. April 15 may be tax return day, but May 9 is tax freedom day.\n  The Tax Foundation also reports that Federal, State, and local taxes \nnow cost a typical two-earner family more than that family spends on \nfood, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. It is no wonder \nthat most families require more than one income. As families work \nthrough their tax returns, many were no doubt struck by the complexity \nof the tax system. Earlier this year, Money magazine revealed the \nresults of its annual report on tax complexity. The magazine \ncommissioned 45 tax professionals, many of them CPA's, to complete the \ntax return of a hypothetical and prosperous American family. While this \nhypothetical family certainly had more tax issues to deal with than the \ntypical family, the issues raised were not unique and should have been \nvery familiar to tax professionals.\n  The results reported in the Money article were astounding. No two \npreparers came up with the same result, and\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\nthe fluctuation in the level of the taxes was striking. There were \nliterally tens of thousands of dollars of differences between the \ncalculations of some of the preparers.\n  Nearly $14 billion is spent by the Internal Revenue Service and other \nFederal agencies to enforce the tax laws each year. There are 136,000 \nemployees of the Internal Revenue Service. There are 17,000 pages of \nInternal Revenue Service laws. There are 480 tax forms published by the \nInternal Revenue Service, and there are an estimated 8 billion pages of \nforms and instructions sent out by the Internal Revenue Service every \nyear.\n  I think these statistics make the case for tax reform. There are \ncertainly a number of reforms that need to be made at the Internal \nRevenue Service. However, Congress is the principal entity responsible \nfor the Tax Code. Congress should scrap the current tax system and \nstart fresh with a simple and fair system.\n  I support taking this action now. However, if our leadership \ndetermines we cannot reach agreement with the President on \ncomprehensive tax reform, then we should at a minimum reduce taxes this \nyear. This should be done by a reduction in the capital gains tax by at \nleast half the current rate for all individuals, eliminate the estate \ntaxes, and a reduction in the family tax burden. This action should be \ndone as a part of the budget and should not be delayed.\n  Before I close, I would like to mention a necessary tax change in \nhealth care. This concerns medical savings accounts. Last year, \nCongress made the tax changes necessary to make medical savings \naccounts available for up to 750,000 individuals. Medical savings \naccounts allow companies to give the funds currently set aside for \nhealth benefits directly to their employees. These employees are then \nempowered to purchase their own health plans and set aside funds for \nfuture medical expenses.\n\n  MSA's, or medical savings accounts, are an important counterweight to \nGovernment and health care bureaucracies. They put greater power in the \nhands of individuals and families. The changes made last year have \nproven popular and demand for medical savings accounts is high. But \neven before Congress provided the full deductibility for MSA's, many \nemployers offered them successfully for years.\n  Last year, I opposed the artificial cap on medical savings accounts, \nand today I am introducing legislation that would make medical savings \naccounts available to all taxpayers. This will foster the type of \nempowerment and competition that we need in health care. It will also \nincrease health care coverage for the self-employed and, thus, those in \ntransition from one job to another. Medical savings accounts are the \nultimate form of health care portability.\n  Medical savings accounts provide a superior alternative to a further \nexpansion of Government-run health care. Americans want health care \nchoice and competition, not more bureaucracy.\n  I invite all my Senate colleagues to cosponsor this MSA extension \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, every year like clockwork, with the \napproach of April 15, tax day, millions of Americans are out scrambling \nto find out how much they owe the Federal Government in taxes and how \nmuch they have overpaid the Federal Government in taxes. The IRS \nrequires us to fill out complicated tax forms and, after plugging in \nnumbers to formulas and performing various mathematical calculations, \nwe come up with the magic number of what we owe the Federal Government \nor sometimes, rarely, what the Federal Government owes to us. To \ncomplete these tax forms is sobering. Sometimes it is a frightening \nexperience, especially when you look at the block on your W-2 form that \nshows the amount of your income that has been consumed for tax \npurposes.\n  The truth be told, the typical worker toils nearly 3 hours in a \ntypical 8-hour workday just to pay taxes. Many families with two \nworking parents find that one of those working parents is working full \ntime just to pay Uncle Sam. Put another way, May 9 is tax freedom day. \nIn theory, this is the day when an individual who has been working \nsince January 1 will be able to take home his or her first paycheck. \nEvery penny of the income they earn during that first 5 months of the \nyear has gone to pay their annual income taxes.\n  Our Nation's total tax burden is at an alltime high. Federal, State \nand local receipts remain at a record 31.7 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. That is one-third of our Nation's total output now \nconsumed in taxes.\n  Even more demonstrative of the magnitude of the American tax burden \nis the fact that the average American family pays more in taxes, as we \nhave heard over and over again, than it spends on food, clothing, and \nshelter combined. This, I think, is proof positive that American \nfamilies are overburdened and in need of tax relief.\n  That is why I introduced, with Senator Grams of Minnesota, who is on \nthe floor this afternoon, the $500-per-child tax credit for all working \nfamilies, regardless of income. Everyone talks about the importance of \nfamily values. It is time that we act to preserve American families by \npassing that $500-per-child tax credit.\n  I talked to a person in Pine Bluff, AR. He said, ``My children are \ngrown. What do you have for me? I don't need that $500-per-child tax \ncredit.'' I said, ``Sir, if you would just compute the benefit that you \nhad as you had reared your children--they are now grown--you would see \nthat the benefit that you had has been eroded through inflation and no \nlonger exists.'' And he was soon convinced. As we look at that per \nchild dependent exemption, that would be over $8,500 had it been \nindexed for inflation.\n\n  The 1997 tax season has been fraught with reports of abusive \npractices and sloppy management with the IRS--reports of taxpayer money \nbeing used to provide tax refunds to prison inmates at the nearby \nLorton prison facility, of IRS agents improperly accessing taxpayers' \nreturns, and of other coercive tactics employed by IRS agents to \ncollect taxes.\n  Americans already suffer under an unfair and incomprehensible Tax \nCode. As they struggle to be honest, taxpaying citizens, they should \nnot have to worry about being harassed by an agency that, according to \nthe General Accounting Office, cannot accurately account for its own $7 \nbillion annual budget.\n  I think millions of Americans feel as I do today, as we look at the \nInternal Revenue Service. We would say, ``Physician, heal thyself.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand morning business was to end at \n12:30. Was there a unanimous consent obtained to extend that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, but there has not \nbeen.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be continued for 30 minutes, or until such time that speakers \non the floor are allowed to make their presentation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, can I make an inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The time was extended for the Democratic side by 10 \nminutes. Up until 12:40 is still the Republican time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nextended up until 1 o'clock, or until Senators are allowed to complete.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. President, I rise today to speak out for Americans on tax \nday--April 15. On this day more than any other, every American is \nreminded how much government costs--not just in actual dollars but in \ntime and energy spent filling out forms.\n  Today, many of my colleagues have described the tax burden in many \ninsightful and illustrative analogies. For example, we know that the \naverage American will work until May 9--tax\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\nfreedom day--just to pay his or her taxes. We know that the typical \nAmerican family pays 38 percent of their income in Federal, State, and \nlocal taxes--a one-third increase over the past four decades. I commend \nmy colleagues for bringing clarity and focus to an extremely complex \ndebate.\n  Today, I want to add to their comments. Putting statistics and \nanecdotes aside, every lawmaker should be asking three questions about \ntax revenue--not just on Tax Day but every day: Whose money is it? How \nmuch of it are we spending? and How are we spending it?\n\n\n                           whose money is it?\n\n  Whenever we debate tax policy in this body, we must begin with a \nsimple principle that should govern all our decisionmaking: There is no \nsuch thing as government money, there is only the people's money. Every \ndollar that comes into Washington belongs to some individual, family, \nor business--not the other way around. For far too long, the Federal \nGovernment has treated the income of the American people as it own--as \nan entitlement it deserves--and this practice must stop.\n  As newspaper columnist James Glassman describes it,\n\n       Tax dollars begin life as personal dollars. They're yours, \n     not Washington's. You do agree, through the political \n     process, to turn over some of your income--but that deal is \n     transitory and renewable, and it depends on Washington \n     providing good value for your money.\n\n  That agreement is based on public trust.\n  When we Senators meet with constituents in our home States, we must \nremember: It's their money. Every time we pass a spending bill on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate, we must be able to look our constituents in \nthe eye and say, ``Here is how we spent your money.'' If we can't--look \nthem in the eye--then we have betrayed their public trust and we have \nfailed as representatives.\n\n\n                    how much of it are we spending?\n\n  Too often over the last half century, lawmakers seem to have \nforgotten or ignored whose money they were managing. Once we remind \nourselves that we are dealing with the taxpayer's hard-earned dollars, \nwe must ask, ``How much of it are we spending?''\n  This year, the Federal Government will spend about $1.6 trillion. \nGrasping the concept of a trillion dollars is difficult, but let me \ntry. If you started a business 2,000 years ago and that business lost \n$1 million a day each day from then until now, you still would not have \nlost your first trillion dollars. Yet our 200-year-old Government \nalready owes $5.5 trillion.\n  Why? Because the Federal Government consistently spends more than it \ntakes in, running up massive debts and threatening our economic future. \nThis year alone, the Federal Government will spend about $107 billion \nmore than it receives from the taxpayers. These annual deficits have \nadded up over time to a total debt of $5.4 trillion--that's nearly \n$20,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. We cannot continue \nto shackle our children and grandchildren with this debt burden. That \nis why balancing the budget is so critical for our future. A balanced \nbudget is the first step toward breaking those shackles.\n\n\n                        how are we spending it?\n\n  The third and final question lawmakers must ask themselves on tax day \nis ``How are we spending the taxpayers' money?''\n  The simple answer is, ``We are spending it at an unsustainable \nrate.'' In 1965, entitlement spending and interest on the debt consumed \n30 percent of the Federal budget. Discretionary spending--which \nincludes the basic functions of Government like defense, highways, \neducation, medical research, and national parks--consumed 70 percent. \nToday, entitlements and interest consume 70 percent of the budget, \nwhile discretionary programs consume 30 percent. By 2012, just 15 years \nfrom now, entitlements and interest on our growing debt will consume \nall Federal revenues--leaving nothing for roads, education, national \nparks, medical research, defense.\n  We have all heard from Members who say that the current tax rate is \npunitive, burdensome, and a threat to the survival of our competitive, \ncapitalistic economy. If that's true today--when our tax rate hovers at \n38 percent per family--consider the effects on our economy in the \nfuture if we do nothing to change this. If we fail to act and act soon, \na child born today will pay a lifetime tax rate of 84 percent on his or \nher earnings to pay for the cost of Government overspending. Such a \nburden would be at the very least unfair and irresponsible.\n  As the tax debate rages on, I urge my colleagues to remember that we \nare trustees of the American Treasury. Building and maintaining that \ntrust is one of our most important duties as representatives of the \npeople. If we always remember whose money we are spending, how much we \nare spending, and how we are spending it, I believe we can be more \nresponsible trustees and we can leave our children a future worth \nworking toward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today is tax day, and for millions of \nAmericans, this is the day that they end their painful ritual of fiscal \nfealty to the Federal Government. So I thought it would be appropriate \nto cite a few statistics that make tax day possible: 136,000 is the \nnumber of employees of the IRS responsible for administering the tax \nlaws; $13.7 billion, that is the amount that it costs to administer and \nenforce the Tax Code; 480 is the number of forms printed by the IRS; 8 \nbillion--8 billion--is the number of pages of forms and instructions \nsent out by the IRS every year; 293,760 is the number of trees that \nmust be cut down each year to supply the 8 billion pages of paper \nneeded for filing the country's taxes.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few of the statistics that point out \nthe complexity and the burden that our Tax Code puts on the American \nfamily and the Nation itself. The typical American family pays more in \ntaxes than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined. That is \nmore than 38 percent for total taxes versus 28 percent for food, \nclothing, and housing.\n  This year, the Republican Congress wants to do something unusual for \nthe taxpayers of our country: Give their money back to them. We want to \nstop penalizing young couples for getting married. Republicans want to \nincrease the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly. In \n1993, 40 percent of families paid higher taxes because they got \nmarried. A couple without children who earns $20,000 a year pays an \nadditional $188 in taxes. When they have children, the number soars to \n$3,717 per year. In Texas, a mother of two children on welfare is \npenalized $5,862 a year for marrying a man who earns $20,000. Our Tax \nCode is biased against marriage, and that is just flat wrong.\n  We want to provide a $500-per-child tax credit for the American \nfamily to give them help in the struggles of raising a family. This \nwould mean 3.5 million families in America would not have to pay taxes \nanymore. We want to cut capital gains taxes to encourage and reward \ninvestment to create new business, to create new jobs.\n  A low capital gains tax rate is important to our future, because we \nshould be able to take our money and put it where we need it at the \ntime. But many people cannot sell their assets because of the huge \ncapital gains tax that has accrued over the years. So we need to \nencourage investment to create the new jobs and the new industries that \nwill get our economy on a safer track.\n  We want to cut estate taxes so that years of hard work and success \nwill not be wiped out in a generation. I have known people who have had \nto sell land that they inherited because they could not pay the \ninheritance taxes on that land. Mr. President, that is wrong. It walks \naway from the American dream. The American dream is if you work harder \nin this country, you can do better and you can create a little nest egg \nthat will make it easier for your children to have a better life. Why \nin the world would we take dollars that are taxed first when you earn \nthem, again when you invest them, then when you die? It does not make \nsense, and it especially hurts the small family farm, ranch, or \nbusiness.\n  We are trying to cut the burden of taxes on the American family. What \nbetter day than today to talk about\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nthis burden and to talk about the differences between the President and \nCongress and our priorities.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. Under the current order, we \nare in morning business.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, there are 365 days in each calendar year, \nbut I can think of no other date that the American people await with \nsuch universal dread as April 15, tax day.\n  However, there is one other date working Americans should look upon \nwith equal disdain, and that is the date that says a great deal about \nthe Federal, State, and local tax burden working families are expected \nto bear. That date is May 9, this year's tax freedom day.\n  As it does every year, the Tax Foundation has calculated the date the \naverage American stops working just to pay their share of the tax \nburden and begins working for themselves. This year, tax freedom day \nfalls on May 9. And while the use of the word ``freedom'' in tax \nfreedom day implies something to celebrate, working Americans have \nabsolutely nothing to celebrate when it comes to their taxes.\n  Tax freedom day falls a full day later this year than it did in 1996, \nmeaning taxpayers must work 128 days before they can count a single \npenny of their salary as their own.\n  Of those days, 44 will be spent paying personal income taxes; 38 days \nwill be spent paying payroll taxes; sales and excise taxes, 18 days; \nproperty taxes, 12 days; corporate income taxes, 13 days; also 3 days \nwill be spent paying miscellaneous taxes.\n  When you total all that up, that is 128 days, Mr. President, 128 days \nin which the American people spend imprisoned by their own tax system. \nIf the cost of complying with the tax system itself were included in \nthe calculations, tax freedom day would be pushed forward another 13 \ndays.\n  The tax burden on middle-class Americans is rising rapidly. Taxpayers \nare now working an entire week longer to pay off their taxes than they \nwere when President Clinton first took office in 1993. That sounds like \nGovernment getting larger and more expensive, not the ``era of big \nGovernment is over.'' If you calculate the tax load in hours and \nminutes, instead of days, Americans spend fully 2 hours and 49 minutes \nof each 8-hour workday laboring to pay their taxes.\n  That is a great deal more than the 1 hour, 40 minutes it takes to pay \nfor their family's food, clothing, and shelter.\n  May 9 marks the arrival of Tax Freedom Day for the average State.\n  Unfortunately for taxpayers in my home State, Minnesota ranks well \nabove average in the tax burden my constituents are forced to bear. In \n1997, Tax Freedom Day will not arrive in Minnesota until 4 days later, \nuntil May 13. Only five other States and the District of Columbia mark \nTax Freedom Day as late or later than we do.\n  There has never been a time in our history when the need for tax \nrelief was so obvious and so great. Let us make 1997 the year we enact \nthe $500 per-child tax credit. Let us make 1997 the year we kill off \nthe death tax. Let us make 1997 the year we promote savings and \ninvestment by cutting capital gains. Let us not let another Tax Day go \nby before we deliver on our promise of substantial relief for the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, it is not a normal practice of mine to quote poetry on \nthe Senate floor. I prefer to leave the rhymes to those Senators who \npossess a more poetic nature than I. But because this is Tax Day, I \nwould like to share the closing lines of a poem by Ogden Nash and then \nfollow it up with a final comment.\n\n     ``Abracadabra, thus we learn\n     The more you create, the less you earn.\n     The less you earn, the more you're given,\n     The less you lead, the more you're driven,\n     The more destroyed, the more they feed,\n     The more you pay, the more they need,\n     The more you earn, the less you keep,\n     And now I lay me down to sleep.\n     I pray the Lord my soul to take\n     If the tax-collector hasn't got it before I wake.''\n\n  It was 1935 when Mr. Nash first published his poem warning of the \ndangers of a tax system run amuck. At that time in our history, the \nFederal tax rate was less than four percent.\n  Now, I cannot imagine what kind of poem Mr. Nash would write today, \nat a time when Washington demands an average 28 percent of our income \nin taxes. And even if I could imagine what Mr. Nash would write I am \nnot sure I would be allowed to read it on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3160-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPRECIATION TO SENATE LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

With strong and responsive action from the \nleadership today, the U.S. Senate said that those who have a visual \nimpairment will be able to fully utilize their talents on this Senate \nfloor.\n  A resolution was accepted today in the Senate which allows persons \nrequiring a guide dog, a wheelchair, or a cane to be considered on a \ncase-by-case basis for entry to the floor. Pursuant to this resolution, \nthe Sergeant at Arms has determined that for Ms. Moira Shea, a staffer \nin my office, that her guide dog is necessary and appropriate to the \nperformance of her duties.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, and colleagues, watching Ms. Shea enter the \nChamber today makes me feel very proud. It is a good day for the Senate \nbecause ensuring equal access to opportunity is what the U.S. Senate is \nall about. Ms. Shea has been assisting my office in a number of \nmatters, particularly nuclear waste legislation and legislation with \nrespect to the rights of the disabled.\n  Yesterday, I attempted to bring Ms. Shea on to the Senate floor to \nassist me in debate on the nuclear waste bill. Ms. Shea is a respected \neconomist and energy policy expert who has worked for the Federal \nGovernment for more than 20 years. She was denied access to the Senate \nfloor yesterday because she requires the use of a guide dog as a result \nof a genetic condition which significantly impairs her vision.\n  Today, Mr. President and colleagues, I thank the majority and \nminority leaders as well as the chairman and ranking member of the \nRules Committee for moving so expeditiously to ensure that this body \nextend equal opportunity to citizens who are visually impaired.\n  Today, a resolution was offered by the majority and minority leaders \nand referred to the Senate Rules Committee that seeks to permanently \naddress this issue so that an individual with a visual impairment will \nnot need to seek case-by-case approval just to use their talents on \nthis Senate floor. I intend to work with Members on both sides of the \naisle and with Ms. Shea to make certain that the U.S. Senate provides \nappropriate access to those citizens with disabilities and that the \naccess complies with the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that what the Senate is saying today \nis that a double standard will not be allowed here. In the private \nsector, for example, Federal law is very clear. In the private sector \nwhere you have an individual with Ms. Shea's talents and abilities, and \nif a guide dog or a white cane is needed to carry out those duties in \nthe private sector, Ms. Shea would have a legal right to have that \nguide dog with her.\n  Now, I close by thanking several of our colleagues for their help in \nrectifying this situation. I particularly thank Senator Reid of Nevada, \nthe lead cosponsor of my resolution, as well as chairman Frank \nMurkowski for his support yesterday. In addition, Senators Wellstone \nand Bryan and, in fact, all Members of the Senate who\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nwere on the floor yesterday during discussion of this issue moved to be \ncosponsors of this legislation. I thank Senator Ford who also, for \nyears, has worked for the rights of the disabled. Finally, I thank our \nSergeant at Arms, Mr. Greg Casey. He has been extraordinarily patient \nand conscientious in working with myself and our staff. I thank him for \nhelping to bring justice to the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has done the right thing today by \nstanding up for full legal rights and equal opportunity for those like \nMs. Shea who have a visual impairment. The Senate is sending a message \nacross this country that we are not going to leave our citizens behind. \nI am very proud that the Senate has taken this action. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nOregon and Ms. Shea for doing this historic and unprecedented \nresolution. This is a beautiful dog, Ms. Shea, and we are proud to have \nyou on the floor of the U.S. Senate and proud to have your dog here as \nwell.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to join Senator Hatch in congratulating and \nthanking the Senator from Oregon for his persistence.\n  Ms. Shea, we are delighted you are on the Senate floor with your dog. \nIt is a historic day for the Senate. Senator Hatch has made the point \nand I join, and I think all of our colleagues join, in expressing \nappreciation to the Senator from Oregon who has done an important \nservice for the Senate for making it possible for this to happen.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3167-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3168-S3169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS--S. 522\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today is April 15, tax day. There has been a \ngood effort underway between Senator Coverdell and Senator Glenn and \nSenator Roth and others to bring before the Senate very important \nlegislation, S. 522, regarding the unauthorized access of tax returns. \nThey have come to a bipartisan agreement. I think on this day it is \nvery important that we have this legislation come before the Senate to \nbe debated and voted on. The American people certainly feel that should \nbe done. I think they will feel comforted by the fact that the Senate \nstepped up and has addressed these concerns. This idea of a snooping \nthrough taxpayers files is very offensive to all Americans. So we need \nto get this done today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today, April 15, \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 37, S. 522, \nregarding the unauthorized access of tax returns and the bill be \nconsidered under the following limitations: That there be only 1 \namendment in order to the bill, to be offered by Senators Coverdell, \nGlenn, and Roth, no other motions or amendments be in order, and \nfurther, total debate on the amendment and the bill be limited to 1 \nhour 35 minutes, divided equally between Senator Coverdell or his \ndesignee and Senator Glenn or his designee. I further ask consent that \nfollowing the expiration or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed \nto vote on the Coverdell amendment, the bill then be read the third \ntime, and there then be 10 minutes for debate, to be equally divided, \nto be followed by the final vote on passage of S. 522, as amended, if \namended.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I support the Coverdell-Glenn substitute \namendment to establish criminal penalties for unauthorized inspection \nof tax returns and tax information. Penalties already exist for \nunauthorized disclosure of these documents. It is only fair and \nreasonable that these be extended to unauthorized inspection as well, \nparticularly in light of the recent revelations involving misbehavior \nby some IRS employees. Tax filings are privileged, private information. \nTaxpayers have a right to know that the information they provide the \nIRS will be seen only by those who process it in the normal course of \nGovernment business.\n  I would like to salute Senator Glenn, in particular, for his \nsteadfast advocacy of this legislation over the years. The \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio was ahead of his time when, years ago, \nhe proposed the changes incorporated into the legislation before the \nSenate today. On behalf of the taxpayers of my State, I would like to \nthank him for his leadership on this important issue.\n  I also want to thank Senator Coverdell and others who have been \ninvolved in this effort. I don't know that there is much opposition at \nall to their mutually effective work in addressing the problem that \nneeds to be addressed at the earliest possible date.\n  Unfortunately, as anyone who watches the news knows, we have a set of \ncircumstances in the upper Midwest that also requires immediate action. \nSevere flooding, brought on by the most severe winter in the history of \nthe region, has devastated hundreds of communities throughout the \nStates of Minnesota and South and North Dakota. In my home State of \nSouth Dakota, there have been only 2 days this year in which a \nPresidential Disaster Declaration has not been in effect for the entire \nState. Despite the best efforts of FEMA and the administration to \nrespond, State and local governments have been financially devastated \nby the costs associated with these disasters. The ongoing flooding that \nis currently occurring is having an even greater financial effect on \nfamilies and individuals. In Watertown, SD, and other communities in \nthe region, thousands of residents have been evacuated from their homes \ndue to rising flood waters. Many of these evacuated homeowners have now \ndiscovered that they are unable to obtain benefits from their flood \ninsurance, even though they purchased flood insurance and are now \nflooded out and lost their homes, their farms, and their businesses. \nJust last week, when many of us were home, we pledged immediate \nresponse in an effort to resolve the problem that they have as quickly \nas possible. I simply cannot pass up the opportunity, legislatively, to \nattempt to find a way to reconcile that pledge with my responsibilities \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  So it is in keeping with that effort that I ask unanimous consent \nthat as part of the Coverdell amendment, we allow this small change, \nwhich the administration is completely in support of. There is very, \nvery minimal budgetary exposure involved, and it would be an \nextraordinary measure of assistance to many people who, today, are not \nonly without insurance coverage, but are also without homes. So I \nsimply ask unanimous consent that this small change in the flood \ninsurance law be accommodated in the Coverdell amendment. Then I will \nhave no objection.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object to that \nadditional unanimous-consent request. I might say that I am from a \nState that has been disaster prone, and I know that Senator Daschle's \narea has had all kinds of problems this year--drought, flooding, \nfreezing flooding, the works. We have had similar problems in my State, \nfrom droughts to floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, freezing rain, which \nhave caused terrible devastation. So I am sympathetic to the problem.\n  However, this is asking for a change in the law that has been in \nplace since 1968. Clearly, my constituents and the constituents all \nover America that have had to deal with disasters have complied with \nand have dealt with this 30-day requirement of the insurance coverage \nversus 15 days. Regardless of that, I think it is something we should \nconsider. But we have just recently been aware of the language of the \nSenator from South Dakota in this area. We need to assess whether there \nis objection to it. Will there be a budget impact? What does it mean \nfor people that had to deal with it in the past or will in the future? \nWe are checking with the chairmen of the Budget Committee, the Banking \nCommittee, and the Finance Committee. I think we should not leap to do \nit until we know for sure exactly what the impact would be.\n  Again, I do think we should work with each other in a bipartisan way, \nalways, when disasters are involved. But as good stewards of our \nconstituents, we need to make sure we understand the ramifications, \ntoo.\n  So I think that within, hopefully, a relatively short period of time, \nwe will be able to get an assessment of any negative impact that might \ncome from this.\n  I hope we can get started with this legislation, which is so \nimportant with regard to snooping through IRS files.\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\n Everybody understands that it is wrong. People are outraged by it. \nThere is a bipartisan commitment to it. So if we don't get an agreement \nto get started on this now, or shortly, we will not be able to get it \ndone today, which is symbolically a very important day to do it. So I \nwould not be able to agree to this change in the bill at this time, \nwhile we are talking it out.\n  I have suggested another alternative to make in order as an \namendment. There are a lot of options. We could either withdraw it, or \naccept it, or vote on it later in the day. We will work with the \nSenators that have the jurisdiction. We will talk with the Senator from \nSouth Dakota to see if we can work something out on the flood insurance \nprovision.\n  In the meantime, I do object to the addition at this time. I plead \nwith the Senator to allow us to proceed with this legislation under our \nunanimous-consent request while we continue to work on this issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no objection at all to proceeding \nwith consideration of the legislation. As I indicated, I think Senators \nCoverdell and Glenn ought to be complimented for their work in trying \nto address this matter. There is a difference between proceeding to the \nbill and proceeding under the unanimous-consent request, as propounded \nby the majority leader. I, of course, would object to the unanimous \nconsent request but would have no objection to proceeding to the bill \nin an effort to begin debate.\n  Mr. LOTT. In view of that, then, Mr. President, I am prepared to \nyield the floor. I advise Senators that we will renew our request \nagain, probably within an hour or so after we have had a chance to \ncheck further into this matter.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, be recognized for up to 10 minutes of \nmorning business following the remarks of Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed as in morning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3168-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3169-S3174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hoped to come to the floor today to \ndeliver a statement commending the Attorney General for her courageous \ndecision to do the right thing and request the appointment of an \nindependent counsel to investigate the fundraising violations in \nconnection with the 1996 Presidential election. Regrettably, I am here \ntoday for a much different reason, to express disappointment and \nfrustration with her refusal to even initiate an independent counsel's \nappointment.\n  I appreciate the fact that the Attorney General is under enormous \npressure from the White House, the Congress, the media, and the public, \nand that she is in a very unenviable position. I have respect and \nadmiration for the Attorney General, but her refusal to do what the law \npermits and indeed requires her to do, frankly, does not engender \nrespect or admiration in this instance.\n  The Clinton administration and the Department of Justice is trying to \ncast her decision as a legal decision when, in fact, it is a decision \nwithin her power, and in my opinion, one which she is ethically obliged \nto make.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which, pursuant to its \nstatutory responsibilities requested 33 days ago that the Attorney \nGeneral apply for the appointment of an independent counsel, I am \ncompelled to respond to what can only be characterized as her \ninadequate response. In all candor, the substance of the Attorney \nGeneral's report is vague, ambiguous at best, and at times, legally \ndisingenuous. Especially in light of the fact that the committee \nrequested she evaluate and report on ``all of the information before \nher,'' not just a few isolated allegations, the Attorney General's \nreport also is incomplete, and in a rather selective way at that.\n  A judge in a court of law would recognize the Attorney General's \nreport as a defense brief, too clever by a half, carefully and \nzealously crafted to serve a client's interest. But the Attorney \nGeneral's client here is not the President of the United States or her \npolitical party, it is the public. And the public's confidence that \nthis investigation will be fair, as thorough, and as tough as any \nother, altogether untainted by political considerations, has not been \nfulfilled. I am afraid this client, the public, has been disserved.\n  Given the evasiveness of the Attorney General's report, together with \nthe delay in its transmission and the fact that as the Attorney General \nherself admits, ``much has been discovered,'' since the committee sent \nits letter, I have little choice but to conclude that much to my \ndisappointment, the Attorney General did not receive our request with a \nmind fully open to doing what is plainly in our Nation's best \ninterests.\n  Before responding to the Attorney General's report in more detail, I \nfeel I should briefly review what the independent statute provides for. \nAn independent counsel can be triggered in one of two ways: Where there \nis sufficient information to investigate whether any person ``covered'' \nby the statute may have violated Federal law; or where an investigation \nof someone else who may have violated the law may result in a political \nor other conflict of interest. It is that simple.\n  Let me talk, No. 1, about the mandatory trigger of that legislation. \nWith respect to the first, the mandatory trigger where ``covered \nindividuals'' are at issue, the Attorney General's report does little \nbut make reference to legal ``factors that must be considered,'' and \nthen repeatedly draws the summary conclusion that she does not have \nspecific and credible evidence that a covered individual may have \nviolated the law. Despite the White House's characterization of the \nAttorney General's decision as simply ``applying the law to the \nfacts,'' there is virtually no application of the pertinent law to the \npertinent facts actually before the public, let alone the facts before \nthe Attorney General.\n  While the statute requires the Attorney General to set forth the \nreasons for her decisions with respect to each matter before her, in my \nview she has utterly failed to do so here. To illustrate just a few \nexamples of the inadequacy of the Attorney General's response, let me \npoint out that she fails to specifically explain why an independent \ncounsel is not warranted to further investigate the abundant evidence \nthat covered individuals made extensive and deliberate use of Federal \nproperty and resources for campaign purposes including, for example, \nthe Lincoln bedroom, and other areas of the White House, Air Force One, \nand a computer database costing the taxpayers $1.7 million.\n  An authority higher than me and more independent than the Attorney \nGeneral needs to determine the scope of the various laws implicated by \nthis conduct and whether any of the laws were violated. The Attorney \nGeneral's somewhat evasive approach to this entire matter is aptly \nillustrated by her argument that the use of the Government telephone \ndoes not constitute conversion of Government property. I am sure it \ndoes not. But as the Attorney General knows all too well, that is \nbeside the point. The allegations of misuse of Government property are \nnot based on phone calls.\n  Mr. President, the Attorneys General's evasive approach to this \nentire matter is aptly illustrated by her argument that the use of the \nGovernment telephone does not constitute conversion of Government \nproperty. I am sure it does not. But, as the Attorney General knows all \ntoo well, that is beside the point: The allegations of misuse of \nGovernment property are not based on phone calls, but on the diversion \nof resources, such as the White House, Air Force One, and the White \nHouse database for campaign purposes, while phone solicitations were \nnot alleged to have violated the conversion laws, but rather the \nprohibition on solicitations from Federal property. The conclusion I \ncannot help but draw here is that, however involved the Attorney \nGeneral's career staff was in preparing this letter, in the end, it was \nher political advisers who had the last word.\n  In short, the Attorneys General's carefully finessed and, in some \ncases, deliberately irrelevant legal arguments, combined with her \nsummary\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nconclusions that there is no specific, credible evidence that a covered \nindividual may have violated the law, hardly persuades one that an \nindependent counsel is not mandated under the statute or, for that \nmatter that the question has been given a genuinely thorough and candid \nevaluation.\n  Perhaps more fundamental, though, is the Attorney General's \naltogether inadequate explanation as to why she will not request an \nindependent counsel pursuant to the second statutory trigger --to avoid \na conflict of interest. Here the test is quite simple: If the Attorney \nGeneral is presented with a conflict of interest in investigating \nwhether any individuals may have violated the law, she has the \ndiscretion to proceed with the appointment of an independent counsel. \nTry as the White House and the Attorney General might to cast this as a \nnarrow and technical legal question, it is anything but that; it is an \nethical one requiring sensitive judgment as to what is necessary to \nensure the public's confidence that an investigation can be supervised \nby the Attorney General and completed in a thorough and impartial \nmanner.\n  In the past, the Attorney General has had a rather broad view of what \nis necessary to protect the public's confidence that an investigation \nis not compromised by any perception of a conflict of interest. In her \nWhitewater independent counsel request, for example, Attorney General \nReno concluded that an independent counsel was required because her \ninvestigation would involve an investigation of James McDougal and \n``other individuals associated with the President and Mrs. Clinton'' \nwould amount to a conflict of interest. It was that simple. In her \nreferral of the Nussbaum perjury allegation to the independent counsel, \nthe Attorney General concluded that a conflict of interest existed \nbecause the investigation ``will involve an inquiry into statements \nallegedly made by a former senior member of the White House staff.'' It \nwas that simple. And, testifying before Congress in 1993, Ms. Reno \nstated that the Iran-Contra investigation ``could not have been \nconducted under the supervision of the Attorney General and concluded \nwith any public confidence in its thoroughness or impartiality.'' It \nwas that simple.\n  Indeed, the Attorney General's testimony at that time thoroughly \nexplained her rather strong view that even the slightest appearance of \na conflict of interest should at all costs be avoided by the \nappointment of an independent counsel. It was that simple. She \ntestified:\n\n       There is an inherent conflict of interest whenever senior \n     Executive Branch officials are to be investigated by the \n     Department of Justice and its appointed head, the Attorney \n     General. The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the \n     President. Recognition of this conflict does not belittle or \n     demean the impressive professionalism of the Department's \n     career prosecutors, nor does it question the integrity of the \n     Attorney General and his or her political appointees. \n     Instead, it recognizes the importance of public confidence in \n     our system of justice, and the destructive effect in a free \n     democracy of public cynicism.\n\n  Attorney General Reno further testified:\n\n       It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in the system, and you cannot do that when there \n     is a conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who \n     is, in effect, the chief prosecutor. . .. The Independent \n     Counsel Act was designed to avoid even the appearance of \n     impropriety in the consideration of allegations of misconduct \n     by high-level Executive Branch officials and to prevent. . . \n     the actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Act thus \n     served as a vehicle to further the public's perception of \n     fairness and thoroughness in such matters and to avert even \n     the most subtle influences that may appear in an \n     investigation of highly placed Executive officials.\n\n  Now, in her report to the Judiciary Committee, however, the Attorney \nGeneral adopts a far narrower view of when an independent counsel is \ncalled for. Suddenly, the conflict of interest provision has become a \ncomplicated legal threshold which ``should be invoked only in certain \nnarrow circumstances.'' That is on page 3 of the letter to me. Directly \ncontradicting her own public statements that it is impossible for the \npublic to have confidence in an investigation where there is a \n``conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, in \neffect, the chief prosecutor,'' now the Attorney General claims that \nher discretion is limited only to situations where there is an actual \nconflict of interest. Quite frankly, the Attorney General's efforts to \ndistance herself from her 1993 testimony require her to render a rather \ncreative reading of her own testimony.\n  Allow me to suggest that, to the extent an independent counsel was \ncalled for to ensure public confidence in an investigation of Mr. \nNorth, Mr. Nussbaum or Mr. McDougal and his associates, one certainly \nis called for here. If the Attorney General has adopted a new standard \nfor evaluating when an independent counsel is necessary to ensure the \npublic's confidence in an investigation, she should state as much and \nexplain the basis for her new position.\n  Although the Attorney General does not say as much in her letter, one \ncan only surmise that her position is that First, there is no conflict \nof interest in continuing to investigate any of the individuals already \nunder investigation, that is, Huang, Riady, Trie, Kanchanalak, John \nH.K. Lee, the Wiriadinatas, Charles DeQueljoe, Mark Middleton and \nWebster Hubbell, and second, that there is no basis for investigating \nwhether other high-ranking officials may have violated the law. Since \nGeneral Reno fails to explain her reasoning, let's step back for a \nmoment and review some of the facts here to determine whether either of \nthese apparent positions can really be defended.\n  Take Mr. John Huang, the former Lippo executive whom the Riady's are \nwidely reported to have bragged was placed in the Clinton \nAdministration in exchange for generous donations by the Riady family, \nwhose ties to the Clintons date back to Little Rock in the 1980's. See, \nfor example, the New York Times, October 7, 1996. Recall that the Lippo \nGroup, Huang's former employer, is connected to a far-reaching network \nof seriously questionable activities, directly implicating not just the \nRiadys and Huang, but the other individuals that figure in this \ntroubling scandal, including Charlie Trie, Pauline Kanchanalak, Soraya \nWiriadinata, C.J. Giroir, Mark Middleton, Mark Grobmeyer, Wang Jun, \nCharles DeQueljoe, and even Webster Hubbell. Since the Department is \nalready investigating Huang, there plainly are sufficient grounds to \ninvestigate whether he may have violated federal law. In declining to \ninvoke the discretionary conflict of interest trigger, the Attorney \nGeneral's position, therefore, must be that there is no potential \nconflict of interest in her investigating Huang.\n  Let's take a look at some of this. This is the ``Lippo Group, an \nOverview.''\n  John Huang was a former Lippo executive in the United States. He had \na $780,000 severance package before he went to work for the Government. \nBy the way, before he went to work for the Government, for 5 months he \nhad a security clearance given him by this administration. There is a \nquestion whether that was legal; a former Commerce official, multiple \ncontacts with Lippo during that time; former DNC vice chairman; raised \nmore than $3.4 million; $1.6 million is to be returned; and, he visited \nthe White House more than 75 times.\n  C.J. Giroir, a Lippo Joint Venture person, and a former Rose Law Firm \nattorney, met with James Riady, President Clinton, and Lindsey on Huang \non his move to the DNC. He donated $25,000 to the DNC.\n  Mark Middleton, former White House aide from Little Rock, met with \nJames Riady and President Clinton; has Far East business interests; \nunlimited access to the White House after his departure.\n  Charlie Trie, Little Rock restaurateur, had a $60,000 loan from \nLippo; former Lippo executive; arranged with a former Lippo executive \nAntonio Pan, a Hong Kong dinner for Ron Brown; attempted to give more \nthan $600,000 to the Clinton's legal expense trust; visited the White \nHouse at least 27 times.\n  I can go through all of these other people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the description of each \nof them be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Lippo Group--An Overview\n\n     John Huang:\n       Former top Lippo executive in U.S.\n       $780,000 severance package\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\n       Former Commerce Official-multiple contacts w/Lippo\n       Former DNC Vice Chairman\n       Raised more than $3.4 mill.

Mr. President, let's just take a look at the specific, \ncredible evidence that has surfaced to date. Huang, who received a \nseverance package from Lippo of $788,750 is reported to have:\n  Received a top secret security clearance that could have allowed him \nto review classified intelligence documents, for 5 months while still \nemployed by the Lippo Group, and before he joined the Commerce \nDepartment, all after a lax security check that was limited to his \nactivities in the United States;\n  Made at least 78 visits to the White House during his 18 months at \nthe Commerce Department;\n  Received 37 intelligence briefings on issues relating to China, \nVietnam, and other matters of potential interest to Lippo;\n  Made more than 70 calls to a Lippo-controlled bank; and received at \nleast 70 calls; 39 classified, top-secret briefings; 30 phone \nconversations with Mark Middleton; 9 phone calls from Webster Hubbell; \nreceived at least 9 calls from the Chinese Embassy officials. He had at \nleast three meetings with Chinese Government officials. He had a 1-year \ntop secret clearance after leaving Commerce after he joined the \nDemocratic National Committee. You wonder why national security \ninterests were compromised and why information was given to the DNC.\n  Like I say, he had 30-plus phone conversations with Mark Middleton or \nhis associates. All of them had interests--at least I understand had \ninterests--in the Far East.\n  He had his transfer to the DNC orchestrated at a curious September \n13, 1995, Oval Office meeting attended by the President, Bruce Lindsey, \nJames Riady, and Lippo joint venture partner and former Rose law \npartner, Joseph Giroir;\n  Raised over $3.4 million while at the DNC--money used to reelect the \nPresident--retaining his top secret security clearance even though he \nwas no longer working for the U.S. Government; and had $1.6 million of \nthat $3.4 million used to reelect the President returned because of its \nsuspicious sources.\n  As we now know, John Huang has taken the fifth amendment, or has \nasserted the fifth amendment, while the Riadys have not only taken the \nfifth but they fled the country. Doesn't an investigation of Huang, so \nclose to those who are covered by the statute, and the Riadys, so close \nto those who are covered by the statute who, like the McDougals, are \npolitical supporters and ``individuals associated with the \nPresident,''--to use the Attorney General's language of the past--\ndoesn't that raise a conflict of interest?\n  It isn't just John Huang. Here are some examples of illegal funds \nraised by Huang: The Wiriadinatas, $450,000. They have returned to \nIndonesia. All funds are supposed to have been returned by the DNC. I \nam not sure that is true.\n  Pauline Kanchanalak gave $253,000. She left the country. She is now \nin Thailand. Allegedly all of that $250,000 has been returned by the \nDNC. I am not so sure.\n  Mr. Gandhi gave $250,000; testified he had no assets. How could he \ngive $250,000? All of those funds are supposed to have been returned by \nthe DNC. I am not so sure about that either.\n  John H.K. Lee. He gave $250,000. He has disappeared. And those funds \nwere supposed to be returned by the DNC. I am not so sure they have \ndone it.\n  Then Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple, $166,750 raised there. The temple \nresidents, many of whom gave part of this money, were people who had \ntaken a vow of poverty and had no money to give. Is there no illegality \nthere; nothing to raise a possibility that something may be wrong here \nwhich is what the statute basically says? Supposedly $74,000 of that \nwas returned by the DNC. You mean these things aren't wrong and \nillegal? You mean there is no conflict of interest here at all? If all \nyou do is look at Huang, you have to say there is something wrong here.\n  Then there is Mr. Charles Trie. Trie is a former Little Rock \nrestaurateur, and reportedly a longtime friend of President Clinton who \nnow runs an international trading company in Little Rock, AR. Mr. Trie \nhas also asserted the fifth amendment and has even fled the country, \nalong with these others.\n  He is a business partner with Ng Lap Seng, a Chinese Government \nofficial. He received a $60,000 loan from the Lippo Group. He raised \n$645,000 in questionable funds which have been returned by the DNC. He \nraised $639,000 for the Clinton ``Legal Defense Fund,'' which was \nreturned because the source of the money could not be identified; or \nthe sources of the moneys could not be identified.\n  He was during this period receiving wire transfers of very large sums \nfrom the Bank of China, owned by the Chinese Government.\n  He visited the White House 37 times.\n  He escorted Mr. Wang Jun, a Chinese arms merchant, to a White House \ncoffee last year, which, when revealed, was described by the President \nas ``inappropriate.''\n  He wrote the President in March 1996 to question his decision to \ndeploy aircraft carriers to the Taiwan straits when the Chinese test-\nfired missiles in Taiwan's direction, receiving a personal letter back \nfrom the President assuring Trie that the United States only wanted \npeace in the region; arranged a Hong Kong dinner for former Commerce \nSecretary Ron Brown; and, finally, was formally appointed to a \nPresidential Commission on Asian Trade in April 1996.\n  To the extent there was a conflict of interest preventing public \nconfidence in the Justice Department's investigation of Oliver North or \nJames McDougal, certainly the same conflict exists with respect to an \ninvestigation of Huang, the Riadys, and Trie, not to mention the \nhandful of other individuals who have taken or will assert the fifth \namendment, fled the country, or done both, including Pauline \nKanchanalak, Arief and Soraya Wiriadanata, John H.K. Lee, and Charles \nDeQueljoe. Frankly, there is even more of a conflict here.\n  Moreover, it has become clear that there is specific, credible \ninformation providing sufficient grounds to investigate whether various \nhigh-ranking members of the administration may have known of, or \nconspired in, any of these apparent fundraising violations. Indeed, we \nnow know from the Ickes files that the decision to transfer Huang from \nthe Commerce Department to his fundraising role in the DNC was made at \nthe September 13, 1995, Oval Office meeting which included not just \nHuang, James Riady, and Lippo Joint Venture Partner and former Rose Law\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nPartner Joseph Giroir, but Bruce Lindsey--who seems to pop up in all of \nthese instances--and President Clinton himself, and that a participant \nat this Oval Office meeting reportedly recommended that the President \n``reassign Huang from his Government job to a political fund-raising \njob, where he could extract contributions for favors done and favors \nyet to come.'' The New York Times, March 5, 1997. Mr. Ickes' notes \nexpressly indicate that Huang had specifically targeted ``overseas \nChinese.'' And it has been reported how this decision to transfer Huang \nto the DNC, made at that September 13, 1995, Oval Office meeting, was \ndirectly linked to a plan, agreed to just days earlier by the \nPresident, Dick Morris, Harold Ickes, and others, to raise funds to \nwage a preemptive television ad campaign. See New York Times, April 14, \n1997. In short, isn't there sufficient information at least to \ninvestigate whether any of these top-level White House advisers were \naware of or involved in Huang's and the Riady's far-reaching scheme to \nlaunder foreign funds into Democratic campaign coffers? Does the \nAttorney General expect the public to have confidence that she can \nthoroughly and dispassionately investigate individuals among the \nPresident's closest advisers without any conflict?\n  Similarly, there is now a wealth of information documenting the \nextensive involvement from the President down through Mr. Ickes and \nother White House advisers in the plans, discussed earlier, to use the \nLincoln bedroom, the White House, Air Force One, and the White House's \ncomputer database to further campaign purposes, and that campaign \ncontributions were received at the White House. The Attorney General \nclaims she is ``actively investigating'' whether laws were violated. \nDoesn't this investigation of these high-level White House advisers, \neven if not covered individuals, present a conflict at least as great \nas the conflict that apparently existed with regard to the \ninvestigations of Mr. North and Mr. McDougal?\n  How can one say that there is no conflict when the FBI and White \nHouse are publicly squabbling over whether the White House should \nreceive information about the investigation, and the Attorney General \nis smack in the middle of this squabble; when the White House falsely \naccuses the FBI of telling the National Security Council staff not to \npass on information regarding Chinese attempts to illegally influence \nUnited States policymakers?\n  Indeed, the very fact that the FBI, an agency within the Justice \nDepartment, refused to produce this information to the White House on \nthe eve of Secretary Albright's visit to China clearly suggests that \nthe investigation has already reached high up into the White House. It \nis curious, to say the least, that the Department of Justice leaked its \ndecision to the press over the weekend, but it did not actually notify \nthe Judiciary Committee of its decision until 6:30 last night, 2 days \nafter this letter was due. Furthermore, the Acting Deputy Attorney \nGeneral's assertion that the fact that both Judiciary Committees have \nmade a formal request would emphatically not have any impact on their \ndecision suggests to me that the Justice Department is in a defense \nmode.\n  In short, I think there is little doubt there is at the very least a \npotential conflict of interest in having the Justice Department \ninvestigate these matters. The administration should not be \ninvestigating itself, it is just as simple as that, as long as we have \nan independent counsel statute. Simply claiming to defer to career \nJustice Department officials will not do. Would the public accept a \nMember of Congress not recusing himself or herself from a particular \nmatter on which he or she had a major conflict of interest because \nstaff recommended they not recuse themselves? Would the public accept a \njudge's refusal to recuse himself or herself in the face of a conflict \nbecause a clerk advised against it?\n  The fact is that the DNC, the Democratic National Committee, has \nsimply, on the basis of its own audit, already identified over $3 \nmillion in improper contributions, violations of law, if you will. A \nsignificant portion of this illicit money has not even been returned \nyet, only confirming that this $3 million has already been spent, spent \nto reelect President Clinton.\n  We have people calling for campaign finance reform on this floor. Why \ndon't we enforce the campaign finance laws that are already on the \nbooks. That is what this is all about, in part, I have to tell you. \nThree million dollars in illegal funds, illicit funds spent to reelect \nthe President, already spent. I wonder how Candidate Dole feels about \nthat.\n  The need for an independent counsel is not merely a matter of \napplying the law to the facts. The chorus we are now hearing from the \nPresident's press secretary and the Democratic apologists would seem to \nindicate that that is so when in fact it is not. In my opinion, \nAttorney General Reno was presented with an ethical question, a \nquestion ultimately of whether the public can have confidence in this \ninvestigation, whether the public can have confidence in this Justice \nDepartment, and whether the public can have confidence in the Clinton \nadministration itself. Make no mistake about it. Attorney General \nReno's decision yesterday was a significant political event, one which, \nmuch to my regret, will subject her to serious and I think justified \ncriticism. This is not a happy day for the Department of Justice or for \nthe public confidence in our system of justice. By continuing to permit \nwhat certainly appears to be a very serious conflict of interest, the \nAttorney General regrettably has, to use her own words, brought upon \nthe Nation ``the destructive effect in a free democracy of public \ncynicism.''\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, that has already been \ngranted.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was seeking recognition on the same subject. Senator \nHagel, I believe, is on the way up to join me for 10 minutes. This is a \nseparate request. Is it possible to do both?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to address the issue that the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee raised, and I am glad he stayed in the Chamber. I could not \ndisagree with him more. If this really is a contest over the \nprofessionalism of Attorney General Janet Reno, I feel very confident \nto stand by her. On four separate occasions, Attorney General Reno has \nexercised the right to call for an independent counsel within the \nClinton administration, three of those counsel investigating members \nappointed to the President's Cabinet and a fourth investigating the \nWhitewater controversy involving the Clinton family itself. It is very \nclear to me that Attorney General Reno is calling these as she sees \nthem.\n\n  Look at the situation that we now have before us. The Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives, Mr. Gingrich, leaders of the Republican \nParty, all come forward and say that if Attorney General Reno does not \nask for an independent counsel, they are going do drag her up to \nCapitol Hill, put her before the committee, maybe put her under oath, \nand demand to know why she has not called for an independent counsel.\n  I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate the independent counsel \nstatute itself is hanging on by a slender thread if we try to \npoliticize this process and pressure the Attorney General into calling \nfor an investigation where it is not warranted.\n  Keep in mind the creation of this statute came from an era when \nPresident Nixon fired Archibald Cox as a special prosecutor, the so-\ncalled Saturday Night Massacre. The independent counsel statute was \ncreated to try to put in place a third party or a dispassionate or a \ndetached approach to investigations. And now, because those in the \nmajority, the Republican Party, are dissatisfied that Attorney General \nReno has not called for an independent counsel, you hear all sorts of \ncomments about we are going to put the pressure on her; we are going to \nbring her up here and put her before a committee to answer all these \nquestions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield in just a moment. It just may be \na fact that there is insufficient evidence to support the charges which \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\nfrom Utah and other Republicans believe. Now, this Attorney General has \nbeen involved in this investigation for a long period of time with 50 \ndifferent FBI agents. If the newspaper reports are accurate, she has \nbasically said that she will turn to her career prosecutors to make \nthis call. I trust her judgment. I think we should trust her judgment. \nApplying political pressure at this point on the Attorney General is \nnot in the best interests of a good investigation that may be necessary \nand may lead to the appointment of an independent counsel.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my colleague yielding.\n  Let us just make it clear to my colleague that this chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and Chairman Hyde over in the House, when many \npeople were calling for us to send her a letter, delayed and delayed, \ngiving the Attorney General a lot of time, nor have we been calling \nimproperly for her to act in any way other than properly. But it will \nbe interesting for people to know that we had scheduled our oversight \nhearing for May 20 for the Attorney General to come in and to be \nexamined by the Judiciary Committee. I think for the information of \neverybody who is here, she has agreed to come earlier than that, within \nthe next 3 weeks, probably in the first week of May, and at that time \nshe will have to justify this decision.\n  I think it is also safe to point out that I have been a very strong \nsupporter of the Attorney General and still care for her a great deal. \nI do not like to see her subjected to this, but this is, to my \nknowledge, the first time that the letters from thoughtful chairmen and \nall the Republicans on both sides of the Judiciary Committee have been \nrejected and I think under much more stringent circumstances than \nindependent counsel she has granted in the past.\n  So I personally hope she can assert why she has not decided to at \nleast conduct a preliminary investigation which would have triggered \nanother 90 days to do this. I suggested to her and to the Justice \nDepartment that she do that.\n  I also do not accept the--I am sorry; I will not take much longer. I \ndo not accept her assertion that she is relying on professional staff \nmembers.\n  Now, I have a lot of confidence in the professional staff members \ndown there, but this involves a lot more than that and, frankly, \ninvolves just how this statute is going to be applied.\n  When the time comes to reconsider this statute, I will be very \ninterested in working with the distinguished Senator from Illinois and \nothers to make sure that, if we are going to have a statute like this, \nlet us have it so it works, and, frankly, I have qualms about having it \nat all. But since we do have it and since it does have these two main \nmethods of triggering the call for an independent counsel and the \nappointment of an independent counsel, I have to say I am sadly \ndisappointed that she has not chosen to do that under these \ncircumstances. But I do understand my colleague at this hour rising to \ndefend Attorney General Reno. I am not attacking her personally. I am \njust attacking what has been done here, and I think it should have been \ndone before.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah. I want to say this much. \nIf there has been any criticism of Attorney General Janet Reno in the \nlast 6 months, it is that she is too independent. There was a question \nas to whether this President would even reappoint her because of her \nindependence, the fact she had named four independent counsel. That has \nbeen the criticism of Attorney General Reno. She calls them as she sees \nthem. She is a professional.\n  She has made a decision today which the Republicans are unhappy with; \nthey wanted an independent counsel named in this case. But when she \nnamed four previous independent counsel, they cheered--good judgment, \ngood work. Now, when she has decided not to call for one, they want to \nbring her up to Capitol Hill, put her before the committee, start \nasking questions: Why won't you bend to this pressure? I hope she does \nnot. I hope she calls it based on the evidence.\n\n  On a show that I was on last night, one of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side said, ``Hasn't there been enough time here? Shouldn't \nshe call for an independent counsel?''\n  This is not about time. This is about evidence, credible witnesses. \nIf they do not come forward with the evidence and with the testimony to \njustify an independent counsel, I hope Attorney General Reno will not \nbow to pressure here. I hope she will stand up for what she believes \nin. And as a Democrat, I am prepared to accept her decision. I believe \nshe is professional enough that we can stand behind her. But we \njeopardize the future of this statute, and I think we ought to think \ntwice about it, by putting this kind of public pressure on the Attorney \nGeneral trying to push her in one political direction or the other.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Does the Senator from Illinois \nyield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I had asked for an additional 10 minutes \non another topic with the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for just 90 seconds?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to say this in response. I just spent 30 \nminutes laying out some of the evidence that I think clearly shows the \ngrounds for further investigation. The question is how can the Attorney \nGeneral continue this investigation within the Department without a \nconflict of interest? I do not think she can. Again, I will cite her \ntestimony back in 1993.\n  She had a strong view that even the slightest appearance of a \nconflict of interests should, at all costs, be avoided by the \nindependent counsel. She said this:\n       . . . there is an inherent conflict of interest whenever \n     senior Executive Branch officials are to be investigated by \n     the Department of Justice and its appointed head, the \n     Attorney General. The Attorney General serves at the pleasure \n     of the President. Recognition of this conflict does not \n     belittle or demean the impressive professionalism of the \n     Department's career prosecutors, nor does it question the \n     integrity of the Attorney General and his or her political \n     appointees. Instead, it recognizes the importance of public \n     confidence in our system of justice, and the destructive \n     effect in a free democracy of public cynicism.\n\n  She further testified that:\n\n       It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in the system and you cannot do that when there is \n     conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, \n     in effect, the chief prosecutor. . . . The Independent \n     Counsel Act as designed to avoid even the appearance of \n     impropriety in the consideration of allegations of misconduct \n     by high-level Executive Branch officials and to prevent . . . \n     the actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Act thus \n     served as a vehicle to further the public's perception of \n     fairness and thoroughness in such matters, and to avert even \n     the most subtle influences that may appear in an \n     investigation of highly-placed Executive officials.\n\n  I really believe that the case has been made here. And, although I \nstill have very fond feelings toward the Attorney General, I think she \nhas made a tragic error. And I believe that this is not going to end \nit. In the end, I think we would have been a lot farther down the road \nhad she applied for the appointment of an independent counsel.\n  Be that as it may, these remarks had to be made because they are \nimportant. Either we are going to have a statute or we are not. As I \nhave said, I have never been a strong supporter of this statute. But it \nis there and it has been used in prior administrations. It has been \nused in this administration. And this case, it seems to me, is even \nmore overwhelming than some of the prior cases where it has been used.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, who has time at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the remaining \ntime.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me just say in closing, on this \nparticular issue, before I move to the other with Senator Hagel, this \nis a matter of the Attorney General's discretion. Whether that Attorney \nGeneral is a Democrat or a Republican, under this statute the Attorney \nGeneral is to gather the evidence, listen to the testimony, and decide \nwhether or not that evidence and testimony crosses a threshold to \nsuggest that a crime has been committed, either by a covered person in \nthe administration or a Member of Congress, or creating a conflict of \ninterest between the administration and the investigation.\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\n  If I listened and heard correctly, the Senator from Utah questions \nwhether or not an Attorney General, appointed by a President, can \nexercise appropriate discretion when there has been a suggestion that \nthat President or his Cabinet be investigated.\n  What the Senator from Utah calls into question is more than the \njudgment of any specific Attorney General. He calls into question the \nvery existence of the statute. I think there are many deficiencies in \nthis statute. I think we should address those, and perhaps reauthorize \nit with some changes. Among those changes, I might add, is that if an \nindependent counsel is to be appointed, that independent counsel be \ntruly independent.\n  In the history of this statute, 15 independent counsels have been \nnamed: 11 Republicans, 2 Independents, 2 Democrats. This process has \nbeen loaded to appoint Republican independent counsels. And how? \nBecause the three judges who make the appointment, named by the Chief \nJustice, have created a daisy chain, where they are appointed for 2 \nyears as the statute calls for and then reappointed for another 2 \nyears. They keep coming back, over and over and over again, the same \npeople, making the same judgments about the appointment of independent \ncounsel.\n  I think this statute needs to be addressed. But, if we are going to \nattack this Attorney General because she has to exercise her \ndiscretion, believe me that is what the statute says that she must do. \nShe must look at that evidence, decide whether it is credible, and \ndecide whether to go forward. As unhappy as the Republicans may be with \nthis decision by the Attorney General, I trust her judgment. I trust \nher professional judgment. If she says at this moment it is not \nwarranted, I think she is right. I will stand by it.\n  Should she change her mind at some later date, I will accept that \ndecision, too. But to call her up here and put her under pressure \nbecause she has made that decision is a serious, serious mistake.\n  At this point I believe there has been a unanimous-consent request \nfor 10 minutes for Senator Hagel and myself to address another issue, \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining of that \ntime.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin and Mr. Hagel pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 575 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this Senator inquires of the order of \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is scheduled to recess absent a \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may proceed as in \nmorning business for no more than 6 to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3169-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3174-S3175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OUR SYSTEM OF TAXATION\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is likely the single most frustrating \nday of the year for many Americans. What self-respecting member of any \nlegislative body would not take to the floor and talk about his or her \nfavorite subject, taxes? We could all relate to the tension of the day \nand the frustration of working our way through the ``simplified'' tax \nforms, worrying about making an inadvertent mistake. But, also, how we \nare going to do what is expected of us? With April 15 now upon us, it \nis time to reflect on our system of taxation and the burden it places \non each and every one of us who live in this country.\n  I know at times the IRS finds itself as the brunt of many jokes. But \nto a lot of folks in Montana, tax day is no laughing matter. The fact \nis, families all across this Nation are forced to make some tough \nfinancial choices each year around this time. Serious questions are \nbeing asked. What can we do as a family to pay our fair share of taxes? \nBy and large, Americans know, and they understand that some taxes are \nnecessary to pay for the essential government services: For education, \nfor the infrastructure of transportation and other services that we \nenjoy. But the question also surfaces on how to balance our family \nneeds.\n  All too often, the options given require sacrifices. And, you know \nwhat? They affect children and they affect relationships. Most times, \nit is not fair. And sometimes it is just not right.\n  Unfortunately, it seems we are living in an age when only one wage \nearner cannot live financially secure and comfortable. Nowadays, in \norder to make ends meet both parents are working, even though one may \nprefer to remain home with their children. Families in which one parent \nchooses to remain at home often struggle financially, living paycheck \nto paycheck, while, on the other hand, dual-income families find a \ndisproportionate share of the second check being melted away with added \nexpenses of cost of child care, additional transportation needs and so \non, and still no tax relief on the burden that is suffered on the \nsecond paycheck. Neither situation leaves families in a comfortable \nfinancial condition. Time and time again we have seen bad economic \nconditions lead to the demise of families and the family structure. Who \nsuffers? Our children suffer.\n  I believe it is important that we begin the process of reform, which \nwill allow our families more options and, in the end, allow them to \nkeep more of what they earn. Those decisions should be and could be \nmade at home instead of some IRS office or, yes, an office here in \nWashington, DC. Let families decide, make the financial decision of \nwhat to do with their income. All the polls that I have seen taken on \nthe attitudes of Americans tell us that our current system of taxation \nis in bad need of reform. I agree. Giving Montanans and all Americans \nthe opportunity to be financially secure should be the goal.\n  I might add at this point, the Nation's tax collection agency also \nneeds to do something about its own image. That may be a feat that \nborders on the impossible, but it should be attempted. There are two \ntaxes, in my estimation, that are destructive of the majority of \nfamilies. They are death taxes--the estate taxes--and capital gains. \nMontana, my State, is a State made up of family-run farms and ranches \nand small businesses. With regard to the death taxes, upon the death of \nan owner of a small family business or a family farmer ranch, the \nfamily is required to pay more than 55 percent of the value of the farm \nor business value in excess of $600,000. The only thing the survivors \nwant to do is simply continue operating the family business or farm.\n  But in most cases, they are forced to sell it in order to pay those \ndeath taxes. No one--no one, Mr. President--should be forced to sell \nthe farm to save the farm.\n  Another equally burdensome tax is the capital gains tax, which \npunishes those who choose to save and invest for their future. This tax \naffects everybody who saves and invests to ensure they can take care of \nthemselves and their loved ones. Like the estate tax, the capital gains \ntax is punitive. It is a voluntary tax. You do not have to pay capital \ngains tax because you do not have to sell. If you do not sell, you \nlimit economic opportunity in the financial community.\n  Like the estate tax, it is a form of double taxation, moneys taxed \nonce it is earned as income and again upon the sale of an asset or \ninvestment, and Lord knows how many times in between, making it even \nmore difficult for families to save for the future.\n  The capital gains tax has a top rate of 28 percent, which is among \nthe highest in the world. Many of the world's strongest economic \npowers, including Germany, Hong Kong and South Korea, have no capital \ngains tax at all. These countries recognize the importance of savings. \nThey also recognize the importance of investments, and they know what \nit takes to create jobs, maintain an economic growth and stability and, \nlet's face it, governments cannot take all the money and provide a \nstable financial future for anybody with the exception of those who \nchoose to exploit their own government.\n  There is no question in my mind, in order to strengthen the American \nfamily, we must make them economically secure. No matter what we say or \nhow good it seems, Government cannot do that. With juvenile crime at an \nall-time high, there is no hope for young people if they cannot see a \nfuture that\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nallows them to use their God-given talents to ensure economic and \npolitical freedom.\n  We must put in place those policies that allow us to provide \nessential Government services, help those who cannot help themselves \nand build the infrastructure that provides us with opportunity and \npromise for the future. We must work to ease the excessive tax burden \nbeing shouldered by families.\n  It would be a noble work, indeed, in this Senate, if we could provide \nfor the time when decisions could be made by families at the kitchen \ntable with regard to their economic and political future, when parents \nhad more options.

Mr. President, I want to comment on the independent \ncounsel decision of the Attorney General.\n  The Attorney General's obligation is to follow the law. It is not to \nrespond to political pressure from whatever source.\n  Now, over the last weekend, there were some extraordinary attempts \nmade by a number of House Republican leaders to literally scare the \nAttorney General into doing what they wanted. Both Speaker Gingrich and \nMajority Leader Armey said Sunday, in effect, that if the Attorney \nGeneral did not seek an independent counsel, it is because she caved in \nto administration pressure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the April 14 article of the Washington \nPost, entitled ``Republicans Warn Reno on Independent Counsel,'' be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, those comments by the Speaker and the \nmajority leader of the House constitute an attempt at political \nintimidation and coercion. Their message to the Attorney General was \nthat if she doesn't seek the appointment of an independent counsel, she \nwould run the risk of being brought before a congressional committee \nand that she would be investigated, she would be put under oath, as \nthough she, somehow or other, is violating her oath.\n  The statements by the Republican leaders in the House fly in the face \nof the very purpose of our independent counsel law. Now, this is a \nstatute that we passed, on a bipartisan basis, to take politics out of \ncriminal investigations of high-level officials. But the Speaker of the \nHouse and the majority leader of the House worked mighty hard to put \npolitics right back into the law. Their threats to the Attorney \nGeneral--and that is exactly what they were--to make her do what they \nwant were inappropriate, and they jeopardize the very law that they are \ndemanding she invoke.\n  She is required and was required to follow the law, wherever it leads \nher, despite the clumsy efforts at political intimidation of the \nSpeaker of the House and the majority leader of the House. Their \ncomments and their efforts to intimidate and coerce her to reach a \nconclusion that they believe is the right conclusion are inappropriate; \nthey undermine a very important law, and they put that law's usefulness \ninto jeopardy.\n  There are thresholds in the independent counsel law. The Attorney \nGeneral has gone through, very carefully, in her letter to the Congress \nwhy it is she does not at this time seek the appointment of an \nindependent counsel. She has gone through the evidence that she has and \nhas indicated why the thresholds in the statute have not been met. She \nhas done so carefully and professionally.\n  I urge every Member of this body to read the Attorney General's \nletter to Senator Hatch before they join any partisan effort to attempt \nto undermine the purpose of the law and to partisanize it.\n  Now, Senator Cohen and I worked mighty hard to reauthorize this law. \nWe did it more than once. We did it because it holds out the hope that \nserious allegations against high-level officials can be dealt with on a \nnonpartisan basis. That hope is being dashed by the kind of excessive \ncomments that the Speaker of the House and majority leader of the House \nengaged in last weekend when they engaged in threats and coercion, \nattempting to politically intimidate the Attorney General of the United \nStates. She has not shown a reluctance to use the independent counsel \nstatute when the threshold has been met. She is following the law to \nthe best of her conscience and ability. She has done a professional \njob. I commend her for following the law and the public integrity \nsection recommendation in her Department, rather than bowing to \npolitical pressure. I emphasize that she has not, and I believe will \nnot, bow to political pressure from whatever source or whatever \ndirection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Attorney General's letter to Senator \nHatch be printed in the Record at this time.\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On March 13, 1997, you and nine other \n     majority party members of the Committee on the Judiciary of \n     the United States Senate wrote to me requesting the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate possible \n     fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign. You made that request pursuant to a \n     provision of the Independent Counsel Act, 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 592(g)(1), which provides that ``a majority of majority \n     party members [of the Committee on the Judiciary] * * * may \n     request in writing that the Attorney General apply for the \n     appointment of an independent counsel.'' The Act requires me \n     to respond within 30 days, setting forth the reasons for my \n     decision on each of the matters with respect to which your \n     request is made. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(2).\n       I am writing to inform you that I have not initiated a \n     ``preliminary investigations'' (as that term is defined in \n     the Independent Counsel Act) of any of the matters mentioned \n     in your letter. Rather, as you know, matters relating to \n     campaign financing in the 1996 Federal elections have been \n     under active investigation since November by a task force of \n     career Justice Department prosecutors and Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI) agents. This task force is pursuing the \n     investigation vigorously and diligently, and it will continue \n     to do so. I can assure you that I have given your views and \n     your arguments careful thought, but at this time, I am unable \n     to agree, based on the facts and the law, that an independent \n     counsel should be appointed to handle this investigation.\n       1. The Independent Counsel Act:\n       In order to explain my reasons, I would like to outline \n     briefly the relevant provisions of the Independent Counsel \n     Act. The Act can be invoked in two circumstances that are \n     relevant here:\n       First, if there are sufficient allegations (as further \n     described below) of criminal activity by a covered person, \n     defined as the President and Vice President, cabinet \n     officers, certain other enumerated high Federal officials, or \n     certain specified officers of the President's election \n     campaign (not party officials), see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(b), I \n     must seek appointment of an independent counsel.\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\n       Second, if there are sufficient allegations of criminal \n     activity by a person other than a covered person, and I \n     determine that ``an investigation or prosecution of [that] \n     person by the Department of Justice may result in a personal, \n     financial or political conflict of interest,'' see 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 591(c)(1), I may seek appointment of an independent \n     counsel.\n       In either case, I must follow a two-step process to \n     determine whether the allegations are sufficient. First, I \n     must determine whether the allegations are sufficiently \n     specific and credible to constitute grounds to investigate \n     whether an individual may have violated Federal criminal law. \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(d). If so, the Department commences a \n     ``preliminary investigation'' for up to 90 days (which can be \n     extended an additional 60 days upon a showing of good cause). \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(a). If, at the conclusion of this \n     ``preliminary investigation,'' I determine that further \n     investigation of the matters is warranted, I must seek an \n     independent counsel.\n       Certain important features of the Act are critical to my \n     decision in this case:\n       First, the Act sets forth the only circumstances in which I \n     may seek an independent counsel pursuant to its provisions. I \n     may not invoke its procedures unless the statutory \n     requirements are met.\n       Second, the Act does not permit or require me to commence a \n     preliminary investigation unless there is specific and \n     credible evidence that a crime may have been committed. In \n     your letter, you suggest that it is not the responsibility of \n     the Department of Justice to determine whether a particular \n     set of facts suggests a potential Federal crime, but that \n     such legal determinations should be left to an independent \n     counsel. I do not agree. Under the Independent Counsel \n     Act, it is the Department's obligation to determine in the \n     first instance whether particular conduct potentially \n     falls within the scope of a particular criminal statute \n     such that criminal investigation is warranted. If it is \n     our conclusion that the alleged conduct is not criminal, \n     then there is no basis for appointment of an independent \n     counsel, because there would be no specific and credible \n     allegation of a violation of criminal law. See 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 592(a)(1).\n       Third, there is an important difference between the \n     mandatory and discretionary provisions of the Act. Once I \n     have received specific and credible allegations of criminal \n     conduct by a covered person, I must commence a preliminary \n     investigation and, if further investigation is warranted at \n     the end of the preliminary investigation, seek appointment of \n     an independent counsel. If, on the other hand, I receive \n     specific and credible evidence that a person not covered by \n     the mandatory provisions of the Act has committed a crime, \n     and I determine that a conflict of interest exists with \n     respect to the investigation of that person, I may--but need \n     not--commence a preliminary investigation pursuant to the \n     provisions of the Act. This provision gives me the \n     flexibility to decide whether, overall, the national interest \n     would be best served by appointment of an independent counsel \n     in such a case, or whether it would be better for the \n     Department of Justice to continue a vigorous investigation of \n     the matter.\n       Fourth, even this discretionary provision is not available \n     unless I find a conflict of interest of the sort contemplated \n     by the Act. The Congress has made it very clear that this \n     provision should be invoked only in certain narrow \n     circumstances. Under the Act, I must conclude that there is a \n     potential for an actual conflict of interest, rather than \n     merely an appearance of a conflict of interest. The Congress \n     expressly adopted this higher standard to ensure that the \n     provision would not be invoked unnecessarily. See 128 Cong. \n     Rec. H 9507 (daily ed. December 13, 1982) (statement of Rep. \n     Hall). Moreover, I must find that there is the potential for \n     such an actual conflict with respect to the investigation of \n     a particular person, not merely with respect to the overall \n     matter. Indeed, when the Act was reauthorized in 1994, \n     Congress considered a proposal for a more flexible standard \n     for invoking the discretionary clause, which would have \n     permitted its use to refer any ``matter'' to an Independent \n     Counsel when the purposes of the Act would be served.\n       Congress rejected this suggestion, explaining that such a \n     standard would ``substantially lower the threshold for use of \n     the general discretionary provision.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. No. \n     511, 103rd Cong., 2nd Sess. 9 (1994).\n       2. Covered Persons--The Mandatory Provisions of the Act:\n       Let me now turn to the specific allegations in your letter. \n     You assert that there are ``new questions of possible \n     wrongdoing by senior White House officials themselves,'' and \n     you identify a number of particular types of conduct in \n     support of this claim. While all of the specific issues you \n     mention are under review or active investigation by the task \n     force, at this time we have no specific, credible evidence \n     that any covered White House official may have committed a \n     Federal crime in respect of any of these issues. \n     Nevertheless, I will discuss separately each area that you \n     raise.\n       a. Fundraising on Federal Property. First, you suggest that \n     ``federal officials may have illegally solicited and/or \n     received contributions on federal property.'' The conduct you \n     describe could be a violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 607. We are \n     aware of a number of allegations of this sort; all are being \n     evaluated, and where appropriate, investigations have been \n     commenced. The Department takes allegations of political \n     fundraising by Federal employees on Federal property \n     seriously, and in appropriate cases would not hesitate to \n     prosecute such matters. Indeed, the Public Integrity Section, \n     which is overseeing the work of the campaign financing task \n     force, recently obtained a number of guilty pleas from \n     individuals who were soliciting and accepting political \n     contributions within the Department of Agriculture.\n       The analysis of a potential section 607 violation is a \n     fact-specific inquiry. A number of different factors must be \n     considered when reviewing allegations that this law may have \n     been violated:\n       First, the law specifically applies only to contributions \n     as technically defined by the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     (FECA)--funds commonly referred to as ``hard money.'' The \n     statute originally applied broadly to any political \n     fundraising, but in 1979, over the objection of the \n     Department of Justice, Congress narrowed the scope of section \n     607 to render it applicable only to FECA contributions. \n     Before concluding that section 607 may have been violated, we \n     must have evidence that a particular solicitation involved a \n     ``contribution'' within the definition of the FECA.\n       Second, there are private areas of the White House that, as \n     a general rule, fall outside the scope of the statute, \n     because of the statutory requirement that the particular \n     solicitation occur in an area ``occupied in the discharge of \n     official duties.'' 3 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 31 (1979). The \n     distinction recognizes that while the Federal Government \n     provides a residence to the President, similar to the housing \n     that it might provide to foreign service officers, this \n     residence is still the personal home of an individual within \n     which restrictions that might validly apply to the Federal \n     workplace should not be imposed. Before we can conclude that \n     section 607 may have been violated, we must have evidence \n     that fundraising took place in locations covered by the \n     provisions of the statute.\n       Thus, while you express concerns about the possibility of \n     ``specific solicitation . . . made by federal officials at \n     the numerous White House overnights, coffees, and other \n     similar events,'' we do not at this time have any specific \n     and credible evidence of any such solicitation by any covered \n     person that may constitute a violation of section 607.\n       We do not suggest, of course, that our consideration of \n     information concerning fundraising on Federal property is \n     limited to whether the conduct constituted a violation only \n     of section 607. However, at this point in time, we have no \n     specific and credible evidence to suggest that any crime was \n     committed by any covered person in connection with these \n     allegations.\n       b. Misuse of Government Resources. You next assert that \n     Government property and employees may have been used \n     illegally to further campaign interests--conduct which might, \n     in some circumstances, constitute a theft or conversion of \n     Government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 651. \n     Again, we are actively investigating allegations that such \n     misconduct may have occurred. However, we are unaware at this \n     time of any evidence that any covered person participated in \n     any such activity, other than use of Government property that \n     is permitted under Federal law, such as the reports that the \n     Vice President used a Government telephone, charging the \n     calls to a nongovernment credit card. Federal regulations \n     permit such incidental use of Government property for \n     otherwise lawful personal purposes. See, e.g., 5 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 2635.704; 41 C.F.R. Sec. 201-21.601 (personal long \n     distance telephone calls). Thus, for example, allegations \n     that a Government telephone or telefacsimile machine may have \n     been used on a few occasions by a covered person for personal \n     purposes does not amount to an allegation of a Federal crime. \n     To the extent that there are allegations warranting \n     investigation that individuals not covered by the Independent \n     Counsel Act diverted Government resources, it is my \n     conclusion, as I explain below, that there is at present no \n     conflict of interest for the Department of Justice to \n     investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute those involved in \n     any such activity.\n       c. Foreign Efforts to Influence U.S. Policy. You next cite \n     reports suggesting the possibility that foreign contributions \n     may have been made in hopes of influencing American policy \n     decisions. These allegations are under active investigation \n     by the task force. The facts known at this time, however, do \n     not indicate the criminal involvement of any covered person \n     in such conduct.\n       It is neither unique nor unprecedented or the Department to \n     receive information that foreign interests might be seeking \n     to infuse money into American political campaigns. That was \n     precisely the scenario that underlay the criminal \n     investigations, prosecutions and congressional hearings \n     during the late 1970s involving allegations that a Korean \n     businessman was making illegal campaign contributions, among \n     other things, to Members of Congress to curry congressional \n     support for the Government of South Korea. In a more recent \n     example, in 1996 an individual was prosecuted and convicted \n     for funneling Indian Government funds into Federal elections \n     through the cover of a political action committee.\n       Absent specific and credible evidence of complicity by a \n     covered person, it has never been suggested that the mere \n     allegation that a foreign government may have been trying to \n     provide funds to Federal campaigns should warrant appointment \n     of an independent counsel. Nor can it be the case that an \n     independent counsel is required to investigate because \n     campaign contributors or\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\n     those who donated to political parties believed their \n     largesse would influence policy or achieve access. The \n     Department of Justice routinely handles such allegations, and \n     because of its experience in reviewing and investigating \n     these sensitive matters, embracing, among other things, \n     issues of national security, is particularly well-equipped to \n     do so.\n       d. Coordination of Campaign Fundraising and Expenditures. \n     You also suggest that the ``close coordination by the White \n     House over the raising and spending of `soft'--and \n     purportedly independent--DNC funds violated Federal election \n     laws, and/or had the legal effect of rendering those funds \n     subject to campaign finance limitations they otherwise would \n     not be subject to.'' We believe this statement misapprehends \n     the law. The FECA does not prohibit the coordination of \n     fundraising or expenditures between a party and its \n     candidates for office. Indeed, the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC), the body charged by Congress with \n     primary responsibility for interpreting and enforcing the \n     FECA, has historically assumed coordination between a \n     candidate and his or her political party.\n       Of course, coordinated expenditures may be unlawful under \n     the FECA if they are made with funds from prohibited sources, \n     if they were misreported, or if they exceed applicable \n     expenditure limits. However, we presently lack specific and \n     credible evidence suggesting that any covered person \n     participated in any such violations, if they occurred.\n       With respect to coordinated media advertisements by \n     political parties (an area that has received much attention \n     of late), the proper characterization of a particular \n     expenditure depends not on the degree of coordination, but \n     rather on the content of the message. Indeed, just last year \n     the FEC and the Department of Justice took this position in a \n     brief filed before the Supreme Court, in a case decided on \n     other grounds. See generally, Brief for the Respondent, \n     Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, (S. \n     Ct. No. 95-489) at 2-3, 18 n.15, 23-24. In this connection, \n     the FEC has concluded that party media advertisements that \n     focus on ``national legislative activity'' and that do not \n     contain an ``electioneering message'' may be financed, in \n     part, using ``soft'' money, i.e., money that does not comply \n     with FECA's contribution limits. FEC Advisory Op. 1995-25, 2 \n     Fed. Elec. Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH) para. 6162, at 12,109-\n     12,110 (August 24, 1995); FEC Advisory Op. 1985-14, 2 Fed. \n     Elec. Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH) para. 5819, at 11,185-11,186 \n     (May 30, 1985). Moreover, such advertisements are not subject \n     to any applicable limitations on coordinated Expenditures by \n     the party on behalf of its candidates. AO 1985-14 at 11-185-\n     11,186.\n       We recognize that there are allegations that both \n     presidential candidates and both national political parties \n     engaged in a concerted effort to take full advantage of every \n     funding option available to them under the law, to craft \n     advertisements that took advantage of the lesser regulation \n     applicable to legislative issue advertising, and to raise \n     large quantities of soft political funding to finance these \n     ventures. However, at the present time, we lack specific and \n     credible evidence suggesting that these activities violated \n     the FECA. Moreover, even assuming that, after a thorough \n     investigation, the FEC were to conclude that regulatory \n     violations occurred, we presently lack specific and credible \n     evidence suggesting that any covered person participated in \n     any such violations.\n       3. Conflict of Interest--The Discretionary Provisions of \n     the Act:\n       In urging me to conclude that the investigation poses the \n     type of potential conflict of interest contemplated by the \n     Act, you rely heavily on my testimony before the Senate \n     Committee on Government Affairs in 1993 in support of \n     reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act. I stand by \n     those views and continue to support the overall concept \n     underlying the Act. My decisions pursuant to the Act have \n     been, I believe, fully consistent with those views.\n       The remarks you quote from my testimony should be \n     interpreted within the context of the statutory language I \n     was discussing. When, for example, I referred to the need for \n     the Act to deal with the inherent conflict of interest when \n     the Department of Justice investigates ``high-level Executive \n     Branch officials,'' I was referring to persons covered under \n     the mandatory provisions of the Act. With respect to the \n     conflict of interest provision, my testimony expressed the \n     conviction that the Act ``would in no way preempt this \n     Department's authority to investigate public corruption,'' \n     and that the Department was clearly capable of ``vigorous \n     investigation of wrongdoing by public officials, whatever \n     allegiance or stripes they may wear. I will vigorously defend \n     and continue this tradition.'' While I endorsed the concept \n     of the discretionary clause to deal with unforeseeable \n     situations, I strongly emphasized that ``it is part of the \n     Attorney General's job to make difficult decisions in tough \n     cases. I have no intention of abdicating that \n     responsibility[.]'' These principles continue to guide my \n     decisionmaking today.\n       There are times when reliance on the discretionary clause \n     is appropriate, and indeed, as you point out, I have done so \n     myself on a few occasions. However, in each of those cases, I \n     considered the particular factual context in which the \n     allegations against those persons arose and the history of \n     the matter. Moreover, even after finding the existence of a \n     potential conflict, I must consider whether under all the \n     circumstances discretionary appointment of an independent \n     counsel is appropriate. In each case, therefore, the final \n     decision has been an exercise of my discretion, as provided \n     for under the Act.\n       I have undertaken the same examination here. Based on the \n     facts as we know them now, I have not concluded that any \n     conflict of interest would ensure from our vigorous and \n     thorough investigation of the allegations contained in your \n     letter.\n       Your letter relies upon press reports, certain documents \n     and various public statements which you assert demonstrate \n     that ``officials at the highest level of the White House were \n     involved in formulating, coordinating and implementing the \n     [Democratic National Committee's (DNC's)] fundraising efforts \n     for the 1996 presidential campaign.'' You suggest that a \n     thorough investigation of ``fundraising improprieties'' will \n     therefore necessarily include an inquiry into the ``knowledge \n     and/or complicity of very senior White House officials,'' and \n     that the Department of Justice would therefore have a \n     conflict of interest investigating these allegations.\n       To the extent that ``improprieties'' comprise crimes, they \n     are being thoroughly investigated by the agents and \n     prosecutors assigned to the task force. Should that \n     investigation develop at any time specific and credible \n     evidence that any covered person may have committed a crime, \n     the Act will be triggered, and I will fulfill my \n     responsibilities under the Act. In addition, should that \n     investigation develop specific and credible evidence that a \n     crime may have been committed by a ``very senior'' White \n     House official who is not covered by the Act, I will decide \n     whether investigation of that person by the Department might \n     result in a conflict of interest, and, if so, whether the \n     discretionary clause should be invoked. Until then, however, \n     the mere fact that employees of the White House and the DNC \n     worked closely together in the course of President Clinton's \n     reelection campaign does not warrant appointment of an \n     independent counsel. As I have stated above, the Department \n     has a long history of investigating allegations of criminal \n     activity by high-ranking Government officials without fear or \n     favor, and will do so in this case.\n       I also do not accept the suggestion that there will be \n     widespread public distrust of the actions and conclusions of \n     the Department if it continues to investigate this matter, \n     creating a conflict of interest warranting the appointment of \n     an independent counsel. First, unless I find that the \n     investigation of a particular person against whom specific \n     and credible allegations have been made would pose a \n     conflict, I have no authority to utilize the procedures of \n     the Act. Moreover, I have confidence that the career \n     professionals in the Department will investigate this matter \n     in a fashion that will satisfy the American people that \n     justice has been done.\n       Finally, even were I to determine that a conflict of \n     interest of the sort contemplated by the statute exists in \n     this case--and as noted above I do not find such a conflict \n     at this time--there would be a number of weighty \n     considerations that I would have to consider in determining \n     whether to exercise my discretion to seek an independent \n     counsel at this time. Because invocation of the conflict of \n     interest provision is discretionary, it would still be my \n     responsibility in that circumstance to weigh all the factors \n     and determine whether appointment of an independent counsel \n     would best serve the national interest. If in the future this \n     investigation reveals evidence indicating that a conflict of \n     interest exists, these factors will continue to weigh heavily \n     in my evaluation of whether or not to invoke the \n     discretionary provisions of the Act.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I assure you, once again, that allegations of violations of \n     Federal criminal law with respect to campaign financing in \n     the course of the 1996 Federal elections will be thoroughly \n     investigated and, if appropriate, prosecuted. At this point \n     it appears to me that that task should be performed by the \n     Department of Justice and its career investigators and \n     prosecutors. I want to emphasize, however, that the task \n     force continues to receive new information (much has been \n     discovered even since I received your letter), and I will \n     continue to monitor the investigation closely in light of my \n     responsibilities under the Independent Counsel Act. Should \n     future developments make it appropriate to invoke the \n     procedures of the Act, I will do so without hesitation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Janet Reno.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 14, 1997]\n\n              Republicans Warn Reno on Independent Counsel\n\n                           (By John E. Wang)\n\n       House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said yesterday Attorney \n     General Janet Reno should be called before Congress to \n     testify under oath if she does not tell Congress today that \n     she will seek an independent counsel to investigate alleged \n     abuses in Democratic Party fund-raising.\n       Gingrich declared he has no confidence in Reno as attorney \n     general and, when asked if she should resign, said: ``We'll \n     know tomorrow,'' the deadline for Reno to respond to a \n     request from congressional Republicans that she call for an \n     independent counsel in the matter.\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\n       ``The evidence mounts every day of lawbreaking in this \n     administration,'' Gingrich said on ``Fox News Sunday.''\n       ``If she can look at the day-after-day revelations about \n     this administration and not conclude it's time for an \n     independent counsel, how can any serious citizen have any \n     sense of faith in her judgment?''\n       Late last week, the indications were that Reno would likely \n     not seek a counsel in the case, which is already being \n     investigated by career Justice Department prosecutors, but \n     aides emphasized no final decision had been made.\n       If she decides not to ask a three-judge panel to name an \n     independent counsel, Gingrich said, Reno needs to explain her \n     decision. ``She needs to answer in public, she needs to \n     answer, I think, under oath,'' he said.\n       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) \n     said Reno ``becomes a major issue'' if she does not call for \n     an independent counsel.\n       ``The conflict of interest, both apparent and real, it \n     seems to me, would necessitate her choosing an independent \n     counsel,'' he said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``If she doesn't, \n     then I think there's going to be a swirl of criticism that's \n     going to be, I think, very much justified.''\n       Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg dismissed \n     such talk. ``Unfortunately, this has become a battle between \n     law and politics,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``The \n     Justice Department will adhere to the law.''\n       Reno routinely asks the career prosecutors looking into the \n     matter whether any development requires the appointment of an \n     independent counsel, according to Brandenburg. So far, they \n     have not said that an independent counsel is indicated, he \n     said.\n       The law says the attorney general must ask for an \n     independent counsel if there is specific, credible \n     information of criminal wrongdoing by top administration \n     officials--including the president, vice president and \n     Cabinet officers--the head of a president's election or \n     reelection campaign or anyone else for whom it would be a \n     conflict of interest for the Justice Department to \n     investigate.\n       House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) \n     said an independent counsel was needed to maintain public \n     confidence in the investigation. ``In-house investigations, \n     as honorable as they might well be, don't sell the public on \n     the fact that they are independent,'' he said on ABC.\n       While Hyde said he retains his confidence in Reno as \n     attorney general, Gingrich was sharply critical of her for \n     not telling White House officials the FBI suspected China was \n     planning to make illegal campaign contributions. Reno has \n     said she telephoned national security adviser Anthony Lake, \n     failed to reach him and never called back.\n       ``If you're the top law enforcement officer of this country \n     . . . wouldn't you say to the White House, `Gee, the \n     president and the secretary of state ought to know we think \n     the Chinese communists may be trying to buy the American \n     election'?'' he said.\n       House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.) suggested \n     Reno is victim of the political pressures within the \n     administration.\n       ``This is a person that would like to be professional and \n     responsible in their job, and that makes her out of place in \n     this administration,'' Armey said on CBS's ``Face the \n     Nation.'' ``She is in a hopeless situation. . . . If I were \n     Janet Reno, I would just say, `I can't function with people \n     that stand with these standards of conduct and behavior and \n     I'm leaving.' ''\n       On another topic, Gingrich said the United States should \n     ``consider very seriously'' military action against ``certain \n     very high-value targets in Iran'' if there is strong evidence \n     linking a senior Iranian government official to a group of \n     Shiite Muslims suspected of bombing a U.S. military compound \n     in Saudi Arabia last year.\n       ``We have to take whatever steps are necessary to convince \n     Iran that state-sponsored terrorism is not acceptable,'' he \n     said. ``The indirect killing of Americans is still an act of \n     war.''\n       The Washington Post reported yesterday that intelligence \n     information indicates that Brig. Ahmad Sherifi, a senior \n     Iranian intelligence officer and a top official in Iran's \n     Revolutionary Guards, met roughly two years before the \n     bombing with a Saudi Shiite arrested March 18 in Canada. \n     According to Canadian court records, the man, Hani Abd Rahim \n     Sayegh, had fled Saudi Arabia shortly after the June 25 \n     bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen and wounded more than \n     500 others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, particularly as we are talking \nabout tax day, I think it is important, also, to talk about something \nthat, as Americans, we can celebrate together on this day.\n  Today marks the anniversary of an important day in American history. \nToday is the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's dismantling of the \ncolor barrier in major league baseball. It might even be said that his \nactions, in so doing, were the beginning of the dismantling of American \napartheid and the system of Jim Crow segregation that kept us apart in \nthis country. I know for a fact that I would not be here in the U.S. \nSenate today had it not been for the achievement of Jackie Robinson. I \ndaresay that the victory of Tiger Woods in the Masters, which every \nAmerican celebrated, I think, would not have happened had it not been \nfor Jackie Robinson's achievement.\n  It was 50 years ago that Jackie Robinson became a member of the \nBrooklyn Dodgers, making history by opening doors that had previously \nbeen closed to African American athletes. The year 1997 also marks the \nyear that major league baseball owners agreed to give pensions to \nseveral baseball players who played in the then-segregated Negro \nLeagues. Many of those players followed in the path that was blazed by \nJackie Robinson, but they were ineligible for major league pensions. \nThe fact that the owners fixed that this year again is reason for us to \ncelebrate.\n  Mr. President, there are few Americans today who do not know of \nJackie Robinson, the baseball great whose talent and pursuit of \nexcellence enabled him to break the color barrier 50 years ago. Jackie \nRobinson began his baseball career in 1945 as a Negro League player \nafter serving his country in World War II. The following year he joined \nthe minor league operation of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and was named the \nMinor League Most Valuable Player. In 1947, he was brought up to play \nin the major leagues, and was named 1947's Rookie of the Year. Two \nyears later, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player. In 1962, \nJackie Robinson became the first African-American named to Baseball's \nHall of Fame.\n  Jackie Robinson's legacy, however, is not restricted to that of a \nsports legend, or even a civil rights pioneer. Today I want to talk \nabout some of his many achievements off the baseball field. While \nplaying professional baseball, Jackie Robinson served as an inspiration \nto many people of the heights they could achieve. Upon his retirement, \nhe was determined to make a real difference in the quality of the lives \nof others. As founder of the Jackie Robinson Development Corp. and the \nFreedom National Bank, he was able to provide access to capital and \naffordable housing to low income families in the underserved community \nof Harlem.\n  Even today, his good works continue through his widow, Rachel \nRobinson, who started the Jackie Robinson Foundation 1 year after his \ndeath. The Foundation provides full 4-year college scholarships for \nminority and disadvantaged young people. The recipients are chosen \nbased on academic strength, community service, leadership potential and \nfinancial need. There have been over 400 Jackie Robinson scholars from \nacross the country with a 92 percent graduation rate.\n  In order to celebrate these achievements, Senator D'Amato and I led \nthe effort to mint a commemorative coin in honor of Jackie Robinson. I \nam delighted that this legislation passed and that the Jackie Robinson \nFoundation will benefit from profits earned by the coin. Minting will \nbegin later this year.\n  Jackie Robinson's extraordinary successes were the result of \nphenomenal talent and determination. While much of the world knows of \nJackie Robinson's success, we must not forget the African-American \nbaseball players who played in the Majors and helped integrate the \ngame, yet did not receive the recognition for their contribution to the \ngame, nor, for that matter, receive a pension for their time in the \nMajors.\n  Last year, I became aware of the plight of Sam Jethroe, a former \nmajor league ball player whose career in baseball began in the Negro \nLeague. Sam Jethroe, born in East St. Louis, IL, on January 20, 1922, \nbegan playing for the Cleveland Buckeyes, a Negro League team, at the \nage of 20. He played for the Buckeyes for seven seasons, and was one of \nthe recognized stars of the Negro League.\n\n  A switch-hitting outfielder who threw right-handed, Jethroe was \nchristened ``Jet'' for running so fast; opposing teams actually worked \nat strategies to slow him down. Sam Jethroe was also a good hitter; he \nbatted .300 during his time with the Buckeyes and he led the Negro \nLeague in hitting in 1942, 1944, and 1945.\n  Although African-Americans had previously been banned from the major\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nleagues, Mr. Jethroe was given a try-out with the Boston Red Sox in \n1945. He wasn't signed onto a major league team, however, until 1949, 2 \nyears after Jackie Robinson's historic appearance in the league. At \nthat time, Mr. Jethroe became the first African-American baseball \nplayer on the Boston--now Atlanta--Braves and debuted on their team in \n1950. He was their starting center fielder.\n  In 1950, Sam Jethroe won the base-stealing crown, with 35, scored 100 \nruns, and batted .273, with 18 homers and 58 RBI's. As a result he was \nnamed National League Rookie of the Year in 1950, the third African-\nAmerican to capture the honor in 4 years, following Jackie Robinson and \npitcher Don Newcombe. In 1951, Sam Jethroe was even better. He repeated \nhis stolen base title win and batted .280, with 101 runs scored, 29 \ndoubles, 10 triples, 18 homers, and 65 RBI's.\n  After spending 1953 in the minors, Mr. Jethroe completed a successful \ncareer in baseball by playing two games with the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n  At the time that Sam Jethroe played baseball, a player needed 4 years \nof service in the major leagues in order to qualify for a pension. As \nyou may know, players active since 1980 need only 1 year in the majors \nto qualify. Because Sam Jethroe fell short of the 4-year requirement, \nhe has never received a pension. I believe that Mr. Jethroe would have \nqualified for a pension; that is, he would have played more than 4 \nyears in major league baseball had it not been for the fact that he was \nbanned from baseball because of the color of his skin.\n  The misfortune of the ban was compounded by the change of vesting \nrules for pension eligibility. Sam Jethroe is now 74 years old, and \ndoes not enjoy a secure retirement.\n  Pension security goes to the heart of our challenge to treat the end \nof life as the golden years rather than the disposable years. \nRetirement security has been likened to a three legged stool. Social \nsecurity, private pensions, and personal savings constitute the basis \nof an income stream for the later years of life. While Sam Jethroe was \neligible for social security benefits, he had limited savings, and did \nnot receive a pension for his years in major league baseball.\n  Sam Jethroe's compelling story prompted me to contact Jerry Reinsdorf \nof the Chicago White Sox to see if anything could be done to help Sam \nJethroe and Negro League veterans suffering from similar circumstances.\n  Mr. Reinsdorf took the initiative and raised the issue of pension \nprotection with other owners for those people who were excluded from \nmajor league baseball prior to the breaking down of the barriers by \nJackie Robinson.\n  In 1997, the owners decided to provide pensions to the African-\nAmericans who played solely in the Negro leagues before 1948, as well \nas those who played both in the Negro leagues and in the major leagues. \nI would like to commend Jerry Reinsdorf for his help in this matter. \nSam Jethroe and the other Negro League players would not have received \nthis long-awaited relief had it not been for him.\n  I also want to commend the owners for the tremendous good will and \npropriety of their decision. They recognized an injustice and fixed it. \nIt is fitting that major league baseball recognize the contributions of \nthese fine athletes in the year that we recognize and celebrate the \n50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's historic breakthrough in major \nleague baseball.\n  So, Mr. President, in summary, I would like to say that there is good \nnews today, the 15th of April. Not only did Jackie Robinson 50 years \nago help open up doors in America, but he helped to change hearts. \nFifty years ago, after the owners of major league baseball debated \nwhether or not to let people of color play America's game, they made a \ndecision that America's game would take care of one of its own. It \nseems to me to be an essential American story, that in 50 years' time \nwe have seen enough change in this country, given rise by the \nsacrifice, the commitment, and the excellence pursued by Jackie \nRobinson and those like him who opened up doors. Now, 50 years later, \nthose doors have been opened, and the hearts of many Americans have, \nindeed, been changed.\n  I think that is good news for today that we can all celebrate.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Moseley-Braun pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 586 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne).

Reserving the right to object, I would like to ask the \nmajority leader if I could have unanimous consent for 10 minutes to \nintroduce a bill and speak after the vote on the Coverdell legislation?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have a number of Senators that may be \nrequesting time to speak after this. I think we can accommodate the \nSenator, but I would like to get a minute where maybe we can get all \nthose wrapped up and we will get an agreement during the debate. So the \nSenator will get the 10 minutes shortly after the vote, if he would \ndefer for now, and I will see what we have to do.

Reserving the right to object, I thank my colleagues, \nespecially Senator Coverdell, for working with us to try to resolve \nthis matter. The language that we now have incorporated, or will have \nincorporated, in the resolution is certainly acceptable. I hope we can \nhave a good debate and pass this legislation this afternoon. It is \nimportant we do it today, but it is also important this legislation, \ninvolving flood victims, be passed today. This will accommodate our \nneed in that regard.\n  I thank Senator Coverdell and the majority leader for their \ncooperation. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will send an amendment to the desk. I do \nwant to note, while this is going to the desk, we did work to \naccommodate the Senator and other Senators from the area where there \nhave been floods. We have made a change in the time flood insurance is \nrequired to be covered by--we limited the times involved, so we could \nhave time to assess, maybe, the impact and whether or not to put it on \na permanent basis.

Mr. President, as I understand the situation at the \nmoment, we now have until 4:05, when the unanimous consent called for \nthe vote. Time would be equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Is that about 20 minutes on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 17\\1/2\\ minutes for each side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, let me thank all the Senators \nwho have played a significant role in this legislation that we are \nabout to vote on, certainly Senators Glenn of Ohio and Roth of Delaware \nand others, who have committed themselves to ending the practice on the \npart of the IRS of snooping through the personal tax files of American \ncitizens.\n  Recently, the GAO issued its report on IRS system security, on April \n8, which was initiated at the request of Senator Glenn. The General \nAccounting Office concluded that the IRS has failed to effectively deal \nwith file snooping. It says:\n\n       Further, although the IRS has taken some action to detect \n     browsing--\n\n  That word means looking at the personal tax files of American \ntaxpayers.\n\n     it is still not effectively addressing this area of \n     continuing concern because (1) it does not know the full \n     extent of browsing and (2) it is consistently addressing \n     cases of browsing.\n\n  The GAO found that the IRS still does not know the full extent of \nfile snooping, it says:\n\n       Because the IRS does not monitor the activities of all \n     employees authorized to access taxpayer data . . ., IRS has \n     no assurance that employees are not--[snooping, they use the \n     word browsing] taxpayer data, and no analytical basis on \n     which to estimate the extent of the browsing problem or any \n     damage being done.\n\n  The Internal Revenue Service stated a zero tolerance policy, with \nregard to file snooping. In 1993, Commissioner Margaret Richardson \nstated:\n\n       Any access of taxpayer information with no legitimate \n     business reason to do so is unauthorized and improper and \n     will not be tolerated.\n\n  She said:\n\n       We will discipline those who abuse taxpayer trust up to and \n     including removal or prosecution.\n\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\n\n  Recent reports have documented up to 800, last year alone, files were \nviolated, hundreds of employees have been involved--and there have been \n23 suspensions. This statement that was made to the American people has \nnot been fulfilled. That is why this legislation is here today.\n  Since the IRS Commissioner made this statement, the IRS has found \n1,515 additional confirmed cases of file snooping. But, as I said, only \n23 resulted in job termination and only 23 percent resulted in any \ndisciplinary action at all. Since 1991, there have been 3,345 confirmed \ncases of file snooping by IRS employees.\n  This is reprehensible activity. These are very, very personal records \nand are expected to be maintained in just that way. I think the irony \nof this is that whenever you get at odds with IRS, you get audited. \nSome would say audited is a kind word. Some people feel they have been \nbludgeoned. But the IRS has been engaged in activity that is \nreprehensible and it is time for them to be audited.\n  This measure, coauthored by myself, Senator Glenn, Senator Roth and \nothers, is the beginning of an audit of IRS. It is symbolic that we \npass this legislation today but it is important to note that the IRS \nAccountability Act comes right behind this, the IRS Accountability Act, \nwhich will deal not only with file snooping, but with random audits, \nbalancing the ledger between the taxpayer and this agency, and putting \nIRS agents under the same laws as the rest of American citizens.\n  Recently, the Wall Street Journal, on April 3, 1997, printed an \narticle about IRS activities. I will quote it here. According to a \nFederal jury here, this gentleman:\n\n       . . . took unauthorized looks at returns of a political \n     opponent, [this is an IRS employee] a family adversary, and \n     two associates in the white-supremacist movement whom, the \n     government says, he suspected of being informers. The jury \n     convicted [this gentleman] in December 1995 on 13 counts of \n     wire and computer fraud, and he spent 6 months of 1996 in \n     jail.\n\n  Some IRS browsers apparently are merely nosy. Geoffrey Coughlin, a \nHouston account analyst, last year pleaded guilty to looking at more \nthan 150 unauthorized files, including those of friends and relatives, \nex-girlfriends, politicians, and sports stars.\n  This is another case. Robert M. Patterson, an IRS examiner in \nMemphis, TN, scanned agency computers for tax records of people named \nDolly Parton, Wynonna Judd, Karen Carpenter, Garth Brooks, Elizabeth \nTaylor--well, it is pretty clear, to understand the drift here.\n  This legislation, Coverdell-Glenn-Roth, makes it a Federal \nmisdemeanor, $1,000 fine, a year imprisonment under the Federal \nsentencing guidelines. A convicted offender would pay costs of \nprosecution and be dismissed from position where applicable. It covers \nFederal employees and officers, and State and other employees who have \naccess to tax records.\n  Taxpayers whose files have been accessed and are disclosed without \nproper authorization can seek civil action; such civil action against \nthe United States, when the offender is a Federal employee, and against \nthe individual offender when not a Federal employee. It requires \ntaxpayer notification if we certify that their files have been \nimproperly accessed or disclosed and they would be notified when the \noffender is charged formally.\n  There are several Senators who want to speak on this measure. I \nnotice the Senator from Ohio has arrived, the coauthor of the proposal.\n  I am going to yield to the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nRoth, who has done outstanding work on this proposal.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 5 minutes to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, students of history may remember Henry \nStimson. He served America as Secretary of War and Secretary of State \nin the first half of the 20th century. While in office, Stimson tried \nto close down American counterintelligence sources. His reason, you may \nrecall, was that ``gentlemen do not read each other's mail.''\n  Today, Mr. President, Henry Stimson would not only be concerned about \ncounterintelligence operations but about the Internal Revenue Service \nas well. Recent reports disclose that among the abuses and misuses of \npower and access at the IRS is the ability of IRS employees to snoop in \nthe files of unwitting taxpayers.\n  While it's not the mail that these snoops are reading, it is \nsomething just as sensitive. I don't know of anyone who wants his or \nher detailed financial information perused without reason. The millions \nof Americans who comply with the law and file tax returns each year, \nshould be able to do so without fear or hesitation that someone--for \npurposes of curiosity, revenge, or even a more avaricious motive--is \nsnooping through their private information.\n  If Government has one responsibility to these men and women it \ncertainly must be to ensure their privacy. Current law does prohibit \nthe disclosure of confidential taxpayer information. However, the \nInternal Revenue Code does not specifically prohibit IRS employees from \nunauthorized inspection or snooping of confidential taxpayer \ninformation.\n  I can think of no better day to call for change that today, April 15, \nwhen once again those millions of trusting Americans are rushing their \nreturns off to the IRS.\n  You may remember, Mr. President, that last year, Congress amended \ntitle 18 of the United States Code to make it a crime to use a computer \nto snoop information of any Federal department or agency, including the \nIRS. However, last year's legislation did not apply to unauthorized \ninspection of paper documents.\n  The bill we introduce today will correct that. It will require that \ntax return information be kept confidential by the IRS and it's \nemployees. It will ensure that IRS employees do not snoop confidential \ntaxpayer information.\n  This bill will create a criminal penalty in the Internal Revenue Code \nof up to 1 year in prison and/or a fine of up to $1,000, plus the cost \nof prosecution for unauthorized willful browsing of confidential \ntaxpayer information. The bill will also require the abusing employee \nto be fired.\n  The bill will allow civil damages for snooping, and, if an IRS \nemployee is indicted for unlawful inspection or disclosure of a \ntaxpayer's confidential information, the bill will require that the IRS \nnotify the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, this bill will provide additional protections and some \npeace of mind for taxpayers. I want to thank Senator Coverdell and \nSenator Glenn for their efforts to protect taxpayers by making it a \ncrime for IRS employees to snoop taxpayer data.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee on Finance. Unauthorized browsing of \nconfidential tax information undermines the confidence of taxpayers, \nand such behavior ought to be subject to criminal penalties--which it \nwill be under this bill.\n  This legislation is a product of the bipartisan efforts of the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and the Senator \nfrom New York, among others. I join my chairman in urging its prompt \nenactment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. We each have 17 minutes, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield myself such time as I shall use.\n  Mr. President, today is April 15. We do not need to tell everybody \nthat. It is tax day for most Americans. On this day, honest hard-\nworking citizens voluntarily--voluntarily--share their most personal \nand sensitive financial information with their Government.\n  All Americans should have unbridled faith that their tax returns will \nremain absolutely, unequivocally confidential and zealously \nsafeguarded. That is the hallmark of our taxpaying system, and if this \ntrust is breached, it shakes the whole foundation of our very \nGovernment, because it means our people are losing faith in their \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\n  That is why I am proud to be standing here today as one of the \nauthors, one of the sponsors, the Democratic sponsor of legislation to \noutlaw what I have come to term as ``computer voyeurism.'' That is the \nunauthorized inspection of your tax information by those not entitled \nto see it, not the people legitimately working on your tax account.\n  In 1993 and 1994, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nI held hearings which first exposed this insidious practice. We came \nacross it almost by happenstance.\n  In 1990, I was pleased to work with my distinguished colleague who \njust spoke, Senator Roth, then ranking member of the committee, to pass \ninto law the Chief Financial Officers Act. That measure required major \nGovernment agencies to do something for the first time which our own \nprivate businesses take for granted. That is, producing annual \nauditable financial statements so we know how much money is being \nspent, where it is being spent, and how it is being spent.\n  I figured that of all the Government agencies which should be able to \nbalance its books and come up with a good auditable statement, it would \nbe the IRS; it should be able to account for all the revenue taken in, \nand the IRS would be the agency we would look at first. In fact, before \nthe CFO Act, we had no idea of the differences between what revenues \nthe IRS reported it was collecting and what was actually on the books. \nLittle did I know then how wrong I really was.\n  For 4 years running now, the IRS has not been able to pass its own \naudit. The General Accounting Office, which we asked to go in and help \naudit the IRS, still cannot even render an opinion on the reliability \nof the IRS's own books due, in part, to missing records, \nunsubstantiated amounts, and unreliable information. If we have that \nsituation in the IRS, you can imagine what the situation is in some of \nthe other agencies of Government.\n  The IRS, I guess if we put it in our own household terms, it would be \nrecords in a shoe box under the bed. If your return was being audited \nand you could not come up with the documents, you would be called on \nthe carpet for that. You would not get too much sympathy. But all that \nis another story, one of which the Governmental Affairs Committee has \nheld numerous oversight hearings on.\n  But it was through these initial GAO CFO audits we first discovered \nthe problems IRS was having in preventing and detecting employees who \nget their kicks, apparently, out of surfing through other people's tax \nreturns, ones they are not supposed to be working on or looking at.\n  Our hearings revealed that in the years 1989 to 1994, more than 1,300 \nIRS employees were investigated on suspicion of snooping through \nprivate taxpayer files. Those probes resulted in disciplinary action \nagainst 420 workers, primarily in the Southeast region where the \ninvestigation was concentrated.\n  My investigation found that some IRS employees had been browsing \nthrough the financial records of family members, ex-spouses, coworkers, \nneighbors, friends and enemies, and celebrities in particular.\n  They also had submitted fraudulent tax returns and then used their \ncomputer access to monitor the IRS review of those returns.\n  They used the computer to issue fraudulent refunds to family and to \nfriends and, in fact, one employee was reported to have altered about \n200 accounts and received kickbacks from inflated refund checks.\n  We, in Congress, at that time were absolutely stunned at these \nrevelations and did not believe it could happen, but it did. But it did \nnot light a candle to the firestorm across the country from outraged--\nappropriately outraged--American taxpayers because we got a wave of \nindignation. Taxpayers were shocked to know that the most personal \ninformation they voluntarily, and in good faith, provide to the \nGovernment could, in effect, become an open book for others' private \nentertainment.\n  Even worse was the pitifully low number of employees fired for \ncommitting these awful actions. It turned out that no criminal \npenalties existed for these kinds of browsing offenses.\n\n  Mr. President, above the entrance to the main IRS building in DC are \ninscribed the famous words uttered by Oliver Wendell Holmes:\n\n       Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.\n\n  Unfortunately, what American citizens have been subjected to in this \ncase is downright uncivilized behavior.\n  At our hearings, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue pledged to \nimplement a ``zero tolerance'' policy. Warnings of possible prosecution \nfor unauthorized use of the system began appearing whenever workers \nlogged on to the main taxpayer account database. Explicit memos went \nout to all employees warning them against such unauthorized activities.\n  Finally, a new automated detection program, called EARL--electronic \naudit research log--was installed on the primary computer system to \nmonitor employee use and alert managers to possible misuse.\n  To evaluate the effectiveness of these actions, particularly the new \ncomputer detection system, I asked GAO to conduct a review. I also \nasked the inspector general at the Department of Treasury to perform an \ninspection.\n  In the meantime, we worked with the Treasury Department, the \nDepartment of Justice and the IRS to come up with a legislative \nsolution for closing the legal loophole that let browsers off the hook \nfrom criminal punishment.\n  That effort culminated in the legislation, the Taxpayer Browsing \nProtection Act, which I introduced in 1995 during the 104th Congress \nand as S. 523 for the 105th Congress.\n  The goal was simple: to make willful browsers subject to a criminal \nmisdemeanor penalty of up to $1,000 and a year in jail, and if any IRS \nemployees are convicted of such an offense, they would be fired \nimmediately. Zero tolerance should mean what it says--absolutely, \npositively no tolerance.\n  That legislation was incorporated into this amendment and was the \nbasis for the bill as is currently being considered in the House.\n  We were not able to pass my bill in the last Congress--we did come \nclose to trying to move it in the Senate--the issue has gotten more \nexposure now due to two recent court cases.\n  Just last year, in Tennessee, a jury acquitted a former IRS employee \nwho had been charged with 70 counts of improperly peeking at the tax \nreturns of celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Dolly Parton, Wynonna \nJudd, Michael Jordan, Lucille Ball, Tom Cruise, President Clinton, and \nElvis Presley, just to name some of them.\n  More recently, just a few weeks ago, a Federal appeals court in \nBoston reversed the conviction of a former employee who had been found \nguilty of several counts of wire and computer fraud by improperly \naccessing the IRS taxpayer database. It is reported that he had browsed \nthrough several files, including those of a local politician who had \nbeaten him in an election, and a woman he once had dated. The \nGovernment had alleged that this worker was a member of a white \nsupremacist group and was collecting data on people he thought could be \nGovernment informers.\n  In both of these cases, though there was unauthorized snooping, \nbecause there was no subsequent disclosure to third parties, no \ncriminal penalties could be meted out. As the First U.S. Circuit Court \nof Appeals held:\n\n       Unauthorized browsing of taxpayer files, although certainly \n     inappropriate conduct, cannot, without more, sustain a felony \n     conviction.\n\n  Sounds ridiculous, but that is what the court ruled. That was their \ninterpretation of the fine print of the law. I doubt these kinds of \ndecisions give great comfort to honest law-abiding citizens.\n  I should note that last year, Congress passed the Economic Espionage \nAct of 1996. My good friend, Senator Leahy, played a major part in this \neffort. This law does provide title 18 criminal penalties for anyone \nintentionally accessing a computer without authorization, or exceeding \nauthorized access, and obtaining any information from any Department or \nagency of the United States. This section may be helpful in prosecuting \nfuture cases, since it would apply to tax information stored in \ncomputers.\n  This provision is not enough in our efforts to deter and punish \nbrowsing, for, according to the IRS, it does not apply to the \nunauthorized access or inspection of paper tax returns, return\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\ninformation in other forms, such as documents or magnetic media, such \nas tapes.\n  That is why we, all taxpayers, need the protections originally \nespoused in the bill and incorporated in this amendment to specifically \nfill this gap and ensure unauthorized browsing or inspection of any tax \ninformation in any form is subject to criminal penalties, and that is \nwhat this does. It will also provide those criminal sanctions within \nthe Internal Revenue Code so that the confidentiality scheme governing \ntax information and the related law enforcement mechanisms are \npreserved in the same section.\n  While I do feel the recent court decisions have spurred us on, I also \nbelieve the new findings contained in a GAO report I released last \nweekend entitled ``IRS Security Systems: Tax Processing Operations and \nData Still at Risk Due to Serious Weaknesses,'' have brought this \nproblem to the forefront.\n  This report is the evaluation I asked GAO to undertake in 1994 in \nresponse to the actions implemented by the IRS to prevent browsing and \nenforce its zero tolerance policy. It was released by GAO earlier this \nyear; however, because some of the specific details could potentially \njeopardize IRS security, the report was designated for ``Limited \nOfficial Use'' with restricted access.\n\n  I have been involved in this important issue for a long time and \nbecause I believe the public has a right to know, I requested that GAO \nissue a redacted version of the report suitable for public release. I \nthank GAO for their hard work in this matter and also the IRS for their \ncooperation in making this possible.\n  The findings of GAO's report are disturbing. Even more important, \ntheir conclusions are reaffirmed by the IRS in a comprehensive internal \nreport of their own compiled last fall.\n  In addition, I should add, they are buttressed to some extent by a \nreview I asked the Treasury Inspector General to conduct on IRS \ncomputer security controls and the Service's progress in addressing the \nshortcomings. That report, too, is ``Limited Official Use.'' But I can \ntell you, while there have been some positive actions taken to \nproactively confront this problem, we are nowhere near any satisfactory \nresolution.\n  The bottom line is although the IRS efforts in this area are well-\nintentioned, unfortunately they have come too late and fall far short \nof the commitment and determination sorely needed to tackle this \nproblem head on.\n  The findings of GAO's report are disturbing. Just as important, their \nconclusions are affirmed by the IRS in a comprehensive internal report \nof their own compiled last fall.\n  GAO found that serious weaknesses in IRS's information security makes \ntaxpayer data vulnerable to authorized use, to modification, or to \ndestruction. According to GAO, the IRS also has no effective means for \nmeasuring the extent of the browsing problem, the damage being done by \nbrowsing, or the progress being made to deter browsing.\n  Finally, and this is something I am having GAO look at further, we do \nnot know to what extent the detection and control systems exist in \nother IRS databases, besides ``IDRS,'' the primary taxpayers' account \nsystem looked at here. That may be open for further problems.\n  I was struck by the candor in the IRS's own internal report on the \n``EARL'' detection system. That report found its progress in management \nprograms to prevent and detect browsing ``painfully slow,'' as they \ndetermined. Quite distressing to me, the IRS internal report indicated \nthat some employees felt IRS management does not aggressively pursue \nbrowsing violations. Some workers, when confronted about their snooping \nactivities, saw nothing wrong and believed it would be of no \nconsequence to them even if they were caught. Hard to believe.\n  Mr. President, we have to fix that. When you have over 1,500 \ninvestigations of browsing cases since my last hearings 2 years ago, \nand only 23 workers fired, something just is not right. That does not \nsound like zero tolerance to me.\n  I have a more detailed summary of the major findings contained in \nboth the GAO and internal IRS report which I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. I also point out the effectiveness of controls used to \nsafeguard IRS systems, facilities, and taxpayer data. GAO found serious \nweaknesses in these efforts, especially in the areas of physical and \nlogical security.\n  For example, the facilities visited by GAO could not account for over \n6,400 units of magnetic storage media such as tapes and cartridges \nwhich might contain taxpayer data. Now, IRS responded last week they \nhave located 5,700 of the units, but that means that 700 are still \nunaccounted for. That begs the question: Where are they? Are they \ndeemed lost? And can they be misused? Each of the units can store tax \ninformation on thousands of Americans. We need to know where they are. \nMoreover, GAO only visited selected facilities. I just wonder if the \nIRS is able to track all of its inventory at the other major sites not \nvisited by GAO. We would like to know what the results are there, too.\n  GAO also found that printouts containing taxpayer data were left \nunprotected and unattended in open areas of two facilities, where they \ncould be compromised. I do not want to say much more on this portion of \nthe report than I have already said, except that these matters and the \nothers referred to by GAO must be dealt with swiftly and effectively.\n  I am glad to have brought this matter to the Senate's attention and \nam pleased to have the support of colleagues. I commend the efforts of \nSenator Coverdell in this area. He has added very significant \nprovisions to some of the original language. I think we have an \nexcellent bill. I want to congratulate him for taking the initiative in \nbringing this up.\n  The first of the sections that Senator Coverdell brought would \nrequire that a taxpayer be notified by the Secretary of the Treasury \nwhen a criminal indictment or charge is brought against an IRS employee \nfor unlawful inspection of that taxpayer's return or return \ninformation. This is something I remember Senator Pryor, our former \ncolleague, bringing up before the Commissioner at one of our earlier \nhearings.\n\n  The second new section will provide taxpayers with a civil remedy in \nsuch unauthorized inspections as similarly provided under current law \nfor unlawful disclosures. This provision clarifies that civil liability \nwill not be a remedy in cases where the inspection is requested by the \ntaxpayer or in any instance which results from an accidental review of \na return or return information.\n  I want to be clear about that last point in reference to the \nlegislation at hand. I do not want to compromise IRS employees' ability \nto do what they are supposed to be doing, especially in the areas of \nreturn processing, examination, and inspection. Under this bill, IRS \nemployees will continue to be able to inspect tax returns or return \ninformation as authorized by the Internal Revenue Code or tax \nadministration purposes without penalties. Only intentional, willful, \nunauthorized inspections will be subject to prosecution, where you knew \nor should have known it was wrong.\n  As the report by the House Ways and Means Committee states: \n``Accidental or inadvertent inspection that may occur--such as, for \nexample, by making an error in typing in a TIN [Taxpayer Identification \nNumber]--would not be subject to damages because it would not meet this \nstandard.''\n  These are good provisions and I welcome their inclusion. I also want \nto thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Roth, who sat with us as \nranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee during our \nhearings last year during consideration of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights \n2, pledged his commitment and support for bringing this legislation to \nthe floor.\n  Let me say a word about the men and women who work at the IRS. The \nvast majority of the people who work at the IRS are just as fine a \npeople as there are in this room or anywhere else in this country. They \nare dedicated. They are trying to do a good job. I do not want to \nunduly scare anyone that this is commonplace or that their privacy has \nbeen violated. You have a few bad apples over there, but I am sure most \nof the people over there want to turn in themselves because most of the \npeople\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\nof the IRS, including the Commissioner, are proud of the work they are \ndoing.\n  The Commissioner has done a good job in many areas. I have been \ncomplimentary of her. Her plan to deal with the IRS is a good one. The \nway of getting it downhill to the centers and the different regions and \nhaving it done there did not occur the way it should have, with what I \nthought was a very good plan. I do not want to condemn all the IRS over \nthere. Normally, the people look down on the tax man every April 15. We \nknow that. It is not popular to pay taxes. The people working there are \ndoing a great service for this country, and we want to weed out those \nfew bad apples that may be over there.\n  I have visited some of the sites and I know what some of the IRS \nemployees are up against. It is not an easy job. They are, by and \nlarge, a dedicated bunch, committed to their job and laboring under \ndifficult conditions with very outmoded systems. Unfortunately, in this \nday and age, they must also fear for their own personal safety. \nHowever, even just a single incidence of this behavior is one too many \nand cannot be tolerated.\n  The IRS has a moral and legal obligation to uphold when Americans \nprovide the Government with their most personal and private \ninformation. The IRS must have the complete trust and confidence of \ntaxpayers. That means we cannot tolerate any of this browsing or \nmishandling of accounts. The American people expect and demand nothing \nless.\n  I thank you, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n  Major Findings From GAO Report, Supplemented With Excerpts From the \n             IRS' Earl Executive Steering Committee Report\n\n\n      the irs system designed to detect browsing (earl) is limited\n\n       The main monitoring system, EARL, is supposed to be able to \n     detect patterns of potential abuse by IRS employees in the \n     IRS' primary database (IDRS). GAO found that the EARL system \n     is ineffective because it can't distinguish between \n     legitimate work activity and illegal browsing. Only through \n     time-consuming manual reviews, which, according to internal \n     IRS documents can sometimes take up to 40 hours, can actual \n     instances, of snooping be positively identified.\n       Moreover, EARL only monitors the main taxpayer database. \n     There are several other systems used by employees to create, \n     access, or modify data which, apparently, go unsupervised. \n     This is something I have asked the GAO to look into further.\n       According to GAO, ``because IRS does not monitor the \n     activities of all employees authorized to access taxpayer \n     data . . . IRS has no assurance that these employees are not \n     browsing taxpayer data and no analytical basis on which to \n     estimate the extent of the browsing problem or any damage \n     being done.''\n       In fact, according, to the IRS' EARL report:\n       ``The current system of reports does not provide accurate \n     and meaningful data about what the abuse detection programs \n     are producing, the quality of the outputs, the efficiency of \n     our abuse detection research efforts, or the level of \n     functional management follow through and discipline. This \n     impedes our ability to respond to critics and congressional \n     oversight inquiries about our abuse detection efforts.''\n\n\n  irs progress in reducing and disciplining browsing cases is unclear\n\n       IRS' management information systems do not provide \n     sufficient information to describe known browsing incidents \n     precisely or to evaluate their severity consistently.\n       The systems used by the IRS cannot report on the total \n     number of unauthorized browsing incidents. Nor do they \n     contain sufficient information to determine, for each case \n     investigated, how many taxpayer accounts were inappropriately \n     accessed or how many times each account was accessed.\n       Consequently, for known incidents of browsing, IRS cannot \n     efficiently determine how many and how often taxpayers' \n     accounts were inappropriately accessed. Without such \n     information, IRS cannot measure whether it is making progress \n     from year to year in reducing browsing.\n       Internal IRS figures show a fluctuation in the number of \n     browsing cases closed in the last few years: 521 cases in \n     FY'91; 787 in FY'92; 522 in FY'93; 646 in FY'94, and; 869 in \n     FY'95.\n       More distressing, however, is the fact that in spite of the \n     Commissioner's announced ``Zero Tolerance'' policy, the \n     percentages of cases resulting in discipline has remained \n     constant from year to year. Figures for FY'91-FY'95 show that \n     the percentage of browsing cases resulting in the IRS' three \n     most severe categories of penalties (disciplinary action, \n     separation, resignation/retirement) has ranged between 23-32 \n     percent, with an average of 29 percent.\n       The IRS' internal report also confirms this: ``A review of \n     disciplinary actions for IDRS abuse over the last four years \n     showed that only 25% of the cases result in some \n     discipline.''\n       That report also indicated that almost one-third of the \n     cases detected were situations where an employee accessed \n     their own account, which, according to the report, is \n     ``generally attributable to trainee error.''\n\n\n     Incidents of Browsing are Reviewed and Referred Inconsistently\n\n       IRS processing facilities do not consistently review and \n     refer potential browsing cases. They had different policies \n     and procedures for identifying potential violations and \n     referring them to the appropriate unit within IRS for \n     investigation and action. Further, IRS management had not \n     developed procedures to assure that potential browsing cases \n     were consistently reviewed and referred to management \n     officials throughout the agency.\n       The IRS internal report identifies this as a problem area, \n     too:\n       ``Although the EARL system has been under development since \n     1993, the service has not yet maximized its ability to \n     identify IDRS browsing. The process is labor intensive and \n     there is little accountability for effectively using EARL and \n     handling the cases it identifies. There is little consistency \n     in the detection procedures from one center to the next or in \n     how discipline is applied on abuse cases throughout the \n     nation.''\n\n\n           Penalties for Browsing are Inconsistent Across IRS\n\n       Despite IRS policy to ensure that browsing penalties are \n     handled consistently across the agency, it appears that there \n     are disparities in how similar cases are decided among \n     different offices, or even sometimes within the same office. \n     Examples of inconsistent discipline included:\n       Temporary employees who attempted to access their own \n     accounts were given letters of reprimand, although \n     historically, IRS terminated temporary employees for this \n     type of infraction.\n       One employee who attempted to access his own account was \n     given a written warning, while other employees in similar \n     situations, from the same division, were not counseled at \n     all.\n       The IRS' EARL internal report also demonstrated widespread \n     deviations on how browsing penalties were imposed. That \n     report showed that for FY'95, for example, the percentage of \n     browsing cases resulting in employee counseling ranged from a \n     low of 0 percent at one facility to 77 percent at another. \n     Similarly, the report showed that the percentage of cases \n     resulting in removal ranged from 0 percent at one facility to \n     7 percent at another. For punishments other than counseling \n     or removal (e.g., suspension), the range was between 10 \n     percent and 86 percent.\n       More incredible to me--and quite distressing--is the \n     extremely low percentage of employees caught browsing each \n     year who are fired for their offense, according to the IRS' \n     own figures. Would you believe that, for all of the browsing \n     cases detected and closed each year, the highest number of \n     employees fired in one year has been 12. Between FY'91-FY'95, \n     only 43 employees were fired after browsing investigations. \n     That is generally 1% of the total number of cases brought \n     each year. Even if you include the category of resignation \n     and retirement, the highest percentage of employees \n     terminated through separation or resignation/retirement in \n     any one year has been 6%.\n\n\nPunishments Assessed for Browsing Not Consistently Publicized to Deter \n                               Violations\n\n       GAO found that IRS facilities did not consistently \n     publicize the penalties assessed in browsing cases to deter \n     such behavior. For example, one facility never reported \n     disciplinary actions. By contrast, another facility used its \n     monthly newsletter to report disciplinary actions for \n     browsing, including citing a management official who had \n     accessed a relative's account.\n       By inconsistently and incompletely reporting on penalties \n     assessed for employee browsing, IRS is missing an opportunity \n     to more effectively deter such action.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 4 minutes and 23 \nseconds, plus the 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first let me thank my good colleague \nfrom Ohio, Senator Glenn, for the extended effort and work, some of \nwhich he outlined in his statement, over a period of years to get at \nthis problem. I appreciate his kind remarks in regard to my efforts.\n  Mr. President, the fact that we have come to a situation where it has \nbeen certified by the General Accounting Office and others that \nemployees of the Internal Revenue Service have been reviewing personal \nrecords in an unauthorized way must be stopped. The purpose of this \nlegislation is to do just that.\n  Senator Glenn also complimented the many loyal employees who work at \nthe Internal Revenue Service, and that should be done. We would be \nremiss not to do so.\n  Mr. President, there is a reason that half the American people are \noffended\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nby this agency. The belligerence, the intimidation is well-documented, \ntime and time again, and it is time that aura of having a standard or \nstatus that is higher than the taxpayer themselves come to an end.\n  As I said, on this Senator's part, this legislation is but a \nbeginning of the kind of accountability that I think needs to be put in \nplace with regard to the relationship between the Internal Revenue \nService and the American people.\n  Somebody said today, in all the flurry of meetings, trying to resolve \nthe differences here, that in no case should the average American \ncitizen be frightened by an arm of their Government in the day-to-day \nfunction and relationship between people and their Government. The \npeople should not be intimidated. They should not be fearful of this \nrelationship.\n  I will leave the individual unnamed, but not long ago I was in a \ncommercial establishment and I was visiting with probably a 70-year-\nold-plus woman in Atlanta. I was completing the transaction, and she \nsaid she wondered if she might be in touch with me. I said, ``Of \ncourse.'' I was about to leave, so I was trying to give her my card. I \nsaid, ``Here is somebody you can call to give me the details,'' and she \nleaned over between her computer and her cash register and motioned me \nto come over and began whispering to me about a problem that involved \nher and the IRS--a 70-year-old woman, a hard worker for years and \nyears. She was scared to death. She was whispering to me because she \nwas frightened. That has left a mark on me. It has happened to me more \nthan once.\n  All too often the citizens that contact me with regard to problems \nwith the IRS are of very modest means and they cannot defend \nthemselves. They cannot protect themselves. They are frightened to \ndeath.\n  I hope what we jointly, in this bipartisan effort, are doing is but, \nas I said, a first step. We are ending a reprehensible practice that \nhas occurred on the part of some at the IRS, but there is much work to \nbe done as we begin a congressional audit of the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  I am prepared to yield back my time and relinquish the floor for \nfinal comments from the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my distinguished colleague from Georgia. I know we \nare approaching the time when we are supposed to have a vote.\n  The American people have to have the utmost confidentiality in the \nIRS. We have to have somebody collect the taxes that does everybody in \nthis country good, that builds roads, the airways, does everything, so \nthose who say we are mad at the IRS and we will do away with it, if \nthey will just think what they are saying, what we need is to have zero \ntolerance for browsers and misuse of the system. That is what this \naddresses today. Our legislation will get the snoops out of the IRS. \nOur legislation says if you are going to snoop, you are going to jail. \nIt is that simple.\n  If you are going to snoop, you are going to pay also. You are also \ngoing to lose your job. I think browsing angers me just like being \nviolated personally, almost. Everybody has to feel that way because you \ntrust your Government. We say we are giving this information willingly, \nhonestly, and then they are misusing it. They are browsing, and the \ninformation may not remain confidential. We don't know what is going to \nhappen to it. The American people deserve better than that.\n  I deplore those who are guilty of engaging in IRS-bashing. And it \nalways seems to build to a crescendo on April 15. I repeat that most \nIRS employees are just as honest as anybody in this room or anybody in \nAmerica. They are dedicated workers. They want to clean out this \nsnooping and they want to see this problem go away just like all the \nrest of us do, so that more Americans don't lose faith in our voluntary \ntax system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add John Kerry of \nMassachusetts and Senator Kohl of Wisconsin to the bill as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Congress we passed legislation I had \nwritten to provide criminal penalties for unauthorized snooping in \ncomputers. I understand that the Republican leadership is bringing up \nan extension of that legislation today. I am happy to see them bring it \nup, but I also point out to the American people that we have already \npassed some very strong legislation on this.\n  In fact, in terms of privacy protection legislation, we could have \npassed additional, strong legislation last year to provide protection \nand criminal sanctions against misuse of personal medical information, \nexcept that the Republican leadership objected to it. That medical \nrecords confidentiality legislation was we put together in a bipartisan \nfashion with Senator Bennett of Utah, myself, and others, based on work \na number of us have been doing for years, but we were blocked when it \nwas going to pass last year. I hope that the Republican leadership \nwillingness to extend protections against government snooping into \nprivate financial records will signal a new attitude and willingness to \naddress the crisis that is looming with respect to the confidentiality \nof health care information, as well.\n  I think we have to ask, why is it suddenly so important to take up \nthis IRS bill today without consideration by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee or any Senate Committee. Aha, what is today? April 15. This \nis, as more and more things around here are, a staged event for \npartisan political purposes. This is tax day, to be sure. But, \nunfortunately, the Republican majority is looking for something to do \nand something to distract from the fact that it is not doing what it is \nsupposed to do today.\n  Along with all Americans we have to file our income taxes today, \nApril 15. The Republican leadership of the House and Senate, however, \nis supposed to pass a budget by April 15. I suspect that there are tens \nof millions of Americans who are getting their taxes filed by today. \nWhen they go down to file their taxes, having stayed up late and worked \nit out, they should ask the leadership in the House and Senate if that \nRepublican leadership has done what the law requires them to do--to \nhave a budget by April 15. Guess what? Has one been passed? No. Has one \neven been debated? No. There is a law that says that, by April 15, we \nmust pass it, but today will come and go and the Senate will miss its \nstatutory deadline.\n  Now, I ask my friends throughout this country, Republican, Democrat, \nand Independent, if you don't follow the law that says you have to file \nand pay your taxes by April 15, what is going to happen? Aha, you might \nsuddenly become a guest of the State, in a very secure place--bars on \nthe windows, bars on the doors.\n  What happens to the leadership of the House and the Senate if they \ndon't obey the law and have a budget passed by April 15? They will be \non the floor in the House and the Senate with a distraction.\n  So while I support the extension of the law we introduced in 1995 and \npassed last year in order to cover the paper records of the IRS, I \nremain concerned that the Senate is not making the progress that we \nneed to make on the Federal budget, on the chemical weapons treaty, and \non confirming Federal judges. We have confirmed two Federal judges in 4 \nmonths. There are 100 vacancies. Talk about zero population growth. At \nthis rate, at the end of the Congress there will 150 vacancies.\n  Then there's campaign finance reform. Remember campaign finance \nreform? Has anybody heard of it since the handshake in New Hampshire. \nHa, ha and ho, ho. The Republican leadership could bring up campaign \nfinance reform this afternoon if they wanted to. You are not going to \nsee it.\n  I understand that the House plans to use the Constitution as a \npolitical prop again today. I guess I should at least be grateful that \nthe Senate has avoided that temptation--for today.\n  All I suggest, Mr. President, is that the American people are \nrequired to follow the law and file their taxes today. The U.S. Senate \nand the House of Representatives are required to have a budget by \ntoday--and we are waiting.\n  Privacy is a precious right of every American. When our own \nGovernment workers abuse their access to personal information and \ncompromise our privacy, it is doubly wrong.\n  While I was happy that we are taking this matter up today and to \nsupport it, I comment briefly on the manner in\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nwhich this matter is proceeding. Unfortunately, the Senate of the \nUnited States is not doing the work that needs to be done to serve the \ninterests of the American people. We are not confirming the Federal \njudges that we all need, we are not making progress on balancing the \nbudget, we are not considering the chemical weapons treaty, and we are \nnot considering campaign finance reform legislation.\n  I commend Senator Glenn for his efforts in following up on his \nlongstanding efforts to monitor abuse of access to Internal Revenue \nreturns and information by Government employees.\n  When we file our tax returns today and the American people reveal to \nthe Government intimate details about their personal finances, we \nrightfully expect that the Internal Revenue Service and its employees \nwill treat that information with confidentiality, as the law has long \ncontemplated. Reports that IRS employees are snooping through these \nfiles to satisfy their own voyeuristic urges are unacceptable. \nUnauthorized browsing by IRS employees has been a longstanding problem, \naccording to a recent GAO report, and one that has concerned a number \nof us for years.\n  It is one of the principal circumstances that motivated me to include \nwithin legislation that I authored last Congress criminal sanctions \nagainst unauthorized snooping. Back in June 1995, I introduced, with \nSenators Kyl and Grassley, legislation making snooping through use of \nGovernment computers a crime. We obtained the views of the Attorney \nGeneral, the FBI Director, the Secret Service and others. The bill was \nconsidered and reported twice by the Senate Judiciary Committee and \npassed by the Senate as part of a legislative package back in October \n1996. The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act, title II \nof Public Law 104-294, made it a Federal crime for Government employees \nto misuse their computer access to obtain private information in \nGovernment files. Under the law, Government employees who abuse their \ncomputer privileges to snoop through personal information about \nAmericans, including tax information, are subject to criminal \npenalties.\n  Part of our purpose in passing that law was to stop the snooping by \nIRS employees of private taxpayer tax returns. In 1994, at least 1,300 \nIRS employees were internally investigated for using Government \ncomputers to browse through the tax returns of friends, relatives, and \nneighbors. At a 1995 oversight hearing of the Department of Justice, I \nasked the Attorney General whether a criminal statute making it clear \nthat such snooping is illegal would send a clear signal that we want \nour private information provided to the Government to remain private? \nHer response focused on the need for passage of the NII Protection \nAct. Attorney General Reno stated:\n\n       Enactment of a new statute covering such situations is \n     advisable to send a clear signal about the privacy of such \n     sensitive information. To that end, included as part of [the \n     NII Protection Act] is an amendment to 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1030(a)(2) that would make it clearly illegal for a \n     government employee to intentionally exceed authorized access \n     to a government computer and obtain information.\n\n  I have long been concerned with maintaining the privacy of our \npersonal information. Doing so in this age of computer networks is not \nalways easy but is increasingly important.\n  By passing the NII Protection Act we have already closed a loophole \nthat had existed in our laws. That loophole resulted in the dismissal \nof criminal charges earlier this year against an IRS employee who went \nsnooping through the tax returns of individuals involved in a \nPresidential campaign, a prosecutor who was investigating a family \nmember, a police officer and various social acquaintances. He made \nthese unauthorized searches in 1992, before our new law went into \neffect. He was able to retrieve on his computer screen all the taxpayer \ninformation stored in the IRS main data base in Martinsburg, WV. Since \nthe IRS employee did not disclose the information to anyone else and \ndid not use it for nefarious purposes, the wire and computer fraud \ncharges against him had to be dismissed. The point is that with \nPresident Clinton having signed the NII Protection Act into law last \nOctober 11, the law has been corrected to make such unauthorized \nsnooping through individual tax records by means of computers a Federal \ncrime.\n  Employees of the IRS and other Government agencies and departments \nare forewarned that under the law and augmented by the NII Protection \nAct last year, unauthorized browsing through computerized tax filings \nis criminal and will be prosecuted.\n  I am hopeful that the National Information Infrastructure Protection \nAct and its privacy protections will help deter illegal browsing by IRS \nemployees and help restore the confidence of American taxpayers that \nthe private financial information we are obliged to give the Government \nwill remain private.\n  Our job is not done, however. We need to remain vigilant to protect \nthe privacy of our intimate personal information in this era of \ncomputer networks. I am particularly concerned that we are doing a \nwoefully inadequate job at protecting the privacy of our medical \ninformation. For several years I have worked on legislation to provide \nprivacy protection to our health care information. I hope that this \nyear we will finally enact this much-needed and overdue legislation. If \nwe do not, we risk having the computerized transmissions of health care \ninformation required by the so-called administrative simplification \nprovisions of the law passed last year, without the privacy protection \nthat the American people expect and deserve.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the public expects some essential services \nfrom the Government. Social security payments, highway funding, \nnational defense, a safety net in bad times, clean air and water, the \nNational Park System, and so on. These are important to the country and \nthe Government should provide them.\n  So most folks are willing to pay their fair share of taxes. Nobody \nlikes it, but most of us do it regularly and honestly. But we do expect \nthe Government to keep it fair, make it as simple as possible, and keep \nit private.\n  And we've recently found that in their zeal to catch the few people \nwho don't pay their taxes, some tax collectors forget the most \nfundamental truth about our tax system. Citizens have rights that must \nbe protected.\n  One of the first bills I introduced when I first came to the Senate \nwas a Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, to protect taxpayers in disputes with \nthe Internal Revenue Service. And I noted:\n\n       Oliver Wendell Holmes reasoned that ``Taxes are what we pay \n     for a civilized society.'' However, Justice Holmes did not \n     consider additional burdens imposed on taxpayers--added costs \n     and delays that result from inefficiencies and \n     inconsistencies in the administration of tax law.\n\n  That was back in 1979. And it took a while, but in 1988 we finally \npassed a comprehensive Taxpayer Bill of Rights. That went a long ways \ntoward defining taxpayer rights and gave some protection against \narbitrary actions by the IRS.\n  This law made IRS give at least 30 days' notice before levying on a \ntaxpayers' property, so that he or she would have time to file an \nappeal. It exempted more kinds of property from IRS levies, and raised \nthe wage total exempt from collection. It allowed taxpayers to collect \ncosts and attorney's fees from the Government if the IRS acted without \nsubstantial justification. And it let taxpayers sue the Government for \ndamages if IRS employees acted recklessly in collecting taxes or \nintentionally disregarded any provision of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  This helped make taxation a little more fair and accountable. But it \ndidn't solve all the problems. Last year, we did some more with the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights II. This created an Office of Taxpayer Advocate \nwithin the IRS to help taxpayers resolve their problems with the IRS. \nIt gave taxpayers more power to take the IRS to court in order to abate \ninterest and eased the burden of proof for collecting attorney's fees \nand costs when you challenge an IRS decision and win. And it raised the \ndamages a taxpayer can collect in the event an IRS agent recklessly or \nintentionally disregards the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n  But as important as these laws are, we need to do a lot more to give \ntaxpayers confidence in the system and the people who work in it.\n  Today we're going to go a little further. Every once in a while we \nfind that some IRS employees are snooping around in tax returns that \nought to be private. That's happened twice this\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\nyear--first, with the revelation that President Nixon tried to pressure \nhis IRS Administrator to look through political opponents' returns, and \nnow when we hear that some IRS employees have browsed in returns for \nfun. Our bill today will impose criminal penalties on anyone who does \nit. And we'll make sure the taxpayer whose records have been violated \nin this way can be notified so that they too can take action. Without \nthis high level of protection of taxpayer privacy, we undermine our \nability to make a system of voluntary taxation work.\n  Once this bill is signed into law, as I am confident that it will be, \nwe must not rest on our laurels. There is still much work to be done to \nfully protect the rights of taxpayers. The administration proposes \nsimplification and Bill of Rights initiatives that we must review very \nsoon. The Commission on the Restructuring of the Internal Revenue \nService will also issue a bipartisan report that will help us address a \nbroad range of problems with the IRS.\n  That should be a top priority. We need a tax system that brings in \nthe revenue to pay for essential services. One that balances the \nbudget. But also one that is fair and reasonable, and understands that \nmost of us are good people who obey the law and shouldn't be picked on \nall the time. It's that simple.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. \n522, legislation which would allow civil and criminal penalties to be \nimposed for the unauthorized access of tax returns and return \ninformation by employees of the Internal Revenue Service or other \nFederal employees. It is altogether appropriate that this issue should \ncome before both the House and Senate on April 15, and I applaud the \nefforts of my colleagues, Senators Coverdell and Glenn, to work \ntogether on this bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Abuse by employees of the IRS has been of concern to Members of \nCongress for many years. Over the years numerous Coloradans have \nwritten me to express their concerns with this type of abuse as well. \nAnd with the recent release of the report by the General Accounting \nOffice detailing its findings on security problems at the IRS, in \naddition to reports on browsing by IRS employees through private \ntaxpayer files, this issue has once again come to the forefront.\n  This morning, as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTreasury and General Government, I held a hearing to receive testimony \non the issue of browsing. For the record, I would like to state the \nwitnesses included: Senator John Glenn; Larry Summers, Deputy Secretary \nof the U.S. Department of the Treasury; Dr. Rona B. Stillman, Chief \nScientist for Computers and Telecommunications with the GAO; Margaret \nMilner Richardson, Commissioner of the IRS; and Valerie Lau, inspector \ngeneral of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n  It became clear in all of the witnesses' testimonies this morning \nthat currently it is not necessarily illegal for IRS employees to \nbrowse through taxpayer files. The law, as it exists, makes it \ndifficult for the IRS to take effective action against those employees \nwho are caught browsing taxpayer files.\n  Those IRS employees who do access the computerized or paper records \nof celebrities, friends, or enemies most often do so just for the fun \nof it. However, let me tell you--taxpayers do not find this activity \nvery funny. It is an invasion of privacy, and unauthorized browsing \nshould be punishable with civil and criminal penalties. During this \nmorning's hearing, Treasury officials kept referring to taxpayers as \n``customers''. Well, I would like to clarify that in my State \nColoradans do not consider themselves customers. If anything, they \nconsider themselves victims. Unfortunately, taxpayers have become \nvictims of browsing, and they currently have no assurances that \nbrowsers will be held accountable for their actions.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit a couple \nof items for the record to be printed immediately following my \nstatement. First, I have an article from the Washington Post. In \naddition, I would also like to submit a relevant section of the \nElectronic Audit Research Log's Executive Steering Committee Report on \ntaxpayer privacy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Finally, I would simply like to reiterate my support \nfor S. 522. I would like to be able to tell my constituents that \nCongress recognized the need to safeguard their personal tax records \nand took action accordingly by passing this legislation and sending it \non to the President for signature.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 9, 1997]\n\n                  IRS Audit Reveals More Tax Browsing\n\n                           (By Stephen Barr)\n\n       The Internal Revenue Service fired 23 employees, \n     disciplined 349 and counseled 472 other workers after agency \n     audits found that government computers were still being used \n     to browse through the tax records of friends, relatives and \n     celebrities, an IRS document released yesterday showed.\n       The document, covering fiscal 1994 and 1995, listed 1,515 \n     cases where employees were accused of misusing computers. \n     After accounting for the firings, the disciplinary action and \n     the counseling, 33 percent of the cases were closed without \n     any action and the remaining 12 percent took retirement or \n     were cleared.\n       Yesterday's disclosure, made by Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), \n     marked the second time that IRS employees have been faulted \n     for peeking at tax records. A probe in 1993 and 1994 turned \n     up more than 1,300 employees suspected of using government \n     computers to browse through tax files. At the time, the IRS \n     promised ``zero tolerance'' for such snooping.\n       But the new data indicate the problem has continued and the \n     agency does not know how big a problem it has on its hands. \n     ``I don't know what kind of new math they are using, but that \n     doesn't sound like zero tolerance to me,'' Glenn said at a \n     news conference, where he released excerpts of IRS documents \n     and a General Accounting Office (GAO) report.\n       Government employees face criminal penalties for misuse of \n     computer databases, but loopholes have thwarted prosecution \n     of some IRS employees who snooped in files but did not \n     disclose the information to others. Glenn and other \n     lawmakers, including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman \n     Bill Archer (R-Tex.), have proposed legislation this year to \n     tighten the laws.\n       David A. Mader, the IRS chief for management, said \n     ``browsing is not widespread'' at the 102,000-employee \n     agency, but stressed that curious employees must understand \n     that even one unauthorized peek in tax files undercuts the \n     IRS goal of fair and confidential tax administration. The IRS \n     supports efforts to tighten laws, he said.\n       ``It is challenging to change the behavior of an \n     organization this size,'' Mader said. Not every employee \n     deserves to be fired when accused of browsing, he said, but \n     ``we ought to start with the assumption we're going to fire \n     them and then look at the circumstances.\n       The disclosure of additional IRS employee snooping comes at \n     a time when privacy advocates are increasingly worried about \n     the government's growing dependence on computers and \n     information technology. The GAO, for example, has issued more \n     than 30 reports in the last four years describing how \n     government systems are vulnerable to ``hackers'' and even \n     federal employees who want to change data, commit fraud or \n     disrupt an agency's operations.\n       The GAO, in reviewing IRS computer security at Glenn's \n     request, found that five IRS centers could not account for \n     about 6,400 computer tapes and cartridges that might contain \n     taxpayer data. Since the GAO audit, however, 5,700 of the \n     tapes and cartridges have been found, Mader said. He said the \n     problem involved inventory controls and that no tapes were \n     lost.\n       In two centers, computer printouts containing taxpayer data \n     were left unprotected and unattended in open areas, the GAO \n     said.\n       GAO found some computer problems were so sensitive that the \n     congressional watchdog agency feared public disclosure could \n     jeopardize IRS security. As a result, Glenn received a \n     confidential report on those problems and the GAO-prepared \n     report released yesterday leaves out some matters and does \n     not identify the tax processing centers with lax security \n     practices. But the breaches of taxpayer privacy led \n     congressional investigators to conclude that IRS computer \n     systems operate with ``serious weaknesses'' that place tax \n     returns and tax files ``at risk to both internal and external \n     threats,'' GAO said.\n       The IRS handles more than 200 million taxpayer returns each \n     year at 10 primary centers. After the returns are processed, \n     the data are electronically transmitted to a central computer \n     site, where master files on each taxpayer are maintained and \n     updated.\n       To avoid compromising taxpayer information, the IRS \n     developed a software program to monitor the electronic trail \n     left by employees as they call up tax returns and files on \n     their computer screens. The program, the Electronic Audit \n     Research Log (EARL), also signals managers when an employee's \n     work pattern or use of command codes appears at odds with the \n     tasks assigned. The audit trail covered about 58,000 \n     employees who use the IRS's main computer system. But the GAO \n     found EARL does not monitor IRS employees using secondary \n     computer systems and does not effectively distinguish between \n     browsing and legitimate work.\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\n       The IRS internal audit, in a section on disciplining \n     employees, said, ``Some employees, when confronted, indicate \n     they browsed because they do not believe it is wrong and that \n     their will be little or no consequence to them if they are \n     caught.''\n       The IRS document added that agency managers ``apply vastly \n     different levels of discipline for similar offenses,'' \n     sending ``an inconsistent message to the workforce.'' Glenn \n     called for swift passage of his bill to end loopholes in the \n     law that allow some federal workers to escape prosecution for \n     browsing through records.\n       He cited a federal appeals court decision in February that \n     overturned a guilty verdict against a Ku Klux Klansman \n     employed by the IRS in Boston who browsed through tax records \n     of suspected white supremacists, a family adversary and a \n     political opponent.\n       Last year, a former IRS employee was acquitted of criminal \n     charges after peeking at the records of Elizabeth Taylor, \n     Lucille Ball, Tom Cruise, Elvis Presley and other \n     celebrities.\n       In both cases, there was little or no testimony to prove \n     that the IRS workers passed information to others or used the \n     information in a criminal way.\n       Congress expanded criminal penalties last year to deter the \n     use of computer data without proper authorization, but the \n     provision does not apply to paper tax returns or magnetic \n     tapes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                EARL Executive Steering Committee Report\n\n       Attached are excerpts from a lengthy internal IRS audit on \n     the state of taxpayer privacy at the agency.

Mr. President, we are engaged in an important debate--a \ndebate about privacy, liberty, and the role of Government in our lives. \nThe American people want less Government, less regulation and less \ntaxes. They want less hassle and more respect from their Government.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Taxpayer Privacy \nProtection Act, which was introduced by my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell. The Senate will vote on this important \nlegislation later today, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  As the April 15 income tax deadline approaches each year, Americans \nrush to file their returns while wading through a paper storm of tax \nforms that even some tax lawyers have trouble understanding. During tax \nseason, animus for the IRS reaches its peak as taxpayers are reminded \nwhat an intrusive, overbearing bureaucracy the Internal Revenue Service \nhas become.\n  Nobody likes taxes, and nobody likes tax collectors. They are \nnecessary evils. But if we must have them, then we need to do all we \ncan to ease the burden they impose on our citizens and to make the \nsystem user-friendly and respectful of our people.\n  The IRS system today is neither user-friendly nor respectful. Today \nwe have an IRS that is out of control from top management all the way \ndown to its field offices, and the American taxpayers are paying the \nprice for that disarray--a price in inefficiency, inconvenience, \nintrusiveness, and even harassment.\n  The American people deserve better. It is bad enough that taxpayers \nhave to pay for an agency that wastes their money and time. But it is \nsimply unacceptable that the IRS has tolerated some of its employees \nsnooping through confidential taxpayer information.\n  The headlines of our newspapers have been littered with accounts of \nIRS employees reading taxpayers' confidential files without authority \nand without cause. During fiscal years 1994 and 1995, there were 1,515 \ncases of IRS employees browsing through confidential taxpayer computer \nrecords, according to a recent General Accounting Office report. These \nemployees violated the privacy of hundreds of taxpayers when they \nsnooped through the tax returns of friends, family member or \ncelebrities without authorization and without justification.\n  Yet, of those 1,515 cases of snooping, only 844 resulted in employees \nbeing fired, disciplined, or counseled.\n  Let me emphasize that, Mr. President--only 844 of the 1,515 snoops \nhad action taken against them. That means almost 700 known cases of \nsnooping went unpunished.\n  This is not acceptable. Unauthorized snooping is wrong and \nintolerable. That is why the laws need to be changed.\n  The Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act imposes civil and criminal \npenalties against IRS employees who snoop through tax returns and \nrelated information without authority. It puts real power in the hands \nof taxpayers who are the victims of IRS snooping--it lets them bring \nsuit against the IRS employee who is responsible. Under this \nlegislation, IRS employees can be fired, fined, and jailed if they are \nfound guilty of snooping.\n  This bill is an important step toward protecting Americans from an \nout of control IRS. It is an important step toward holding IRS \nemployees accountable for their actions. It is a small but important \nstep toward making our tax system respectful, trustworthy, and sound.\n  It should become law--now.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 522, The Taxpayer \nBrowsing Protection Act, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nmeasure to stop IRS employees from electronically browsing through \ntaxpayer files.\n  Mr. President, today is not a day when most Americans feel much \nsympathy for the IRS. For many Americans finishing up their tax \nreturns, the last several days have been painful ones, with families \nstruggling to understand and fill out complex forms, writing checks to \nthe IRS and wondering where all the money they send to Washington \nactually goes.\n  And it doesn't help to see recent news accounts of the $4 billion of \nthe taxpayers money has been wasted by the IRS in an effort to \nmodernize its computer system--without success. That's nearly enough \nmoney to pay for our troops in Bosnia, and for continued disaster \nrelief to areas of the country damaged by floods and storms, including \nareas of North Carolina still suffering from the effects of Hurricane \nFran.\n  And so, Mr. President, today is not a good day for the American \npeople to be told of yet another outrage at the IRS. As many as 211 \nmillion Americans who file tax returns this year will pay over $1.6 \ntrillion in taxes. That is outrage enough. Quite frankly, the American \npeople are overtaxed, and I hope that we can provide them some tax \nrelief this year.\n  As complicated and burdensome as our Tax Code has become, the vast \nmajority of taxpayers fill out their tax forms honestly and completely. \nIn fact, our entire system of tax collection depends on the voluntary \ncompliance of the American people. Much of the information contained in \nthese tax returns is extremely private and sensitive. Taxpayers have a \nright to expect that this information will be treated with the greatest \nof care.\n  For that reason, I was deeply troubled by the results of the recent \ninvestigation of the Internal Revenue Service by the General Accounting \nOffice\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\nwhich has prompted this hearing. The GAO has uncovered at least 1,515 \ncases where IRS employees have used Government computers to browse \nthrough the private tax files of Americans--without authorization.\n  According to the GAO, this is not the first time that IRS employees \nhave been caught peeking in on private tax files. In 1993 and 1994, the \nGAO discovered that more than 1,300 IRS employees had used Government \ncomputers to electronically browse through tax records. At that time, \nthe Commissioner of the IRS announced a new zero tolerance policy for \nsuch behavior.\n  Unfortunately, zero tolerance has been more like zero improvement. \nAccording to the GAO, little has changed since this problem was first \nidentified in 1993. IRS employees are still snooping into tax files \nwithout proper authorization. The system put in place by the IRS to fix \nthe problem and detect unauthorized browsing--the Electronic Audit \nResearch Log, or EARL--can't even tell the difference between browsing \nand legitimate work.\n  To make matters worse, an IRS internal audit found that many \nemployees who were caught browsing did not believe that snooping in \ntaxpayers' files is wrong, and perhaps even more troubling, they \nthought there would be little or no consequence to them if they were \ncaught.\n  I am concerned that we can't count on the senior management of the \nIRS to supervise their employees. In fact, I am concerned about the \nsupervisors themselves, and I wonder who is watching them. I find news \naccounts that the IRS may be conducting politically motivated audits of \nselected nonprofit organizations deeply troubling.\n  Mr. President, the IRS has demonstrated that it cannot adequately \nsupervise its own employees to protect the privacy of the American \npeople. Stronger measures are clearly needed. That is why I am a \ncosponsor of of S. 522, The Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act offered by \nmy good friend, Senator Coverdell. I join my colleagues in support of \nthe measure.\n  Mr. President, due to a prior family commitment, I was unavoidably \ndetained and missed the vote on S. 522. Had I been present I would have \nvoted ``aye.''\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask for yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to now propound a unanimous-\nconsent request that the Senate proceed immediately to the \nconsideration of a Senate resolution submitted by myself regarding the \nsense of the Senate relating to tax relief for the American people. I \nfurther ask unanimous-consent that there be 10 minutes for debate on \nthe resolution equally divided in the usual form, and following that \ndebate the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of the resolution \nto be followed by a vote on the preamble, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  I might take just a moment so that there can be a response to that \nunanimous-consent request. This is a sense of the Senate which just \ndeclares a need for tax relief for the American people, and condemns \nthe abuses of power and authority committed by the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  We have discussed this with a number of Senators. We have provided it \nto the other side of the aisle.\n  So I propound that unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to--before I propound the unanimous-consent request, let me \nexplain my objection to the resolution offered by the Senate majority \nleader and then indicate that I would intend to offer a resolution of \nmy own.\n  Some of the provisions that are in the resolution offered by the \nSenator from Mississippi, the majority leader, are not troublesome, but \nthere are some provisions and some language that are very troublesome \nto some of us in this resolution.\n  It is clearly a partisan resolution written in a manner that suggests \nthat one side is no good, the other side is all bad, and for that \nreason I object to it.\n  In the spirit of discussing the taxes, tax burden on the American \ncitizens and the ability to address meaningful tax reform for American \nfamilies and to do so in a budget process that has a requirement that \nthe Congress bring to the floor of the Senate and pass a budget today \non April 15, I would offer a unanimous-consent request and will do so, \nand the resolution that I will offer is a resolution that talks some \nabout the tax burden that we face in this country and our desire to \noffer meaningful tax relief to American families but to do so in the \ncontext of a budget that reaches balance, and that we do it in a \nprocess as described by law in this country, that a budget be brought \nto the Congress, be passed by April 15.\n  It is unusual that we have not even started a budget process at this \npoint. April 15 is two deadlines. One, people will line up at the post \noffice this evening in a traffic jam trying to file their income tax \nreturn and get an April 15 postmark because people at the post office \nwant to meet their obligation.\n  There is a second obligation today, and that is the obligation of the \nCongress to pass a budget resolution, by law, on April 15. Obviously, \nwe are far from that position of being able to pass a budget \nresolution. No budget resolution has come from the Budget Committee. \nThere is not an indication that such a budget resolution will be \nforthcoming.\n  In the resolution that I will ask unanimous consent to offer we ask \nthat the majority party take up without delay a budget resolution that \nbalances the budget by the year 2002 and targets its tax relief to \nworking and middle-class families to the same degree as the proposal \noffered by the President and, at the same time, protects important \ndomestic priorities such as Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the \nenvironment.\n  I might say there is a difference with respect to our interest in tax \nrelief. There are those who propose tax relief but do it in a way that \nsays what they would like to do is especially exempt income from \ninvestment, which means there is more of a burden on income from work. \nIt is an approach that says let us tax work but let us exempt \ninvestment. Guess who has all the investment income in the country. The \nupper-income folks.\n  And so you have a proposal that essentially says let us exempt the \nfolks at the upper-income scale, and then we will shift the burden, and \nwhat we will end up doing is taxing work.\n  Some of us think that is the wrong way to offer tax relief, that \noverburdened working families deserve some tax relief in this country, \nand we believe a responsible budget that allows for some tax relief to \nworking families but still protects important priorities, and, \nimportantly, balances the budget in 2002, is a responsibility of this \nCongress. And it so happens that today is the day by which that is \nsupposed to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3190-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3190-S3192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--SENATE RESOLUTION 74\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of a resolution I will send to \nthe desk submitted by myself and on behalf of Senator Daschle regarding \nthe sense of the Senate relating to the budget deficit reduction and \ntax relief for working families.\n  I further ask there be 10 minutes for debate on the resolution \nequally divided in the usual form, and, following that debate, without \nintervening action, the Senate proceed to vote on the adoption of the \nresolution, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Also, I must say it is regrettable that the objection was \nheard on the earlier unanimous-consent request for a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution in this area. I had hoped the Senate would be able to \nadopt the resolution in a timely manner, considering this is April 15, \ntax day, the day that most Americans have the worst feeling about in \nthe entire year. This is a\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, and as a matter of fact I would assume \nthat we could probably come together on language that would make it \nclear we feel that working Americans should have and deserve some tax \nrelief and we need to do it today, not May 9, which is how long the \nAmerican people have to work to pay their taxes for the year. Until May \nthe 9th we all work for the Government, and then after that we get to \nkeep the money we have been earning because we have paid off the tax \nburden that the American people are saddled with.\n  I know of examples of young Americans who are working making $30,000 \na year and their tax burden, when you add it all up, is probably 40 \npercent. Others, like my own young son who is a young entrepreneur, \ncreating jobs, trying to help people get a job, keep a job, make a \nliving, get some basic training, move on, are paying over 50 percent. \nWe now have probably the highest tax burden on working Americans in \nhistory. It is very high. It is oppressive.\n  With regard to the budget itself, as a matter of fact, Congress has \nonly met the April 15 deadline for budget resolutions once in 15 years. \nThat is not to say we should not do it. I had hoped we would meet that \ndeadline this year, and I will work toward that goal in the future. One \nof the reasons we have not is because we have been working in good \nfaith with the administration to see if we could come together on \nagreement of a package that would take us to balance by the year 2002 \nwith tax relief for working Americans.\n  I remind Senators, as a matter of fact, that there has been \nbipartisan support for tax relief for working Americans. Senator Breaux \nand Senator Lieberman have supported capital gains tax rate cuts. I \nthink maybe the Senator from North Dakota was referring to that a \nmoment ago. Senator Torricelli joined Senators Breaux, Nickles, Craig, \nand I in saying the estate tax, the death tax, clearly is one of the \nworst things we have in the Tax Code because it undermines the American \ndream of working and saving up something, producing something and \nleaving something to your children but now the tax law takes 44 \npercent, minimum, of a life's work above certain levels, once you get \nabove the exemption, and up to 55 percent under certain conditions.\n  We should raise that exemption for individuals, for small businesses, \nfarmers, and ranchers, in the Senator's State, in the North Dakota \narea, in my State and all across America.\n  So we should come up with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution today, \nApril 15, that makes a commitment to reducing the burden. As a matter \nof fact, one of the reasons why we need to do it, the Senator will \nrecall we had the largest tax increase in history that was passed in \nthe first year of the Clinton administration, 1993. We need to give \nback a little bit of that to families with children, and to the capital \ngains area where a lot of people are not selling or not being able to \nget the benefit of their lands or stocks or what they own because they \ndo not want to have to pay the excessive capital gains tax rate.\n  But without saying OK, you did it, we did it, they did it, what I am \nadvocating this afternoon is we get a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in \na bipartisan way in which we agree that the American people deserve \nsome relief. And that is what the title says here--declare the need for \ntax relief for the American people and condemn the abuses of power and \nauthority committed by the Internal Revenue Service. We have already \ndone that today. We have already said that their snooping around \nthrough files is wrong, and we put some penalties in the law for that. \nWe worked together on that one.\n  So it seems that while there has been objection heard on both sides I \nguess so far this afternoon, I think we ought to see if we cannot come \nto an agreement on something where the American people can say, yes, \nlook, they really are committed to doing their job in controlling the \nrate of growth in the Federal Government and giving some tax relief to \nthe American people. So I would be constrained at this point to object \nto that unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Without belaboring this at great length, the Senator from \nMississippi said we will not go through ``you said, they said, we \nsaid,'' having already done that. The fact is I would not have \nobjected, nor would other Members on this side of the aisle have \nobjected to this resolution except this is not a resolution you bring \nto the floor and say, by the way, let us be bipartisan.\n  Let me give you an example. This is a resolution that says page 1, \nsub 5, ``President proposed and Democratic-controlled Congress enacted \na $241 billion tax increase on the American people in 1993, the largest \nin history,'' and on and on and on. It was not the largest in history. \nThe largest in history came during the Reagan administration in 1982, \nthe largest tax increase in history documented by the Congressional \nBudget Office and Joint Tax Committee, but that is beside the point.\n  In 1993, a provision that I voted for was a deficit reduction \nprovision, and guess what happened as a result of that? Yes, the \ndeficit was reduced. Contest that? Well, even Alan Greenspan says it \nwas reduced as a result of that action. The deficit was reduced because \nwe had the courage to reduce spending and increase some revenue. The \ndeficit has been reduced over 60 percent since 1993. We have had \neconomic growth. We have had job creation. We have had lower interest \nrates. And the fact is this country was put back on track because the \ndeficits were being reduced and we were moving in the right direction.\n  Now, was it controversial to do that? Yes, of course, it was. Why was \nit controversial? Because it lends itself to this sort of nonsense, \nsomeone coming to the floor of the Senate and saying, well, gee, look \nat the Democrats over on the other side of the aisle. This resolution \nsays, well, the Democrats did it. The Democrats passed the largest tax \nincrease in history.\n  Some of what the majority leader said I agree with, and we can draft \na bipartisan resolution that talks about the common interests here. \nShould we try to do some tax relief for working families? Of course, we \nshould. Let us do that in the context of a balanced budget. Can we do \nsomething that allows people to pass businesses and family farms from \none generation to the other without inheriting the business and the \nfarm and the estate tax obligation? Yes, let us do that. Should we, \nhowever, agree to some of the other proposals on the other side that \nsay let's have a zero tax on estates, exempt all estates and have no \nestate tax, and, by the way, let us decide there be a zero tax for the \ncapital gains that someone has?\n  Kevin Phillips, a Republican commentator, today on NPR talked about \nthat issue, and I will read it again in the Chamber tomorrow. I read it \ntoday. It makes no sense to decide we are going to have a tax system, \nand there are four streams of income in this country and we decide to \ntreat a couple streams of income by exempting them and the other \nstreams will bear a tax burden. So we will create a situation where \nsomeone would propose, let's tax those people who are recipients of \nincome from investments and decide then, all right, we have taxed them \nat half the rate they used to be taxed. Now we will exempt them \naltogether. Let us just have a total tax exemption for people who have \ntheir income from investments, but people who get their income by \nworking, let's go ahead and keep taxing those folks.\n  Guess what. It is like squeezing a balloon. When you exempt a class \nof income over here from any tax obligation, the people who are over \nhere remaining to pay the tax are going to pay a higher burden. It is \nsaying let's exempt people who are investors and we will ask people who \nwork to pay a higher tax.\n  Does that make any sense? Tax work but exempt investment? Capital \ngains tax--I proposed a capital gains tax proposal that says if you \nhold a capital asset for 10 years, maybe you should be able to take \n$250,000 with a zero tax rate during your lifetime; tax free $250,000 \nduring your lifetime. But should we go back to the good old days where \nyou have a tax shelter industry with tens of thousands of people doing \nnothing but help people convert ordinary income to capital gains so \nthey\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\nend up paying no tax so the people who go to work every day end up \npaying a certain tax. I do not think so. It does not make sense to me.\n  If the Senator from Mississippi wants to pass a bipartisan resolution \nand takes these kinds of things, especially, out of it, write a \nresolution and we will pass it. I have no problem with that. But you \ncannot call this bipartisan, bringing this to the floor and throwing \nout sort of an in-your-face admonition about what Democrats did in \n1993. Most of us feel good about what we did in 1993. We turned this \ncountry around, and passed a piece of legislation that substantially \nreduced the Federal deficit, substantially reduced the Federal budget \ndeficit, helped create new jobs, put us on a course to economic growth \nand reduced interest rates. That is what we did, and we did not get one \nvote to help us. All we got was criticism then and now, 4 years later, \nwe slip papers under the doors and over the transom, to say, ``Here is \nwhat they did, here is what they did back in 1993.''\n  That is not the way to do business. If you want to do a resolution, \nlet us do one. Let us just take all this backbiting out of it and do a \nresolution that reaches the consensus that I think we could reach on \nsome of the things that we think should be done with respect to our Tax \nCode.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3190-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I compliment my distinguished friend from \nNorth Dakota on his very prescient remarks, which I think are right on \ntarget. I listened to a lot of the debate today on the question of \ntaxation, and I must say I find it puzzling. I do not really mean this, \nbut I say quite often that I wish everybody had the opportunity to live \nthrough the Depression. My brother and sister and I were lucky. We had \nsomething to eat. We also had devoted parents and that makes up for a \nmultitude of problems. However, not everyone is as fortunate. Some \npeople need a helping hand.\n  Nobody likes the idea of taxes. I coughed up a sizable amount \nyesterday to the IRS. I did not particularly enjoy it. But I have never \nbegrudged the taxes I paid, even though, as a U.S. Senator, I see a lot \nof waste. I see money misspent. I see priorities misplaced. And \nsometimes it is kind of a bitter pill to swallow. But I can not accept \nthe idea that some Senators that have propounded today that somehow \nthere is something unholy and evil about paying taxes. As Justice \nHolmes said, taxes are necessary ``to make our society a civilized \none.'' To complain about the taxes we pay in order to live in a \ncivilized society is unfathomable to me.\n\n  My brother, who is my best friend, does not like to pay taxes. I keep \nreminding him the thing he and my sister and I had that a lot of \nchildren did not have when we were growing up, is that we chose our \nparents well. A lot of children do not have that luxury. The fact is \nthat the Federal Government has done a tremendous amount of good with \nour tax funds. I think about the house we lived in and the fact that \nthe water well was only about 10 steps away from the outhouse, and \npeople died of typhoid fever in the summertime and we could not figure \nout why. All of a sudden, Franklin Roosevelt was elected President, the \nfirst President of the United States who began to treat the South as a \npart of the United States and not as a conquered nation. So, we began \nto get paved streets, running water, indoor plumbing, electricity, \nnatural gas, housing, medical help, free shots against typhoid fever \nand smallpox at the schoolhouse, by a nurse paid for by those insidious \ntaxes that we pay.\n  Mr. President, if I could just list all of the things that have \nhappened since I was 10 years old, that have made us the great Nation \nwe are, not one single Member of the U.S. Senate would take any of them \nback--not one. I am thinking about the housing programs we have, the \nfarm programs we have, the medical research that we do, the medical \nhelp we give people. I think about the bank insurance fund. If we had \nnot had the FSLIC fund when the S's were all going broke, you think \nabout what a catastrophe that would have been in this country. That is \nwhat happened during the Depression, the banks went broke. And my \nmother, who had carefully saved $1,100 selling cream and eggs and \nchickens on Saturday, lost every nickel of it when the bank went under. \nAnd she grieved about it until her dying day.\n  Who would turn their back on the environmental improvements we have \nmade in this country? Mr. President, 65 percent of the streams were \nunfishable and unswimmable. Now 65 percent are swimmable and fishable, \nand nobody here wants to do anything but go to 100 percent clean water \nand air for our children and grandchildren yet to come.\n  I could go on with many other things the Government has done to \nbenefit us all. For instance, we have dammed the rivers that used to \nflood every spring. My mother and father used to go down to the \nArkansas River every April, see people straggling along the road who \nhad lost their homes and all their possessions, pick them up, take them \nhome, keep them for a couple of nights until the water receded, and \ntake them back to the area they had called their homes. We dammed the \nArkansas River. It not only provides navigation but recreation and \nflood control. And people in those same areas of Arbuckle Island do not \nhave to worry about it anymore.\n  And now some in Congress want a constitutional amendment that would \nrequire a two-thirds vote to raise taxes. You could not even correct a \nmistake with less than two-thirds of the vote. You could not close a \ntax loophole with less than two-thirds of the vote. It would favor the \nwealthy, who would be assured their taxes would never go up. And it \nwould be a terrible disservice to the people who rely on Government \nservices--yes, even welfare recipients. Like I say, everybody did not \nhave Bill and Lattie Bumpers for parents.\n  We talk about family values. I have the three greatest children and \nthe greatest family a man could have. I know all about family values. I \nput mine up against those of anybody in the world. Yet you and I know \nthere are a lot of children in this country who would be better off \nalmost anyplace than where they are.\n  So, I believe in helping these children. We keep on building more \nprisons and spending $25,000 a year for every person we incarcerate, \nand if we had given that child an education at roughly half the cost, \nhe would not be in prison. When I was Governor I used to go to the \nprisons and talk, sit and have lunch with them, interview them, talk to \nthem. I never met one with a college degree, though there probably were \na few. I never met one who owned his own home. I didn't meet very many \nwho did not come from a broken home.\n\n  Mr. President, I stand here on April 15 and we are still without a \nbudget. Instead, we are wasting the peoples' time with a debate between \nthe Democrats and Republicans about taxes. So far as I am concerned, \nthe whole country loses with that debate. If you really want to restore \nconfidence in the American political system and you want to stop the \nalienation of people's attitudes toward Congress and what goes on here, \ndo two things: Balance the budget and change the way you finance \ncampaigns. Anybody who thinks a democracy can survive when the laws\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\nwe pass and the people we elect are totally dependent on how much money \nwe put on it is dreaming.\n  And, if you want to stop alienation and really cause people to dance \nin the streets, balance the budget. In 1981, Fritz Hollings, Bill \nBradley and Dale Bumpers were the only three Senators who voted for \nRonald Reagan's spending cuts and against his tax cuts. I can show you \nabsolute documented proof, if everybody had voted that way we would \nhave had a balanced budget in 1985. But, no, the herd instinct swept \nacross this body and we voted for those massive tax cuts that \nguaranteed the budget was going to go out of control. And it did. Just \nas I screamed from this very spot in 1981.\n  Here we are, back to the same old stand. It reminds me of trying to \nhousebreak my little dog. I just could not do it. His memory was just \ntoo short. And he is not alone. The memories of people in this body are \nawful short, too. Nobody seems to remember how we got an additional $3 \ntrillion in debt from 1981 to 1992.\n  So, it is nonsense to talk about a two-thirds vote to raise taxes. \nEven the Articles of Confederation, which started out by saying you \nhave to have 9 of 13 States agree to raise taxes before you can do it, \nhad to be changed because they knew that would not work.\n  Mr. President, I have tried to make two points today. As I have said \nmany times before, if it had not been for a generous, compassionate, \ncaring Government, who had taxes to pay for my education on the GI \nbill, I would not be standing here right now. I have been trying to pay \nback this great Nation, the oldest democracy on Earth, with an organic \nlaw which we call the Constitution; next to the Holy Bible the most \nsacred to me. And every time we get in a tough political spot somebody \nsays, ``Well, let's amend the Constitution.'' When I think about some \nof the people here trying to tinker with what Ben Franklin and James \nMadison and John Adams and Alexander Hamilton did, crafted the greatest \ndocument and delivered under that document the greatest Nation, the \ngreatest democracy on Earth, and people are constantly trying to \ndestroy it, undo it--I shudder when I hear some of my colleagues \nwanting to undo what the greatest assemblage of minds ever assembled \nunder one roof did to bring this all about.\n  What do they want to do? Make it impossible to raise taxes because \nthe rich would have to pay. I am not going to be caught voting to cut \nMedicare and welfare and Medicaid and have somebody come to me and say, \n``Did you use it for balancing the budget?''\n  No.\n  ``Did you use it for education, so that everybody can have a college \neducation?''\n  No.\n  ``Did you put it into housing? The environment?''\n  No.\n  ``What on Earth did you do with it?''\n  Why, we cut taxes for the wealthiest 5 percent of the people in \nAmerica. That is what we did with it.\n  I will be 6 feet under before you catch me voting for something like \nthat.\n  I just came over here to say that the citizenry of this country, when \nyou stop and talk to them from the heart, if not the head, talk to them \nfrom the heart and the head, let them know we are the luckiest people \nalive.\n  Yes, I paid a lot of taxes yesterday, and I did not like it, but I \nwill tell you what I do like. I enjoy living in a civilized society \nwhere the crime rate is down, where the unemployment rate has been \ndramatically reduced, where inflation is under control, where people \nhave jobs and where some Senators are trying to figure out a way to \neducate every child in this country who wants it.\n  So, no, I am not voting for any of this nonsense that would require a \ntwo-thirds vote to raise taxes. That is not a democracy. I consider \nmyself just about the luckiest man that ever lived, No. 1, because of \nmy parents and No. 2, because I got elected to the U.S. Senate after \nserving my State as Governor for 4 years. Why? It is the greatest place \nin the world to keep faith with humankind, to give other people the \nsame kind of chances you had.\n  So I am very fortunate to be an American, and I did not begrudge the \ntaxes I paid yesterday, just as I never begrudged the taxes I have \npaid, and I think most of the Members of the Senate agree with that \nwhen they stop and really reflect on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3192-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3193-S3195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TAX DAY AND TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I would like to talk a little bit about \ntax day and, of course, the arguments going on here in the last few \nminutes about taxes and who should pay them, how much should be paid. I \nfind it a little ironic, but perhaps not surprising, that efforts to \nget a couple of resolutions on the floor to approve or have the Senate \ngo on record that the American taxpayer, the American family, the \nAmerican working people need tax relief--we tried to get just a \nresolution approved under a unanimous-consent agreement, but it was \ndenied.\n  Many talk about tax relief. The only problem is there are many more \nin this body who talk against tax relief. I have been a strong \nsupporter of family tax relief, and I have been the author and have \nsupported for the last 4 years an effort to get a $500-per-child tax \ncredit across the board. That is not really enough, because when you \nlook at how we support families and children, if we kept pace--and a \nlot of you just looked at your 1040 forms, 1040EZ forms, and you found \nout for every dependent you can deduct $2,550. If that had kept pace \nwith inflation from 1955, it would be worth over $9,000. So over the \nlast 20 or 30 years, somehow we have found children or families less \nworthy of tax relief than we do today.\n  We talk about other tax relief, like the death tax, the estate tax. \nIn other words, you have worked all your life, you have tried to put \nsomething away, as you are encouraged to do, to provide for your family \nafter you are gone, to be able to leave your children or your spouse \nsome money for the means of doing better. But yet, when you die, the \nGovernment wants to come in and take the majority of it. I think it was \nPaul Harvey who went through this the other day on the radio and talked \nabout if you had a $3 million estate, by the time the Government got \nfinished taking money away from you through penalties, et cetera, and \nthe estate tax and everything else, your family would get $400,000, the \nGovernment would get $2.6 million of that.\n  If you had an estate of $1.9 million, the tax on it would be 85 \npercent that would go to the Government. What kind of a message does \nthis send to anybody? Does it tell you that you should save? ``Why? I'm \ngoing to save up all my money so that the day I die, the Government can \ncome in and take 85 percent of it away from my kids.''\n  We talk about the death tax, and we talk about eliminating the estate \ntax. You worked all your life, you have already paid your taxes on \nthose dollars. This is after-tax income, and yet, when you die, the \nGovernment says, ``That's not enough, we want the bulk of whatever you \nhave in your savings account and cap gains tax.''\n  There is always talk about how it is only a tax cut for the wealthy. \nGranted, there are people who have money who are going to benefit from \nthis, but it is capital they are going to reinvest. When we talk about \nbeing able to provide an economy for working families in this country, \nwe need to grow, and that needs investments, it needs capital, no \nmatter where it comes from--foreign investors, local, domestic. We need \nthose dollars.\n  Right now, it is estimated that $7.5 trillion is locked up in old \ninvestments; in other words, in companies that maybe are not as \nefficient as new companies, old products that could be replaced by new, \nbecause of penalties of taking your money out of one investment to put \ninto another, and the Government is standing there to grab a majority \nof it. In other words, people cannot afford to take it out of one \ninvestment because the Government is going to confiscate a large part \nof that. So those investments remain locked up. What we are saying is \ncap gains would release a flood of new investments into new jobs, new \ncompanies, new products; it would expand the economy, it would provide \nnew revenues.\n  I know my time is going to run out, but let me talk quickly about tax \ncuts.\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\nWe always hear these charges of where did the deficit go wrong, and \nthey all go back and blame it on Ronald Reagan in 1981. He said, \n``Let's have some tax relief for Americans,'' and he pushed through a \ntax relief package. During 1981 to 1990, revenues to the Federal \nGovernment nearly doubled. They increased 99.4 percent--99.4 percent--\nbut that was not enough because this Congress spent 112 percent. They \nspent far exceeding even the growth in the revenues.\n  They say, and we have seen the charts this morning, ``Let's look at \nwhere the blame is; the blame is the Reagan-Bush administrations \nbecause that is when the deficits went up, and let's give all the \ncredit to President Clinton because this is where the deficit is coming \ndown.''\n  Let's retrace that. During the Reagan-Bush administrations, who \ncontrolled the purse strings? Who was in control of Congress? I don't \nwant to throw stones, but I think everybody knows. It was controlled by \nDemocrats. Who controlled spending? Ronald Reagan suggested and was \nable to get through tax relief under the premise that for every $1 in \ntax relief, there would be a $2 reduction in spending. But once the \nrevenues came in, the eyes got big and people just could not resist \nbeing the good guy on the block and taking your money and spending it. \nIn fact, they spent it so fast they even outspent a rapidly growing \neconomy.\n\n  Who was to blame? It was not Reagan or Bush, it was the \ndemocratically controlled Congress spending the dollars.\n  Let's look at the last 4 years. They say in the last 4 years, \ndeficits have actually gone down. From 1993 to 1995, they went down \nbecause Bill Clinton got through the largest tax increase in history. \nAgain, who passed it? It was Congress who passed it, and that was \ncontrolled by the Democrats. So we did have deficit reduction but, \nagain, because of tax increases. In fact, this Congress has raised \ntaxes once on average every 22 months.\n  The last 2 years, under a Republican controlled Congress, deficits \ncontinued to go down, but because of reductions in spending.\n  Here we have a difference in philosophy. We could balance the budget \nif we take 80 percent of everything you make. We can probably balance \nthe budget and still increase spending, but it would come out of \nsomebody's pocket. I don't know, it does not seem to make sense. In a \nrecent USA/CNN poll, 70 percent of Americans said they wanted tax \nrelief, meaningful tax relief. Not this give-and-take, smoke-and-\nmirrors, a little bit here, little bit there, targeted what you believe \nas tax relief, not what they believe you should have but what you \nbelieve you should have.\n  Let's look at 5 years. The Government is going to take $8.6 trillion \nfrom you over the next 5 years, and we are asking in tax relief one \npenny on every dollar. Somehow, you are going to hear from this body \nthat we cannot live with 99 cents on the dollar, but you, as taxpayers, \nsure can give it all up. Somehow you can make the sacrifice, tighten \nyour belt, spend less on your children, education, food, clothing, \nshelter, homes, maybe a night out for pizza, but do not let Congress \ntake one penny on the dollar less than what they want to spend. By the \nway, that would not even be enough.\n  The support for taxes, I still support--let's look at DC and the \nbudget in DC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I was going to wrap this up by saying the District of \nColumbia has problems with their budget, and what has been the proposed \nsolution? Give them tax relief. I think the whole country has a serious \nproblem, taxpayers have a problem, just like what is facing Washington, \nDC, and I think they need tax relief as well.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, first, I wish to compliment and \ncongratulate my colleague from Minnesota for an outstanding statement \non really the need for tax relief. Today is tax day. Today is the day \nthat thousands of Americans will be running to the post office trying \nto make sure they get their taxes filed on time.\n  In my household, it is not a pleasant time. My wife and I have been \nmarried 28-plus years, and this is always the time where we are \nscrambling around to make sure we find all the charitable \ncontributions, make sure we get all the 1099's, make sure we get all \nthe forms together, and it is not pleasant, it is not easy, it is not \nsomething we look forward to.\n  I heard my friend and colleague from Arkansas say he does not mind \none bit the amount of money he pays in taxes. I will say, as a \ntaxpayer, I mind. I will say a lot of taxes are unfair and a lot of \ntaxes are very counterproductive to individual freedom. As a matter of \nfact, a lot of taxes actually suffocate an individual's ability to \nexpand, to grow, to work for yourself, to take care of your family.\n  I will give you a couple of examples and one of the reasons why this \nSenator favors very much balancing the budget but also, likewise, \ncutting taxes for families, particularly working families, making some \nchanges in estate taxes as outlined by my colleague, Senator Grams, and \nmaking some changes in capital gains. Let's touch on a couple of \nexamples.\n  I heard my colleague from Arkansas say, ``Well, they're cutting taxes \nfor the wealthy.'' You do not have to be very wealthy, and all of a \nsudden you are working for the Government more than you are working for \nyourself. If you are a self-employed individual and you have a company, \nmaybe you have a painting service or lawn service--I used to have a \njanitor service when I was in college--if you are self-employed, \nsingle, and you have taxable income at $25,000, most people would not \ncategorize you as rich. But according to Government sources, you must \nbe, because the Government wants half of everything you make.\n  If a person has a taxable income at $25,000, their marginal income \ntax bracket is 28 percent Federal income tax. That individual must also \npay Social Security taxes; if self-employed, he pays 15.3 percent. Add \nthat to the 28, and that is 43.3 percent, and that is before they pay \nany State income tax. In my State that is about 7 percent.\n\n  That means that person, that individual with taxable income of \n$25,000 pays 28 percent Federal income tax, 15.3 percent FICA tax, \nunemployment tax, Social Security, Medicare tax. You add the two \ntogether and get 43.3, add State income tax and, bingo, that person is \ntaxed at over 50 percent, and any additional dollar they make is going \nto Government.\n  I think that is too high. I do not think Government is entitled to \ntake over half of what they make. They are the ones creating the work. \nThey are the ones doing the job. They are the ones putting in the \nlabor, the sweat, the equity, the homework, the education necessary to \ncreate the job, create the service, and Government is coming in saying \nthey want half of it. If it is a couple and their taxable income is \n$40,000, they are in the same 50-percent tax bracket.\n  I think that is too high. I think estate taxes are high. My colleague \nsaid that is cutting taxes for the wealthy. You can have a taxable \nestate of $1 million, and Uncle Sam says they want 39 percent. Why in \nthe world, if a person accumulates a couple of restaurants, maybe two \nor three restaurants, and they happen to have an estate value of $1.6 \nmillion--we have a $600,000 exemption, so he has two or three \nrestaurants and their value is worth, say, $2 million, why should Uncle \nSam say it wants 40 percent of it? What did Uncle Sam do to generate \nthose businesses? Why should it be entitled to 40 percent?\n  Or if you have a taxable estate of $3 million, Uncle Sam wants 55 \npercent of that estate. Again, it could be a farm, ranch, machine job, \nit could be a restaurant, it could be any type of business. Why should \nthe Government come in and say, ``We want over half''? What did \nGovernment do to create those jobs, that business? I disagree. That tax \nis unfair. It needs to be changed. I think it is counterproductive. I \ndo not think it raises money.\n\n  I think when you get into marginal rates, over half of the people \nfind ways to avoid taxes. They will come up with schemes. They will \ncome up with scams. They will do different scams. They do not want the \nGovernment to\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\nget over half of what they make. They work to get it down.\n  We should change rates. When we change rates, my colleague from \nMinnesota mentioned, when we lower that tax on transactions, there are \nmore transactions, and the Government makes more money. A lot of people \nare sitting on a lot of transactions. They would like to sell this land \nfor that, and buy this land, or sell this stock and buy that stock, but \nthey do not want to if Uncle Sam says, ``We want 28 percent for that \nexchange.'' If you reduce the tax on that exchange, capital gains, you \nwill have a lot more trading, a lot more buying and selling, and \nGovernment will make money on the transactions. The Government does not \nmake money if people sit on the assets and do not trade the assets.\n  The point is, we can reduce the rates and generate more money for the \nFederal Government, and, I think, create a healthier, more stable \neconomy.\n  So, Madam President, I make this statement urging my colleagues that \nthis is the year that we can balance the budget and provide tax relief \nfor American families. It should be a done deal. President Clinton \ncampaigned for tax relief in 1992. He did not deliver. Actually he \ndelivered just the opposite. In 1993, he passed the largest tax \nincrease in history. In 1996, President Clinton campaigned for tax \nrelief. Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, campaigned for tax relief. \nBoth said they favored a $500-tax-credit per child. You would think \nthat would be a done deal. We passed that last year in the last \nCongress. President Clinton, unfortunately, vetoed it. You think it \nwould be a done deal and now it would happen. I am not so sure \neverybody on the other side is willing to do that. Hopefully the \nPresident will.\n  I want to work with the President. I want it to become law. I do not \nhave an interest in passing a tax bill just to have it vetoed. I want \nto pass a tax relief package this year that includes relief for \nAmerican working families, that includes a reduction in capital gains, \nthat includes estate tax relief, that includes incentives to save, \nIRAs, saving for retirement and education, I want to pass that and have \nit become law.\n  We look forward to working with the President and other Members in \nthis body to pass a bipartisan package that can actually reduce \ntaxpayers' taxes this year.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3193-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        GENERAL RENO'S ACTIONS UNDER THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, Attorney General Janet Reno's refusal \nto appoint an independent counsel to investigate the Clinton \nadministration's highly questionable fundraising activities is based \nupon a shocking misinterpretation of the history, purpose, and \nrequirements of the independent counsel law.\n  Ms. Reno states that the act ``does not permit'' invoking the \nindependent counsel provisions unless there is ``specific and credible \nevidence that a crime may have been committed by'' a person covered by \nthe law. In fact, the law requires that it be invoked whenever there is \n``information sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate'' whether \nany person covered by the law may have violated Federal law. In short, \neven though General Reno acknowledges that there are ``sufficient \ngrounds to investigate,'' and even though that investigation is ongoing \nas I speak, she insists on controlling the investigation herself.\n  There remains no conceivable room for doubt that the Clinton \nadministration, the Clinton-Gore campaign, and the Democratic National \nCommittee engaged in fundraising practices that must be investigated. \nVirtually every editorial page in the Nation, from the Wall Street \nJournal to the New York Times, have demanded an investigation. Indeed, \neven the highest officials at the DNC have acknowledged that their \npractices were questionable and have agreed to return over $3 million \nin contributions from foreign nationals, persons who gave contributions \nin the names of others, and contributions that may have come from \nforeign governments. And serious questions exist as to the use of \nGovernment property to solicit contributions and reward contributors.\n  The Vice President has admitted that he made numerous telephone calls \nfrom his official office using a Clinton-Gore campaign card to raise \nfunds for the purpose of furthering the Clinton-Gore reelection \ncampaign. Several of the recipients of those calls said that they felt \npressured to contribute because they had ongoing business with the \nGovernment. Other telephone call recipients perceived these calls as \nconstituting a shakedown. When a charge was recently aired that a \nprominent Member of Congress had pressured a potential contributor, a \nFederal grand jury investigation was launched within days of the \nallegation. Shouldn't the Vice President, or the President, who had \npointedly not denied making fundraising calls from his office, be \ninvestigated as well?\n  The purpose of the independent counsel law is to entrust the \ninvestigation of these matters to someone who is not a subordinate of \nthe official or officials being investigated. Yet General Reno refuses \nto invoke the independent counsel law until she is satisfied that laws \nhave, in fact, been broken. That decision is not hers to make. That \ninterpretation stands the law on its head.\n  It is impossible to defend the proposition, as the Attorney General \nattempts to do, that covered persons are not implicated in the \ninvestigation that she is presently conducting and which should be \nconducted by an independent person. Documents released by the White \nHouse prove conclusively that the fundraising by the President's \nreelection campaign and by the DNC was run, on a day-to-day, hands-on \nbasis by the President, himself, and his direct subordinate, Deputy \nChief of Staff Harold Ickes. The DNC took orders directly from the \nPresident through Mr. Ickes. And the President and the Vice President \nand the First Lady were directly and substantially involved in all \nfundraising activities by the Clinton-Gore campaign and by the DNC, \nwhich was raising not soft money, but money that was raised for the \npurpose and used directly to fuel the President's reelection drive.\n  The Attorney General seems to feel that some of the laws implicated \nby these practices may not or should not be prosecuted. But that \nprosecutorial decision must not be made by someone who owes her \nposition in Government to the official who may have possibly violated \nthose laws. It does not answer this concern for the Attorney General to \nstate that she is relying on career officials in the Department of \nJustice. As long as they are reporting to her, they are reporting to \nthe President. She may not independently investigate the conduct of \nPresident Clinton any more than Attorney General Mitchell could \ninvestigate President Nixon or Attorney General Meese could investigate \nPresident Reagan.\n  I am not prejudging the results of the investigation which must be \nconducted into these matters. But I know that the practices that must \nbe investigated may have violated Federal criminal laws, and that those \nviolations may have been encouraged, inspired, directed, or condoned by \nthe President or his immediate subordinates. The people of the United \nStates are entitled to a prompt, full, fair, and independent \ninvestigation of these matters, and that investigation cannot be \ncontrolled by a person who serves at the pleasure of the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3195-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3195-S3196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TAX RELIEF, TAX REFORM, AND IRS REFORM\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

I read recently that \nsubjects in some of\n\n[[Page S3196]]\n\nthe outer provinces of the Roman Empire stirred up civil unrest when \nRoman plus local taxation reached an estimated 25 percent of their \nincome.\n  Today, the typical American family of four pays 38 percent of its \nincome in taxes at all levels--working 3 hours of every 8-hour day just \nto pay taxes.\n  Tax-and-spend liberals don't like it when taxpayers are reminded that \nit is the taxpayer's money--not the Government's --that is taken in \ntaxes.\n  I continue to support reasonable, fair tax relief that is pro-family \nand pro-economic growth.\n  Among other efforts, today, I am joining again as an original \ncosponsor, with Senator Ashcroft, of the Working Americans Wage \nRestoration Act.\n  American wage-earners are double taxed. They pay Social Security \ntaxes and income taxes twice on the same wages. The least they deserve \nto an above-the-line deduction against their income taxes for the taxes \nthey pay into Social Security.\n  Too often within government, common sense is the least common kind of \nsense.\n  The Ashcroft-Craig bill would be one important step in the right \ndirection.\n  American workers and their families need tax relief as soon as we can \nenact it. They are also clamoring for fundamental tax reform.\n  Compliance with the current Federal income tax system costs 5.4 \nbillion hours a year and $200 billion--$700 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America.\n  The IRS publishes 480 different tax forms, and another 280 forms to \nexplain the first 480 forms.\n  If laid end-to-end, the 8 billion pages of instructions sent out by \nthe IRS every year would circle the Earth 28 times.\n  The Internal Revenue Code is too complex, produces arbitrary results, \nand is far too involved in social engineering.\n  It is costing the Government the trust and confidence of the American \npeople.\n  That's why Senator Shelby and I will reintroduce the Freedom and \nFairness Restoration Act--the flat tax bill--in the coming weeks.\n  Our bill would create a single, flat, tax rate of 17 percent. \nFamilies of modest and middle-class means would be protected--by a \npersonal exemption amounting to $33,800 for a family of four.\n  A fair, flat tax system would reward work, promote savings and \neconomic growth, and increase willing compliance with the law. As much \nas Americans distrust the tax laws, they fear the tax collector who \nenforces them.\n  Small wonder: Drug dealers, child molesters, and organized crime hit \nmen have more legal rights than an average taxpayer whom the IRS \nsuspects of underpaying his or her taxes.\n  Blatant disregard for individuals' rights has all been in pursuit of \none goal: Get the money.\n  An ever-growing Federal Government, with its voracious appetite for \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars, has led Congresses dominated for \ndecades by tax-and-spend liberals to expand the powers of the Internal \nRevenue Service and allow the agency to ignore the due process of law \nprotections to which American citizens otherwise have been entitled.\n  Americans expect to enjoy due process of the law as one of their \nfundamental rights. But that's not the case when you're dealing with \nthe IRS.\n  Most of the time, if a criminal suspect is not publicly attracting \nthe attention of a law enforcement officer, no one from the \ngovernment--from the FBI to the local sheriff--can search their home or \nseize their property without a warrant from an impartial court, based \nupon a showing of probable cause.\n  But if the IRS thinks someone has underpaid their taxes, it can seize \ncars and freeze bank accounts on its own authority--without obtaining \nany kind of impartial, prior approval.\n  It can consider the taxpayer guilty until proven innocent. It can \nimpose costly penalties until the taxpayer--sometimes after years of \ncourt proceedings--conclusively proves they did nothing wrong.\n  So-called ``horror stories'' about the IRS are multiplying. Sometimes \nthe problem is brought on by a Tax Code that is too complicated even \nfor the IRS to understand. Sometimes the problem is with IRS agents who \nact outside the law. And sometimes, it happens when IRS officials push \nto the limit the legal powers they've been granted by past Congresses \nand Presidents. In any case, there's never an excuse for such behavior.\n  Congress is now investigating these incidents. We are working to make \nthe IRS more accountable and the process fairer.\n  One of these efforts will take a major step closer to becoming law \ntoday--S. 522, the ``anti-snooping'' bill introduced by Senator \nCoverdell. I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  This bill will clamp down on rogue IRS agents and put a stop to the \nunauthorized inspection of taxpayers' information. Years into the age \nof the computer, this is overdue. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n  Congress never should have granted powers to the IRS that allow it--\nthat, in fact, have encouraged it--to trample the due process rights \nthat all Americans should enjoy.\n  Criminal activity by individual, rogue IRS agents should not be \nhidden behind a shield of sovereign immunity.\n  We will pass the anti-snooping bill today. It is one small part of a \nlarger reform package that still needs to be passed.\n  Many of the other needed reforms are included in another of Senator \nCoverdell's bills, S. 365, the IRS Accountability Act. I am also proud \nto be a cosponsor of that bill, as well.\n  No people can remain free, or their government effective, if they do \nnot display trust and confidence in each other.\n  Yet America's tax system increasingly eats like a corrosive acid at \nthese very bonds of support and legitimacy.\n  I am committed to the three-step program necessary to restore \nfairness to the tax system and trust to the people:\n  Pro-family, pro-growth tax relief; a simpler, fairer, flatter Tax \nCode; and reform for the tax collector, increasing accountability and \nrequiring the IRS to treat the taxpayer with dignity, respect, and due \nprocess of the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3195-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                STUDY ON TAX CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As tax day is here, it is worth considering the \ncontributions of legal immigrants to Uncle Sam.\n  A new study by the Library of Congress highlights the extraordinary \nlevel of Federal taxes paid by legal immigrants. Recent immigrants--\nincluding both those who have not yet naturalized and those who have \nbecome citizens--paid an estimated $55 billion in Federal income taxes \nin 1995. Without immigration, the Government would have had $55 billion \nless to pay for key services or deficit reduction.\n  We have long known of the major contributions of immigrants in \ndeveloping innovative technologies, creating jobs for American workers, \nvitalizing our inner cities, serving in our Armed Forces, and in many \nother ways. But this report also shows that immigrants pay their way in \nFederal taxes.\n  The $55 billion that recent immigrants contributed is almost three \ntimes what the Federal Government will spend this year on law \nenforcement to deal with crime. It is twice what the Federal Government \nwill invest in education. It is nine times the budget of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  Often in recent years, Congress has been too quick to engage in \nimmigrant-bashing, or too slow to recognize the immense contributions \nof immigrants to the Nation's heritage and history. Studies like this \nhelp to redress the balance, by demonstrating the continuing important \nrole of immigration in our modern society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3196-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3196-S3197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I have introduced legislation to make a \ntechnical correction to the provision of the Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which provided a limited exception \nto the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, allowing U.S. courts to hear \nclaims by American victims of foreign terrorism against the lawless \ngovernments that sponsored the terrorist act. I am pleased to be joined \nby Senator Mack, Senator Kennedy, Senator D'Amato, and Senator Moynihan \nin introducing this bill.\n  Nearly a year ago, when we passed the landmark Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act, Congress took the important step of \nensuring that Americans who are harmed by foreign governments \ncommitting or directing terrorists acts can sue those governments in \nAmerican courts. Congress did this by amending the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunity Act, which generally bars claims against foreign governments, \nto provide that the FSIA does not preempt claims for personal injury or \ndeath by the victims and survivors of terrorist acts committed by \ncertified terrorist states. Thus, lawless nations no longer are able to \nhide their terrorist acts behind the rules of international law that \nthey otherwise flaunt.\n  It has come to our attention, however, that a particular phrase in \nthis law puts at risk, for a small class of intended claimants, the \nright to be heard in court.\n  As enacted, the law provides that a claim must be dismissed if ``the \nclaimant or the victim was not a national of the United States'' when \nthe terrorist act occurred. There is substantial concern that this \nphrase may be interpreted by the courts to require that both the victim \nand the claimant be U.S. nationals. As a result, several American \nclaimants against Libya for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 could be \nbarred from bringing an action because their spouses, who were killed \nin the attack, were British subjects.\n  Notably, the amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act was not \nintended by Congress to preclude its application in such circumstances. \nRather, all that was intended was that either the victim or the \nclaimant be U.S. a national in order for foreign sovereign immunity not \nto apply, permitting a claim to go forward.\n  The legislation we are introducing today corrects this ambiguity, by \namending the law to apply foreign sovereign immunity, and thus bar the \nclaim if ``neither the claimant nor the victim was a national of the \nUnited States.'' It is only right that we should do this.\n  Companion legislation, H.R. 1225, has been introduced in the other \nbody by Representatives Hyde and Conyers, the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. It is my hope that \nmy colleagues will join us in a bipartisan effort to pass this \nlegislation quickly.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 568\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     effective with respect to any cause of action arising, \n     before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     section 1605(a)(7)(B)(ii) of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``the claimant or victim was not'' and \n     inserting ``neither the claimant nor the victim was''.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill offered by \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee that will correct a drafting \nerror in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, \nthereby removing an impediment that would have restricted U.S. victims \nor their U.S. survivors to sue a country, designated by the Department \nof State, that sponsored the terrorist act which caused the death.\n  The Antiterrorism Act contained provisions that limited the \njurisdictional immunities of foreign states, particularly those \ncountries that sponsored acts of terrorism. It was intended that a \nvictim of terrorism who is an American national, or their American \nsurvivors, would not be barred from filing a claim against a country \nthat sponsored the terrorist act. Unfortunately, as drafted, it was not \nclear that Congress intended this right of action to be available to \nvictims who are American as well as survivors who are American, even if \nthe victim who perished was not a U.S. citizen.\n  Countries, designated by the Department of State, that sponsor \nterrorism should be subject to civil suits by the victim or their \nsurviving families. This right of action should be available whether \nthe victim was American or the survivor was American.\n  This clarification should allow for the suit of an American citizen \nwhose spouse perished in the destruction of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, \nScotland, in December 1988.\n  I thank my colleague for taking up this issue and urge immediate \npassage so that justice can be achieved for several of the families of \nPan Am 103, and all future victims of state-sponsored terrorism.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3197-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3197-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO DUTY-FREE TREATMENT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM \n                                   29\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program offers duty-free \ntreatment to specified products that are imported from designated \ndeveloping countries.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nincome tax deduction for student loan interest payments; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n            the loan interest forgiveness for education act\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and my colleague \nfrom Montana, Senator Conrad Burns, in introducing S. 573, the Loan \nInterest Forgiveness for Education Act, the LIFE Act. One of the major \nforces driving this bill is our growing concern that parents and \nstudents in this country have access to a quality education without \namassing enormous student loan bills.\n  The cost of college has a direct impact on access to college. The \nmore tuition goes up, the more students will be\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\npriced out of their opportunity for the American dream. Our country \nwill suffer the loss of talent and training. We cannot as a nation \nprepare for the 21st century by making it more difficult for our \nchildren to access higher education.\n  This Congress is working hard to eliminate the Federal deficit. In \npart, this is because we know that piling on more debt ultimately \nundermines the ability of the generations that follow us to achieve the \nAmerican dream, and to do what we have done--live better than our \nparents. Mr. President, that is why we are introducing this LIFE bill. \nIt will do two things: encourage individuals to go to college, and \nreduce the cost of a college education. I believe very strongly, Mr. \nPresident, that the way to achieve this dream is to ensure that \neveryone who is in need of financial assistance to attend an \ninstitution of higher learning has that opportunity. They should have \nthe opportunity, as we did, to pursue their dreams.\n  It is absolutely essential that we continue to invest in our most \nimportant asset--our children. That is what the Loan Interest \nForgiveness for Education Act is all about. The bill will create a \ndeduction for qualified student loan interest including expenses for \ninterest paid on student loans used to pay postsecondary education \nexpenses such as tuition, books, room and board. This bill is similar \nto provisions contained in both the Republican and Democratic \nleadership education bills, S. 1 and S. 12, and is also similar to a \nprovision passed by Congress as part of the 1995 Budget Reconciliation \nAct.\n  As you may know, President Clinton has proposed a bill to allow a \n$1,500 tax credit per year for the first 2 years of college or a \n$10,000 deduction per person per year for qualified college tuition \nexpense. I am glad to see President Clinton focus on investing in \neducation for the middle class because it is truly our only hope of \nremaining competitive in this global marketplace. However, I believe we \nshould go even further by investing in those working parents too, who \nwould otherwise not be able to send their children to college without \nloans.\n\n  The median income for a family of four as reported by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation in 1995 was $49,531. If that household income was \ncomprised entirely of wage or salary income and, if that household \nfiled a joint return claiming the standard deduction and four personal \nexemptions, the household's income tax liability would have been $4,947 \nand a total payroll tax liability of $7,578 resulting in a total tax \nliability of $12,525. When considering the tax liability and the \nlimited income of the median household family, a large number of \nAmerican families will not have the extra income to save $80,000 for \ntwo children to go to college.\n  This legislation will focus on those that do not have parents who can \nafford to save for college. Those working parents who can barely afford \nto make ends meet; parents who provide the basics of life such as food, \nclothing, shelter, and medical insurance for their children but do not \nmake the extra income to save for college. Even if families could \nafford to save the money to pay for their children's college education, \nincome tax liability of many families is not high enough to benefit \nfrom the President's proposal because neither the $10,000 tax deduction \nnor $1,500 tax credit is refundable.\n  Students whose parents are unable to pay for college up front are \ngenerally the ones who rely more heavily on student loans to pay for \ncollege and should be given the same type of tax relief as those that \ncome from families that can afford to finance the costs of a college \neducation from savings. That is why the Loan Interest Forgiveness for \nEducation Act, or the LIFE Act, helps not only to improve the life of \nstudents who might not otherwise have the opportunity to attend \ncollege, it also helps to improve their life after graduation. These \nstudents generally have an enormous burden of debt and the interest \ncosts impair their ability to get started in life after college. New \ncollege graduates just beginning their careers all too often have to \npay a higher percentage of their income in educational loan bills than \nthey do in rent.\n  I believe we should encourage individuals who cannot afford to pay \nfor college to realize that education is a wise investment in their \nfuture. Although some individuals must incur substantial debt to \ncomplete their education, the Government should do their part to make \nsure that these students will not suffer because of this decision for \nthe next 20 years of their lives.\n  The Government uses the Tax Code to help American families buy their \nown homes. It is equally important to use the Tax Code to encourage \nhigher education. It is an investment in our children, our economy and \nour future. If a child receives a college education, that person is \nmuch more likely to be able to afford to purchase a home. The link \nbetween educational attainment and earnings is unquestionable. \nStatistics show that the average earnings of the most educated \nAmericans are 600 percent greater than that of the least educated \nAmericans. The Department of Labor estimates that, by the year 2000, \nmore than half of all new jobs will require an education beyond high \nschool. As we move nearer to the 21st century and into an information-\ndriven economy, the gap between high school and college graduates is \ngrowing. A college graduate in 1980 earned 43 percent more per hour \nthan a high school graduate. By 1994, that had increased to 73 percent. \nWhen we reduce access to higher education, we reduce access to the \nAmerican Dream.\n  Given the fact that many of the people in the young generation are \ngoing to be pushed into the ocean of responsibility to pay off our \nnational debt, and pay higher Social Security taxes to support us, the \nleast that we could do, Mr. President, is to provide them with a life-\npreserver. It is the ethical thing to do and the right thing to do. \nThis life-preserver that I speak of, Mr. President, is education. By \nsupporting this educational initiative we are affording members of this \nyoung generation and others a chance to arm themselves with knowledge \nas well as enhance their income potential. This is very important \nbecause most economist agree that education produces substantial \nspillover, which simply means indirect effects, that will benefit \nsociety in general. Examples cited of such positive spillover effects \ninclude a more efficient work force, lower unemployment rates, lower \nwelfare costs, and less crime. All of these are issues that concern us \ngreatly. Furthermore, an educated electorate is said to foster a more \nresponsive and effective government. So as you can see this bill is \nvery timely.\n  This bill comes at a time when the cost of attending an institution \nof higher learning has increased at a rate higher than inflation. In \nthe 1980's, for example, the cost of a year's tuition at a publicly \nsupported college increased from $635 to $1,454, an increase of almost \n130 percent. And a year's tuition at a private college increased from \nan average of $3,498 to $8,772, an increase of 150 percent. A more \nrecent figure can be found in the state of Illinois where, as of 1994, \nstudents at Northern Illinois University and Illinois State University, \nboth public institutions, were paying nearly 96 percent more than the \nincrease in the inflationary rate for that same year. The number of \nloans borrowed through the main Federal college loan programs rose by \nnearly 50 percent since 1990, from 4,493,000 in 1990 to 6,672,000 in \n1995. Rapid increases in college tuition force today's students to \nborrow much more than their predecessors did, yet in 1986, the interest \ndeduction for student loans was eliminated.\n  I am working with the GAO, [Government Accounting Office] to further \ninvestigate why college tuition is rising so rapidly, and what the \nFederal Government can most appropriately do about this problem. One of \nthe arguments against providing up front tax cuts to parents for the \ncosts of education is that tuition costs will increase to take into \naccount the tax benefit given to parents. However, the Loan Interest \nForgiveness for Education Act will not increase the cost of tuition \nbecause the benefit will be received after individuals have graduated. \nThis bill will improve the life of college graduates while at the same \ntime encouraging them to pay back their student loans.\n  We must improve the accessibility of education, so that all Americans \nmay receive a higher education, not just the wealthy elite.\n  It is a critical matter in terms of the opportunities than this \ngeneration of\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\nAmericans will have to access and maintain the American dream. The fact \nthat Americans depend on people being able to make a living and support \nthemselves, and to reach as high as their talents will take them, \nshould not be hampered in any way by the limitation of availability of \neducational opportunity because of costs.\n  I know that I would not be in the Senate today were it not for \nquality public education and the accessibility of affordable higher \neducation. The Chicago Public Schools gave me a solid foundation, and I \nwas able to attend the University of Illinois and the University of \nChicago in spite of the fact of that my parents were working-class \npeople. I am committed to seeing that the students of this generation \nand those who follow them have even greater opportunities than I have \nhad. I am absolutely determined to ensure that the exploding cost of \ncollege does not close the door to opportunity for them. Our generation \nhas an absolute duty to keep the door open, and to preserve and enhance \nthe opportunity for a better life and the American dream for the 21st \ncentury.\n  Certainly this generation should not have to bear a burdensome loan \nportfolio when they graduate that keeps them from making other optimal \neconomic choices.\n  So, Mr. President, I introduce this legislation. I send it to the \ndesk, and I encourage my colleagues to consider cosponsorship of it. I \nhope that by tax day next year we are able to provide those students \nwho are going to college and have taken on loans the opportunity to \nhave some loan forgiveness once they graduate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 574. A bill to delay the application of the substantiation \nrequirements to reimbursement arrangements of certain loggers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                    TAX RELIEF FOR MICHIGAN LOGGERS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, April 15 is a day that generally is \nviewed with consternation throughout the Unided States. For many \nloggers in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, however, tax day is synonymous \nwith bankruptcy. This is because the IRS insists on enforcing a little \nknown, and less understood, tax law affecting loggers in my State.\n  For nearly three decades, businesses in the timber industry have used \nan accounting plan that allocated a percentage of loggers' wages as \nrental for the use of the loggers' chain saws, thereby excluding this \nportion of their wages from income tax withholding, FICA, and FUTA \ntaxes. This practice was acceptable to the IRS until the Family Support \nAct of 1988 required that an employee business expense reimbursement \nnot be excluded from an employee's income unless it is paid under an \naccountable plan. The timber industry's traditional accounting \nprocedure was not an accountable plan.\n  Unaware of the change in policy, the timber industry continued to use \ntheir old accounting plan in violation of the new law. Many small \nlogging operations and loggers have now been assessed penalties and \ninterest by the IRS because of their violation of this obscure law. It \nshould be noted that most of the timber industry was in line with the \nnew policy by tax year 1993 and continues to abide by the correct \naccounting procedure policies. Nonetheless, some loggers face fines of \n$20,000 or more. Mr. President, many loggers in Michigan's Upper \nPeninsula earn less than $20,000 per year.\n  To add to the frustration, IRS headquarters has stated that each \ndistrict operation has the authority to decide the effective date of \nthe requirement for accountable plans, and in other States, the IRS has \ndecided to have an effective date for this accounting procedure as it \nrelates to the timber industry of January 1, 1993. The IRS office in \nMichigan, however, will not agree to the January 1, 1993 date which is \nbeing used in other parts of the country. Michigan is the only State in \nwhich the IRS will not accept this date.\n  Mr. President, relief for these loggers is long overdue, and today \nSenator Levin joins with me to introduce legislation that will change \nthe Tax Code and make permissible the qualified logger reimbursement \narrangement for loggers in any taxable year prior to January 1, 1993. \nIt will also provide for a refund or credit of any overpayment of tax \naccrued during these years. This correction is long overdue and I hope \nfor swift adoption during this session of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Allard, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Shelby, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Mack, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 575. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe deduction for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         The Health Insurance Tax Equity For Self-Employed Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will use just 2 or 3 minutes and defer \nto my colleague. I want to say I am glad he is with me today. It is one \nof our first bills as new Members of the U.S. Senate and one that is \nvery important, not only to our States but also to the Nation. I think \nit is extremely fitting that Senator Hagel and 14 of our colleagues \nhave joined me in introducing a bipartisan bill to provide tax relief \nfor a group of hard-working Americans, namely the self-employed. What \nwe are trying to do with this bill, and I think it is appropriate to \ndiscuss it on April 15, is to say that people who are self-employed, \nsmall business people, farmers and the like, should enjoy the same tax \nbenefits of deduction for health insurance premiums as corporations. \nThis is only simple fairness.\n  If I work for a big company, they can literally write off every penny \nof the cost of my health insurance that they pay. However, if I happen \nto be a farmer in central Illinois, or a self-employed woman in Chicago \nworking at home at a computer, and I go to buy health insurance, only \n40 percent of the premiums could be deducted. That is unfair and it \ncreates a real disadvantage. We should encourage people to take out \nhealth insurance. The best way to encourage them to do it is to make it \nmore affordable by providing full deductibility. In my State of \nIllinois there are over 400,000 people who are self-employed who would \nbenefit from this tax relief. In fact, over 3 million Americans who are \nself-employed do not have health insurance. That represents 25 percent \nof the self-employed. That is a high percentage compared to other \ngroups.\n  So, what Senator Hagel and I are trying to do with our legislation is \nto level the playing field, give them all equal treatment and fair \ntreatment. I think this tax relief could be worth $500 or $1,000 for \nsomebody today who could deduct only 40 percent, but in the future \ncould deduct 100 percent under our legislation.\n  I thank my colleague for joining me in introducing this bill. It is \nsupported not only by the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the National Farm Bureau, the Pork Producers, the Corn \nGrowers and the Farmers Union, but also by the National Association of \nWomen Business Owners. Between 1987 and 1996 the number of women-owned \nbusinesses increased by 78 percent, and about 80 percent of these are \nindividual proprietorships.\n  I think this is an issue whose time has come. I have spoken to many \nof my colleagues and they believe that is the case, too. I hope we can \nwork as part of any budget agreement to include this provision.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Insurance Tax Equity \n     for Self-Employed Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEDUCTION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS OF SELF-EMPLOYED \n                   INDIVIDUALS INCREASED.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 162(l)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to special rules for health insurance \n     costs of self-employed individuals) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) Allowance of deduction.--In the case of an individual \n     who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), \n     there shall be allowed as a deduction under this section\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n     an amount equal to the amount paid during the taxable year \n     for insurance which constitutes medical care for the \n     taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, and dependents.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to introduce legislation that \nwill cut taxes and improve access to health insurance for millions of \nsmall business owners and farmers across America.\n  Our legislation--the Health Insurance Tax Equity for Self-Employed \nAct--is a bill about fairness. Under current law, corporations can \ndeduct from their income tax the full amount of money spent on health \ncare for their employees. But the 10\\1/2\\ million self-employed men and \nwomen in America cannot fully deduct what they spend on their own \nhealth care. They can deduct a percentage--which is now 40 percent and \nwill increase to 80 percent by 2006--but they cannot deduct the entire \ncost.\n  Our bill would immediately eliminate this disadvantage--effective \nJanuary 1, 1997--and put the self-employed on the same footing with \ntheir incorporated competitors. And it would make health insurance more \naffordable for the 3 million uninsured Americans who are self-employed.\n  This bill will make a real difference to real people. The high cost \nof health insurance was the No. 1 problem that small businesses cited \nin a recent comprehensive study by the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses [NFIB]. Small business owners often pay 30 \npercent more for the cost of their health insurance than do larger \ncompanies--they pay more, but they can deduct less.\n  Our bill will make health insurance more affordable for small \nbusiness owners. That is why it has been endorsed by the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses.\n  It also is strongly supported by the National Farm Bureau and by the \nNebraska Farm Bureau Federation. Both have sent me letters endorsing \nthis legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of these \nbe submitted for the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 7.)\n  Mr. HAGEL. More than 95 percent of farmers and ranchers are self-\nemployed and generally pay the full cost of their insurance coverage \nthemselves. Our bill makes a real difference to them as well.\n  I am involved in this issue because it is vitally important to my \nhome State of Nebraska. There are 98,000 self-employed people in \nNebraska, of whom more than 10,000 are uninsured. These are real \nnumbers. These are real people. This legislation can make a real \ndifference for them--making their health insurance more affordable and \ntheir businesses more profitable.\n  Every State in America has hardworking, self-employed men and women \nwho need the tax relief and health care assistance this bill offers. I \nhope my colleagues will support this important effort.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                              Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                      Lincoln, NE, April 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chuck: On behalf of Nebraska's largest farm \n     organization, I am writing to offer Nebraska Farm Bureau \n     Federation's strong support for your legislation that would \n     provide a 100 percent tax deduction of health insurance \n     premiums for the self-employed.\n       Deductibility of health insurance premium costs for self-\n     employed individuals has been a long standing goal of Farm \n     Bureau. More than 95 percent of farmers and ranchers are \n     self-employed and generally pay the full cost of their \n     insurance coverage themselves. In addition, many farm \n     families are forced into a situation where a spouse must get \n     an off-farm job primarily to obtain more affordable health \n     insurance coverage for their family.\n       The cost of self-employed health insurance, when not \n     purchased as part of a group, can be significant and cause \n     financial hardships for some individuals and farm families. \n     In many cases, farmers and ranchers pay more than $3,000 to \n     $5,000 annually for health insurance. Farmers and ranchers \n     are looking at many avenues to cut skyrocketing health \n     insurance premiums. More farmers have moved to higher \n     deductible policies--quite often in the $2,500 to $5,000 \n     range. In other cases, farmers are opting to go without \n     health insurance altogether.\n       As you know, current federal tax law allows self-employed \n     people to deduct 30 percent of the cost of their health \n     insurance premiums. That will increase to 80 percent by the \n     year 2006. Current federal tax law also allows corporations \n     to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premium \n     costs. Members of Nebraska Farm Bureau believe that fairness \n     and equity dictate that Nebraska's self-employed individuals \n     receive the same tax treatment as other employees and \n     employers.\n       Nebraska Farm Bureau appreciates your work on the \n     introduction of this legislation and we wholeheartedly offer \n     our support to this effort.\n           Respectively,\n     Bryce P. Neidig, President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                  National Federation of Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hagel: On behalf of the 600,000 small business \n     owners of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I am writing to express our strong support of your \n     legislation to extend the deduction of health insurance \n     premiums for the self-employed to 100 percent, effective \n     immediately upon date of enactment.\n       Current law's tax treatment of the health insurance \n     premiums for the self-employed is extremely unfair. The three \n     million self-employed Americans who are presently uninsured \n     should have access to the same 100 percent deduction that \n     CEO's and employees in Fortune 500 companies receive. The \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n     gave the self-employed the ability to take a 40-percent \n     deduction in 1997 and gradually phases in a permanent \n     deduction for the self-employed reaching 80 percent in 2006. \n     Enabling the self-employed to take an 100 percent deduction \n     would certainly help us to make health care more affordable \n     for this important group of employers and their employees.\n       The cost of health insurance is the number one problem that \n     small businesses cited in a 1996 NFIB Education Foundation \n     study. Small Business Problems and Priorities, the most \n     comprehensive study of its kind in the country. Small \n     business owners often pay 30 percent more for the cost of \n     their health insurance than larger companies. In addition, \n     self-employed business owners face the cost that result from \n     having to pay income taxes on the majority of the amount of \n     their health insurance premiums. Instead of penalizing the \n     self-employed in this manner, Congress should be doing all it \n     can to help the self-employed, a group who plays a critical \n     role in our economy.\n       NFIB appreciates your understanding of this issue and your \n     willingness to introduce this significant piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n                     Vice President, Federal Governmental Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 576. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat corporate tax benefits from stock option compensation expenses are \nallowed only to the extent such expenses are included in corporate \naccounts; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           THE ENDING DOUBLE STANDARDS FOR STOCK OPTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the past several years, the Wall Street \nJournal has published a special pullout section of the newspaper with a \nnumber of articles on executive pay. Last year's headline read, ``The \nGreat Divide: CEO Pay Keeps Soaring Leaving Everybody Else Further and \nFurther Behind.'' Last week, Business Week magazine featured this cover \nstory on its 47th annual pay survey: ``Executive Pay: It's Out of \nControl.''\n  Both publications analyze the pay of top executives at approximately \n350 U.S. major corporations. Their analysis shows that the pay of the \nchief executive officers continues to outpace inflation, other workers' \npay, the pay of CEO's in other countries, and company profits.\n  According to Business Week, for CEO's of the leading 350 companies \nstudied, their average total compensation rose 54 percent last year to \nabout $5.7 million, which came on top of 1995 CEO pay increases of 30 \npercent. So in 1995 we had the CEO's increasing their pay by 30 \npercent, last year increases of 54 percent. Blue-collar employees \nreceived a 3 percent raise in 1996, and white-collar workers fared only \nslightly better with a 3.2 percent raise.\n  So in 1996 the pay of the top executives was 209 times the pay of the \nfactory employee, which is a huge increase. The ratio of executive pay \nto factory workers' pay in the United States was already two to three \ntimes more than the pay ratio in any other country. Suddenly, now we \nsee this going up to a ratio of 209 times the pay of the average \nfactory worker. The last time we had statistics, the ratio of executive \npay to factory worker pay was 20 times in Japan and 25 times in \nGermany. Those statistics are a few years\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\nold but we do not think they have changed that much.\n  These statistics, the 3.2 percent pay increase that went to the white \ncollar workers and the 3 percent increase in wages and benefits that \nwent to America's blue collar workers, represent a growing problem in \nAmerica, and represent a gap that is growing. The question is now what? \nIs this gap going to continue? That is a question more for the market \nthan for government.\n  There is something that government is currently doing that can change \nthis, and that is right now we permit stock options, which represent \nthe biggest portion of corporate pay, to be taken as a tax deduction \nfor income tax purposes, although it is not shown as an expense on the \ncompany's books. There is no other form of executive compensation for \nwhich this is true. Every other form of executive compensation, of \ncompensation for anybody, is shown as an expense on the company's books \nwhen it is taken as a deduction on income tax.\n  There is no double standard for any form of compensation in our \ncountry, in our Tax Code, except for stock options. If a corporate \nexecutive gets stock, that is an expense on the company's books. It is \na tax deduction on their income taxes. If there is a bonus based on \nperformance, that is an expense on the company's books, and it is a tax \ndeduction. But when it comes to stock options, the Tax Code right now \npermits there to be a tax deduction for the company when that stock \noption is exercised. However, the company does not show that stock \noption as an expense on its own books. It is a stealth exception. It is \na double standard. We should end it.\n  That is why, today, Senator McCain and I are introducing legislation \nto end this corporate tax loophole that is fueling the increases in \nexecutive pay and is fueling those increases with taxpayer dollars. \nAgain, this loophole allows companies to deduct from their income taxes \nthese multimillion dollar pay expenses that never show up on the \ncompany office books as an expense.\n  A just completed survey of CEO pay at 55 major Fortune 500 \ncorporations by a leading executive compensation publication called \nExecutive Compensation Reports, found that in 1996 stock options \naveraged about 45 percent of total executive pay. That is up from 40 \npercent just 1 year ago, and stock options provided more money to the \n55 CEO's studied than their base salary or their annual bonus. In fact, \nfor 1996, salary accounted for only 22 percent of CEO compensation \nwhile stock options accounted for 45 percent.\n\n  These stock options enable a CEO typically to buy company shares at a \nset price for a period of time, which is usually 10 years. Since stock \nprices generally rise over time, stock options have become the most \nlucrative source of executive pay.\n  Now, again, I do not think anyone is suggesting government ought to \ndetermine how much executives get paid. We should not. Stockholders and \nboards of directors should set that. But we should determine whether or \nnot we want to allow our Tax Code to contain this loophole any longer, \nwhere this one form of executive compensation and only this form of \ncompensation is dealt with by a double standard. We permit the company \nto get the tax deduction when it comes to filing their income tax \nreturn, but we do not require the company to show that same expense as \nan expense on their books, thereby hiding the cost to the company of \nthe stock option cost but still getting a tax deduction.\n  Now, say, a corporate executive exercises stock options to purchase \ncompany stock and makes a profit of $10 million. The company can claim \nthe full $10 million as a business expense and deduct it from the \ncompany's tax bill. But when it comes to showing that expense on their \nbooks, on their annual report, it is not an expense. It is a footnote, \nnot required to be shown as an expense like other forms of \ncompensation, but rather hidden in a footnote.\n  This is not an accounting issue. The accounting authorities, the \nexperts, have decided how this should be handled as an accounting \nmatter. This is now a tax loophole issue. The question is whether or \nnot we, on tax day, want to continue a loophole for executives--because \nthat is who we are talking about in approximately 98 percent of the \ncases. In perhaps 1 or 2 percent of the cases these stock option plans \nare broadly based and help average employees, and we would not include \nthat in our bill. But in maybe 98 percent of the cases, these are \nnarrowly based stock option plans only going to the top officials of \ncompanies.\n  This bill would end the double standard. It gives a choice. If you \nwant to take it as an expense for tax purposes, deduct this as \ncompensation for tax purposes, that is fine, no restriction. But then \nyou have to show it on your books as an expense also. You do not want \nto show it on your books as an expense? That is your choice, but then \nwe will not let you take it as an expense on your income taxes and have \nthe rest of the taxpayers of the United States foot the bill.\n  Stock option pay is either a company expense or it is not. It either \nlowers company earnings or it does not. Something is clearly out of \nwhack when in the tax law a company can say one thing at tax time and \nsomething else to investors at the annual meeting.\n  This bill that I am introducing with Senator McCain today would end \nthe double standard that allows corporations to treat stock option pay \none way on the tax form and the opposite way on the company's books.\n  I want to emphasize that this bill does not prohibit stock options. \nIt doesn't put a cap on them. It doesn't limit them in any way. It just \nsays, if you want to claim stock option pay as an expense at tax time, \nyou have to treat it as an expense the rest of the year as well.\n  In summary, the bill would not prohibit stock options. It would not \nput a cap on them or limit them in any way. It just says, if a company \nwants to claim stock option pay as an expense at tax time, it has to \ntreat it as an expense the rest of the year as well. Period.\n  The bill provides one exception to ensure that closing the stock \noption tax loophole doesn't affect the pay of average workers.\n  Right now, stock option pay is overwhelmingly executive pay. In 1994, \nthe most extensive stock option review to date, covering 6,000 publicly \ntraded U.S. companies, found that only 1 percent of the companies \nissued stock options to anyone other than management and 97 percent of \nthe stock options issued went to 15 or fewer individuals per company.\n  Nevertheless, there are a few companies that issue stock options to \nall employees and do not disproportionately favor top executives. Our \nbill would allow companies that provide broad-based plans to continue \nto claim existing stock option tax benefits, even if they exclude stock \noption pay expenses from their books. Like FASB, we would encourage but \nnot require these companies to treat these expenses consistently. By \nmaking this limited exception, we would ensure that average worker pay \nwould not be affected by closing the stock option loophole. We might \neven encourage a few more companies to share stock option benefits with \naverage workers.\n  The bottom line is that the bill that Senator McCain and I are \nintroducing today is not intended to stop the use of stock options. Our \nbill is aimed only at stopping the manipulation of stock option \nexpenses by those companies that are trying to have it both ways--\nclaiming stock option pay as an expense at tax time, but not when \nreporting company earnings to Wall Street and the public. It is aimed \nat ending a stealth tax benefit that is fueling the wage gap, favoring \none group of companies over another, and feeding public cynicism about \nthe fairness of the Federal Tax Code.\n  It would also curtail an expensive tax loophole. The Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated that eliminating the corporate stock option \nloophole would save taxpayers $373 million over 7 years and $933 \nmillion--almost $1 billion--over 10 years. In this era of fiscal \nausterity, that's money worth saving.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill Senator McCain \nand I are introducing be printed in the Record, along with a section-\nby-section analysis of the bill that would end the double standards for \nstock options.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 576\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

In no event shall such deduction be allowed \n     before the taxable year described in paragraph (1).\n       ``(B) Exception for broad-based option programs.--\n     Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to property transferred in \n     connection with a stock option if, at the time the stock \n     option was granted--\n       ``(i) substantially all employees of the corporation \n     issuing such stock option were eligible to receive \n     substantially similar stock options from such corporation,\n       ``(ii) no individual performing services for such \n     corporation received more than 20 percent of the total number \n     of stock options granted by such corporation during the \n     taxable year, and\n       ``(iii) at least 50 percent of the total number of stock \n     options granted by such corporation during such taxable year \n     were issued to employees other than individuals performing \n     executive or management services for such corporation.\n       ``(C) Employees covered.--For purposes of this paragraph, \n     an employee shall be taken into account only if--\n       ``(i) the employee is a full-time employee, and\n       ``(ii) substantially all of the services performed by the \n     employee for the corporation are performed within the United \n     States.\n       ``(D) Special rules for controlled groups.--The Secretary \n     shall prescribe rules for the application of this paragraph \n     in cases where the stock option is granted by a parent or \n     subsidiary corporation (within the meaning of section 424) of \n     the employer corporation.''\n       (b) Consistent Treatment for Research Tax Credit.--Section \n     41(b)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining \n     wages for purposes of credit for increasing research \n     expenses) is amended by inserting at the end the following \n     new clause:\n       ``(iv) Special rule for stock options and stock-based \n     plans.--The term `wages' shall not include any amount of \n     property transferred in connection with a stock option and \n     required to be included in a report or statement under \n     section 83(h)(2) until it is so included, and the portion of \n     such amount which may be treated as wages for a taxable year \n     shall not exceed the amount of the deduction allowed under \n     section 83(h) for such taxable year with respect to such \n     amount.''\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--Section 83(h) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``In the case \n     of'' and inserting:\n       ``(1) In general.--In the case of''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to property transferred and wages provided on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, pursuant to stock \n     options granted on or after such date.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Section-by-Section Analysis of Ending Double Standards for Stock \n                              Options Act\n\n       Short Title. Section 1 of the bill provides the short \n     title.\n       Consistent Treatment. Section 2 of the bill would establish \n     requirements for consistent treatment of stock options by \n     corporations when deducting stock option compensation as a \n     business expense under Section 83(h) or claiming stock option \n     wages to obtain a research tax credit under Section 41.\n       Tax Deduction. Subsection 2(a) of the bill would amend \n     section 83(h) of the Internal Revenue Code by adding at the \n     end a new paragraph (2) with special rules for corporate tax \n     deductions related to stock options. A new subparagraph 2(A) \n     of Section 83(h) would limit the deduction that a company \n     could claim for stock option compensation to no more than the \n     amount of stock option expense reported by that company in a \n     financial statement to stockholders. The subsection would \n     continue current law by allowing the deduction at the time \n     the stock option beneficiary exercises the option and \n     includes it in personal income.\n       Average Workers Protected. A new subparagraph 2(B) of \n     Section 83(h) would establish an exception for stock option \n     plans that benefit average workers. To qualify, substantially \n     all full-time, U.S. employees in a company would have to be \n     eligible to receive substantially similar company stock \n     options during the taxable year; no one person could have \n     received more than 20 percent of the stock options issued \n     during the year; and at least 50 percent of the stock options \n     would have had to be issued to non-management employees \n     during the year. A new subparagraph 2(C) would state that \n     only full-time employees performing services in the United \n     States would need to be taken into account in determining \n     eligibility for the exception.\n       Controlled Groups. A new subparagraph 2(D) of Section 83(h) \n     would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \n     regulations applying these rules to stock options granted by \n     a parent or subsidiary corporation of the employer \n     corporation.\n       Tax Credit. Subsection (b) of the bill would amend Section \n     41 of the Internal Revenue Code to clarify the ``wages'' that \n     may be used in calculating the research tax credit allowable \n     under Section 41. The bill would add a new clause (iv) at the \n     end of Section 41(b)(2)(D) stating that the allowable \n     ``wages'' under Section 41 shall not include stock option \n     compensation, until a company reports that compensation in a \n     financial statement to stockholders, as provided in Section \n     83(h)(2) (as amended by this bill). The clause would limit \n     the amount of stock option compensation allowed as a \n     deduction under Section 83(h). Stock option wages could be \n     claimed under Section 41 only after a company reported the \n     compensation expense under Section 83(h)(2), as amended by \n     this bill.\n       Conforming Amendment. Section (c) of the bill would make \n     technical conforming amendments to Section 83(h).\n       Effective Date. Section (d) of the bill would make the \n     amendments applicable only to stock options granted on or \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Levin, entitled Ending Double \nStandards for Stock Options Act. This legislation requires companies to \ntreat stock options for highly paid executives as an expense for \nbookkeeping purposes if they want to claim this expense as a deduction \nfor tax purposes.\n  Currently, corporations can hide these multimillion-dollar executive \ncompensation plans from their stockholders or other investors because \nthese plans are not counted as an expense when calculating company \nearnings. Even the Federal Accounting Standards Board [FASB] recognized \nthat stock options should be treated as an expense for accounting \npurposes. This month, new accounting disclosure rules issued by FASB \nrequire that companies include in their annual reports a footnote \ndisclosing what the company's net earnings would have been if stock \noption plans were treated as an expense.\n  An article in the Wall Street Journal, dated January 14, 1997, stated \nthese new rules could reduce some companies' annual earnings by as much \nas 11 to 32 percent. One might reasonably ask how an arcane accounting \nrule could have such a large effect on the bottom line of corporations. \nThe answer lies in the growth and value of stock options as a means of \nexecutive compensation. These plans now account for about one-fourth of \ntotal executive compensation.\n  We all have heard the reports of executives making multimillion-\ndollar salaries, while average worker salaries stagnate or fall. \nRecently, The Washington Post reported that Michael Eisner, the CEO of \nDisney, was given a stock option package estimated to be worth as much \nas $771 million over the next 10 years. Why shouldn't the value of this \ncompensation package be included in calculating Disney's earnings? How \ncan stockholders evaluate the true value of executive compensation if \nthe value is just buried in a footnote somewhere in the annual report?\n  No other type of compensation gets treated as an expense for tax \npurposes, without also being treated as an expense on the company \nbooks. This double standard is exactly the kind of inequitable \ncorporate benefit that makes the American people irate and must be \neliminated. If companies do not want to fully disclose on their books \nhow much they are compensating their executives, then they should not \nbe able to claim a tax benefit for it.\n  This legislation does not require a particular accounting treatment; \nthe accounting decision is left to the company. This legislation simply \nrequires companies to treat stock options the same way for both \naccounting and tax purposes.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation that will end the double standard for executive stock \noption compensation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two articles to which I have \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 14, 1997]\n\n    As Options Proliferate, Investors Question Effect on Bottom Line\n\n                           (By Laura Jereski)\n\n       How much does Microsoft Corp. really earn from its \n     business?\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\n       For the fiscal year ended June 30, the Redmond, Wash., \n     software giant said pretax income rose 56% to a record $3.4 \n     billion. But a telltale footnote to its income statement \n     revealed that pretax earnings would have been $2.8 billion--\n     $570 million less--if Microsoft had compensated its employees \n     entirely with cash.\n       But employees didn't get just cash. Like many companies \n     these days, Microsoft sprinkles stock options liberally among \n     its workers. That makes a big difference in the earnings \n     outlook at Microsoft and elsewhere.\n       Wall Street and Main Street fervently embrace options as a \n     tonic for much of what ails corporate America. Lucrative for \n     employees, options appear to be cost-free to the employer. \n     Distribute them broadly, the wisdom goes, and employees will \n     pull together, company returns will rocket and shareholders \n     will cheer.\n       But some investors and critics say the options downpour is \n     muddying companies' earnings pictures. Companies can show \n     investors higher earnings if they slash compensation costs by \n     handing out options. As Byron Wien, Morgan Stanley & Co.'s \n     top stock-market strategist, points out: ``In the short run, \n     people are overstating current earnings because part of \n     employees' compensation is coming in the form of options.''\n\n\n                        bet on growth prospects\n\n       Put another way: Investors may be making a bigger bet on \n     company growth prospects than they realize. If Microsoft's \n     options were treated as an expense, its net income last year \n     would have been about $1.8 billion, or $2.85 a share, instead \n     of $2.2 billion, or $3.43 a share--meaning its $83.75 closing \n     stock price on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday would \n     reflect an earning multiple of nearly 30 times last year's \n     earnings instead of about 24 times.\n       Michael Brown, Microsoft's chief financial officer, scoffs \n     at that notion: ``The Street figures it our pretty fast.''\n       But disparities will be popping up all over come March when \n     new accounting disclosure rules by the Financial Accounting \n     Standards Board take effect. For the first time, companies \n     will have to include a footnote in their annual reports \n     disclosing what net would have been if options were treated \n     as an expense--something Microsoft and some others are \n     already doing. Murray Akresh, a compensation expert with \n     Coopers & Lybrand, says the earnings difference could be as \n     much as 11% for some companies. By the time the full impact \n     of the new rule is felt at the end of a four-year transition \n     period, the difference could reach 32%.\n       Companies' true earning power is of particular concern \n     because earnings growth has propelled the stock market's \n     sustained rise. But some money managers say that rise is \n     making options more costly for companies to issue.\n       ``What's really happening is that companies are selling \n     their stock to employees at a discount,'' says Richard \n     Howard, a mutual-fund manager at T. Rowe Price Associates in \n     Baltimore. Often, the companies then turn around and buy \n     stock at the higher market price to hold steady the number of \n     shares outstanding.\n       ``There's a real economic cost when stocks are going up,'' \n     Mr. Howard says. ``That's when options cost the most.''\n\n\n                           options have value\n\n       One measure of that aggregate cost can be seen in stock-\n     buyback programs. In 1996, buybacks totaled $170 billion, \n     according to Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J., securities-\n     market-data company, up 72% from the previous year's $99 \n     billion. Buyback costs are partly offset by the money \n     companies collect from employees who exercise their options \n     and buy.\n       Some investors say the costs ought to be reflected in \n     companies' income statements at the time the employees earn \n     the options. ``Stock options have value, so they should be \n     recorded as an expense,'' says Jerry White, president of \n     Grace & White, a New York money-management firm.\n       And some shareholder activists are rebelling against the \n     amount of options being dispensed. Institutional Shareholders \n     Services, which votes on shareholder issues on behalf of many \n     large investors, votes against about one in five option plans \n     as too generous and expensive. Says ISS research director \n     Jill Lyons: ``A human being has to say, `This is too much.' \n     ''\n       ISS focuses on how much shareholder value option plans \n     transfer, rather than how they might affect company earnings. \n     For example, a magnanimous plan adopted two months ago by San \n     Jose, Calif., computer networker Cisco Systems Inc. will set \n     aside 4.75% of Cisco's stock for options annually for three \n     years. Three-fourths of those options will go to employees \n     below the vice-president level.\n       Most of Wall Street applauds this employee motivator. \n     Analyst Suzanne Harvey at Prudential Securities wrote \n     recently that Cisco has the best employee benefits in the \n     computer industry.\n       But ISS analyst Caroline Kim warned clients that the option \n     plan would double insiders' stake in Cisco to nearly 23%--\n     twice what employees in comparable companies get--and hand \n     over to employees shareholder value of $3.6 billion during \n     the next three years. Shareholders approved the plan anyway.\n       Many investors and financial analysts see nothing wrong \n     with companies' generosity with options. In a recent survey \n     of 300 top Wall Street stock analysts, eight of 10 said they \n     would disregard stock options entirely, as long as companies \n     don't have to take a charge for them. ``I think that's \n     accounting mumbo jumbo, as opposed to a value measure that \n     has to do with stock prices,'' says Bruce Lupatkin, head of \n     research at Hambrecht & Quist.\n       That view prevailed in 1995, after a long and bruising \n     battle over whether such options largess should count against \n     earnings. Hundreds of companies, analysts, venture \n     capitalists, and even congressmen joined forces to defeat \n     accounting rule makers who wanted companies to reflect the \n     actual value of options in their earnings. When the FASB held \n     hearings on the proposal in Silicon Valley--where such \n     options have created thousands of fortunes--they were \n     disrupted by a ``Rally in the Valley'' of the local \n     citizenry, complete with marching bands, balloons and T-\n     shirts stamped ``Stop the FASB.''\n\n\n                            more widespread\n\n       FASB opponents argued that companies incur no cash costs in \n     granting options. Further, not all options granted will be \n     exercised since employees leave and stock prices sometimes \n     fall below the option exercise price. The FASB accountants \n     argued that options are valuable because they give employees \n     a long-term right to buy stock at a set price. They lost, \n     which led to the compromise with the footnote disclosure.\n       Since then, option grants have become more generous and \n     more widespread. Once they were mainly used by small, fast-\n     growing high-technology companies loath to part with precious \n     cash. Today, big companies are enthusiasts, according to a \n     survey of 350 large companies by William M. Mercer Inc., a \n     New York compensation-consulting firm. Annual stock-option \n     grants soared by more than 20% between 1993 and 1995, the \n     firm's work shows.\n       John McMillin, a food-industry analyst at Prudential \n     Securities, says that means ``the quality of the earnings you \n     are looking at is often not good.'' What's more, some \n     companies offer employees the chance to take raises and pay-\n     related benefits in stock instead of cash, which distorts \n     earnings even more. (That can be a losing bet for the \n     employee if the stock fails to rise above the exercise \n     price.)\n       One big proponent of options-for-all is General Mills Inc. \n     The Minneapolis cereal and baked-goods company started \n     granting options to all employees in 1993. General Mills had \n     already been offering its top 800 people the opportunity to \n     take raises and some other benefits in options instead of \n     cash.\n       Mike Davis, General Mills' compensation vice president, \n     says the option programs are ``very attractive for \n     shareholders'' because they cut fixed costs and thereby boost \n     profits, though he can't say by how much. One clue: The \n     company's selling, general and administrative expenses, which \n     include compensation, dropped by $222 million, or 9%, to $2.1 \n     billion, in May 1996, compared with May 1994. For that same \n     period, pretax earnings from continuing operations rose $194 \n     million, or 34%, to $759 million.\n       Meantime, General Mills' options grants have been steadily \n     ratcheting up. Today, the company distributes almost 3% of \n     its stock to employees annually, buying enough stock to match \n     that distribution. ``They are working hard to keep the \n     shares-outstanding line flat,'' Mr. McMillin of Prudential \n     says. ``That also means that they have to go into the market \n     arbitrarily, as options are exercised, and buy stock back at \n     a higher level.''\n       Microsoft, to some extent, also uses buybacks to offset \n     option grants, says, Mr. Brown, its chief financial \n     officer. But the buybacks have become so expensive that \n     the company had to invent a new security to help offset \n     the cost. ``The impact of buying back shares has been more \n     extreme for them because the price took off so \n     dramatically,'' says Michael Kwatinetz, a stock analyst \n     who covers the company for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. \n     Still, Mr. Kwatinetz views the options package overall as \n     ``a strong plus'' for employees.\n       For a while, Microcsoft was coming out about even, in real \n     money terms. When employees exercise options for, say, $40 a \n     share, they pay Microsoft the exercise price. Microsoft gets \n     a tax deduction for the difference between the exercise price \n     and the market price.\n\n\n                            no small change\n\n       But the gross buyback cost has been rising, to $1.3 billion \n     last year from $348 million in 1994. Employees paid Microsoft \n     about $500 million last year for their stock, and tax savings \n     further reduced the company's out-of-pocket costs. But \n     Microsoft still had to shell out about $300 million.\n       Compared with the $570 million in options expense, that \n     sounds like Microsoft is getting its money's worth. In fact, \n     the company is actually paying out $400 million in real cash, \n     to offset employee stock options whose cost isn't recognized \n     in its financial statements.\n       Still, $400 million is no small change, even for a company \n     as flush as Microsoft. So in December, the company sold $1 \n     billion of a newfangled convertible-preferred stock to \n     outside investors that will reduce such costs as long as the \n     stock rises more than 6.88% a year for the next three years. \n     (The preferred stock, which will be redeemed at as high as \n     $102.24 a share, can be exchanged for cash, debt or stock. If \n     Microsoft's stock price falls, the preferred would be \n     redeemed at no less than $79.875 a share.)\n       Many investors consider the financial impact of the options \n     by focusing on earnings per share on a fully diluted basis, a \n     calculation that assumes that options outstanding\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\n     at prices below the current market have been exercised. Tom \n     Stern at Chieftain Capital, a New York money manager, goes \n     one step further. He estimates how much the stock ought to \n     rise, if his earnings estimates are right, and figures out \n     how many more options will be exercised. ``We pay close \n     attention to options,'' he says. ``If you don't, your \n     earnings get diluted.''\n       Will the required footnote disclosure in companies' annual \n     reports have a big impact? ``That's not chopped liver,'' says \n     Jack Ciesielski, author of the Analyst's Accounting Observer \n     newsletter. ``I don't think investors have any idea how big \n     the options programs are.''\n       To calculate the cost, many companies will use option-\n     pricing models in wide use on Wall Street that combine the \n     time span of the options with the volatility of each \n     company's stock price. Options in a hightech company tend to \n     be worth more since chances are better the stock will surge.\n       A few companies have already bit the bullet. Bristol-Myers \n     Squibb Co., the New York pharmaceuticals concern, revealed \n     last year that its options plan would have trimmed 1995 net \n     by a mere $35 million, cutting seven cents a share from per \n     share earnings of $3.58, had options been treated as an \n     expense.\n       The impact of options can be suprisingly big, however, even \n     if the company hasn't been that generous. At Foster Wheeler \n     Corp., the Clinton, N.J., builder of refineries and power \n     plants, the impact was heightened by a restructuring charge \n     that reduced reported earnings at the same time as its stock \n     took off. The result was that a 1995 grant of only 1.35% of \n     shares outstanding would have slashed the year's earnings by \n     14%, or $4.1 million.\n       Tobias Lefkovich, a Smith Barney analyst who follows Foster \n     Wheeler, says nobody noticed. ``Investors are more focused on \n     consistent earnings growth and new orders'' than the option \n     cost, he explains. Nonetheless, Charles Tse, an outside \n     director at Foster Wheeler who serves on the compensation \n     committee, says, ``the whole compensation plan is being \n     reviewed.'' A company spokesman said later that the review \n     wasn't prompted by the stock-option disclosure.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n         Disney Chief May Reap $771 Million From Stock Options\n\n                            (By Paul Farhi)\n\n       By any measure, Michael Eisner the chief executive of the \n     Walt Disney Co., has been one of America's most successful \n     corporate executives. And by any measure, he has been \n     handsomely compensated for it.\n       Eisner, in fact, could be poised to become one of the most \n     richly rewarded employees in the history of American \n     business. Thanks to a new 10-year pay package that includes \n     generous stock options, the top executive of the \n     entertainment conglomerate could reap nearly $771 million \n     over the next decade, according to estimates by the \n     compensation expert who designed Eisner's new contract. The \n     figure doesn't include Eisner's $750,000-per-year salary or \n     bonuses that could add another $15 million annually.\n       While Disney argues that Eisner has proved he's worth it, \n     the huge package has raised anew a debate over executive \n     compensation. A group of 22 institutional pension funds that \n     hold Disney stock plans to protest Eisner's contract at \n     Disney's annual meeting in Anaheim, Calif., next week.\n       They intend to withhold their votes for the five \n     management-backed nominees to Disney's board--including \n     former Senate majority leader George Mitchell and Roy E. \n     Disney, Walt's nephew--and to vote against a resolution that \n     sets the formula for Eisner's annual bonus.\n       The group, which includes the big public-employee pension \n     funds of California, Louisiana and Wisconsin, also is \n     displeased with the severance package awarded Michael Ovitz, \n     the Hollywood talent agent who served as Disney's president \n     for 14 months. Ovitz, who resigned in December, has received \n     $38.9 million in cash from Disney and options on 3 million \n     shares that have a current paper value of $54 million.\n       The Washington-based Council of Institutional Investors, \n     which organized the pension fund protest, acknowledges the \n     action is largely symbolic--it is not voting for alternative \n     board candidates. The group's members control about 11.5 \n     million Disney shares--a tiny fraction of the 675 million \n     Disney shares in the public's hands; it's not clear whether \n     the action has wide support among other shareholders.\n       ``We're merely trying to send a message,'' said Alyssa \n     Machold, deputy director of the council. ``We don't want to \n     start burning Mickey Mouse in effigy. But by not voting, \n     we're calling into question the actions of Disney's board,'' \n     which approved the Eisner and Ovitz packages.\n       The organization says Disney's 16-member board includes 10 \n     directors whose financial ties to the company could \n     compromise their independence. Mitchell's Washington law \n     firm, for example, provides legal services to Disney.\n       Even before his new pay package was disclosed in January, \n     Eisner was often at the center of the executive-pay \n     controversy. In 1992, he made headlines when he exercised \n     options on shares then worth about $202 million.\n       According to Disney's records, the 54-year-old executive \n     has reaped $240 million in profits by exercising options and \n     selling stock in his past 12 years as chief executive. As of \n     September, he held stock that would bring an additional $304 \n     million of profit if sold.\n       His new contract awards him 8 million options. (An option \n     gives its owner the right to buy stock in a company at a \n     particular point in time at a predetermined price; it has \n     value if it permits the buyer to buy stock at a price below \n     the existing market price.)\n       Assessing the future value of an option is an inexact \n     science because it requires guessing the future price of a \n     stock. Officially, Disney estimates the value of Eisner's new \n     options at $195.4 million over their 10-year life.\n       Raymond Watson, the Disney board member who directed \n     negotiations on the contract with Eisner, says that is a \n     conservative figure, based on the low end of assumptions \n     about Disney's future performance.\n       Graef ``Bud'' Crystal, an executive-pay expert whom \n     Disney's board consulted to formulate the contract, said the \n     value of the Eisner deal likely will be much higher. Assuming \n     an 11 percent annual return--Disney's average stock \n     performance for the past 10 years--Crystal calculated Eisner \n     could realize $770.9 million from exercising the options from \n     2003 to 2006.\n       Asked about that figure, Watson said, ``I don't dispute it. \n     We looked at it that way and 30 other ways besides.''\n       But Watson said Eisner's compensation will be worth it if \n     he can help Disney keep up its historical growth. He noted \n     that options only have value if the company's stock keeps \n     appreciating. Indeed, companies award executive options in \n     order to motivate them to keep share value rising.\n       Under Eisner, Disney has been one of Wall Street's stellar \n     performers. Its revenue has grown from $1.5 billion in 1984 \n     to $18.7 billion in 1996. And its stock has soared during \n     that period--from $3 per share to $75.37\\1/2\\ as of Friday, \n     after adjusting for splits.\n       Even Crystal, a frequently quoted critic of huge executive \n     pay packages, grudgingly says Disney's board had to offer \n     Eisner his huge new deal. ``The package he got is awesome,'' \n     he said. ``But if Sony had tried to lure him away, they would \n     have offered him Tokyo and thrown in Kyoto as a bonus.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 577. A bill to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nFederal Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n          the government restructuring and reform act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Government \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1997, legislation whose objective is to \nreorganize the executive branch into a form and a structure that is \ncapable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. The bill is \ncosponsored by my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman.\n  We are in an era of contraction at the Federal level. Some of this \ncontraction is needed in my opinion, in some areas I don't think it's a \ngood idea. But it is a fact. Many programs are being cut, others have \nbeen eliminated or consolidated into block grants to the States. \nAgencies and departments are being downsized and in some cases \neliminated. In the last Congress, the Bureau of Mines, Office of \nTechnology Assessment, Interstate Commerce Commission, and Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations were all terminated. In \naddition, agency rules and paperwork are being pruned. And Federal \nemployment has been cut by over 250,000 positions in the last 4 years \nand continues to fall.\n  These are big and historic changes, spurred on by our efforts to \nreach a balanced budget and the desire of the American people for a \nmore cost-effective Government.\n  However, despite the overall downsizing effort, the basic structure \nof the Federal Government remains unchanged. In fact, the basic \nstructure of the Federal Government has changed little in the last 25 \nyears, despite structural changes in the private sector, the economy, \nand our society over that same time period. The Federal Government has \nbeen the last to follow suit--and that's as it should be in a \ndemocracy--but that does not mean it should be immune from change \nforever. We cannot keep the status quo in the existing executive branch \nstructure while continuing to downsize, cut budgets and programs and \nreduce personnel levels and also expect these same Federal agencies to \nperform effectively and maintain adequate levels of service. We'll end \nup with what I call the hollowing out of Government. We'll have the \nsame agencies and departments in place doing most of the same \nactivities as they do now. But with less money and less people on hand, \nthese activities will be carried out less effectively. We'll have a \nless costly Federal\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\nGovernment, but not a more cost-effective one. That is, unless we \naddress reorganization and consolidation of Federal agencies and \nfunctions in a comprehensive, well-thought-out way.\n  Reorganization issues are very difficult, perhaps among the most \ndifficult issues we face in Government. It raises questions that don't \nhave simple, right and wrong answers. Should we have greater \ncentralization of Government functions in less, but larger Cabinet \ndepartments? This is the traditional, centralized model of how \nGovernment bureaucracy is organized. Or should we decentralize and \nspread Government functions across many smaller agencies and \ndepartments? Such an approach fits what many call the entrepreneurial \nmodel of Government organization.\n  Well, I can think of pros and cons to both approaches. To add to this \ndifficulty, reorganization necessarily involves questions of turf and \njurisdiction. Turf battles in this town are as hotly contested as any \npolicy issue. I know this through experience. Several years ago I \nproposed consolidating the Government's trade and technology functions \ninto one Cabinet department and I faced very stiff opposition. \nLikewise, turf is just as jealously guarded at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. Ask the President's National Performance Review. \nThey proposed integrating the Agency for International Development into \nthe State Department in addition to consolidating the Federal law \nenforcement agencies only to be faced down by the bureaucracy. So I \ndon't think comprehensive reorganization can be tackled successfully by \neither the Congress or the executive branch.\n\n  That's why I'm in favor of establishing a Government commission to \nexamine executive branch organization. My bill establishes a nine-\nmember, bipartisan Commission to make recommendations to the President \nand the Congress in 2 years on consolidating, eliminating, and \nrestructuring Federal departments and agencies in order to eliminate \nunnecessary activities, reduce duplication across programs, and improve \nmanagement and efficiency. This Commission would be not just any old \nCommission, producing some big thick study that would wind up largely \nunread in some recycling bin, or on the dusty shelf of academia. Rather \nthe Commission's recommendations would be submitted to the Congress and \nhave to be considered on a what I call a flexible fast-track basis. \nThey could not perish in committee, as so often occurs with commission \nreports and recommendations.\n  There is precedent for such a commission. In fact, the few successful \nGovernment reorganization efforts that have taken place have come about \nbecause of the work of a commission. Let me give you some background.\n  The Hoover Commission is probably the most famous Government \nrestructuring commission from recent times. It was formed in 1947 and \nchaired by former President Hoover. The 12-member commission operated \nuntil 1949 and issued 19 reports to the President recommending various \nchanges in the structure of the Federal Government. From these \nrecommendations, President Truman submitted eight reorganization plans \nto Congress in 1949, of which six became effective. The following year \nhe submitted 27 reorganization plans, 20 of which became effective. \nIncluded among these plans were the creation of the General Services \nAdministration, the expansion of the Executive Office of the President, \nand the creation of a centralized Office of Personnel.\n  A second Hoover Commission was formed in 1953 and made 314 specific \nrecommendations over the following 2 years, 202 of which were \nimplemented. However, generally this Commission was not considered as \nsuccessful as the first Hoover Commission, as it engaged itself in more \ncontroversial matters of policy rather than solely focus on management \nand organization as the first commission had done.\n  Our next restructuring effort of note was put forward by President \nNixon's Ash Council, which was in operation from 1969 to 1971. Headed \nby Roy Ash, chairman of Litton Industries, the Council supplied the \nPresident with nine memoranda detailing with specific reorganization \nand consolidation proposals. The Council recommended the formation of \nOMB, the EPA, and NOAA from the consolidation of existing programs. \nThese proposals were all implemented. The Council also recommended the \ncreation of several super-Departments, including a Department of \nNatural Resources, but these proposals ultimately did not pass the \nCongress.\n  The next notable Commission came during the Reagan years, the Grace \nCommission, which was established by Executive order in 1982 and was in \noperation through 1984. The panel was composed of 161 corporate \nexecutives and it issued a massive 47 volume report with nearly 2,500 \nrecommendations. Many of its recommendations were policy-based rather \nthan organizational in nature, hence they generated controversy and \npolarized debate in the Congress. Still, many of the recommendations \nwere implemented, primarily through executive branch action. And the \nCommission did call for stronger financial management in the Federal \nbureaucracy. That's something we have built on in the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs through enactment of the Chief Financial Officers \nAct.\n\n  More recently, the Committee on Governmental Affairs passed \nlegislation to establish a bipartisan reorganization commission as part \nof our efforts to make the VA a Cabinet department. That Commission \nbecame law, Unfortunately, in order to pass it, we had to place a \nmechanism to trigger the activation of the Commission through a \nPresidential certification that the Commission was in the national \ninterest. Unfortunately, that certification was not made, Had it been, \nperhaps we would have in place today the blueprint for the Government \nof the 21st century.\n  Then in the 103d Congress, we reported out a Glenn-Roth-Lieberman \nCommission bill by a 12 to 1 vote. But we did not move it to the floor \nbecause the President's National Performance Review was just getting \nunderway and we wanted to see what it might come up with before \nestablishing the commission.\n  Finally, last year the committee reported out a version of a \ngovernment reorganization commission; however, it was tied to \nlegislation dismantling the Commerce Department and thus died. Late in \nthe session, Senator Stevens developed a substitute retaining the \ncommission but dropping the dismantling provisions, We came close to an \nagreement and my hope this Congress is that we will reach one.\n  For a more detailed history of government restructuring commissions I \nwould refer my colleagues to an excellent report prepared by CRS titled \n``Reorganizing the Executive Branch in the Twentieth Century: Landmark \nCommissions.''\n  I believe that a commission would complement nicely the efforts of \nthe NPR. The Federal work force has been reduced by over 250,000 \npositions, Federal paperwork and redtape has been simplified, \nprocurement reform has been enacted, and unnecessary field offices at \nthe Department of Agriculture has been closed. These accomplishments \nare due in significant part to the work and the efforts of the NPR.\n  However, the NPR has generally not focused on government restricting. \nIn the instances where it has made proposals--I noted two examples \nearlier in my statement--they have been rebuffed by the bureaucracy, \nthe Congress or both.\n  Recent congressional efforts have fallen short also, as several of my \ncolleagues learned in advocating the dismantling of four Cabinet \ndepartments--HUD, DOE, Commerce, and Education. Those efforts were \nheavy-handed in my view and would have created more problems then they \nwould have solved.\n  In closing, I believe an examination of the experience of the private \nsector in restructuring and downsizing is instructive in \ndifferentiating between the right and wrong ways to downsize. A 1993 \nsurvey of over 500 U.S. companies by the Wyatt Co. revealed that only \n60 percent of the companies actually were able to reduce costs in their \nrestrucuting efforts. Both the Wyatt Survey and a similar one conducted \nby the American Management Association concluded that successful \nrestructuring efforts must be planned carefully with a clear vision of \ntheir goals and objectives, and that proper attention be given to \nmaintaining employee morale\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\nand productivity. Otherwise, the costs of reorganization may outweigh \nits benefits.\n  There is a right and a wrong way to reorganize and downsize. I \nbelieve that the Commission approach is the right way. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Summary of the Government Restructuring and Reform Act of 1997\n\n\n                                mission\n\n       To consolidate, eliminate and reorganize Federal government \n     departments, agencies and programs to improve efficiency and \n     effectiveness, streamline operations and eliminate \n     unnecessary duplication.

A bill to permit an individual to be treated by a health care \npractitioner with any method of medical treatment such individual \nrequests, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                  the access to medical treatment act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Access to \nMedical Treatment Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Harkin, \nHatch, Grassley, Reid, Abraham, Inouye, Baucus, Craig, Kempthorne, and \nThomas in this effort to allow greater freedom of choice in the realm \nof medical treatments.\n  I was introduced to the alternative medical treatment debate the same \nway many Americans are: through personal experience. Actually, in my \ncase it was the experience of a personal friend: Berkley Bedell.\n  Berkley Bedell, as many of you know, is a former Congressman from \nIowa's 6th District. He is also--since his battle with Lyme disease \nseveral years ago--a tireless advocate for improving access to \nalternative treatments.\n  As some may remember, Congressman Bedell was ill with Lyme disease \nwhen he left the House at the end of the 100th Congress. Having tried \nseveral unsuccessful rounds of conventional treatment consisting of \nheavy doses of antibiotics over approximately 4 years, he turned to an \nalternative treatment that he believes cured his disease.\n  This treatment consisted on its most basic level of nothing more than \ndrinking processed whey from a cow's milk. After about 2 months of \ntaking regular doses of this processed whey, his symptoms disappeared.\n  Despite Congressman Bedell's amazing recovery, and the fact that this \nsame treatment appeared to be effective in treating other cases of Lyme \ndisease, the treatment can no longer be administered because it has not \ngone through the FDA approval process.\n  Congressman Bedell's story--and others I have heard since--have \nconvinced me of two things: first, that our health care system actually \ndiscourages the development and use of alternative medical treatments; \nand second, that this myopic outlook does not serve the best interest \nof the American people.\n  As I looked into the potential of alternative therapies, I was struck \nby what appears to be a deep-seated skepticism of alternative \ntreatments within the medical establishment that may be impeding their \nuse. It is clear to me that the public would benefit by greater debate \nabout the value of alternative medical treatments, and it is to \nstimulate that debate and ultimately remove barriers to potentially \neffective treatments that I have reintroduced the Access to Medical \nTreatment Act.\n  This legislation would allow individual patients and their physicians \nto use certain alternative and complementary therapies not approved by \nthe FDA. A companion measure has been introduced in the House by \nRepresentative DeFazio and 43 of his colleagues.\n  Mr. President, it has been my experience that efforts to expand \naccess to alternative treatments often produce strong emotional \nreactions--on both sides of the issue. Sometimes, those reactions are \nso strong they detract from the merits of the debate.\n  Therefore, let me clarify the intent of the Access to Medical \nTreatment Act.\n  This bill is intended to promote greater access to alternative \ntherapies under the supervision of licensed health practitioners and \nunder carefully circumscribed guidelines. Hopefully, it will stimulate \na constructive discussion of how best to achieve this objective.\n  I appreciate the natural inclination to be wary of uncharted waters, \nand I am not suggesting that caution be thrown to the wind in the case \nof alternative therapies. Some have expressed concern that this bill \ncould have the unintended effect of opening the door to unscrupulous \nentrepreneurs who seek to make profit on the despair of the sick. I \ndon't minimize that concern. How to guard against such an unintended \nconsequence is an issue we will want to examine closely and address.\n  What I am suggesting, however, is that this concern should not blind \nus to the benefit and potential of alternative medicine. It is not a \nreason to shrink from the challenge of expanding access to alternative \ntherapies.\n  Alternative therapies constitute a legitimate field of endeavor that \nis an accepted part of medicine taught in at least 22 of the Nation's \n125 medical schools, including such prestigious institutions as \nHarvard, Yale, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, Albert Einstein, \nMount Sinai, UCLA, and the University of Maryland.\n  At the National Institutes of Health's Office of Alternative \nMedicine, scientists are working to expand our knowledge of alternative \ntherapies and their safe and effective use.\n  And the State medical licensing boards now have a committee \ndiscussing alternative medicine. I encourage that panel to explore how \nsafe access to alternative medicine might be increased.\n  Additionally, more and more Americans are turning to alternative \ntherapies in those frustrating instances in which conventional \ntreatments seem to be ineffective in combating illness and disease. In \n1990 alone, the New England Journal of Medicine found that Americans \nspent nearly $14 billion on alternative therapies, and made more visits \nto alternative practitioners than they did to primary care doctors. \nAmerican consumers are turning to these therapies because they are \nperceived to be a less expensive and more prevention-based alternative \nto conventional treatments.\n\n  Given the popularity of alternative therapies among the American \npublic, it will be asked why this legislation is necessary. If a \nparticular alternative treatment is effective and desired by patients, \nthen why can't it simply go through the standard FDA approval process?\n  The answer is that the time and expense currently required to gain \nFDA approval of a treatment makes it very\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\ndifficult for all but large pharmaceutical companies to undertake such \nan arduous and costly endeavor. The heavy demands and requirements of \nthe FDA approval process, and the time and expense involved in meeting \nthem, serve to limit access to the potentially innovative contributions \nof individual practitioners, scientists, smaller companies, and others \nwho do not have the financial resources to traverse the painstakingly \ndetailed path to certification.\n  Thus, the current system has the unfortunate effect of both \ndiscouraging the exploration of life-saving treatments and preventing \nlow-cost treatments from gaining access to the market. The Access to \nMedical Treatment Act attempts to open the door to promising treatments \nthat may not have huge financial backing.\n  I want to be absolutely clear, however, that this legislation will \nnot dismantle the FDA, undermine its authority or appreciably change \ncurrent medical practices. It is not meant to attack the FDA or its \napproval process. It is meant to complement it.\n  The FDA should--and would under this legislation--remain solely \nresponsible for protecting the health of the Nation from unsafe and \nimpure drugs. The heavy demands and requirements placed upon treatments \nbefore they gain FDA approval are important, and I firmly believe that \ntreatments receiving the Federal Government's stamp of approval should \nbe proven safe and effective.\n  The real question posed by this legislation is whether it is in the \npublic interest to simply forgo the potential benefits of alternative \ntreatments because of economies of scale, or whether, working with the \nFDA, it makes sense to explore ways to bring such treatments to the \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, the Access to Medical Treatment Act proposes one way \nto extend freedom of choice to medical consumers under carefully \ncontrolled situations. It suggests that individuals--especially those \nwho face life-threatening afflictions for which conventional treatments \nhave proven ineffective--should have the option of trying an \nalternative treatment, so long as they have been fully informed of the \nnature of the treatment, potential side effects and any other \ninformation necessary to fully meet FDA informed consent requirements. \nThis is a choice that is rightly left to the consumer, and not dictated \nby the Federal Government.\n\n  The bill requires that a treatment be administered by a properly \nlicensed health care practitioner who has personally examined the \npatient. It requires the practitioner to comply fully with FDA informed \nconsent requirements. And it strictly regulates the circumstances under \nwhich claims regarding the efficacy of a treatment can be made.\n  No advertising claims can be made about the efficacy of a treatment \nby a manufacturer, distributor, or other seller of the treatment. \nClaims may be made by the practitioner administering the treatment, but \nonly so long as he or she has not received any financial benefit from \nthe manufacturer, distributor, or other seller of the treatment. No \nstatement made by a practitioner about his or her administration of a \ntreatment may be used by a manufacturer, distributor, or other seller \nto advance the sale of such treatment.\n  What this means is that there can be no marketing of any treatment \nadministered under this bill. As such, there should be little incentive \nfor anyone to try to use this bill as a bypass to the process of \nobtaining FDA approval. Also, because only properly licensed \npractitioners are able to make any claims at all about the efficacy of \na treatment, there should be little room for so-called quack medicine. \nIn short, if an individual or a company wants to earn a profit off \ntheir product, they would be wise to go through the standard FDA \napproval process rather than utilizing this legislation.\n  In essence, this legislation addresses the fundamental balance \nbetween two seemingly irreconcilable interests: the protection of \npatients from dangerous treatments and those who would advocate unsafe \nand ineffective medicine--and the preservation of the consumer's \nfreedom to choose alternative therapies.\n  The complexity of this policy challenge should not discourage us from \nseeking to solve it. I am convinced that the public good will be served \nby a serious attempt to reconcile these contradictory interests, and I \nam hopeful the discussion generated by introduction of this legislation \nwill help point the way to its resolution. I welcome anyone who would \nlike to join me in promoting this important debate to cosponsor this \nlegislation. I also welcome alternative suggestions for accomplishing \nthis objective.\n  As I mentioned previously, I am sympathetic to the concern about the \nneed to protect patients against unscrupulous practitioners. \nIndividuals are often at their most vulnerable when they are in \ndesperate need of medical treatment. That is why it is absolutely \ncritical that a proposal of this nature include strong protections to \nensure that patients are not subject to charlatans who would prey on \ntheir misfortunate and fears for personal gain. The Access to Medical \nTreatment Act contains such protections.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents an honest attempt to focus \nserious attention on the value of alternative treatments and overcome \ncurrent obstacles to their safe development and utilization. If there \nis a better way to make alternative therapies available to people \nsafely, let's find that way.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance taxes \npaid by employees and self-employed individuals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the working americans wage restoration act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it has been said that America is a city \non a hill, a special example for the rest of the world to observe--a \nplace of hope, a place of opportunity--what America is and ought to be. \nBut it might be said that if we are a city, we are in need of urban \nrenewal. We need to restart our engine, to regenerate the potential for \ngrowth, for the development of opportunity in this culture.\n  Economic growth has been the idea, it has been the mechanism whereby \nAmerica could find a special place of opportunity, where America could \nbe that particular country that said:\n\n       Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, \n     yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming \n     shore. Send these, the homeless tempest tossed, to me.\n\n  With what the writer of that great poem inscribed on the Statue of \nLiberty, America could proudly proclaim, ``I lift my lamp beside the \ngolden door.''\n  America has been a place of opportunity because it has been a place \nof growth, with an understanding that we could always grow our way \nthrough problems. Growth has been that marvelous key toward providing \nsome new hope for individuals. Individuals from anywhere and everywhere \nat all times in our history have provided a part of the stream of a \ngrowing America, a set of opportunities that is the envy of the world. \nYet what is happening and has happened to our growth? What has happened \nto our culture? Working families are being stressed. They get up early. \nThey work hard. They sacrifice time with each other and with their \nchildren, and they seem to have less and less to show for it. They are \nsqueezed not just financially but as families.\n  What is the reason? Why is that we as a culture find ourselves \nlaboring under this weight rather than soaring with the opportunity \ncharacteristic of our heritage?\n  I think we have a tax load that is weighing down individuals in this \nculture, and it is a major one. It is simple. It is not hard to \nunderstand. The most recent issue of Baron's magazine, which is a \nmagazine that monitors business activity and government and families \nand opportunity, spells out the tremendous tax load--heavier at this \nmoment in history than at any other time in the history of America. It \nis interesting to note that we were able to spend our way out of the \nGreat Depression with lower tax rates than we now have. We were able to \nmake the world safe for democracy or to work toward making it in the \nFirst World War. We were able to defeat the onerous and terrible power \nof Nazi Germany in the Second World War with lower tax rates than we \nhave now.\n  Big government is taking so much of the working wages of Americans \nthat Americans no longer have the resources to spend on themselves that \nthey need.\n  The family budget in 1955, for example, was 27.7 percent in total \ntaxes. Now the total taxes of the average American family is well over \n38 percent. And you are well aware of the fact that we spend more on \ntaxes than\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\nwe do on food, clothing, and shelter combined. We need to take a look \nat what we are spending and how we are deploying it, to see what has \nhappened to what we thought were our wage increases. We have had a lot \nof wage increases, but we end up with less and less. It turns out that \nthe wage increase for America has been stolen by the Government. If we \nhad the kind of income that we have now and we were paying 27.7 in \ntotal taxes like we were in 1955, we would have had real wage \nincreases.\n  Mr. President, today is April 15. It is tax day. Yet most Americans \ndo not realize that we are forced to pay a double tax. We pay income \ntax on the Social Security taxes that are deducted from our check, on \nthose taxes which are pulled out before we ever see our check. We pay \nincome taxes on that tax. That is particularly unfortunate. We are \ndouble taxed. Money that we never see, money that goes to Government, \nwe pay a second tax to Government on that money. It does not make \nsense.\n  Interestingly enough, this is not a tax that hits American businesses \nthe same way. As you will recall, half of the Social Security tax is \npaid by citizens; half is paid by corporations or the employers. The \ncitizen who pays the tax pays a double tax--not only pays the Social \nSecurity tax but then has an income tax on that same money that is \nrequired to be taken out of his remaining funds. The business that pays \nSocial Security taxes gets to deduct from its other taxes what it has \npaid in Social Security taxes, or gets to deduct from its taxable \nincome what it has paid in Social Security taxes.\n\n  So the business community gets fair treatment of a single tax while \nthe working individual has a double tax situation there, and it is time \nto end that kind of arbitrary, unreasonable, unequal, discriminatory \napproach to the worker and to provide parity with the reasonable \nexpectation that is demanded from the employer and the corporation. If \nthis is deductible to the employers and to corporations and to \nbusinesses, the payment of those taxes should also be deductible to \nindividuals in our culture.\n  The ordinary citizen, the worker, cannot though, and it is time that \nwe lift the American worker at least to tax parity and to tax equality, \na position that they should share with the corporate community and the \nbusiness community.\n  For those who are fond of saying that every tax break is a tax break \nfor the rich, it is time to think again. This is not a proposal that is \ndesigned to help people who make millions and millions of dollars. \nSocial Security taxes are only levied on the first $65,000 of income. \nIf we provide a deduction for those Social Security taxes which are \npaid, the person who makes $65,000 in income does not have any smaller \ndeduction or any smaller benefit than the person who makes $650,000 in \nincome or the person who makes $65 million in income. The tax benefit \nis the same once you reach the $65,000 level.\n  So this is a tax benefit that is not focused on the rich. It is not \nany more valuable to the very rich than it is to the middle class. The \ntruth is this is the middle-class tax cut that is fair. It provides for \npeople who work, that they will not be double taxed on their work. \nSocial Security taxes are the only tax in America levied on work. \nIncome taxes are levied on earned income or unearned income, but Social \nSecurity taxes are levied on work. How ironic that in America we would \nhave a double tax on work. We ought to be standing for a proposition, \ninstead of double taxing work, at least give it equality with other \nincome that would not be double taxed. We would give Americans an \nopportunity to retain some of that for which they had worked so they \ncould spend it themselves.\n  There would be a significant improvement in the setting for the \naverage two-income family in America. The average two-earner family \npays about $1,227 more in income taxes because they cannot deduct from \ntheir income tax the taxes they have already paid to Social Security. \nIf we allow them to deduct those, that means that $1,227 that is paid \nin income taxes would be available for individuals to have to meet \ntheir family needs. This is not just a way of saying that people will \nbe able to spend the money. It is saying that people will be able to \nspend this money on themselves rather than have Government spend this \nmoney on more Government programs. I think most Americans understand \nthat they would be better off deciding what they need most and how best \nto meet those needs than expecting Government to spend the money for \nthem.\n  The thrust of the matter is that this $1,227 per year for the average \ntwo-income family would be a welcome relief from a tax load which is \nhigher than it has ever been before in the history of this country.\n  I had the privilege of being Governor in my State for two terms \nbefore I came here, and I know what jobs mean and how important jobs \nare. What is interesting to note is that if we were to implement this \ntax measure of relief for the American people, the scholars estimate it \nwould mean 900,000 new jobs in this country. Nine hundred thousand new \njobs would provide a real spurt of growth for this Nation and would \nhelp us reacquire the sense of dynamic that America has had \nhistorically and that our heritage contains. Nine hundred thousand new \njobs would be an average of about 18,000 jobs per State. I know that \n18,000 jobs is equivalent to at least 3 car plants, new car plants, in \na State. That would mean growth. That would mean opportunity. It would \nbuild for the future of this great country. I think we need to remind \nourselves on a consistent basis when we tax people it is not a question \nof whether or not the money will be spent; it is a question of whether \nGovernment will spend the money or people will spend the money. I \nbelieve people can decide best.\n\n  The passage of this act would affect the take-home pay of 77 million \nAmericans who would have more resources to devote to meet the needs of \ntheir families, and it would be a measure of providing equity and \nfairness so that they would not be double taxed and neither would they \nbe taxed unequally and in a discriminatory way as compared to the taxes \nwhich are levied on the corporate community.\n  Mr. President, so often we say that bigger Government is required \nbecause some think that families will not do what they ought to do. I \nbelieve we have come to a juncture where Government has made it \nimpossible for families to do what they need to do. Families want to \nshare. They want to be involved in their communities. They want to be \ninvolved in reaching out to other people. When Government takes such a \nbig portion of your income, when you have to work 3 hours every day to \npay your taxes and you struggle through the rest of your day to meet \nyour own needs, it does not leave much opportunity for sharing.\n  The purpose of Government is related to growth. It is related to the \ngrowth of people, not the growth of Government. If we are to perpetuate \na system where the only thing that can grow is Government, we have made \na mistake. We would have destroyed the genius of America and repudiated \nour rich history of being able to grow our way through any challenge. \nIt is time for us, the United States of America, the city on the Hill, \nagain to be a city of hope and opportunity. It is time for us to \nprovide a basis upon which the American worker and the American economy \ncan grow. We can do that by ceasing the practice of double taxing work. \nWe must stop double taxing working Americans.\n  The bill, which I now send to the desk, is cosponsored by Senators \nCraig, Shelby, Cochran, Hagel, and Hatch. It would end the double \ntaxation that American workers pay on Social Security taxes, because \nincome taxes are levied on those amounts which are deducted as payroll \ntaxes, known as Social Security taxes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals to designate that up to 10 percent of their income tax \nliability be used to reduce the national debt, and to require spending \nreductions equal to the amounts so designated; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n                 The Taxpayer Debt Buy-Down Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SMITH, Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncreate an active role for ``We the People'' in the fiscal matters of \nthe Federal Government.\n  I am joined by my colleagues, Senators Faircloth, Gramm, Hatch, and \nKyl, who are original cosponsors of this measure.\n\n\nwhy we need the taxpayer debt buy-down: the president and congress have \n                      not stepped up to the plate\n\n  On February 6, President Clinton submitted his fifth unbalanced \nbudget.\n  Then, on March 4, the Senate failed by one vote to approve the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment (BBCA).\n  During the debate on the balanced budget constitutional amendment, \nthe president and his congressional allies decried the constitutional \nchange as too permanent, and argued that Congress could impose fiscal \nself-discipline.\n  In response to these claims, today I am reintroducing the Taxpayer \nDebt Buy-Down Act. This legislation not only answers appeals for \nstatutory restrictions, but also takes the balanced budget debate to \nthe people.\n  If the President and Congress cannot agree, the American people \nshould decide.\n  I first introduced the bill in 1992, and it was endorsed by President \nGeorge Bush.\n  More than one-third of the Senate voted for my plan which I offered \nas an amendment to the tax bill of 1992.\n  I feel the time has come again to empower the taxpayers to tell \nCongress how much spending they want cut in order to balance the budget \nand buy down the debt.\n  For example; in 1996, individual income tax revenue totaled over $650 \nbillion.\n  So if every taxpayer checked off the maximum designation of 10-\npercent, Congress would have to come up with roughly $65 billion in \nspending cuts.\n  Admittedly, this level of participation is highly unlikely initially.\n  A more reasonable estimate would be that the total taxpayer check-off \nwould amount to about 3-percent of all individual tax revenue in the \nfirst few years.\n  Under this scenario, Congress would only have to find less than $20 \nbillion in spending reductions.\n  Considering the danger posed by our growing national debt, who could \noppose $20 billion in spending cuts.\n  The American people will be able to tell us if we are on the right \ntrack, or if they want more deficit and debt reduction.\n  I challenge my colleagues to support their claims that they support a \nbalanced budget. Ask the taxpayers.\n\n\n                      the process would be simple\n\n  First, by checking off a box on their April 1040 tax forms, taxpayers \nwould designate up to 10 percent of their income tax liability, what \nthey owe, for the purpose of deficit and debt reduction. Once the \ndeficit is eliminated, designated cuts would buy down the debt.\n  Second, the following October, the Treasury Department would \ncalculate the amount demanded by the taxpayers. Congress would then \nhave until the end of the next fiscal year to cut Federal spending in \nany area to meet this target.\n  Third, if Congress failed to make the necessary cuts, an automatic \nacross-the-board sequester of all Government accounts, with some \nnecessary exemptions, would be triggered at the end of the session. \nThis sequester would ensure compliance with the taxpayer-mandated \nspending reductions. However, I would hope this would not occur if \nCongress listens to the mandate of the taxpayers.\n  Fourth, furthermore, to harmonize this grassroots effort with \ncongressional efforts to balance the budget, the check-off will \ninitially mandate spending cuts and debt retirement only over and above \nthe savings that Congress otherwise enacts. For example, if Congress \npasses legislation that implements savings of $50 billion in fiscal \nyear 1999, and the check-off for that year totals $60 billion, only an \nadditional $10 billion would be cut under this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Feinstein and Mr. \n        Torricelli):\n  S. 581. A bill to amend section 49 of title 28, United States Code, \nto limit the periods of service that a judge or justice may serve on \nthe division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia to appoint independent counsels, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senators \nLeahy, Feinstein and Torricelli, legislation dealing with the three-\njudge panel that appoints independent counsels.\n  In the last few days, we have heard a flurry of speeches about the \nappointment of an independent counsel and about the grasp that the \nAttorney General has on her job. Recently some Members of Congress have \nsuggested that we should open an investigation on the Attorney General \nbecause of her\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\ndecision not to seek the appointment of an independent counsel.\n  This is a new high in the efforts to politicize the independent \ncounsel statute and a new low in bullying tactics.\n  And, Mr. President, these tactics have worked insofar as their goal \nwas to politicize this issue. Many Americans now view this statute as \njust another political football. Here in Congress, we toss about calls \nfor an independent counsel. We threaten to minutely examine every act \nof the Attorney General in her efforts to carry out her duties under \nthe statute.\n  Meanwhile, one of the most important institutions to the operation of \nthe independent counsel statute goes unexamined. The three-judge panel \nthat appoints and oversees the independent counsels wields enormous \npower. And it has tainted itself through close connections to partisan \npolitics and through the appointment of special counsels who are \nlikewise partisans.\n  This panel seems to operate free of any genuine scrutiny. It plays \none of the most important roles in the administration of the statute. \nAnd it is the most in need of some oversight.\n  The last time an independent counsel was appointed, we all saw just \nhow embroiled that three-judge panel is in partisan politics. The head \nof that panel, the Republican-appointed David Sentelle, had lunch with \ntwo Republican Senators just a few weeks before he appointed an \nindependent counsel who was a Republican Justice Department official \nand who had just recently publicly contemplated running for the Senate \nas a Republican. As a result of this incident, five former presidents \nof the American Bar Association issued a letter rebuking Judge Sentelle \nfor his actions.\n  A recent article in the Legal Times noted:\n\n     In fact, with the appointment of independent counsel[s] \n     handled by a highly secretive three-judge panel, named by the \n     chief judge of the United States, it could be argued that one \n     partisan system has simply been supplanted by another.\n\n  Let me explain what the panel currently does and how that contributes \nto the failings of the statute.\n  The first flaw in the statute is in the appointment terms of the \njudges who sit on this special panel. Currently, three judges are \nappointed to the panel by the Chief Justice of the United States. The \njudges are appointed to the division for 2-year terms.\n  But David Sentelle is now serving his third 2-year term. Judge John \nD. Butzner, Jr., is in the middle of his fourth 2-year term. And Judge \nPeter T. Fay is in the midst of his second 2-year term.\n  In short, some judges are becoming entrenched in the independent \ncounsel process.\n  A second flaw in the judges' panel is in its consistent failure to \nissue any rules of procedure and practice. In 1994, when we \nreauthorized the act, Congress called on the panel to promulgate rules \nof procedure for practice before it, clarify available avenues of \nappellate review, and undertake to catalog and preserve independent \ncounsel reports and make public versions accessible upon request.\n  They have not done so. Only recently, the panel issued some draft \nrules of procedure dealing with attorney fee applications, but in 3 \nyears they do seem to have not otherwise complied with Congress's \nrequest.\n  This special division is like a magician's hat: independent counsels \nemerge from it. But we do not know how. Are there any criteria used by \nthe panel to appoint an independent counsel? Does the panel make any \neffort to assure that the person it appoints is actually independent? \nHow does someone get this job--a job with a virtually unlimited budget \nand a stunning array of powers?\n  We do not know because the Court will not tell us, even though we \nasked them to 3 years ago.\n  We need to do a few things about this panel. The legislation I \nintroduce today is intended to remove any taint of partisan politics \nfrom this panel. It requires that judges on the panel serve no more \nthan two, 2-year terms. This will ensure that no one judge gets \nentrenched in appointing independent counsels. And it assures that the \ndivision does not get politicized. In addition, it is consistent with \ncurrent law. Why have 2-year terms if the judges just stay on as long \nas they want? The 2-year term was clearly inserted with the view that \njudges would not stay on the division forever.\n  In addition to limiting judges on the panel to 4 years, the measure I \nintroduce requires that the division promulgate the very rules that we \nasked them to issue 3 years ago.\n  The special division should not be a mysterious black box. People who \npractice before it should know the rules. Attorney fee applications are \nthe most common things the Division has to deal with, but this \nprovision also requires that the Special Division have rules governing \nthe appointment of an independent counsel. We should know what criteria \nand what procedure they use to assure that the independent counsel is \nindeed independent and qualified.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can all agree that this measure is vitally \nneeded. It is simply aimed at improving the operation of the \nindependent counsel statute not tearing it down. It's goal is to take \nsome partisan politics out of the system and to put a little more \nindependence back into the statute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON PERIODS OF SERVICE THAT A JUDGE MAY \n                   SERVE ON THE DIVISION TO APPOINT INDEPENDENT \n                   COUNSELS.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Service.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 49 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g)(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (f) and \n     subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, no \n     judge or justice may serve more than 2 two-year periods \n     assigned to the division to appoint independent counsels \n     under this section.\n       ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), service in filling a \n     vacancy on the division of--\n       ``(A) less than 1 year shall not apply; and\n       ``(B) 1 year or more shall be considered service for the \n     full two-year period.\n       ``(3) A judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia who has served 2 two-year periods on the \n     division may be assigned to serve an additional two-year \n     period, if--\n       ``(A) every other judge of such Court otherwise eligible \n     for such assignment has served 2 two-year periods in such \n     assignment; and\n       ``(B) the period of time since such judge last served in \n     such assignment is not less than the period of time any other \n     judge of such Court (who is otherwise eligible to serve) last \n     served in such assignment.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and \n     shall apply to any judge or justice serving on such date on \n     the division to appoint independent counsels of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n       (b) Administration of Division by the Circuit Judicial \n     Council.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 332 of title 28, United States \n     Code (including subsection (d) of such section relating to \n     making all necessary and appropriate orders for the effective \n     and expeditious administration of justice), shall apply with \n     respect to the administration of the division of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to \n     appoint independent counsels by the Circuit Judicial Council \n     for the District of Columbia.\n       (2) Rules.--No later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Circuit Judicial Council for the \n     District of Columbia shall promulgate rules to--\n       (A) govern practice and procedures before the division to \n     appoint independent counsels;\n       (B) govern the procedure for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel by the division;\n       (C) clarify procedures for judicial appellate review of \n     actions of the division; and\n       (D) catalog and preserve independent counsel reports and \n     make public versions available upon request.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the whole purpose of the independent \ncounsel law--to get politics out of the process of investigating \npolitically potent matters--has been severely undercut recently by \npartisan efforts to bully the Attorney General into appointing an \nindependent counsel to investigate fundraising activities in the 1996 \nPresidential campaign. In fact, some Republicans in Congress have \nthreatened that if Janet Reno refuses to do what they want, she will be \ninvestigated and her job will be at stake.\n  This marks a new low in the politicization of the independent counsel \nprocess. These threats demean our system of justice and, I fear, \nundermines public confidence in all branches of government.\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\n  Continued politicization of the independent counsel process will be \nthe death knell for this law. The American people already have \nlegitimate questions about how much independent counsels cost, how long \nthey take, and how this law is working. By last count, independent \ncounsels have cost taxpayers a total of over $125 million. Whitewater \ncounsel Ken Starr alone has already spent over $22 million. We still \nhave an independent counsel investigating matters from the Reagan \nadministration.\n  Suspicions about the role of partisan politics in the selection of \nso-called independent counsels are already strong. A Reagan-appointed \nChief Justice, who served in the Nixon administration, appointed a \nstaunchly Republican judge to the selection panel that, after meeting \nin secret, appointed partisan Republican Kenneth Starr to investigate \nWhitewater.\n  If the results of independent counsel investigations cannot be \ntrusted because they are tainted by partisan politics, we will not be \nable to justify the costs of this law.\n  That is why I am commending Senator Durbin for his work on this bill. \nIt takes important steps to begin restoring public confidence in the \nprocess by which independent counsels are selected. Specifically, the \nbill sets term limits for the three judges who serve on the Special \nDivision of the D.C. Circuit division that appoints the independent \ncounsel. Under current law, these judges serve for 2-year terms. \nHowever, all of them are on at least their second 2-year term. The \nlegislation would prohibit a judge, including the current panel, from \nserving more than 2-year terms.\n  In addition, the bill would allow sunshine on the selection of \nindependent counsels and the results of independent counsel \ninvestigations. What criteria does the Special Division use to select \nindependent counsels? Do they look for trial experience, prosecutorial \nexperience or political experience? The bill places the Special \nDivision that selects independent counsels under the authority of the \nCircuit Judicial Council and requires that the Council promulgate \nwithin 6 months rules of practice for the Division. These rules would \nspecify the procedure for selection of an independent counsel. This is \nimportant so everyone will know what qualifications the Special \nDivision uses to evaluate candidates. Public procedures should also \nopen up the process so that appropriate candidates know how to apply \nfor independent counsel positions when openings occur. This is too \nimportant a process to be decided by political cronies over lunch.\n  The bill would also require that the Court catalog and preserve \nindependent counsel reports and make public versions available upon \nrequest.\n  This bill is not a cure-all for the problems we have seen with the \nindependent counsel law. But this is a good start.\n  Mr. President, the whole purpose of the independent counsel law--to \nget politics out of the process of investigating politically potent \nmatters--has been severely undercut recently by partisan efforts to \nbully the Attorney General into appointing an independent counsel to \ninvestigate fundraising activities in the 1996 Presidential campaign. \nIn statement after statement by otherwise responsible Members of \nCongress, they tell her how she should use here discretion and how she \nshould make up her mind, before she even has an opportunity to do so. \nSome Republicans in Congress have threatened that if Janet Reno refuses \nto do what they want, she will be investigated and her job will be at \nstake.\n  Basically, the American people were asked last night to make this \nchoice: Would they let the Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, \ndetermine what the ethics rules should be, or would they rather allow \nthe Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno to follow the law \nand investigate whether crimes have occurred?\n  Frankly, I am very confident in allowing Attorney General Reno to \nproceed. She has done a pretty darn good job so far. She calls them as \nshe sees them and has been a very straightforward Attorney General.\n  I hope that everybody, whether in this body or the other body, will \nstop trying to substitute their ethical standards and political \njudgment as to what should be done and allow the Attorney General, who \nsticks to a very strong ethical standard, to follow and enforce the \nlaw. I believe the statements seeking to intimidate the Attorney \nGeneral mark a new low in the politicization of the independent counsel \nprocess.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 583. A bill to change the date on which individual Federal income \ntax returns must be filed to the Nation's Tax Freedom Day, the day on \nwhich the country's citizens no longer work to pay taxes, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               TAX FILING ON TAX FREEDOM DAY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this past weekend we had a weekend of \nfirsts. Tiger Woods became the youngest PGA player to ever win the \nMasters and in doing so broke the all-time scoring record of 270 and \nestablished the largest margin of victory--12 shots--in the \ntournament's 61-year history.\n  On April 14, 1997, the Tax Foundation announced another first, Tax \nFreedom Day this year will be on May 9.\n  What is Tax Freedom Day? Tax Freedom Day is the day when the average \nAmerican stops working for the Government and starts working for \nthemselves. This year's record date for Tax Freedom Day of May 9 is 2 \ndays after last year's record of May 7 and up significantly since the \nClinton administration took office in 1993.\n  This year the average American will have to work a total of 128 days \nto pay his or her tax bill. That equates to 2 hours 49 minutes of each \nworking day laboring to pay taxes. That's hard time any way you slice \nit.\n  Over the years, April 15 has metamorphosized from being a trip to the \ndentist's office to being a major root canal without the novocaine.\n  I rise today to introduce legislation that will change the date on \nwhich individuals file their Federal income tax returns from April 15 \nto May 9, Tax Freedom Day.\n  While this legislation does little to bring about a change in the \namount of money paid by the average American wage earner, I believe \nthat issue would be helped greatly with the enactment of a balanced \nbudget with tax relief.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to change \nthe time for filing income tax returns from April 15 to the first \nTuesday in November, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                    the TAXATION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, we made several reforms during the last \nCongress intended to put Members of this body in closer touch with the \nAmerican people. Among those reforms were provisions applying to \nMembers of Congress the same laws that apply to private businesses and \ncitizens.\n  Today I am introducing legislation that I believe will further \nstrengthen the ties between Members and their constituents. In \nparticular, Mr. President, I am concerned that, where, according to a \nUSA Today poll from this March, 70 percent of the American people \nbelieve that they need a tax cut, many in Congress still refuse to give \nit to them.\n  I am convinced, Mr. President, that some Members continue to oppose \nany limits on Federal tax funds because they are out of touch with the \nAmerican people. That is why I am introducing the Taxation \nAccountability Act to tie the act of voting more closely with the act \nof taxpaying.\n  Too many Members believe that the American people are not, and do not \nbelieve themselves to be, over-taxed. This is wrong, Mr. President, and \nwe must put an end to this mistaken and dangerous belief. How? By \nmaking it possible for Americans to more effectively act on their \nconvictions regarding proper levels of taxation. By moving tax day, now \nApril 15, to coincide with election day.\n  To begin with, Mr. President, most Americans are not even fully aware \nof the percentage of their income the government takes from them in the \nform of taxes. According to the National Taxpayer's Union, the average \nAmerican family now pays almost 40 percent of its income in State, \nlocal, and Federal taxes. That is an all-time high.\n  Yet, with almost 40 percent of their income going to taxes, mothers \nand fathers in America still are not going to the polls. Despite the \nhuge investment they are making, voluntarily or involuntarily, in \ngovernment in this country, this last Presidential election showed the \nlowest turnout in our history. Americans are not exercising their right \nto decide who shall represent them in deciding how that government \nshall be run--what it shall do and at what expense.\n  Why are Americans so apathetic in the face of such staggering tax \nrates, Mr. President? Simple, most Americans simply do not know how \nhigh their taxes really are.\n  Two years ago a Readers Digest poll asked Americans, ``What is the \nhighest percentage of income that is fair for a family of four making \n$200,000 to pay in all taxes?'' The median response, regardless of \nwhether the respondent was rich or poor, black or white, was 25 \npercent.\n  This estimate among Americans, that 25 percent is the limit of fair \ntaxation, is borne out by a grassroots research poll conducted last \nMarch. That poll found that a majority of Americans would favor a \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit Federal, State, and local taxes \nfrom taking ``a combined total of more than 25 percent of anyone's \nincome in taxes.''\n  Yet the Tax Foundation tells us that a dual-income family today pays \nan average of 38.4 percent of its income in taxes to State, local, and \nFederal governments.\n  Why is it, Mr. President, that Americans, are not aware of so vital a \nfigure as the percentage of their income that is taken away by the \ngovernment in taxes?\n  One reason is the significant extent to which the taxes they pay are \nhidden. Taxes on businesses eventually are paid by families. So are \nsales taxes. Taxes on the average loaf of bread equal 31 percent of the \ntotal cost. Taxes also represent 43 percent of the cost of a hotel \nroom, 54 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas and 40 percent of the \ncost of an airline ticket.\n  Another, and perhaps the most significant way taxes are hidden is \nwithholding. Many taxpayers do not realize how much the government is \ntaking from them because it takes their money before they ever see it. \nOnly when they fill out their tax forms do most Americans have a chance \nto see the full enormity of the tax burden they bear. And then they \nhave 7 months to cool off before election day rolls around.\n  Combined, these factors keep Americans from realizing the extent of \ntheir tax burden, and acting on that realization. Information is \ncrucial to effective voting. And just as crucial, in my view, is \ninformation that is timely. Only if people know the extent of their tax \nburden, and are made aware of it at a time when they can do something \nabout it, will they act. Only if Americans are aware of what is at \nstake on election day will they vote on election day. And only if they \nvote, expressing their opinions on crucial issues like taxation, can \nthey hold Members of Congress responsible for their actions.\n  Mr. President, we are not likely to do away with withholding or \nrepeal Federal taxes on bread and butter. But we can highlight the \nimportance of voting by tieing the process of tax-filing more closely \nto the process of voting.\n  To achieve this, Mr. President, I am proposing legislation that would \nmove tax day, the day tax forms must be mailed to the Internal Revenue \nService, to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November--\nelection day. In this way our citizens will have fresh in their minds \nthe substantive importance of voting at the same time they are to \nexercise their right to vote. Voter participation will increase as \neffective information increases, and thus so will the accountability of \nelected officials, as was intended by our Founders.\n  There will be no cost to the Treasury because this bill moves the \nfiscal year into accord with the calendar year at the same time that it \nmoves tax day. But there will be a significant impact on our form of \ngovernment. Members of Congress will be put in closer touch with the \npeople, to the vast improvement of democracy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation as we attempt to \nfoster responsible voter conduct and responsible government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \n        Wellstone):\n  S. 585. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Treasury to abate the accrual of \ninterest on income tax underpayments by taxpayers located in \nPresidentially declared disaster areas if the Secretary extends the \ntime for filing returns and payment of tax for such returns; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                     income tax relief legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senators Daschle,\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\nWellstone, and Johnson in introducing legislation to provide much-\nneeded income tax relief for North and South Dakotans and others \npummeled by the severe blizzards and flooding this spring in the Upper \nMidwest. This legislation builds upon the good work started by the \nInternal Revenue Service [IRS] last week.\n  About a week ago, the Internal Revenue Service announced that \ntaxpayers living in counties recently declared a disaster area by the \nPresident will be able to delay filing their Federal income tax returns \nuntil May 30, 1997, without facing a late filing or payment penalty. \nClearly this is significant relief for those who may be prevented from \nfiling their tax returns by the April 15, 1997 due date because of the \nrecent blizzard and flooding in our part of the country.\n  In its announcement, however, the IRS stated that it did not have the \nauthority to waive any interest charges accruing on delayed payments \nmade between April 15, 1997 and May 30, 1997. It makes no sense to \nimpose interest charges for payments occurring after the original due \ndate, when the IRS itself says--and I think properly so--that it will \nextend the time for filing income tax returns and payments by taxpayers \nlocated in a Presidentially-declared disaster area. In my opinion, the \nIRS's action properly suggests that income tax return filing and \npayments made before the new date should not be treated as late. It is \njust that simple, and our legislation reflects this point.\n  Specifically, our legislation requires the IRS to abate the \nassessment of interest on underpayment by taxpayers in Presidentially-\ndeclared disaster areas if the IRS acts to extend the period of time \nfor filing income tax returns and paying income tax by taxpayers in \nsuch areas. The legislation would apply to all Presidentially-declared \ndisasters announced after December 31, 1996.\n  Once again, the IRS wisely and promptly granted an extension for \nNorth Dakotans and others to file their income tax returns due to \nflood-and snow-related emergencies without facing late filing and \npayment penalties. But the IRS has been prevented from doing more by \nstatute. Our legislation remedies this problem in the case of IRS \nextensions due to Presidential disaster declarations.\n  We intend to advance this proposal at the first available opportunity \nin the U.S. Senate. We urge our colleagues to support this important \ninitiative to provide income tax relief for those affected by this \nyear's weather-related disasters and for those living in disaster areas \nin the future.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Dorgan on \nthe introduction of legislation authorizing the Internal Revenue \nService to waive interest on late payments of taxes in Presidentially-\ndeclared disaster areas. The IRS currently has authority to waive \npenalties for late tax filings following natural disasters. Last week, \nit did so in the Dakotas and part of Minnesota in response to the \nsevere flooding in the region. However, the IRS does not now have \nparallel authority for waiving interest in these circumstances.\n  A number of South Dakotans have raised questions about the disparate \ntreatment of penalties and interest. If taxpayers deserve more time to \nfile and pay their taxes due to a natural disaster, why should they be \ncharged 9 percent interest, a rate many would consider punitive, on \nthese same taxes? Senator Dorgan's bill would address this apparent \nanomaly in our tax laws and help numerous flood victims who are too \nbusy securing their homes, businesses, and communities to file on time. \nSome of these people have been physically prevented from obtaining tax \nforms by the rising flood waters.\n  For this reason, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Dorgan's \nlegislation, and I thank him for his leadership on this pressing \nmatter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Byrd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Roth, Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Dodd, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Gregg, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Reed, and \n        Ms. Collins):\n  S. 586. A bill to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 the istea reauthorization act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise with Senators Lautenberg and Lieberman and a \ndistinguished group of my colleagues today to introduce the ISTEA \nReauthorization Act of 1997. This bill is designed to reauthorize, with \nsome modifications and improvements, the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991. ISTEA is an innovative law that \naddresses the fundamental imbalance in national transportation \ninvestment, and in so doing, serves to promote intermodalism, improve \nmobility and access to jobs, protect the environment, empower local \ncommunities, and enhance transportation safety.\n  ISTEA spurred the Federal Government and the States to invest their \ntransportation dollars in whatever modes were most efficient for moving \npeople and goods and to solicit the input of local communities in \nplanning those investments. The result was a dramatic increase in \ninvestment in maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roads and \nbridges, in mass transit, and in creative approaches to our \ntransportation needs, from bicycle and pedestrian paths to ferry boats.\n  When I introduced the original ISTEA legislation in 1991, I had only \nfour Senate cosponsors--Quentin Burdick of North Dakota, Steve Symms of \nIdaho, John Chafee of Rhode Island, and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. \nThe bill I introduce today has broad bipartisan and grassroots support, \nwith 31 Senate cosponsors from across the country joining me. We have \nlearned a lot over the last 6 years.\n  In 1991, my House counterpart Robert A. Roe of New Jersey, then \nchairman of the Public Works Committee, and I had hoped to develop a \nFederal highway bill that would mark the end of the era of interstate \nhighway construction. That era had brought the nationwide, multilane, \nlimited access highway system, as first envisioned at the General \nMotors Futurama exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair, and then advanced in \n1944 by President Roosevelt. The New York State Thruway was the \nsystem's first segment. In fact, the civil engineer who built it, \nBertram Tallamy, left Albany in 1956 to start up the national program \nin Washington with funding from a dedicated tax proposed by President \nEisenhower and approved by Congress that year.\n  But by 1991 the interstate system was essentially done and Chairman \nRoe and I confronted the question, ``What now?''\n  We developed three principles for the first highway bill to mark the \npost-interstate era. First, the primary objective was to improve \nefficiency of the transportation system we already had. Second, the \ntime had come to turn the initiative in transportation matters back to \nthe States and cities. Third, transit was to be an option for cities.\n  I am proud to say we achieved our three principles and more.\n  The Interstate Highway System left a big mark on American cities, \nwhere the majority of the funds were spent. I wrote in The Reporter in \n1960:\n\n       It is not true, as is sometimes alleged, that the sponsors \n     of the interstate program ignored the consequences it would \n     have in the cities. Nor did they simply acquiesce in them. \n     They exulted in them . . . This rhapsody startled many of \n     those who have been concerned with the future of the American \n     city. To undertake a vast program of urban highway \n     construction with no thought for other forms of \n     transportation seemed lunatic.\n\n  The results often were. American cities were cruelly split, their \ncharacter and geography changed forever, with interstate highways \nrunning through once-thriving working class neighborhoods from Newark \nto Detroit to Miami. Homes and jobs were dispersed to the outlying \nsuburbs and beyond. The wreckage was something to see. Some cities have \nused ISTEA funds to try to repair the damage where they could, using \nfunds for transit--even bike and pedestrian paths--instead of more road \nbuilding. Or with plans such as Boston's Central Artery, a project\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\nthat will reunite some of that city's most historic and colorful \nneighborhoods, separated for almost 40 years by an elevated highway.\n  Today, I ask that we continue to build upon our success with ISTEA, \nchanging it only as needed. The bill we introduce today retains the \nbasic structure of ISTEA, which distributes funds primarily on needs \nbalanced with such factors as historical shares, but updates outmoded \nformulas and streamlines the equity adjustment programs. The ISTEA \nReauthorization Act of 1997 also increases flexibility for States by \nallowing them to use some of their transportation funding to support \nAmtrak. This is the first step this year in meeting our commitment to \naddress Amtrak's long-term funding needs.\n\n  The ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 reauthorizes all the program \ncategories of the original legislation--the National Highway System, \nthe Interstate Maintenance Program, the Highway Bridge Rehabilitation \nand Replacement Program, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nImprovement Program, the Surface Transportation Program, the Interstate \nHighway Reimbursement Program, and the Transportation Enhancements \nProgram--at a total funding level of $26 billion, which can be fully \nsupported by the Highway Trust Fund.\n  While the ISTEA Reauthorization Act increases funding for all the \nprogram categories, I want to mention three programs in more detail. \nThe bill strengthens the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nImprovement Program, funding it at $2 billion annually, with a portion \nof the authorized amount to be distributed on the basis of population \nresiding in fine particulate non-attainment areas. The CMAQ program, \nwhich has allowed States and municipalities to find creative solutions \nto improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion, has been an \nISTEA success story, resulting in impressive improvement in U.S. air \nquality over the last few years.\n  The bill also increases funding for the Highway Bridge Rehabilitation \nand Replacement Program to $3.75 billion per year. The success of the \nBridge Program is dramatic--in four years, there has been a 15 percent \ndrop in deficient bridges--from 111,200 in 1990 to 94,800 in 1994. I \nbelieve broad consensus exists to strengthen this important program \nthat has already done so much to preserve our existing bridge \ninfrastructure.\n  Finally, the ISTEA Reauthorization Act fully funds the Interstate \nHighway Reimbursement Program at $2 billion per year. The Federal-Aid \nHighway Act of 1956 provided for the Federal Government to fund the \nconstruction of the Interstate Highway System with a Federal-State \nshare of 90-10. At that time a number of States had, at their own \nexpense, already constructed a total of 10,859 miles of highways that \nlater became part of the Interstate System.\n  As a result, Congress tasked the Bureau of Public Roads with \ndetermining the cost of reimbursing States for those segments, and the \nBureau arrived at a figure of $5 billion in 1957 dollars. ISTEA used \nthat figure, adjusted to $30 billion in 1991 dollars, and established a \n15-year repayment schedule. The ISTEA Reauthorization Act retains this \nprogram, which is a matter of basic equity and provides urgently needed \nfunds for those highways that are the oldest and among the most heavily \nused portions of the Interstate System.\n  These programs are essentially, but I do hope that as Congress \nconsiders reauthorization of ISTEA, we can ask the question once again, \n``What now?''\n  Congress must focus on increasing the U.S. investment in \ntransportation infrastructure. The United States has watched our \nEuropean and Asian competitors finance and build innovative \ntransportation infrastructure that is the envy of the world. As the \nbudget process gets underway this year, we will need innovative \nfinancing ideas to leverage scarce Federal dollars and address our \nchronic multi-billion dollar underinvestment in U.S. roads, bridges, \nrails, ports, and transit systems.\n  We must also search for new technologies and innovations--like \nMagnetic-Levitation trains [maglev] and Intelligent Transportation \nSystems [ITS]--to solve our congestion and air quality problems without \npouring ever more concrete. The railroad represents an early 19th \ncentury technology, the automobile an early 20th century technology; we \nneed new modes of transportation for the next century.\n  Today, maglev trains run in Bremen, but not in New York, where the \nmaglev concept was first conceived in 1960 by a young Brookhaven \nscientist, James Powell, as he sat mired in traffic on the Bronx-\nWhitestone Bridge. In truth, today most of the meager Federal \ntransportation research and development resources are going for \nimprovements in existing highways, and not into other modes such as \nrail and transit, where I suspect we can achieve much greater economic \nand environmental returns.\n  As we determine the course for this bill, I also wish to address the \nso-called donor State issue. To distribute Federal transportation funds \nprimarily upon the ability of each State to collect fuel taxes, as \nadvocated by representatives of the donor States, would run counter to \nwhole concept of federalism, which is based on collecting national \nresources to address national needs. When California has an earthquake, \nor Florida has a hurricane, or the Mississippi River floods its banks, \nthe entire Nation addresses these needs, without considering whether \nthe needed funds were raised in the affected States. Every other \nFederal program--from crop supports to water reclamation projects to \nairport improvement grants--distributes funds on the basis of need.\n\n  For example, in response to the Savings & Loan crisis, the Resolution \nTrust Corp. was formed to help bail out depositors, but each State did \nnot contribute according to the amount of dollars lost in that State. \nIf such an approach had been taken, Texas alone would have faced costs \nof over $26 billion, while the cost to New York would have been only $3 \nbillion. Under our Federal system, which allocates national resources \nto meet national needs, the taxpayers of New York shouldered a \nsignificant portion of Texas's burden. The cosponsors of the ISTEA \nReauthorization Act, most of them from donor States in the larger \nscheme of the balance of Federal payments, reject the idea that \ngasoline taxes should be distributed according to where they are \ncollected.\n  Furthermore, some of the highway bill proposals put forth this year, \nwhich distribute up to 60 percent of transportation funding on the \nbasis of where the gas taxes were collected, thwart our national \nenvironmental efforts. These bills reward States with high gas \nconsumption, and punish States that conserve fuel and invest in mass \ntransit. Under these proposals, a State that invests in a new bus or \nrail line, or in other improvements that reduce traffic congestion and \nimprove air quality, would receive less transportation money as gas \nconsumption falls.\n  As a Nation we have made clean air and reduced dependence on foreign \noil two major priorities--these bills threaten to undo the progress we \nhave made. In 1944, the United States exported oil. In 1956, we \nimported only 11.5 percent of consumption. Today, we import nearly 50 \npercent of the oil we consume. It could be said that the biggest single \neffect of the Interstate Highway System has been in the field of \nAmerican foreign policy. We are a nation that absolutely must have \nforeign oil, and must shape our defense and foreign policies \naccordingly. We must strive to keep that dependency to a minimum. The \nsponsors of the ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 are committed to that \ngoal.\n  We are also committed to working with other Members, including our \ndistinguished colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure \nSubcommittee, Senators Warner and Baucus, who have both put forth their \nown proposals for reauthorizing ISTEA. Each coalition's bill reflects, \nto a greater or lesser extent, the interests of its own member States \nand regions, and I am confident that all will ultimately contribute to \na transportation bill that best serves the Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ISTEA Reauthorization \nAct of 1997 legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 586\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n     1991 (Public Law 102-240) (referred to in this section as \n     ``ISTEA'') was the result of a bipartisan and multiregional \n     consensus to change transportation policy by giving States \n     and localities more flexibility in spending Federal funds \n     while still pursuing important national goals;\n       (2) the Federal Government has an important role to play in \n     helping to fund transportation improvements and ensuring that \n     a national focus remains on national goals such as mobility, \n     connectivity and integrity of the transportation system, \n     safety, research, air quality, global and national economic \n     competitiveness, and improved quality of life;\n       (3) this role as funding partner and policy-maker--\n       (A) should nurture State and local flexibility in using \n     funds to solve problems creatively; and\n       (B) should relieve the States of burdensome regulation and \n     review procedures that slow down project implementation \n     without adding value;\n       (4)(A) the economic health of the United States and of the \n     metropolitan and rural areas in the United States depends \n     on--\n       (i) a strong transit program funded above fiscal year 1997 \n     levels; and\n       (ii) dedicated support for intercity passenger rail; and\n       (B) this Act should be accompanied by companion legislation \n     to provide for the needs described in subparagraph (A);\n       (5) the funding programs authorized by ISTEA were visionary \n     and will continue to influence transportation into the \n     future;\n       (6) the partnerships between the Federal Government and \n     State and local governments, and between the public and \n     private sectors, that were reaffirmed and strengthened by \n     ISTEA are helping to improve transportation investment and \n     transportation policy choices; and\n       (7) it is in the interest of the United States as a whole \n     to--\n       (A) reauthorize ISTEA in 1997 with refinements but without \n     significant changes, and without eliminating current funding \n     categories;\n       (B) authorize the maximum feasible level of funding for \n     ISTEA programs;\n       (C) allocate these funds among the States based primarily \n     on need, with adjustments to be considered to reflect--\n       (i) system usage;\n       (ii) system extent; and\n       (iii) historic distribution patterns;\n       (D) preserve and strengthen the partnerships among the \n     Federal Government, State governments, local governments, and \n     the private sector;\n       (E) minimize prescriptive Federal regulation that is \n     unnecessary and eliminate regulatory duplication between the \n     Federal Government and State governments;\n       (F) increase flexibility to address intermodal projects; \n     and\n       (G) provide a separate adequately funded transit program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, it is an honor for me to join today with \nfour of the giants of the first ISTEA--Senators Moynihan, Chafee, \nLautenberg, and Lieberman to support the ISTEA Reauthorization Act, the \nreauthorization of the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act. Their vision of how we should shape transportation in \nthis country in the postinterstate era is why we are here today to \ncarry that vision into the next century.\n  The economic power of California and this Nation can only be \nunleashed if we invest in the means to get our workers to their jobs \nand our exports into international trade. This legislation not only \nwill accomplish that vital goal but it will do so without leaving our \nenvironment in worst shape for generations to come.\n  At this time, Senator Moynihan's bill best meets the goals that I \nhave set for rewriting our surface transportation law. It is the best \napproach for California, which contributes more in Federal gas taxes \nthan any other State. While this legislation is not what I will expect \nin a final bill, it is the best horse for California out of the \nstarting gate.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues in committee to add \nprovisions important to my State, including adding my legislation to \nprovide Federal investment in border infrastructure to relieve border \nchoke points resulting from increased trade. Senator Moynihan knows \nthis is a key issue for the border States.\n  Let me tell you briefly why this bill is the best for California \nright now:\n  First and foremost, this bill recognizes the responsibility that \ntransportation bears to environmental protection by preserving the \nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. Nearly 26 million of \nCalifornia's 33 million residents live in an area that fails to meet \none or more of the EPA's air quality standards. CMAQ must be preserved \nas a separate program targeted to those areas that need alternative \ntransportation choices.\n  The bill also anticipates the adoption of new standards that will \nincrease CMAQ funding for new nonattainment areas while protecting the \nfunding levels of current areas. In addition, the bill preserves \nfunding for areas that are in maintenance status, a measure that I \nauthored in the 1995 National Highway System Designation Act to help \nthese areas continue their path toward improved air quality.\n  Second, the bill uses up to date factors such as actual vehicle use \nand current population estimates in determining the highway funding \ncategories. Those factors help raise California's share of funding. I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues in the committee for a fairer \nshare of the transportation funds for California, but this is a good \nstart.\n  Third, the bill continues the Bridge Rehabilitation and Repair \nProgram. In 1994, after the Northridge disaster, my colleagues here \nsupported my bill that permitted this program to fund seismic retrofit \nprojects without needing some other kind of repair first. This program \nis unique in that it permits such funding for local bridges.\n  Last, but not least, this bill carries the torch for the basic \nframework of ISTEA. I have heard from my local governments north to \nsouth in California that ISTEA works. Some change, yes. But the basic \nintegrity of this law is sound. I agree with them, and I am proud to \njoin the ``ISTEA works team.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nPatrick Moynihan, Senator Joseph Lieberman, and 32 other Senators to \nintroduce the ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997. This bill recognizes \nthe success of the 1991 law, the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act, by reauthorizing it with no major changes.\n  Mr. President, 17 Governors endorsed a statement of principles for \nthe next surface transportation law that strongly affirmed ISTEA's \ngoals and effectiveness in ensuring a sound national transportation \ninfrastructure. Included in those goals were these statements: Maintain \nthe course set by ISTEA; reauthorize ISTEA with simplification and \nrefinement but without significant changes; allocate funds to states \nprimarily based on needs; retain the Federal Government's role as a key \ntransportation partner to help fund highway, bridge, and transit \nprojects and to assure that a national focus remains on mobility, \nconnectivity, uniformity, integrity, safety, and research. Their \nmessage was, plain and simple, ISTEA works.\n  Over the past few months, many others, from coast to coast, have \nsounded that message. Some are in the transportation business, others, \nsuch as mayors, county officials, and environmentalists are not. The \ndrumbeat has sounded, that ISTEA works.\n  I strongly support that message. ISTEA was bold and innovative, and \nchanged the way we think and make decisions about transportation. It \nbrought the public into the process. It requires sound planning. It \npromotes energy efficient transportation, research and development. It \nstrengthens safety.\n  It recognizes that the goal of a transportation system is how best to \nmove goods and people, efficiently and effectively.\n  Mr. President, ISTEA has worked across this Nation, as witnessed by \nthe 32 cosponsors from 17 States. ISTEA has also worked for my home \nState of New Jersey. ISTEA could not have had a better laboratory than \nNew Jersey. New Jersey is a corridor State, linking commerce and travel \nto the Northeast and the rest of the country. New Jersey has the \nhighest vehicle density of any State in the United States. Thousands of \nheavy duty trucks, only half of which are not registered in New Jersey, \nuse New Jersey's roads.\n  It is a commuter State, heavily reliant on mass transit. New Jersey's \ntransportation infrastructure is heavily used and is significantly \nolder than many other State's. We as a State have had to be creative in \nfinding ways to maintain the condition of the infrastructure, while \nimproving mobility and promoting sound planning.\n  Improving mobility reduces congestion, which in turn, improves air \nquality and makes our highways safer. This means that our time is not \nspent in long commutes to work or stuck in traffic. We need to remember \nwhy sensible transportation funding and planning is important. It's not \nto satisfy some special interest. It's to remember that sound \ntransportation systems help cope with growing communities--our \nneighborhoods. Sound transportation systems help to improve mobility to \ntransport freight and promote domestic and international commerce, \nmaking our economy more efficient and creating jobs--our businesses. \nSound transportation systems help to improve air quality and protect \nthe environment--our personal health. In short, transportation can, and \nshould, help develop liveable communities and create a better way of \nlife.\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\n  Mr. President, ISTEA was the first step toward this goal. The ISTEA \nReauthorization Act of 1997 is the next logical step to launch our \nNation's transportation system into the 21st century.\n  The bill we are introducing today recognizes that current levels of \ntransportation investment fall short of needs, so it increases \nauthorized transportation funding over 6 years and continues the \nemphasis on preservation and maintenance of transportation systems.\n\n  The bill continues to support the scientifically proven link between \ntransportation and air quality by bolstering the Congestion Mitigation \nand Air Quality Program.\n  The bill supports allocating transportation funds based on need, by \ncontinuing the bridge program without any changes.\n  The bill increases flexibility by making Amtrak eligible for certain \nhighway funds, and maintains the flexibility for transit.\n  And, the bill recognizes special needs of States with both low and \nhigh density populations, by providing additional funding.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to comment on the effort to revise \nour national highway program to ensure that each State receives \nallocations based on a certain percentage of its gas tax contributions \nto the highway trust fund--the donor-donee issue. This is the wrong way \nto think about transportation funding. It is in the national interest \nto have a Federal transportation policy with national goals. That's how \nwe promote interstate and international commerce, further economic \nproductivity, protect the environment, and ensure safety. That's why \ndecisions to allocate Federal transportation funding should be based on \nneed, not on a State's contribution to the highway trust fund. We do \nnot allocate airport improvement program funds based on the amount of \nticket tax that is collected in each State. No Federal programs work \nthat way.\n  However, if we choose to approach the issue in that context, then we \nmust first recognize each State's return on the Federal dollar for all \nFederal programs. New Jersey receives only 68 cents of return on the \nFederal dollar--second to last, just ahead of Connecticut. New \nJerseyans collectively contribute $15 billion more in Federal payments \nthan they receive--that's more than $1,800 per resident.\n  Mr. President, if we were to adopt an across-the-board rule to \nrequire 95 percent return on Federal dollars, consider what would \nhappen if we apply that test to other programs. New Jersey would then \nreceive $169 million more for agriculture subsidies, $2.1 billion more \nof defense spending, and about $55 million more for child and family \nhealth services funding.\n  Mr. President, national transportation funding should continue to be \nallocated based on national goals and State needs like other Federal \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, ISTEA has worked for our cities, our counties, our \nenvironment, and for economic development. Let us build on the success \nof the past and not turn the clock back on transportation progress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 6 years ago, thanks to the leadership of \nSenators Moynihan and C0hafee, this Nation made a fundamental change in \nthe way that it allocates public investment in transportation. That \nchange was based on the premises that local people understand local \nneeds, that funding should be flexible, and that transportation should \ncontribute to meeting national environmental and public health goals.\n  I made a commitment to myself and to Vermonters that I would only \nsponsor legislation that embodies those three premises. Today I \nannounce that I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the ISTEA \nReauthorization Act of 1997, and I look forward to doing whatever I can \nto ensure that this progressive legislation makes it through the Senate \nand into law.\n  This bill maintains and enhances our transportation commitments in \nways that will benefit Vermonters. I fought hard to include the \nprovision that will allow the State of Vermont the flexibility to use \nFederal funds for Amtrak service. Our small State has two successful \nAmtrak trains, both of which operate because of the leadership shown by \nGovernor Dean and the legislature. If this provision passes it will \nmean that Amtrak service in Vermont can be maintained and possibly even \nexpanded.\n  This bill also protects transportation flexibility that has been so \npopular in Vermont. It maintains the recreational trails and scenic \nbyways programs, and allows States to continue to use funds for bicycle \ntransportation and pedestrian walkways. I will continue to fight for \nthese programs in the coming months.\n  Finally, this bill will bring more resources to Vermont. Out small \nState lies on a major north-south truck route. Much of this traffic \npasses through Vermont without stopping for fuel. Consequently, our \nroads get a lot of the wear and tear that goes along with commerce, \nwithout the accompanying gas tax receipts. This legislation provides \nVermont with a major boost in highway funding, so that we can better \nmaintain and repair our existing roads.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who have not yet done \nso to join me and the bipartisan group of 32 other Senators who have \ncommitted themselves to the ISTEA reauthorization bill of 1997.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I'm delighted to join with Senator \nMoynihan and Senators Lautenberg, Chafee, Dodd, and numerous other \ncolleagues to introduce the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Reauthorization Act of l997.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I was \nproud to have worked hard with Senator Moynihan and others to craft \nISTEA in l991. Without a doubt, ISTEA was the most significant and \ninnovative transportation legislation of a generation. It recognized \nthat our Nation is now reaching a maturing system of transportation. \nWith our Interstate system built, ISTEA moved us to also focus on \nmaintenance, intermodalism, efficiency, funding flexibility, and \nenvironmental protection.\n  So often today we hear complaints about laws and programs that don't \nwork. ISTEA is a law that has worked and is working--very well. It's \none area where we don't need to reinvent government--we did that in \nl991 when we adopted ISTEA. That's why Governors, mayors, county \nofficials, guilders unions, environmental groups, planners, businessmen \nand women, and others are telling us to reauthorize the law with \nminimal change. That was the resounding message I heard in Connecticut \nat a forum yesterday from a broad range of interests.\n  Let me spend a few minutes reviewing why ISTEA is so important.\n  In a very unique way, ISTEA combines this country's long-standing \ncommitment to our national priorities--a national system of \ntransportation central to our economic growth and our commitment to \nprotecting and enhancing our environment--with a new emphasis on \nresponding to local conditions, priorities, and interests and involving \nthe public in this decisionmaking process.\n  The statement of policy that introduces ISTEA reminds us that the \neconomic health of the country depends on access to an efficient \ntransportation system. It reads as follows:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to develop a national \n     intermodal transportation system that is economically \n     efficient and environmentally sound, provides the foundation \n     for the nation to compete in the global economy and will move \n     people and goods in an efficient manner.\n\n  ISTEA's commitment to a national transportation system includes \ndedicated sources of funding to preserve, restore, and rehabilitate our \nInterstate highways and bridges. In many areas of the country, like my \nown, our infrastructure is older and densely traveled. We need \ndedicated sources of funding for these programs to help ensure an \nefficient transportation system for our entire Nation.\n  Second, ISTEA recognized that there is an inextricable link between \ntransportation and the quality of our environment, particularly our air \nquality. Automobiles are a large contributor to our smog, carbon \nmonoxide, and particulate matter pollution. As Americans drive more and \nmore miles, the pollution control gains from cleaner cars get wiped \nout.\n  The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program is one \nof the most innovative programs created under ISTEA. It is providing $1\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\nbillion per year for projects to reduce air pollution. These funds are \nbeing used to help States restore air quality to healthy levels. This \nprogram is the opposite of the so-called unfunded mandates--it provides \nFederal funds to help meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. In \nConnecticut where our air quality is so bad, this program provides an \nimportant source of funding to help us move toward clean air. Stamford, \nGreenwich, and Norwalk, for example, made innovative use of these \nfunds. Our bill would substantially increase funding for this program.\n\n  While recognizing these national priorities, ISTEA also makes nearly \none-half of all funds available for State and local decisionmaking. The \ntransportation needs of Connecticut are different from the needs of \nMontana, and this program allows each area to decide what's right for \nthem, again, within the context of protecting a national transportation \nsystem. And for the first time, it allowed local decisionmakers to \nspend funds on either highways or transit. This leveling of the playing \nfield between transit and highways is very important for many areas of \nthe country, including my own.\n  ISTEA also created a popular program known as Transportation \nEnhancements which provides a small amount of funding to mitigate some \nof the negative effects transportation has caused for our local \ncommunities. I heard yesterday at a forum in Connecticut how funds were \nused from this program to restore a recreational and open space \ncorridor along the abandoned right of way of the former Farmington \nCanal and the Boston and Main Railroad. This project was selected as \none of the Nation's 25 best enhancement projects. We've also used funds \nfrom this program to help restore some of our coastal wetlands, to \nprotect and enhance the landscape of our famous Merritt Parkway and for \nthe restoration of the Route 8 and Route 15 interchanges.\n  We should also not forget the important process changes made by \nISTEA. The law gave local decisionmakers and the public a much greater \nrole in making the transportation decisions that so affect their \ncommunities. In Connecticut, mayors and other local elected officials \nstrongly support this approach. In fact, I heard from mayors at a forum \nyesterday that ISTEA's planning provisions have led to greater \ncooperation between central cities and their suburban neighbors on a \nwide variety of issues--extending beyond transportation.\n  Unfortunately, despite ISTEA's record of achievement, our efforts to \nreauthorize it will not be easy. ISTEA is under attack. A significant \nnumber of Senators already support proposals which would eliminate many \nof the fundamental bases of ISTEA, including much of our commitment to \na national transportation system. Instead, these proposals would turn \nmuch of the program into essentially a block grant, where I'm concerned \nour national priorities for our transportation system would be lost. \nThe funds would be distributed based on how much money each State is \ncontributing to the Highway Trust Fund in gasoline taxes rather than \nlooking to the Nation's infrastructure needs and also focusing funding \non those systems that require preservation and enhancement. In short, \nthese proposals would largely abandon the Federal role in \ntransportation which is so essential to support national economic \ngrowth, global competitiveness, and the quality of life in our \ncommunities.\n  I congratulate my friend and colleague Senator Moynihan and his staff \nfor their outstanding work in putting this bill together. I look \nforward to working with him and my other colleagues as we move through \nthis process.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending Senator Moynihan and \nthe other bipartisan sponsors for their leadership on this important \nissue. The stakes are very high. The strength of our economy is \ndirectly tied to the quality of our transportation. This is no time to \nturn back the clock on ISTEA and its well-balanced commitment to seven \nkey points: Highways; public transit; environmental protection; \nbikeways, recreational trails, and historic preservation; computerized \ntraffic management; safety; and a strong voice for local communities in \nthe allocation of funds.\n  In all of these areas, ISTEA has worked well and deserves to be \ncontinued.\n  This is our reply to the STEP 21 coalition and the Western coalition. \nTheir proposals are blatant schemes to gerrymander the funding formula \nagainst our States and undermine other key aspects of ISTEA, and \nthey're not acceptable.\n  They say their States should get back from the Treasury in ISTEA \nfunds what they pay into the Treasury in gas tax revenues. But that \nkind of tunnel vision is distorting this debate. It's wrong to focus \nnarrowly just on transportation spending versus gas tax revenues. The \nonly fair comparison is between overall Federal spending that goes into \na State, and the overall Federal tax revenues that come from that \nState.\n  By that standard, our States are donor States. We send more to \nWashington than we get back in return. The States complaining the \nloudest about not getting their fair share of Federal transportation \ndollars are huge net winners in the overall picture. They get back far \nmore in Federal spending than they pay into the Treasury. And they're \ntrying to grab even more through ISTEA. I say, they should keep their \nhands out of the ISTEA cookie jar.\n  We have enormous transportation needs in our States, and those needs \ndeserve strong Federal support. Working together, we intend to do all \nwe can to chart a fair transportation course for the coming years. I \nlook forward to that challenge and to our successful efforts together.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague \nfrom New York, Senator Moynihan, and Senator Lautenberg, Senator \nLieberman, and many others today to introduce the ISTEA Reauthorization \nAct of 1997. This law builds on the success of the last 6 years of \nISTEA, and will guide more than $175 billion in Federal highway \nspending over the next 6 years.\n  Few laws we enact this year will have as much of an immediate and \nsignificant affect on our economy than the ISTEA reauthorization bill. \nThe transportation industry employs 12 million people, consumes 20 \npercent of total household spending, and accounts for 11 percent of our \nNation's total economic activity. Highways are the most important \ncomponent of our transportation infrastructure, and their use is \ngrowing. Between 1984 and 1994, U.S. motor vehicle travel increased \n37.5 percent.\n  Over the past 6 years, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and \nEfficiency Act has provided the basis for a strong Federal-State-local \npartnership to help the Nation meet its transportation needs. It has \ndirected $157 billion into highways, mass transit, and related \ntransportation priorities nationwide. It is one of the most successful \nintergovernmental partnerships in American history. Under ISTEA, we \ncompleted the system of Interstate and Defense Highways begun by \nPresident Eisenhower 40 years ago, defined the National Highway System \nthat will help prioritize highway improvements for decades to come, and \ncoordinated planning among different transportation modes.\n  ISTEA has improved the capacity and overall condition of our \ntransportation infrastructure. According to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, our highways and bridges are in better shape than they \nwere a few years ago. Our environment is in better condition too, \nthanks to ISTEA innovations like the congestion mitigation and air \nquality and transportation enhancement programs.\n  Despite our success, we continue to face enormous challenges over the \nnext 6 years to maintain and improve our highways and bridges. Over \nthis time, it will cost an estimated $148.5 billion just to maintain \nthe current physical conditions of our highways. Every year, we must \nrenew 100,000 miles of highways in order to maintain current pavement \nconditions.\n  My own State of Illinois will need several billion dollars to repair \naging roads and bridges. According to some estimates, nearly 43 percent \nof Illinois roads need repair, and almost one-fourth of Illinois \nbridges are in substandard condition. Every year, Illinois motorists \npay an estimated $1 billion\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\nin vehicle wear and tear and other expenses associated with poor road \nconditions.\n  In Chicago, the transportation hub of the Nation, the traffic flow on \nsome of the major arterial highways has increased seven-fold since they \nwere built in the 1950's and 1960's. According to a recent study, \nChicago is the fifth most congested city in the Nation. The typical \nChicago-area driver wastes 34 hours every year sitting still in traffic \njams, and pays $470 a year in lost time and wasted fuel.\n  In order to meet the transportation infrastructure needs of Illinois \nand the Nation, the Federal Government must continue to play a lead \nrole in the ongoing partnership to improve America's highways. If there \nwere ever a legislative case in point for the saying, ``If it's not \nbroken, don't fix it,'' ISTEA is it.\n  The ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 is a simple bill. It builds on \nthe success of the last 6 years. It does not represent a set of major \npolicy changes. It provides a significant increase in funding over \nISTEA levels, updates some of the funding formulas, and increases \nflexibility for States, all within the constructs defined by ISTEA. I \nhope the Environment and Public Works Committee will use this bill as \nthe basis for its deliberations on ISTEA reauthorization, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to join us in sponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  I want to point out that this legislation does not reauthorize the \nmass transit half of ISTEA. That job falls on the Banking Committee. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on the committee and with \nothers who have a strong interest in transit to ensure the next 6 years \nof transit policy also mirror the successful framework of transit \npolicy defined by ISTEA.\n  As we head into the 21st century, we must continue to maintain and \nimprove America's transportation infrastructure. In the global economy, \none of the things that makes our products competitive is our ability to \nmove freight across the country cheaply and efficiently. The ISTEA \nReauthorization Act of 1997 will accomplish that goal by continuing the \nsuccess of ISTEA into the next 6 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

FINDINGS.\n\n  The Senate finds that:\n       (1) The total tax burden on the American family in 1996 was \n     30.4%, the highest level in history;\n       (2) In 1996, one in every three dollars earned in America \n     was paid over in taxes to the federal government;\n       (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in 1997 \n     the federal government will take $1.5 trillion from \n     taxpayers; the highest amount ever;\n       (4) The President's Office of Management and Budget \n     estimates that in 1997, the federal government will take $673 \n     billion from working families, the highest level in history;\n       (5) President Clinton proposed, and the then-Democrat-\n     controlled Congress enacted, a $241 billion tax increase on \n     the American people in 1993--the largest in history.\n       (6) The American family today pays 38.4% of its income in \n     federal, state and local taxes, the highest burden in \n     history.\n       (7) The date on which the American family is free from \n     taxes and begins to keep what it earns is the latest ever--\n     May 7.\n       (8) 56% of all tax returns reporting capital gains came \n     from taxpayers with total incomes below $50,000;\n       (9) Since 1993, the economy has had below average growth--\n     2.5% versus 3.2% in the previous ten years--and productivity \n     has increased at below-average-rates--0.3% versus 1.5% in the \n     previous ten years.\n       (10) The estate tax can be as high as 55%, which is an \n     unjustifiable and confiscatory level of taxation that \n     penalizes work, thrift and entrepreneurship.\n       (11) For three decades, despite spending over 3 billion \n     dollars of taxpayer money, the IRS has failed to create a \n     successfully functioning computer system.\n       (12) The IRS investigated 1,515 employees for unauthorized \n     snooping in taxpayer files, yet of those employees only 23 \n     were fired;\n       (13) The IRS has serious security problems which jeopardize \n     its ability to process taxes, and puts taxpayer information \n     at risk of being misused, changed or destroyed;\n       (14) It is estimated that $200 billion each year is lost to \n     fraud and non-payment of taxes, which the IRS is incapable of \n     finding and collecting.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) In 1997, Congress should provide tax relief for the \n     American people, particularly for families with children, and \n     should cut the capital gains tax, reduce the estate tax \n     burden, and begin moving toward a fairer, simpler tax system.\n       (2) The President should send a detailed plan to Congress \n     by August 1, 1997, addressing the problems with the IRS and \n     proposing an action plan to resolve these problems.\n       (3) In 1997, Congress should pass legislation that imposes \n     criminal penalties for unauthorized snooping in taxpayer \n     files by IRS employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3225-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3225-S3226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 74--RELATIVE TO BUDGET DEFICIT REDUCTION AND TAX \n                                 RELIEF\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for Mr. Daschle) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nas modified by the order of April 11, 1986, with instructions that if \none committee reports, the other committee has 30 days to report or be \ndischarged:\n\n                               S. Res. 74\n\n       Whereas the United States economy continues to expand at a \n     brisk pace after 6 consecutive years of economic growth;\n       Whereas unemployment and inflation continue to remain at \n     the lowest combined rate in 30 years;\n       Whereas median family income is experiencing its fastest \n     growth since the 1960s;\n       Whereas taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product are \n     lower in the United States, at 31.7 percent, than in any of \n     the Group of Seven industrialized countries, the average for \n     which is 36.5 percent;\n       Whereas according to the Congressional Budget Office, \n     Federal taxes as a share of national income are 19.4 percent, \n     the same level as in 1969, and are projected to fall to 18.8 \n     percent in 2002, not including any tax cuts which Congress \n     may yet enact this year;\n       Whereas according to the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     total Federal effective tax rate, including income, payroll, \n     and excise taxes, for a family making $40,000 per year \n     averages 19 percent, of which only 6 percent is attributable \n     to individual income taxes, the lowest of any of the major \n     industrialized countries;\n       Whereas the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has \n     calculated that the typical American generates the income \n     necessary to pay his or her annual Federal personal income \n     tax by January 20th of each year;\n       Whereas strong economic growth, low inflation and \n     unemployment, and declining tax burdens on typical American \n     families have been achieved at the same time that the Federal \n     budget deficit has been reduced by nearly two-thirds;\n       Whereas every Republican Senator voted against the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which cut the deficit by \n     63 percent, lowered interest rates, stimulated job creation, \n     and boosted gains in personal income;\n       Whereas the 1993 budget legislation cut taxes on 15,000,000 \n     workers and their families (40,000,000 Americans) and made 90 \n     percent of small businesses eligible for corporate tax \n     reductions;\n       Whereas President Clinton has submitted to Congress a \n     budget proposal that would further reduce taxes on working \n     families, including tax credits and deductions designed to \n     make post-secondary education and training more affordable;\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office has certified that \n     the President's budget proposal would eliminate the fiscal \n     deficit by 2002, achieving the first budgetary surplus in the \n     United States since 1969;\n       Whereas the principal budget legislation offered in the \n     105th Congress by the Republican majority would make it more \n     difficult to balance the budget by extending $526,000,000,000 \n     of tax cuts over the next 10 years, more than an estimated \n     three-quarters of which would benefit the best-off 20 percent \n     of taxpayers rather than middle class working families;\n       Whereas as many Americans rush to submit their income tax \n     returns to the Internal Revenue Service by April 15, Congress \n     is poised to miss its own April 15 deadline to pass a budget \n     resolution because the Republican majority in the 105th \n     Congress has emphasized symbolic political gestures in \n     connection with the Federal budget rather than the bipartisan \n     construction of legislation to eliminate the deficit; and\n       Whereas the continuing failure by the Republican majority \n     to advance a budget resolution has the effect of withholding \n     from middle-class Americans the tax cuts proposed for them by \n     the President, undermining progress toward a balanced budget, \n     and\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\n     denying the economy the benefit of the lower long-term \n     interest rates that a balanced budget would promote: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Republican majority should take up without delay a budget \n     resolution that balances the budget by 2002, targets its tax-\n     relief on working and middle class families to the same \n     degree as the President's budget proposal, and protects \n     important domestic priorities such as medicare, medicaid, \n     education, and the environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3225-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  THE TAXPAYER PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COVERDELL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 45\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Coverdell, for himself, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Roth, Mr. \nMoynihan, Mr. Mack, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. D'Amato) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 522) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to impose civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized access \nof tax returns and tax return information by Federal employees and \nother persons, and for other purposes;

Mr. President, on the final day for taxpayers to \nfile their tax returns, I think it is appropriate for Congress and the \nAmerican people to assess how well the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] \nis doing managing the collection of 1.4 trillion taxpayer dollars. \nUnfortunately, the answer is not very well. The Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs held a hearing last week on the IRS programs on \nthe General Accounting Office's [GAO] high risk list which identifies \nthose Federal programs most vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement. To the taxpayer's dismay, the IRS made the list six \ntimes. IRS programs have been consistently on GAO's high risk list \nsince its inception in 1990 and GAO has issued over 200 reports in the \npast 5 years critical of the problems at IRS.\n  The problems at IRS are considerable. For example:\n  IRS still can't pass an audit--something that the private sector has \nbeen doing since the 1930's and State governments since the 1980's. \nBecause IRS' financial statements are so poor, it is likely the entire \nGovernment will not be able to pass its first congressionally required \naudit of its financial statements this fall. Shouldn't IRS live up to \nthe same accounting standards it imposes on the taxpayer?\n  For three decades IRS has been attempting to overhaul its outdated \n1960's era computer systems. In its third unsuccessful attempt at \nmodernization, IRS has spent over $3 billion, with very little to show \nfor it. This has become a case study in how not to buy computers.\n  In the area of tax collections, GAO finds that IRS has no real basis \nfor determining how much it is owed or, in any comprehensive sense, by \nwhom. This is important because every dollar owed which is not \ncollected due to inaccurate filing or ineffective collection comes out \nof the pocket of every honest taxpayer.\n  Despite an IRS pledge to have zero-tolerance for snooping by IRS \npersonnel through taxpayer's files, GAO finds that the practice \ncontinues. Only one IRS computer system has a very limited ability to \ndetect snooping. As for the rest of IRS systems and paper files there \nare few controls to protect sensitive taxpayer records from this \ninvasion of privacy.\n  All of IRS' computers are at risk of not operating properly on \nJanuary 1, 2000, because of the antiquated computers' inability to deal \nwith the year 2000 date change. In less than 1,000 days, the collection \nof revenue and the entire tax processing system will be in jeopardy.\n  It is estimated that $200 billion is lost each year to fraud and \nnonpayment of taxes. While IRS caught $131 million in fraudulent \nreturns in 1995, GAO lists filing fraud as a high risk area and it is \nuncertain how many fraudulent returns slip through the system.\n\n  But these concerns are even surpassed by new ones raised by GAO in \nJanuary in a confidential report on IRS security weaknesses which is \nnow being released in very restricted form. IRS has very serious \nphysical and information security problems which jeopardize its ability \nto function and puts taxpayer data at risk of being improperly used, \nchanged, or destroyed. It should concern us all that GAO's findings of \nIRS' vulnerability to security\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nthreats are of such great concern that most of the original report can \nnot be made public.\n  What is at stake here? The confidence of the taxpayer is at stake. \nTax laws must be fairly enforced at the least possible cost and \npersonal intrusion and IRS must meet the standards it expects the \ntaxpayer to meet.\n  Our credibility as the steward of the money we ask the taxpayer to \ncontribute is at stake. Each dollar the Government collects is a dollar \nsomeone else has earned. It is our obligation to make the best use of \nthat dollar, and not waste a cent of it.\n  Finally, at stake is the very ability of government to perform its \nnecessary responsibilities and functions. Without taxpayer confidence \nthat we are collecting money fairly and wisely, our system of \ngovernment is crippled.\n  Taxation in this country has a long and tumultuous history. We are a \nnation founded on a tax revolt and are continuously renewed by a \nhealthy skepticism toward all forms of taxation. It is important to \nremember that it is only with the American people's consent that the \nIRS exists in the first place.\n  As a nation we collect taxes to pay for the responsibilities we have \nassigned to our Government. Right over the entrance to the IRS are the \nwords of Oliver Wendell Holmes: ``Taxes are the price we pay for a \ncivilized society.'' But, recognizing the need to fund government \nresponsibilities does not imply that we should continue with business \nas usual at the IRS. If an agency fails in its fundamental mission, or \nfails to keep its promises to Congress and the American people, we need \nto be prepared to make fundamental changes. I, for one, favor greatly \nsimplifying the Tax Code. A simpler code, fairly administered, will \nhelp to restore the taxpayers' faith in the system. It will also make \nthe system more manageable.\n  In the meantime, it is imperative for IRS to improve its operations. \nIt is outrageous that IRS programs put on GAO's high-risk list remain \nthere year-after-year. GAO testified before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in June of 1991 and described key areas in which IRS needed \nto improve its operations. Six years later, we heard virtually the same \nmessage in the same areas from GAO. What has IRS been doing in the last \n6 years? What has been done to correct systemic management problems at \nIRS?\n  Fortunately, the forces for change may now be coming into place. \nCongress has used its power of the purse to express its dissatisfaction \nwith IRS' computer modernization. A new Commission to Restructure the \nIRS has been formed to address how the Nation collects taxes and the \nadministration has announced a new plan for reform at IRS. The Deputy \nSecretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers, testified before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee last Thursday on this plan. The \nadministration's recognition of many of the problems it faces is a good \nfirst step. However, it is unclear how establishing new layers of \nbureaucracy will improve the situation at IRS. We also need to \nunderstand how giving IRS greater personnel and budgetary flexibilities \nwould enable it to better manage its programs and finances.\n\n  It is necessary for Congress and the administration to work together \nto reform the IRS. As for the next step, the Congress needs more \ndetails on the administration's IRS reform proposals. I plan to work \nwith my colleagues to ensure that a detailed plan is sent to Congress \nas soon as possible to address the IRS' high risk problems. This reform \nplan should be linked to IRS' GPRA strategic plan and should include \nspecific performance measures that will successfully address IRS' high-\nrisk areas.\n  Congress is also taking up today legislation on criminalizing the \nsnooping by IRS employees of confidential taxpayer data. This is an \nissue with a longstanding history at the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. The issue was first brought to light during financial audits \nunder the Chief Financial Officers Act. In 1994, it was thought that \nIRS would address this issue in a comprehensive manner. At last week's \nhearing, GAO found that snooping was still a significant problem. All \nof us are greatly disturbed about reports of lax security and the \nunauthorized browsing by IRS employees of taxpayer information. This \ninvasion of privacy is a breech of public trust and only further lowers \nthe faith of the taxpayer in the fairness of the system.\n  I want to work with the administration and other congressional \ncommittees to implement lasting solutions to identified management \nproblems at IRS and reduce the risks to the taxpayers. Most of these \nproblems have existed for years. I recognize that this administration, \nand previous ones, have tried to solve them. But, time is growing \nshort. The confidence of our citizens is low and the risks are \nhigh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3227-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3228-S3229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JACKIE ROBINSON\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJackie Robinson, a true American hero. Born in Cairo, GA and raised by \na single mother in Pasadena, CA, Jackie Robinson integrated major \nleague baseball 50 years ago today. It was not an easy task. He faced \noutright prejudice from fans, other teams, as well as his own \nteammates. He was cursed and spit upon. It is hard to imagine how one \nman could endure such circumstances. But, he persevered and paved the \nway for young blacks who had long dreamed of wearing a major league \nbaseball uniform. His courageous actions forced all Americans to face \nthe issue of integration, and he helped to jump start the civil rights \nmovement.\n  Jackie Robinson was deservedly elected to the Hall of Fame in 1962, \nhis first year of eligibility. He had a career batting average of .311 \nwith the Dodgers; won the 1949 batting title with a .342; was selected \nas National League MVP in 1949; and named National League Rookie of the \nYear in 1947.\n  As my dear friend, Hank Aaron, wrote in an op-ed piece which ran in \nthe New York Times on Sunday, April 13, 1997, ``Jackie showed me and my \ngeneration what we could do, he also showed us how to do it. By \nwatching him, we knew that we would have to swallow an awful lot of \npride to make it in the big leagues.'' Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron \nnot only made it in the big leagues, but they also succeeded with their \nlives.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the entire text of Hank Aaron's op-ed that \nappeared in the New York Times on April 13, 1997, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 13, 1997]\n\n                         When Baseball Mattered\n\n                            (By Hank Aaron)\n\n       Atlanta.--Jackie Robinson meant everything to me.\n       Before I was a teen-ager, I was telling my father that I \n     was going to be a ballplayer, and he was telling me, ``Ain't \n     no colored ballplayers.'' Then Jackie broke into the Brooklyn \n     Dodgers lineup in 1947, and Daddy never said that again. When \n     the Dodgers played an exhibition game in Mobile, Ala., on \n     their way north the next spring, Daddy even came to the game \n     with me. A black man in a major-league uniform: that was \n     something my father had to see for himself.\n       Jackie not only showed me and my generation what we could \n     do, he also showed us how to do it. By watching him, we knew \n     that we would have to swallow an awful lot of pride to make \n     it in the big leagues. We knew of the hatred and cruelty \n     Jackie had to quietly endure from the fans and the press and \n     the anti-integrationist teams like the Cardinals and the \n     Phillies and even from his teammates. We also knew that he \n     didn't subject himself to all that for personal benefit. Why \n     would he choose to get spiked and cursed at and spat on for \n     his own account?\n       Jackie was a college football hero, a handsome, \n     intelligent, talented guy with a lot going for him. He didn't \n     need that kind of humiliation. And it certainly wasn't in his \n     nature to suffer it silently. But he had to. Not for himself, \n     but for me and all the young black kids like me. When Jackie \n     Robinson loosened his fist and turned the other cheek, he was \n     taking the blows for the love and future of his people.\n       Now, 50 years later, people are saying that Jackie Robinson \n     was an icon, a pioneer, a hero. But that's all they want to \n     do: say it.\n       Nobody wants to be like Jackie. Everybody wants to be like \n     Mike. They want to be like Deion, like Junior.\n       That's O.K. Sports stars are going to be role models in any \n     generation. I'm sure Jackie would be pleased to see how well \n     black athletes are doing these days, how mainstream they've \n     become. I'm sure he would be proud of all the money they're \n     making. But I suspect he'd want to shake some of them until \n     the dollar signs fell from their eyes so they could once \n     again see straight.\n       Jackie Robinson was about leadership. When I was a rookie \n     with the Braves and we came north with the Dodgers after \n     spring training, I sat in the corner of Jackie's hotel room, \n     thumbing through magazines, as he and his black teammates--\n     Roy Campanella,\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\n     Don Newcombe, Junior Gilliam and Joe Black--played cards and \n     went over strategy: what to do if a fight broke out on the \n     field; if a pitcher threw at them; if somebody called one of \n     them ``nigger.''\n       In his later years, after blacks were secure in the game, \n     Jackie let go of his forbearance and fought back. In the \n     quest to integrate baseball, it was time for pride to take \n     over from meekness. And Jackie made sure that younger blacks \n     like myself were soldiers in the struggle.\n       When I look back at the statistics of the late 1950's and \n     60's and see the extent to which black players dominated the \n     National League (the American League was somewhat slower to \n     integrate), I know why that was. We were on a mission. And, \n     although Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, Frank Robinson, Willie \n     Stargell, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson and I were trying to make our \n     marks individually, we understood that we were on a \n     collective mission. Jackie Robinson demonstrated to us \n     that, for a black player in our day and age, true success \n     could not be an individual thing.\n       To players today, however, that's exactly what it is. The \n     potential is certainly there, perhaps more than at any time \n     since Jackie came along, for today's stars to have a real \n     impact on their communities. Imagine what could be \n     accomplished if the players, both black and white, were to \n     really dedicate themselves--not just their money, although \n     that would certainly help--to camps and counseling centers \n     and baseball programs in the inner city.\n       Some of the players have their own charitable foundations, \n     and I applaud them for that. (I believe Dave Winfield, for \n     instance, is very sincere.) But as often as not these good \n     works are really publicity stunts. They're engineered by \n     agents, who are acting in the interest of the player's \n     image--in other words, his marketability. Players these days \n     don't do anything without an agent leading them every step of \n     the way (with his hand out). The agent, of course, could care \n     less about Jackie Robinson.\n       The result is that today's players have lost all concept of \n     history. Their collective mission is greed. Nothing else \n     means much of anything to them. As a group, there's no \n     discernible social conscience among them; certainly no sense \n     of self-sacrifice, which is what Jackie Robinson's legacy is \n     based on. It's a sick feeling, and one of the reasons I've \n     been moving further and further away from the game.\n       The players today think that they're making $10 million a \n     year because they have talent and people want to give them \n     money. They have no clue what Jackie went through on their \n     behalf, or Larry Doby or Monte Irvin or Don Newcombe, or \n     even, to a lesser extent, the players of my generation. \n     People wonder where the heroes have gone. Where there is no \n     conscience, there are no heroes.\n       The saddest thing about all of this is that baseball was \n     once the standard for our country. Jackie Robinson helped \n     blaze the trail for the civil rights movement that followed. \n     The group that succeeded Jackie--my contemporaries--did the \n     same sort of work in the segregated minor leagues of the \n     South. Baseball publicly pressed the issue of integration; in \n     a symbolic way, it was our civil rights laboratory.\n       It is tragic to me that baseball has fallen so far behind \n     basketball and even football in terms of racial leadership. \n     People question whether baseball is still the national \n     pastime, and I have to wonder, too. It is certainly not the \n     national standard it once was.\n       The upside of this is that baseball, and baseball only, has \n     Jackie Robinson. Here's hoping that on the 50th anniversary \n     of Jackie's historic breakthrough, baseball will honor him in \n     a way that really matters. It could start more youth \n     programs, give tickets to kids who can't afford them, become \n     a social presence in the cities it depends on. It could hire \n     more black umpires, more black doctors, more black \n     concessionaries, more black executives.\n       It could hire a black commissioner.\n       You want a name? How about Colin Powell? He's a great \n     American, a man more popular, maybe, than the President. I'm \n     not out there pushing his candidacy, but I think he would be \n     great for baseball. He would restore some social relevance to \n     the game. He would do honor to Jackie Robinson's name.\n       It would be even more meaningful, perhaps, if some of \n     Jackie's descendants--today's players--committed themselves \n     this year to honoring his name, in act as well as rhetoric.\n       Jackie's spirit is watching. I know that he would be \n     bitterly disappointed if he saw the way today's black players \n     have abandoned the struggle, but he would be happy for their \n     success nonetheless. And I have no doubt that he'd do it all \n     over again for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3228-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MUSIC IN OUR SCHOOLS MONTH\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

She was an active member of the National Black \nCaucus of State Legislators, as well as a successful fundraiser for the \nUnited Negro College Fund, raising more than $1 million over the past \n11 years.\n  Representative Stallworth was also a leader on issues related to \npublic utilities.

I know my \ncolleagues will join me in congratulating Alma on her illustrious \ncareer and in wishing her well in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3229-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3229-S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF JACKIE ROBINSON BREAKING BASEBALL'S COLOR \n                                BARRIER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay special tribute to a \nlegendary figure in our Nation's history; Jack Roosevelt Robinson. One \nhalf century ago today, Jackie Robinson stepped out of the dugout \nbefore an Ebbets Field crowd of 30,000 to play first base for the \nBrooklyn Dodgers. In doing so, he became the first African-American to \nplay professional baseball in the modern major leagues.\n  However, Jackie Robinson did not merely break baseball's color \nbarrier, he shattered it in the most spectacular fashion imaginable. He \nwas the first African-American to lead the league in stolen bases, to \nwin the batting title, to play in the All-Star Game, to play in the \nWorld Series, to win the Most Valuable Player Award, and to be inducted \ninto the Hall of Fame.\n  As an ardent baseball fan, I marvel at his accomplishments on the \nfield. As an American, I stand in gratitude for all he did for civil \nrights in this country. The impressive nature of his long litany of \nbaseball firsts is far surpassed by the measure of his exceptional \ncharacter. To be able to bear the brunt of national adversity and \nhostility and still perform with such dignity and grace requires a \ncourage far greater than most could summon.\n  To many, the details of April 15, 1947 are long forgotten. For the \nrecord, in the seventh inning Robinson scored the deciding run in a 5 \nto 3 win over the Boston Braves. When Robinson crossed home plate, it \nwas a victory for his\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nteam, for professional sports, and, indeed, for the entire country. \nJackie Robinson was one of those rare individuals who transcended both \nrace and athletics to become an American hero. It is my hope and belief \nthat his legacy today is as powerful as ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3229-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JACKIE ROBINSON\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, some of the most pivotal events in U.S. \nhistory that have helped eliminate the barriers between white and black \nAmericans have been simple acts that occurred in very common, everyday \nsettings; on a bus, in a diner, and in a school. Today marks the 50th \nanniversary of one of those events, and it also occurred in a common \nand unlikely setting--at a baseball game. On April 15, 1947, the \nBrooklyn Dodgers debuted their new infielder, Jackie Robinson, in a \ngame against the Boston Braves. And by his very presence on that field, \nAmerican society was changed forever.\n  Until that day, professional baseball had been segregated for over 50 \nyears, and no African-American in the 20th century had worn a major \nleague uniform. Segregation had denied many fine black players from \ncompeting side by side with their white counterparts. It was the dream \nof many Negro League stars like Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, and Cool \nPapa Bell to take the field in a major league park and have the chance \nto claim their rightful place in the record books alongside Babe Ruth \nand Ty Cobb. They knew they were good enough, and so did many white \nbaseball executives who saw them play. But until Jackie Robinson, black \nAmericans were kept out of the majors and many of these great players \nnever got the chance to play there.\n  In 1947, Dodgers' manager Branch Rickey ignored the color line and \ngave Jackie Robinson a chance to play. Not because he was black, not \nbecause he could be a symbol for a change in American society, but \nbecause he was a dazzling player who could help the Dodgers win. And he \ndid. In that very first year, Robinson became the National League's \nRookie of the Year. In 1949, he would be named the Most Valuable \nPlayer. In 10 years, he helped Brooklyn capture six National League \nchampionships and one World Series title. He retired with a lifetime \nbatting average of .311 and was named to the Hall of Fame in his first \nyear of eligibility.\n  After his rookie season, he was listed second only to Bing Crosby as \nthe most popular man in America. That is a very interesting fact, for \neven though he clearly captured the hearts and minds of many Americans, \nand no doubt changed the thinking of many others, there were also those \nwho hated him and let him know it with vicious insults, jeers, and \nthreats of physical violence. On the field opposing ballplayers tried \nto spike him on the base paths, and pitchers regularly threw fast balls \nnear his head. Even some of his own teammates asked to be traded when \nthey learned he was being called up from the minors. Off the field he \nsometimes could not join the rest of the Dodgers in the same hotels or \nrestaurants. Jackie Robinson had to endure it all, because he knew if \nhe fought back, if his confidence and calm were rattled, and if he did \nnot perform to the highest athletic level, it could be years before \nanother minority player would be given the same chance. But he used his \ncourage and ability to succeed on every level, proving himself to be \nmuch, much more than just a talented baseball player.\n  How far we have come in terms of racial equality in the half-century \nsince Jackie Robinson's debut is debatable. Black athletes are now \ncommonplace in professional sports, and some, such as basketball star \nMichael Jordan, are among the most successful and instantly \nrecognizable figures in the world. Over the weekend, an amazingly-\ngifted and congenial young man named Tiger Woods became both the first \nAfrican-American and first Asian-American to win the Masters golf \ntournament, breaking down another long-held color barrier.\n  But outside of sports, there are still subtle but daunting barriers \nthat prevent African-Americans, as well as other minorities, from \nachieving equal status in many facets of our culture. Shortly before \nhis death in 1972, Robinson himself was quoted as saying,\n\n       I can't believe that I have it made while so many of my \n     black brothers and sisters are hungry, inadequately housed, \n     insufficiently clothed, denied their dignity, live in slums \n     or barely exist on welfare.\n\n  If he were still alive today, it is likely his opinion would be \nunchanged.\n  But America is a work in progress and there may always be barriers, \nlarge and small, which create inequity in our society. Jackie Robinson \nwas one of the best athletes in the world, and the barrier he broke was \none that prevented him and other black athletes from using their \ntalents for their fullest gain. Jackie Robinson faced that barrier with \ncourage, faith, and dignity. He broke it for himself, but even more \nsignificantly for all those who have followed. That is why he is a hero \nand why we celebrate his memory today. Perhaps the lesson we can learn \nfrom Jackie Robinson's example is that we must face those areas of \ndiscrimination we encounter in our lives, no matter what our racial \nheritage, with the same courage, faith, and dignity. We may never fully \nend discrimination but we can continue working together to eliminate \nthe barriers that remain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3230-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JACKIE ROBINSON\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today, all of America celebrates \nthe 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's courageous entry into major \nleague baseball, an event which foreshadowed and indeed paved the way \nfor the wider integration of American society in the 1950's and 1960's. \nFor the people of Georgia, this celebration has special significance \nbecause Jackie Robinson was born in Cairo, GA, 78 years ago. Last year, \nhis Georgia roots were honored when the Cairo High School named its \nbaseball stadium Jackie Robinson Field.\n  The son of a sharecropper and grandson of a slave, Jackie Robinson \nknew poverty, adversity, and the most overt forms of discrimination. He \nknew especially the lonely burden of having to break the color line in \nbaseball all by himself. Apart from remarkable athletic abilities, \nJackie Robinson possessed extraordinary personal qualities which \nenabled him to embody the hopes and challenge the prejudices of an \nentire generation of Americans. He truly met the classic definition of \ncourage--the demonstration of grace under pressure.\n  Georgians and all Americans honor the history which Jackie Robinson \nmade 50 years ago today. It is clear in retrospect that he did more \nthan open the door of the national pastime to African-Americans. He \nalso helped to open the door of a genuine opportunity society to all \nAmericans. Jackie Robinson believed passionately in the promise of the \nAmerican dream. Through a lifetime of hard work, personal sacrifice, \nand commitment to racial harmony, he did as much as any American over \nthe past half century to help make that noble dream a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3230-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE FRONT LINE IRS EMPLOYEE\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as we debate our tax system and the \nmanagement of the Internal Revenue Service, I believe we should take \ntime out to recognize a largely unappreciated group of public servants. \nIf there is anyone dreading tax day more than the taxpayer in general, \nit is the front line IRS employee who is right now trying to handle all \nof those last minute phone calls and process the bulk of returns that \nare just now starting to flood in.

The revenues they collect pay for our national parks, our \nhighways, and our national defense. While we can debate the system at \nlength, I believe we should take a moment today of all days to \nrecognize the hard work done by those front line men and women at the \nIRS to make our government run.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3230-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3230-S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE TOP 10 SMALL BUSINESSES IN KANSAS CITY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on Monday, April 21, 1997, the Kansas \nCity MO Chamber of Commerce will honor the 1997 Top 10 Small Businesses \nof the Greater Kansas City area. The Chamber is an association of \nalmost 3,000 businesses across the 10-county bistate area whose members \nemploy approximately 240,000 people in the Greater\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\nKansas City area. This honor is part of the Chamber's award-winning \nSmall Business Week activities, which are among the country's largest \nSmall Business Week celebrations.\n  The Top 10 Awards are given in recognition of the economic \ncontributions of small businesses which make up more than 90 percent of \nthe Greater Kansas City metropolitan area. These 10 businesses alone \ncontributed $104 million in annual sales and employed more than 840 \npeople in 1996. Nearly 700 companies were nominated, but only 10 can \nearn the honor of small business of the year. Of the 10, the Greater \nKansas City Chamber will select its 11th annual Small Business of the \nYear, at its luncheon on April 25, 1997. The Small Business of the Year \nwill receive the ``Mr. K'' award, named for Ewing Marion Kauffman, one \nof the country's best entrepreneurs.\n  This year's Top 10 recipients are, Accommodations by Apple, Inc., \nGould Evans Affiliates, Hermes Landscaping, Inc., Arthur Clark Holding \nInc., Boulevard Brewing Co., The Corridor Group, Inc., Courtney Day \nInc., DARCA Inc., Data Systems International Inc., and Galvmet Inc.\n  When Ewing Kauffman observed that, ``Surprisingly, of all of the \nmotivational aspects that there are, once a person has food, clothing, \nand shelter, the most motivating force in the world is appreciation. * \n* * we don't express appreciation as much as we should.'' I can only \nspeculate that he was thinking of businesses such as these. As the \nChairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, it gives me great \nsatisfaction to see my home State thriving in the small business \ncommunity and I would like each honoree to know how much I appreciate \ntheir hard work and commitment to excellence. I congratulate these \ncompanies not only for this honor, but also for the outstanding \ncommunity service they provide to the Greater Kansas City area. They \nare an inspiration to all small businesses not only in this area, but \naround the country, and I applaud them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3230-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJ. MARGARET M. JOSEPH\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments of Senate business to honor Maj. Margaret Joseph, a \nPennsylvanian who dedicated her life to defending freedom and serving \nher country.\n  Margaret distinguished herself as a member of the Army Nurse Corps. \nDuring World War II, she served in the European theater. Many soldiers \nfighting in France and England owe their lives to dedicated \nprofessionals such as Margaret Joseph, who nursed them back to health. \nFor others, her compassionate care was among the last acts of kindness \nthey would experience on this Earth. In recognition of Margaret's skill \nand dedication, she was promoted to the rank of major by an act of \nCongress.\n  Unfortunately, Major Joseph is no longer with us. She passed away on \nNovember 19, 1996, in Philadelphia, PA. On December 3, 1996, she was \nlaid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.\n  Mr. President, Major Joseph was rightfully proud of her service to \nthis Nation. I hope my colleagues will join me both in recognizing her \naccomplishments and in honoring her as a patriot, as a distinguished \nsoldier, and as a courageous human being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/15/senate-section/article/S3231-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1997 concurrent resolution on the Budget (H. Con. \nRes. 178), show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $16.9 billion in budget authority and by $12.6 billion in \noutlays.
