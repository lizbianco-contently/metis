Mr. President, like the Chaplain, and on behalf of the \nSenate, I would like to pay tribute today to Mother Teresa. I know that \nI am speaking for every Member of the Senate in expressing our sorrow \nin the loss of Mother Teresa, this wonderful lady.\n  At the same time, we realize that if ever there was a life well \nlived, it was hers. Her passing helps us understand the psalm's comfort \nfor those who mourn, that ``precious in the eyes of the Lord is the \ndeath of His faithful ones.''\n  Only 3 months ago, Mother Teresa came here to the Capitol. She joined \nus as we gave to her the Congressional Gold Medal in support of her \nwork for the poorest of the world's poor. Even then, everyone present \nunderstood that it would only be a matter of time before her work, \nnever finished, would rest in other hands.\n  But what an honor it was for us to meet her. The leaders were there, \nand the Members of the House and the Senate. That was a special \noccasion. We all felt touched by this elderly lady, who at once was so \nfrail and at the same time so tough and so unconcerned about anything \nexcept the suffering of others.\n  This was a lady who, on an earlier visit to Washington, when she was \nbeing escorted to a White House car\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nwaiting to take her to the airport, inquired about how her companions \nwould get to the airport. When she was told they would go in a \ndifferent vehicle, she declared everyone must stay together and take \nthe bus.\n  To put it mildly, fame, and accolades were not important to her. What \nwas important to her--what shaped her life from the Balkan village \nwhere she was born to the places of power where she was honored--was a \ndevotion to the most vulnerable members of the human family, especially \nchildren, both before and after their birth.\n  When she first visited the Capitol back in 1981, one of our \ncolleagues, then Senator James Buckley of New York, remarked, ``There \nis no telling what may be started by someone like her, who plays with \nfire by striking sparks off the flinty heart.''\n  Today, 16 years later, it is magnificently clear what she did start, \nliterally around the world. Out of her poverty, she enriched mankind. \nOut of her loneliness, she showed us the heights of the human spirit. \nFrom the perspective of this century's end, we have a better \nunderstanding of what true greatness really is.\n  The monsters of our era--Mao, Stalin, Hitler, and the rest--they and \ntheir ideologies are in the trash heap of history. But what Mother \nTeresa launched, with bare hands and with an open heart, is going to \nlast far longer than anyone can imagine.\n  Sad as our loss of her may be, we should not forget that her passing \nwould not be viewed by her as a tragedy, but as a triumph. She had that \nassurance from the person to whom she gave her life, who surely has \nsaid to her, ``I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. I was thirsty, and \nyou gave me to drink.''\n  So as we celebrate her life, let us now celebrate her joy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8877-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8878-S8898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n                        1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 830) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act to improve the \n     regulation of food, drugs, devices, and biological products, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed the consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First, I want to thank the majority leader for, I think \nvery aptly and appropriately and eloquently, expressing our thoughts \nabout Mother Teresa. All of us were moved by her life, and all feel \nsimilarly as to his feelings about what she did for all the people of \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, today, we move forward again on the motion to proceed \nwith respect to the reform of the FDA bill, S. 830.\n  Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Food and Drug \nAdministration commonly known as FDA, has two important functions: \nFirst, the review and approval of important new products that can \nimprove the public health, such as lifesaving drugs, biological \nproducts, and medical devices; and second, the prevention of harm to \nthe public from marketed products that are unsafe or ineffective. Since \n1938, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act has been amended \nnumerous times to expand the FDA's mission to ensure that only safe or \nineffective products are marketed.\n  But the act has been changed only once, by the Prescription Drug User \nFee Act of 1992, commonly called PDUFA, to strengthen the FDA's ability \nto review and approve expeditiously important new products that can \nimprove the public health.\n  Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of \n1997, S. 830, is designed to ensure the timely availability of safe and \neffective new products that will benefit the public and to ensure that \nour Nation continues to lead the world in new product innovation and \ndevelopment.\n  The legislation accomplishes three major objectives: It builds upon \nrecent administrative reforms that both streamline FDA's procedures and \nstrengthen the agency's ability to accomplish its mandate in an era of \nlimited Federal resources; it requires a greater degree of \naccountability from the agency in how it pursues its mandate; and \nthird, it provides for the reauthorization of PDUFA.\n  The FDA acknowledges that its mandate requires it to regulate over \none-third of our Nation's products. Within its purview the FDA \nregulates nearly all of the food and all of the cosmetics, medical \ndevices, and drugs made available to our citizens.\n  This legislation identifies areas where improvements can be made that \nwill strengthen the agency's ability to approve safe and effective \nproducts more expeditiously. It builds upon the numerous investigations \nby Congress, the FDA, the General Accounting Office, and other \norganizations that have identified problems with the current FDA \nproduct approval system and have recommended reasonable reforms to \nstreamline and strengthen that system. The major provisions of S. 830 \naccomplishes, among others, the following purposes. The legislation:\n  First, establishes a clearly defined, balanced mission for the FDA;\n  Second, it improves patient access to needed therapies and provides \nexpedited humanitarian access to medical devices;\n  Third, creates new incentives for determining better pharmaceuticals \nfor children;\n  Fourth, gives patients access to new therapies more quickly through a \nnew fast-track drug approval process;\n  Fifth, increases access to information by health professionals and \npatients;\n  Next, increases agency access to expertise and resources;\n  Also, improves the certainty and clarity of rules;\n  And further, improves agency accountability and provides for better \nresources allocation by setting priorities;\n  It also, simplifies the approval process for indirect food contact \nsubstances and provides a more reasonable standard for some health \nclaims; and,\n  The legislation reauthorizes the PDUFA Program thus ensuring \nadditional resource availability for the agency to conform with its \nnecessary missions.\n  Mr. President, let us explore these objectives in greater detail. \nFirst, the legislation establishes a clearly defined, balanced mission \nfor the FDA. Congress has never established a mission statement for the \nFDA. This bill does.\n  The FDA in March 1993 adopted a formal statement declaring that the \nagency ``is a team of dedicated professionals working to protect and \npromote the health of the American people.'' Although this statement \ndefines the agency's mission in terms of ensuring that the products it \nregulates comply with the law, there is no reference to the importance \nof approving new products that benefit the public.\n  The legislation amends the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act by adding an \nagency mission statement focused on: First, protecting the public \nhealth by ensuring that the products it regulates meet the appropriate \nFDA regulatory standards; second, promptly and efficiently reviewing \nclinical research and taking appropriate action on the marketing of \nregulated products in a manner which does not unduly impede innovation \nor product availability; and, third, participating with other countries \nto reduce regulatory burdens, harmonize regulatory requirements, and \nachieve appropriate reciprocal arrangements with other countries.\n  The legislation improves patient access to needed therapies and \nprovides expedited humanitarian access to medical devices. The FDA has \nno crosscutting program that ensures access by patients with serious or \nlife-threatening diseases to drugs or devices in clinical trials--even \nwhen that unapproved therapy may be the only way to save the patient's \nlife.\n  The legislation would create new law whereby manufacturers may \nprovide, under strictly controlled circumstances and in response to a \npatient's request, an investigational product for those patients \nneeding treatment for a serious or life-threatening disease. The \nlegislation also improves the existing program for the humanitarian use \nof medical devices for patient populations of fewer than 4,000.\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\n  The legislation creates new incentives for determining better \npharmaceuticals for children. Children have for years been wrongly \nconsidered small adults when estimating the effect of prescription \ndrugs on their overall health. Currently there is no systematic means \nfor testing the safety and efficacy of drugs on the pediatric \npopulation.\n  The legislation gives the Secretary authority to request pediatric \nclinical trials for new drug applications and provides 6 extra months \nof market exclusivity to drugs when the manufacturer voluntarily meet \ncertain conditions under the program. The Secretary must determine in \nwriting that information relating to the use of a drug in the pediatric \npopulation is needed. In addition, the FDA may establish time frames \nfor completing such pediatric studies before additional exclusivity is \ngranted.\n  The legislation gives patients access to new therapies more quickly \nthrough a new fast-track drug approval process. I think this is \nimportant.\n  For several years the FDA has allowed the expedited review and \napproval of drugs but such review has been largely confined to \ntreatments for HIV/AIDS or cancer. This provision facilitates \ndevelopment and expedites approval of new drugs for the treatment of \nany serious or life-threatening diseases.\n  The legislation increases access to information by health \nprofessionals and patients. For years, sophisticated users of health \nrelated economic information, like health maintenance organizations, \nhave had constrained from access to important information that could \nhelp them reduce health care costs.\n  The legislation would apply the Federal Trade Commission's \n``competent and reliable scientific evidence'' standard for FDA review \nof health care economic statements distributed by manufacturers to \nsophisticated purchasers. In the past, only a few patient groups have \nhad access to information about ongoing clinical trials for lifesaving \ntherapies. The legislation expands patient access to information by \nrequiring the creation of data bases on ongoing research related to the \ntreatment, detection, and prevention of serious of life-threatening \ndiseases.\n  The legislation increases agency access to expertise and resources. \nCurrent law contains no provisions to assure that the FDA can access \nexpertise housed at the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and other \nscience-based Federal agencies to enhance the scientific and technical \nexpertise available to FDA's product reviewers. The legislation \nrequires FDA to develop programs and policies to foster such \ncollaboration. The legislation also authorizes the agency to contract \nwith outside experts to review all or parts of applications when it \nwill add to the timeliness or quality of a product review, and provides \nfor the use of accredited outside organizations for the review of \nmedical devices.\n  The legislation improves the certainty and clarity of rules. The \nlegislation makes a series of changes related to the classification, \nreview and approval of FDA regulated products designed to ensure that \nsponsors of new products face consistent and equitable regulatory \nrequirements. In addition, the legislation gives FDA 2 years to \nevaluate the success of its recently issued ``Good Guidance Practices'' \nguidance after which FDA is required to implement this policy as a \nregulation, making any modifications necessary to reflect experience \nduring the 2-year trial period. The legislation provides medical device \nmanufacturers with the ability to make recommendations to the FDA \nrespecting initial product classifications.\n  It facilitates the reclassification and/or approval of device \napplications by allowing FDA to consider historical data in making its \ndeterminations, and the legislation more clearly states the \nrelationship of labeling claims to approval and clearance of medical \ndevices. It increases the certainty of review time frames by providing \na definition of a day with respect to the agency's review timeclock and \nby requiring the agency to approve or disapprove a device application \nwithin 180 days.\n  The legislation also prohibits FDA from withholding the initial \nclassification of a device because of a failure to comply with any \nprovision of the unrelated to making a determination of substantial \nequivalence, and it clarifies that FDA has discretion in determining \nthe number of clinical trials required for the approval of a drug or \ndevice. FDA would retain total discretion to require a sufficient \nnumber of trials to show safety and efficacy. The provision introduces \nthe concept that two trials are not always necessary, establishes the \nprimacy of quality data over quantity of data, and requires the FDA to \nconsider the number and type of trials on a product-by-product basis.\n  The legislation improves agency accountability and provides for \nbetter resource allocation by setting priorities. Except as required \nunder PDUFA, the FD Act provides no form of public accountability by \nthe FDA for its performance of its statutory obligations.\n  The legislation requires FDA to develop a plan designed to: First, \nminimize deaths and injuries suffered by persons who may use products \nregulated by the FDA; second, maximize the clarity and availability of \ninformation about the product review process; third, implement all \ninspection and post-market monitoring provisions of the act by 1999; \nfourth, ensure access to the scientific and technical expertise \nnecessary to properly review products; fifth, establish a schedule to \nbring the FDA into compliance by 1999 with the product review times in \nthe act for products submitted after the date of enactment of this \nsection; and sixth, eliminate the backlog of products awaiting final \naction by the year 2000.\n  The legislation also requires FDA to submit an annual report to \nassist Congress in assessing the agency's performance in accomplishing \nthe objectives laid out in the agency plan.\n  The legislation streamlines several FDA functions with respect to \ncertain review and inspection processes thus allowing the agency to \nfocus its limited resources on areas of greatest need. The legislation \nestablishes reasonable data requirements for new product approval \napplications, petitions, or other submissions. The legislation provides \nFDA with the discretion to approve drugs and biologics on the basis of \nproducts manufactured in pilot and small-scale facilities.\n  FDA is also directed to establish policies to facilitate the approval \nof supplemental applications for new uses for an approved product. \nFurther, the legislation establishes procedures and policies to foster \na collaborative review process between the agency and the sponsors of \nmedical device applications. Finally, the legislation streamlines the \nreview of minor modifications to medical devices.\n  The legislation simplifies the approval process for indirect food \ncontact substances and provides a more reasonable standard for some \nhealth claims. Current law requires the agency to preapprove food \ncontact substances, most of which pose little if any risk to human \nhealth.\n  The legislation replaces the preapproval process for these \nsubstances, primarily packaging materials, with a simple notification \nrequirement. The legislation also provides for health claims for foods, \nwith premarket notification, when the claims are based on authoritative \nrecommendations by an authoritative scientific body of the U.S. \nGovernment such as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, or the National Academy of Sciences--\nvery reliable agencies.\n  The legislation reauthorizes the PDUFA Program thus ensuring \nadditional resource availability for the agency. PDUFA is reauthorized \nfor 5 years. Performance goals beyond those set for the 1992 act will \nbe identified in side letters between the FDA and the Senate Committee \non Labor and Human Resources. The bill assumes that FDA will receive \nfor fiscal year 1998 the 1997 level of appropriated funds for the \nagency.\n  This is important to keep in mind. For fiscal year 1999 through 2002, \nthe bill assumes an annual inflation adjustment. I mention this because \nthere in the present proposal by the administration is a request to cut \nback on the use of PDUFA.\n  Mr. President, I think after all of us have had time in this body to \ngo through this legislation, Members will understand why there is so \nlittle dispute over almost all of the bill. We will be talking again \ntoday, as we did last Friday, about two areas in the bill for\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\nwhich there has not been agreement, but the disagreements are not very \ncomplicated to understand.\n  First of all, we had a vote of 89-5 on Friday to allow us to end the \nfilibuster under the circumstances we faced. That approval indicates \nwhat I am saying now, that for almost all of this bill there is no \ndispute between us and the minority or Senator Kennedy or the Office of \nthe President or the Secretary of HHS.\n  What we do have are two problems in which there is dispute. This \nmakes up 6 pages out of a 152-page bill. Keep in mind, because we will \nhave some vigorous arguments in those two areas, everyone agrees with \nthe rest of the bill--almost. There will always be somebody, but there \nis hardly any disagreement on the matters I discussed in my statement.\n  The two remaining matters refer, first of all, to cosmetics. There is \nan increasing need, at least felt by especially some States and also by \nthe FDA and others, that there has to be more work done in approving \ncosmetics or ensuring that cosmetics that are injurious to health do \nnot get on the market. At present, most of that has been left sort of \nambiguous whether the FDA should do it or not.\n  On the other hand, because of the realization that uniformity would \nbe helpful, it would be useful if we could have uniformity throughout \nthe States on cosmetics so that the people all over the country do not \nhave to worry about going from place to place. And thus the bill does \nestablish the FDA predominance in the field with respect to the use of \ncosmetics.\n\n  Now, this is met with some difficulties because some States, \nCalifornia in particular, had voted and had passed laws on cosmetics. \nLet me go through the present authority.\n  The FDA now has substantial authority to ensure the safety of \ncosmetic products. It can ban or restrict ingredients for safety \nreasons, mandate warning labels, inspect manufacturing facilities, \nissues regulatory letters, seize illegal products, enjoin unlawful \nactivities, and prosecute violators of the adulteration and misbranding \nprovisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n  In addition, cosmetic products are subject to one of the most \ncomprehensive set of Federal labeling requirements for consumer \nproducts. A cosmetic label must include the name and address of the \nmanufacturer, packager, or distributor; a statement of product \nidentity; net quantity of contents; a list of all ingredients in the \nproducts; adequate directions for use; and mandated warnings for \nspecific products.\n  In addition to this substantial Federal regulatory authority, the \ncosmetic industry supports a variety of programs to ensure the safety \nof cosmetic ingredients. Most important is the Cosmetic Ingredient \nReview, a 20-year program that has reviewed the safety of almost 620 \ncosmetic ingredients.\n  The safety evaluations are conducted by an independent expert panel \nof seven leading academic scientists and physicians. The panel also \nincludes three liaison representatives from the FDA, the Consumer \nFederation of America, and private industry.\n  Along with this regulatory authority, the agency has sufficient \nresources to police the safety of cosmetics. This year, Congress \nappears ready to approve nearly a billion dollars for the agency. Yet \nof that amount, the FDA will likely spend no more than about $6\\1/2\\ \nmillion on cosmetics safety and labeling. Why? Why would the agency \ndevote less than 1 percent of its budget? Because of the outstanding \nsafety record of cosmetic products. Numerous FDA Commissioners--\nincluding David Kessler, have stated that cosmetics are among the \nsafest products under the FDA's jurisdiction.\n  Let me turn now to the language of the national uniformity provision \nfor cosmetics included in the latest version of S. 830. First, let me \nemphasize that this provision in no way affects State enforcement \npowers, such as seizure, embargo, or judicial proceedings, that the \nStates can now use to guard against adulterated, misbranded, or \notherwise unsafe products. Let me repeat this point: The national \nuniformity provision would not block any State from exercising its \npolice powers against unsafe cosmetic products.\n  Second, the national uniformity provision provides only limited \npreemption of State safety standards. Preemption would apply only when \nthe FDA has an applicable safety standard affecting cosmetic already in \nplace. If the FDA has not acted in a safety area, the States would \nstill be free to impose their own particular safety regulations \naffecting cosmetic products. For example, individual States could ban \nparticular ingredients or could set specified concentrations levels for \ningredients used in cosmetic products when the FDA has not acted.\n  Preemption does apply to State labeling and packaging for cosmetic \nproducts that are in addition to or not identical with Federal \nstandards.\n  This is designed to ensure a single, nationwide system for regulating \nthe labeling for cosmetic products. This will promote efficient product \ndistribution in interstate commerce, assure the ready availability of \nproducts in all States, and hold down costs for consumers.\n  Third, under this provision States and localities are clearly \npermitted to petition to impose a State-specific requirement if they \nhave a situation where an important public interest is at stake, and \nthe requirement would not violate a Federal law or unduly burden \ninterstate commerce.\n  Fourth, the existing right of States, or entity or person is \npreserved to petition the FDA to make an certain regulation on over-\nthe-counter drugs or cosmetics a national requirement.\n  And finally, the regulation of the practices of pharmacy and \nmedicine, areas traditionally and appropriately the responsibility of \nthe States is not modified or preempted by this provision.\n  This is a sensible compromise that guards against the possibility of \n50 different labels in 50 different States but at the same time \npreserves the ability of States to protect the public against any \nproblems that may arise over the safety of cosmetic products.\n  Mr. President, we will go forward with another lengthy dissertation \non this aspect of this. I hope people will keep in mind that there is \nbroad, broad agreement among all of us--Senator Kennedy and those who \nsupport it--that this bill has come a long way. It has gone a great \ndistance toward bringing together what we can pass and be very proud \nof. There are just two areas where there is disagreement, which we will \nhear about, I am sure, now. But I hope that everybody will keep in mind \nthat this is in the area of 6 pages of a 152-page bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I want to just comment about the devotion \nand duty of our friend and colleague from Vermont. I am sure there may \nbe those who are watching the proceedings this morning who may not \nknow, as many of us know, the Senator and his daughter were rear-ended \nlast Friday morning. Nonetheless, he came in here during the course of \nthe consideration of this legislation, and now he is here doing his \nduty in spite of the inconvenience and discomfort he is feeling. So I \nthink all of us have great respect for Senator Jeffords. His devotion \nto duty is again reflected in his presence here this morning and his \ncommitment in moving ahead this legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I also want to, as I did at the opening of the \ndiscussion and debate, congratulate Senator Jeffords on his efforts in \nthe consideration of this legislation. We considered this legislation--\nFDA reform--in the last Congress. We reported legislation out of the \ncommittee. It did not move toward a successful resolution. There were a \nnumber of features there that were extremely troublesome in terms of \nthe protection of the public. There were areas of strong difference. \nAlthough the process did move forward, it was not successful.\n  Senator Jeffords has built upon a strong record and made every effort \nto try to work through an important public policy area, reform of the \nFood and Drug Administration, in ways that recognize its primary \nresponsibility, which is to protect the public. As we go forward with \nthis debate, FDA reform should serve the public interest and also take \ninto consideration the innovation of the pharmaceutical industry and \nthe medical device industry in bringing new products onto the market\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\nin ways that can improve the health care of the American people. That \nis always a balance.\n  Men and women of good judgment can differ. There are two important \nprovisions in this legislation, which eventually will be subject to \nfurther debate and discussion, dealing with what we call sections 404 \nand 406, labeling and manufacturing. I will come back to those measures \na little later in the course of the debate. We heard references to \nthose items by our friends and colleagues, Senator Reed and Senator \nDurbin, on Friday last. We will have a chance to outline at least some \nof the concerns about those measures, and, ultimately, the Senate and \nthe conference will have an opportunity to deal with those.\n  I personally feel that they pose important public health issues that \nneed to be addressed. But I agree with what Senator Jeffords has \noutlined, which is the broad sweep of this legislation, and the areas \nof broad agreement that have been an impressive legislative \nachievement. Senator Jeffords should receive commendation for that \nbecause all of us who were part of that process feel that there are \nmany features in here that should move forward.\n  Some of us are hopeful that we can address the medical device \nlegislation and also address what I consider to be one of the important \namendments that was passed in the consideration of the legislation in \none of the last markups--passed with a strong vote, after some \ndiscussion, but nonetheless, poses what I consider to be an important \nand unnecessary health hazard to the American people. That is, the \nprovisions which are known as the cosmetic preemption provisions, which \nwere added to this legislation, not included in the original mark of \nthe chair, not included in the original mark of Senator Kassebaum a \nyear ago, but added at the behest of the industry. As a matter of fact, \nthe language itself was drafted by the industry. It was advanced in the \ncommittee considerations and now is part of the legislation.\n\n  As I mentioned last week, I am absolutely convinced that if this had \nbeen introduced as a separate bill, it would be far back in the \nrecesses of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, in terms of its \nconsideration. But nonetheless, action was taken by the committee and \nthat action has resulted in the inclusion of the cosmetic preemption \nprovision. If this legislation is passed, it will effectively say to \nthe 50 States that you virtually have no rights or opportunities for \nprotecting your consumers from unsafe or dangerous cosmetics.\n  Now, I listened with interest to what the Senator outlined in regards \nto the powers of the FDA, in terms of protecting the public. But the \nfact is, as we know, the food and drug law has 126 pages that relate to \ndrugs or prescription drugs and medical devices, it has 55 pages \ndealing with labeling and nutrition labeling, it has 8 pages dealing \nwith definitions in the food and drug law, and it has a page and a half \non cosmetics.\n  There are only two members of the Food and Drug Administration who \noversee cosmetic packaging, labeling and warning. We have seen where \nthe various studies that have been done by governmental agencies, like \nthe General Accounting Office, have stated that what is necessary to \ngive assurance and protection to the American people regarding \ncosmetics is more significant regulatory authorities for FDA to make \nsure that the ingredients that are going into cosmetics are going to be \nsafe. We do that with the pharmaceutical industry; we do it with the \nmedical device industry. We do not do that with cosmetics.\n  The American people go into their drugstore and get a prescription \ndrug or an over-the-counter drug. They know that, in effect, there is a \nwarranty from the FDA that bears the gold standard for safety in the \nworld, that those products are going to be safe. They get a medical \ndevice and they know it is going to be safe. But the fact of the matter \nis, Mr. President, we are not so sure when it comes to cosmetics. For \nexample, when we consider the safety of our cosmetics, we know that, \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission, more than 10 years ago--and the \nutilization of cosmetics has grown exponentially since that time--\nreports 47,000 emergency room visits as a result of the use of \ncosmetics and cosmetic products in one single year. Does that sound \nvery safe to all of you? What is the record? Where is the testimony to \nsay how safe it was? You do not have it. You do not have it because we \nhave not had any hearings. It would have been a good hearing if we had \ntwo or three former heads of FDA that appeared before the committee and \nsaid this is what the safety issues are, these are what the health \nissues are, these are why either we agree or we differ on the issues of \npreemption. But we didn't have them in the Senate. And you have not had \nthem in the House. You didn't have them in this Congress. You didn't \nhave them in the last Congress. You have not had them in the Congress \nbefore. You have not had them for 20 years. The only documents you have \nare from the GAO. And they don't talk about how safe everything is. \nThey have a series of recommendations, which I have read into the \nRecord, that say what we ought to be doing in order to guarantee safety \nand security.\n\n  That is what the GAO said. That isn't the Senator from Massachusetts. \nThat isn't the four other Senators that said let's stop, look, and \nlisten. But we are going to go ahead pell-mell with this particular \nprovision. We have looked at the results of the GAO study. They have \nnot been refuted, and we have not had any hearings providing evidence \nthat can refute the GAO.\n  Mr. President, is this something that just now a single Senator, or \nthree, or four, or five Senators should be concerned about?\n  It is interesting that the administration has targeted this \nprovision, as well as the two to three other provisions that I \nmentioned earlier, as matters that have to be addressed.\n  The National Governors' Association: This is what they say about this \nprovision.\n\n       When the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee \n     considered reauthorization of the Food and Drug \n     Administration, the committee adopted an amendment proposed \n     by Senator Gregg that preempts State regulations, disclosure \n     requirements, labeling, and warning requirements as they \n     apply to nonprescription drugs and cosmetics. The National \n     Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors' \n     Association, vigorously oppose this provision and hope that \n     it will not be part of the bill when it is reported by the \n     Senate.\n\n  All the Governors are saying virtually the same thing. Let us, in the \n50 States, be able to take actions with regard to cosmetics, allow us \nto protect our people. That is what all the Governors are saying. But \noh, no. ``Washington knows best.'' Remember those old statements that \nwe used to hear all across the country by many of our colleagues. Let's \nnot have a one-solution-fits all. Let's not have that. Let's not have \n``Government knows best.'' Well, here you have Government knows best. \nThey don't know best. They can't handle and protect their people in \nCalifornia, or Ohio, or Massachusetts. Absolutely not, even though \nthere have been strong efforts in each of these States to try and move \nahead and to protect their people. But we are saying not after we pass \nthis law.\n  Mr. President, as I said last Friday here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, we are making tough decisions on matters over which reasonable \npeople can differ. And these are in many instances heartrending \ndecisions. I mentioned last Friday, the decisions that we had in our \nHuman Resources Committee where you have a limited amount of money. You \nhave to make a decision for Meals on Wheels; whether you are going to \nprovide all of the money to the congregate sites to feed elderly \npeople--and you can feed more elderly people if you put it in the \ncongregate sites--or are you going to take a third of that money and \nfeed people that are shut-ins? The money will not go as far. You are \nnot going to reach as many people if you take those scarce resources \nand reach the shut-ins. What should be the public policy question? \nShould we give the money to feed more people, or should we allocate \nsome to the shut-ins, or should we just leave this up to the local \ncommunity?\n  These are important public policy issues that affect the lives of \nreal people. But not on this cosmetic issue. What are the public policy \nconsiderations on the other side? Money. Greed. Cosmetic industry. \nGreed. What are the public health considerations of preemption? How are \nthey advanced? How are they preserved? How are the American people \nfurther protected by a preemption? They are not. We have not heard that\n\n[[Page S8882]]\n\nargument made on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We have not heard it, \nbecause it is not there.\n\n  This legislation is proposed because of what has been happening in \nthe area of California, and some of the other States which have been \nlooking at the kinds of concerns being raised by so many consumers day \nin and day out--I will mention those in just a few moments--that are \nreally wondering whether some of these products are safe. And there is \ngood reason to ask whether they are safe because as we have seen from \nthe GAO, many of these products are potential carcinogens. What is a \ncarcinogen? It is a cancer-causing agent. We wouldn't permit these \nproducts to go into processed food because the Delaney clause would \nprotect the American people from carcinogens in processed food. But can \nyou add them to cosmetics? You can add them to cosmetics. They are \nadded to cosmetics today.\n  That is another reason, Mr. President, why the Environmental Defense \nFund says no to this provision; why the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil says no to this provision; why the Patients Coalition Consumers \nUnion says no to do this provision; why the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica says no; why AIDS Action says no; why the American Public \nHealth Association, the association to protect the American public \nhealth, says no to this provision. All of these organizations say no to \nthis provision. Why? Because it doesn't protect and advance the \ninterests of the public health in the States. It advances the bottom \nline of the cosmetic industry, but it does not advance the interests of \nthe public health.\n  Mr. President, I will mention what the National Women's Health \nNetwork says in a letter that I will include.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed at an appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              National Women's Health Network,\n\n                                                September 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the 13,000 individual \n     and 300 organizational members of the National Women's Health \n     Network, I am writing to express our opposition to damaging \n     provisions in S. 830, the FDA Modernization and \n     Accountability Act of 1997 which would preempt state \n     regulation of cosmetics. I commend you for speaking out about \n     this potential threat to women's health.\n       The spectrum of the cosmetic industry is broad and not \n     simply limited to lipstick, mascara, or eyeshadow. Hair gels \n     and dyes, soap, toothpaste, baby powder, and lotions also \n     fall under the umbrella of this $20 billion dollar industry. \n     Most women use one or more of these products everyday, and \n     assume that they are safe for themselves and their families.\n       Sadly, this is not the case. There is virtually no federal \n     oversight of cosmetic products which, according to a 1987 \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission study, led to an estimated \n     47,000 emergency room visits in one year. Additionally, the \n     General Accounting Office reported that a number of cosmetic \n     products marketed in the United States ``may pose a serious \n     hazard to the public.''\n       Because the FDA has virtually no authority to regulate this \n     very profitable industry; in fact the FDA has less than 30 \n     employees overseeing the safety of cosmetics, states have \n     initiated their own efforts to protect their residents. These \n     state consumer protection laws have alerted women to products \n     containing carcinogens or the presence of ingredients which \n     may cause allergic reactions.\n       The Network believes that S. 830 puts the financial \n     bottomline of the cosmetics industry ahead of the health of \n     millions of women by banning states from regulating the \n     industry's products. The bill would even bar states from \n     establishing public communication campaigns which would \n     inform women of a cosmetic's safety and effectiveness. This \n     would mean no warning labels, no data on carcinogens, no \n     ``keep out of reach of children'' notices.\n       It is absolutely crucial that provisions in S. 830 \n     preempting states' rights to regulate cosmetics be removed \n     from the bill. Women and their families deserve to have \n     complete information about the safety and effectiveness of \n     these products and states who are willing to step forward to \n     safeguard the health of their residents must be allowed to do \n     so. The National Women's Health Network stands ready to work \n     with you to educate members of the Senate and the American \n     public about this very serious women's health issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Cynthia A. Pearson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. They say:\n\n       The spectrum of the cosmetic industry is broad and not \n     simply limited to lipstick, mascara, or eye shadow. Hair gels \n     and dyes, soap, toothpaste, baby powder, and lotions also \n     fall under the umbrella of this $20 billion industry. Most \n     women use one or more of these products every day, and assume \n     that they are safe for themselves and their families.\n       Sadly, this is not the case. There is virtually no federal \n     oversight of cosmetic products which, according to a 1987 \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission study, led to an estimated \n     47,000 emergency room visits in one year.\n\n  Just to depart for a minute, if you have 47,000 people going to the \nemergency room, how many other thousands are going back to see their \ndoctors? How many other thousands have gone to their dermatologists? \nHow many other thousands have gone to their own doctors, and not to the \nemergency room and willing to pay the other $150, $175, or $200 to just \nvisit the emergency room? How many others knew that? There were 47,000 \nemergency room visits in one year.\n\n       Additionally the General Accounting Office reported that a \n     number of cosmetic products marketed in the United States \n     ``may pose a serious hazard to the public.''\n\n  That is the GAO-- `` * * * may pose a serious hazard to the public.''\n  It would seem to me this morning that we ought to be debating how we \nare going to advance public health, and how we are going to protect \nthose individuals whose health may be in danger. Are we debating that? \nNo. To the contrary. We are going to say as a result of this \nlegislation that the health of the consumers of cosmetics are going to \nbe at greater risk. That is the only conclusion, and that the bottom \nlines of the cosmetic industry are going to be higher.\n  I continue:\n\n       The Women's Health Network ``* * * believes that S. 830 \n     puts the financial bottom line of the cosmetic industry ahead \n     of the health of millions of women by banning states from \n     regulating the industry's products.''\n\n  There it is. There is the heart of the argument right there by the \nNational Women's Health Network, one of the effective organizations \nthat looks out after the public health of American women. Does it get \nit right here?\n\n       The Network believes that S. 830 puts the financial bottom \n     line of the cosmetic industry ahead of the health of millions \n     of women by banning states from regulating the industry's \n     products.\n\n  That is it. That is what we got tagged onto this bill that is dealing \nwith pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs, dealing with medical \ndevices, dealing with the extension of PDUFA, which is a source of \nrevenue to ensure that the FDA can be tops in the world in terms of \napproving new products. We support those various provisions. But now we \nhave added onto this train this cosmetic preemption that the principal \norganizations that are dealing with public health say to the U.S. \nSenate: ``Stop. Say no. Do not move ahead with that.''\n  It continues, Mr. President:\n\n       It is absolutely crucial that provisions in S. 830 \n     preempting states' rights to regulate cosmetics be removed \n     from the bill. Women and their families deserve to have \n     complete information about the safety and effectiveness of \n     these products and states who are willing to step forward to \n     safeguard the health of their residents must be allowed to do \n     so.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just continue on with the groups just so that \nwe understand the breadth of the opposition. It isn't just a few \nSenators. As I mentioned, the principal public health associations, \nthose that are primarily concerned about women's health, the ones that \nuse these products to the greatest extent--the administration, the \nState legislators. The State legislators were joined by the Association \nof State and Territory Health Officials. They emphasized State laws \nprovide consumers with important protections in areas where the FDA has \ninsufficient resources to act and represent a legitimate exercise of \nState authority.\n\n  As I mentioned before, Mr. President, if we were debating the \nregulatory authority of the FDA to protect the public health, that is a \nlegitimate debate. But that is not where we are. We are not out here \ndebating what would be appropriate power for the FDA to have to ensure \nprotections for the American consumer on cosmetics.\n  If there are those that can say with a straight face with the $6 \nmillion budget that they are allocating through FDA\n\n[[Page S8883]]\n\nand two people that are overseeing the areas of packaging and labeling, \nwhich is the only thing that the States can do in terms of trying to \nget at these health considerations--if we were out here to say, ``Look, \nthey have too much power, they have been abusing that power, and they \nare inefficient with that power,'' that would be one thing. But we are \nnot out here debating that. We are just saying we know, as the cosmetic \nindustry does, that the agency does not have the wherewithal in order \nto protect the consumer, that the historical protections for the \nconsumer on health and safety have been the States and local \ncommunities, and what we are out here now saying is that we are going \nto take all of their power away. That is the issue. It isn't that we \nhave a strong FDA. We don't have it. It is not represented. It was \nnever discussed in the course of our markup. We had no hearing that \nwould be able to represent it.\n  Let me just take a few minutes to indicate how we have gotten to \nwhere we are with regard to the FDA power on drugs, pharmaceuticals, \nand on cosmetics.\n  As I mentioned, the FDA has less than two people to regulate the \nlabeling, packaging, and warning for a $20 billion a year industry. The \nFDA has less than 30 people to work on cosmetics, and FDA's authorities \nare grossly inadequate. The FDA regulation of cosmetics is a dinosaur, \nan anachronism from the time when drugs didn't have to be effective, \nwhen food additives didn't have to be safe, and when medical devices \ndidn't have to be safe or effective. Just go back with me in terms of \nthe times so we understand where we are.\n  I chaired the hearings that we had in the 1970's about medical \ndevices. Twenty-three women died from perforated uteruses as a result \nof the Dalkon shield. And that was the beginning of the changes in our \nmedical device legislation--in the mid-1970's. Because of the danger \nwith the sophistication of medical devices, we were going to have to \nmake sure they were going to be safe and efficacious. And we did.\n  Mr. President, in 1938, the last and only time the Congress acted \nspecifically to regulate cosmetics--1938 is the last time--FDA was \ngiven authority to regulate products that were misbranded or \nadulterated. FDA had the burden. FDA had to find the problem. FDA had \nto do the studies. FDA has to bring a court action.\n  The entire burden is on the agency. In the last 60 years, we have \nprogressed in other areas of public health and safety. In 1954, we \npassed the Miller pesticides amendment. In 1958, we passed the Food \nAdditives Amendment requiring manufacturers of food additives to \ndemonstrate safety before putting potentially harmful chemicals in the \nfood supply. Now manufacturers have to demonstrate that their products \nare safe in order to go in the food supply.\n  Do you have to do that with regard to cosmetics? No, you do not have \nto do that with regard to cosmetics. Two years later, we passed the \ncolor additives amendment to establish a premarket approval system for \nadditives used in food, drugs and cosmetics. The drug amendments of \n1962 fundamentally restructured the way FDA required premarket approval \nof safety and effectiveness for every new drug. Prior to that it was \nnot there, not necessary. They have to prove safety and effectiveness.\n  In 1976, we enacted the medical device amendments following long \nyears of study and debate. So now we have the agency requiring that \neach of the products in terms of the prescription drugs and with regard \nto medical devices have to be proven safe and efficacious. Do they have \nto do that with regard to cosmetics? No. No, they do not have to do \nthat today.\n  Among the most recent changes in FDA's authority were the infant \nformula amendments of 1980 and the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and \nEducation Act, and the 1990 Safe Medical Device Act. Under these laws \nCongress held manufacturers responsible for safe and effective \nproducts. We asked the manufacturers to provide data to FDA to \ndemonstrate safety before they could sell the products.\n  We went ahead again with regard to prescriptions and again with \nregard to medical devices. Do we do it with cosmetics? No. Despite all \nthis progress and advance in public health and safety, cosmetic \nregulation has lagged far behind. FDA's authority and regulation of \ncosmetics is still stuck in the framework of the 1938 law that Congress \nfound it necessary to update in every other product area. This is not \nto say that Congress has not revisited the area of cosmetic regulation. \nIn fact, every time that Congress has revisited cosmetic regulation it \nhas resulted in a call for additional protection and additional safety \nmeasures--every single time. But here we are on this FDA \nreauthorization bill, to reauthorize the FDA and bring it up into the \nmodern period in terms of medical devices and pharmacy. Here we are \nwith a change, significant change in terms of the relationship of the \nprotection of the American people from cosmetics.\n  And here we are without the hearings, using the exact language of the \ncosmetic industry which is going to mean health threats to the American \nconsumer--at what benefit? Well, as I mentioned, the bottom line of the \ncosmetic industry. So we have each and every time, with regard to \npharmaceuticals and medical devices, we see what we have done and we \nhave seen each time that Congress has gotten into it or the GAO studies \nhave gotten into it, they say it is an area which cries out of the need \nfor greater protection of the public.\n  In 1948, George Larrick, who became the Food and Drug Administrator, \nsaid:\n\n       Real scientific appraisal of cosmetic ingredients should be \n     made before an ingredient is marketed.\n\n  Did we do that? No. In the 1952 hearings, James Delaney in the House \nfound that partial regulation of cosmetics resulted in insufficiently \ntested cosmetics that are a source of discomfort and disability. \nFurther, the House report found that cosmetics should be subjected \nessentially to the same safety requirement as applied to new drugs. Yet \ntoday that is far from the case.\n  In 1978, the U.S. GAO report strongly recommended the FDA be given \nadequate authority to increase safety of cosmetics. Among its findings: \nAlthough there is increasing evidence that some cosmetic products and \ningredients may carry a significant risk of injury to consumers, the \nFDA does not have an effective program for regulating cosmetics. Some \ncoal tar hair dyes may pose a significant risk of cancer because they \ncontain colors known to cause or are suspected of causing cancer in \nhumans or animals. However, the exemptions granted to coal tar hair \ndyes in 1938 prevented FDA from effectively regulating hair dyes. The \nindustry was sufficiently powerful at that time to write an exemption \nin the law. And there is increasing evidence that people with darker \nhair who use these darker colors have higher incidence of troubles in \nterms of not only their scalps but also their general health conditions \nand there are increasing studies concerning the exposure these \nindividuals may have had to carcinogens and cancer.\n\n  Serious burns have been reported from the use of flammable cosmetics. \nAmong those likely to ignite at the time of application are perfumes \nand colognes which usually contain a high concentration of alcohol and \nnail polish removers which contain flammable ingredients such as \nacetone and ethyl acetate.\n  In 1975 FDA sponsored a 3-month survey of 35,000 users of cosmetics. \nParticipants kept a diary and reported adverse reactions. These reports \nwere reviewed by a team of physicians to determine if the injuries were \ncosmetically related. One of every 60 participants suffered an injury \nconfirmed by a physician as cosmetically related. One in every 450 \nparticipants suffered a severe or moderate injury.\n  These are studies that were done back in 1975 by the FDA. Do you \nthink we have updated those studies? No. Do you think we have had \nhearings about that? No. And yet each and every time there is a serious \nevaluation we are finding these incidents involving health hazards. We \nhave seen the varying degrees of the hazards in the examples and in the \npictures that are here behind us. And we could go through picture after \npicture of the damage done by various kinds of products.\n  The GAO report concludes that cosmetics are being marketed in the \nUnited States which may pose a serious hazard to the public.\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\n  That is not the Senator from Massachusetts. That is the GAO, not \nDemocrat, not Republican. In drawing on the best scientific \ninformation, this is what they conclude.\n\n       Cosmetics are being marketed in the United States which may \n     pose a serious hazard to health. Some contain toxic \n     ingredients which may cause cancer, birth defects or other \n     chronic toxic effects and contain contaminants known to cause \n     cancer in animals because exposure to these ingredients can \n     occur through skin absorption and inhalation as well as oral \n     ingestion. It is important that the hazards posed by them be \n     carefully assessed.\n\n  I tell you, Mr. President, if this provision passes, those hazards \nare not going to be assessed by the States because of the way the \nlanguage is written in the legislation. I am talking about what will be \npreempted on page 119, line 8:\n\n       Shall be deemed to include--\n\n  This is the preemption--\n\n     any requirement relating to public information or any other \n     form of public communication relating to the safety or \n     effectiveness of a drug or cosmetic.\n\n  There it is. Here you have the last studies being done, nonpartisan. \nIndividuals are reviewing the most recent, up-to-date scientific \nstudies. Cosmetics which are being marketed in the United States which \nmay pose a serious hazard to the public.\n  Why are we asked to take a chance on it, Mr. President? Why are we \nbeing asked to take this action? One reason and one reason only--the \nbottom line for the cosmetic industry. There is no public health \nargument that can be made on the other side--absolutely none--just the \ngreed of the cosmetic industry.\n  Every American ought to understand that. Here you have the GAO saying \ncosmetics are being marketed which may cause a serious hazard to your \nhealth. You have the several States: Texas, California, Ohio, my own \nState of Massachusetts, and a number of other States that are \nattempting to deal with some of these potential and real hazards to us \nand they are going to be preempted. Sure, we exempted California from \nthis provision, but there are other health protections in California \nthat are going be precluded.\n  I have my differences with the attorney general, Dan Lundgren out \nthere in California, but you read through his letter about this action \nand about the efforts California is making trying to protect its public \nand how it is completely contrary to the interests of California. Here \nis the Attorney General of California:\n\n       Regulation of health and safety matters has historically \n     been a matter of local concern, and the Federal Government \n     has been reluctant to infringe on state sovereignty in these \n     traditional areas.\n\n  And he says:\n\n       As noted above, S. 830 would, in the absence of specific \n     FDA exemption, appear to prevent the State of California from \n     enforcing their Sherman Food Drug and Cosmetic Law which is \n     there to protect the people of California. And it goes on to \n     make the case in opposition to this particular provision.\n\n  So now we have the GAO report and we have what this statute does.\n  The 1988 hearings held in the House of Representatives raised the \nsame issues about the FDA's lack of authority and resources in this \nimportant area. Nothing has been done. Let me review one more time what \nFDA cannot do under its current authority.\n  It cannot require cosmetics manufacturers to submit safety data on \ntheir products--cannot require that. It can require it with regard to \npharmaceuticals. It cannot require cosmetic manufacturers to register \ntheir plants or establishments or require cosmetic manufacturers to \nregister their products or require premarket approval of any cosmetic \nor cosmetic ingredient even when such approval is necessary to protect \nthe public health; cannot require manufacturers to submit consumer \ncomplaints about adverse reactions to cosmetics; cannot require \nmanufacturers to perform specific testing necessary to support the \nsafety of a cosmetic or an ingredient.\n  So, Mr. President, this is what we have under current law. I would \nlike to mention just some of the dangers associated with this limited \nauthority. We have talked in generalities. We talk about jurisdiction. \nWe talk about preemption. We talk about inspection. But here are \nexamples of dangerous cosmetics. These injuries took place this year, \nand there are dozens and dozens of them in graphic detail. I want to \nread a few of them for you.\n  Do any of you use Alberto Hot Oil Treatment for your hair? There was \na complaint just last month of eye dermatitis from this product. Do you \nknow what that means? It means blisters, chemical burns, rash, redness, \nswelling, and inflammation. All that from a simple hair treatment.\n  Everybody in America uses toothpaste every single day. In August, a \nconsumer used a type of Colgate toothpaste with baking soda and \nperoxide. What happened? Mouth pain and dermatitis. That's a fancy way \nof describing itching, burning, and swelling of the lips, tongue and \ngums.\n  In case you are thinking of switching brands, think again. Somebody \nelse used Crest Tartar Control toothpaste in January and developed the \nsame symptoms of burning, itching, and swelling in the mouth--not what \nyou would expect from brushing your teeth in the morning.\n  Here is another example. In August somebody used Gillette Cool Wave \nclear stick deodorant. Instead of being clean and presentable, they \nended up with armpit dermatitis and bleeding. Can you imagine bleeding \nfrom using deodorant.\n  How about a product called Revlon Outrageous Shampoo and Conditioner? \nIt is outrageous all right. The user developed scalp sores, swelling, \nand inflammation from the shampoo.\n  Have you ever used Bath salts? You may not want to after you hear \nthis. In March, someone developed ``nervous system and urogenital tract \nreactions'' from Essential Elements Bath Salts. Can you imagine \nexpecting a nice relaxing hot bath and end up with dizziness and \nheadaches.\n  These examples go on and on.\n  Prestigious manufacturers L'Oreal, Avon, Clairol, Neutrogena, \nfamiliar names like Procter and Gamble, Revlon, Maybelline, Mr. \nPresident, this list provides a dismaying parade of horrors from \nproducts we rely on every single day.\n  Here are just a few examples of the injury complaints received by the \nFDA. Dermatitis includes rash and redness, swelling, blisters, sores, \nweeping and lumps, inflammation, chemical burns, and irritation. Pain \nranges from itching and stinging to soreness and tingling. Tissue \ndamage, other than thermal burn, can include dryness and peeling, \nsplitting, cracking, hair and nail breaking, hair and nail loss, \nulcerations, hair matting, and scars. Nervous system reactions range \nfrom dizziness, and headache to irritability, nervousness, and \nnumbness.\n  How many people using these products have symptoms like dizziness, \nheadache, irritability, nervousness, or numbness, and wonder where in \nthe world this is all this coming from? It may very well be coming from \ntheir cosmetics, from their shampoos and toothpastes and other types of \ncosmetics.\n  If these examples aren't striking enough, there are respiratory \nsystem reactions, like upset stomach, nausea, loss of appetite, \nvomiting, and diarrhea. Or urogenital tract reactions: painful \nurination, discharge, stopping of urination, and on and on it goes.\n  Mr. President, I asked for the complaints that we have gotten in just \nthe last few months. Here in my hand is the list of them from the FDA. \nIt is interesting to note that, a number of years ago, we tried to get \nauthority for an FDA hotline so people could call up with their \ncosmetic injuries. It was struck out in the Appropriations Committee at \nthe behest and intervention of the cosmetic industry. We tried to get a \nhotline so that at least we would be able to get more information and \nthe FDA would be able to act on that information about specific \nproducts.\n  What is the lesson we can draw from this? The industry does not want \nmore information about cosmetic injuries. They don't want others to \nhave that information. So they eliminated funding of the cosmetic \nhotline. We have successful and important hotlines in many other areas. \nThey have been a strong success. I have been a strong supporter of \nthem, because they assist people in obtaining information and, most \nimportant, help in a timely way. But they also allow the Government to \nregister various complaints and gauge the seriousness of public health \nproblems.\n  We tried to get the hotline. We had it authorized, it went on to the \nAppropriations Committee a few years ago,\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\nbut it was knocked out by intensive lobbying. So I am truly amazed that \nthe FDA has the kinds of reports I will describe, and the sheer number \nof cases that they do. The truth is, most people who suffer injuries or \nadverse reactions from cosmetics simply don't know who to tell, other \nthan their doctors. They in turn don't have anyone to tell or don't \nknow who to tell. Certainly, the companies are under no obligation to \ntell the FDA--nor do they.\n  I will return a little later to the efforts that were made to try to \nget the manufacturers to voluntarily assist the FDA in reporting \ncomplaints. At the end of the day, only about 3 percent of the \nmanufacturers cooperated in that effort. When hearings were held in \n1988, there appeared to be a consensus to do more to protect the \npublic. The industry itself said, give us an opportunity to voluntarily \nprovide the FDA the complaints that we receive. Well, it ended up being \nabout 3 percent of the companies that actually participated. I will get \nto this in just a few moments.\n  Let's begin with the injury complaints. In August, Alberto Culver & \nCo.'s hot oil treatment for color-treated and permed hair: Eye \ndermatitis, including rash, redness, swelling, blisters, sores, \nweeping, lumps, inflammation, sunburn, chemical burn, and irritation. \nClairol Helene Curtis, the brand was Nice N Easy Natural Lite Ash Brown \nNo. 114 and Degree antiperspirant; upper trunk and shoulder pain, \nincluding burning and stinging. Clairol's Nice N Easy Medium Brown No. \n118: Hair tissue damage other than thermal burns. Procter & Gamble's \nCovergirl Makeup Master, facial and nose injury including dermatitis; \nRevlon's Professional Nail Enamel Remover: Finger injury, including \ncuticle, irritation, dermatitis. Neutro-gena's Clear Pore Facial \nTreatment, facial injury; Dixie Health, Dermal KK is the brand: Face, \nincluding nose bleeding.\n\n  In July, Maybelline's Great Lash Mascara: Face pain and dermatitis in \nthe nose. Realistic's, which is Roux Labs, Revlon Super Fabulayer Hair \nRelaxer Conditioner: Scalp dermatitis; Shark Products' Africa Pride \nRelaxer is the brand: Hair tissue damage. Procter & Gamble's Pantene \nShampoo: Upper trunk dermatitis, neck tissue damage. Vidal Sassoon \nShampoo: Upper trunk dermatitis. Clairol Hydrience Permanent Hair \nColor: Permanent discoloration of the hair. I can't imagine a product \nthat could unintentionally make hair permanently discolored, but that \nis what has been reported.\n  The list goes on. It lists the names of just about every major kind \nof cosmetic maker in the book. Andrea International's eyelash adhesive: \nEye pain. You have perfume from Stern & Co., the product is Oscar: \nRespiratory system reactions. And the list goes on. I have page after \npage of these kinds of complaints.\n  It seems to me if the States want to bring these matters up and it \nwas the desire of the States to try to protect their consumers, they \nshould have the opportunity to do so. Just as California has done and \njust as other States which are presently studying these issues will do. \nThese States could go and talk to the manufacturers and the \nmanufacturers can make changes, which they have on product after \nproduct sold in California. Proposition 65 is the basis for this \nCalifornia system, which works by inducing product improvements without \nhaving to remove products from the market or even putting labels on \nthem. That is the way it has worked in California. Safer products. And \ntime in and time out, the manufacturer comes out and advertises that \nthey have upgraded their product. It is a better product now than it \never has been--an interesting and desirable outcome.\n  But in this bill we say no. We just say no. We tell consumers, you \ncannot have the remedy of the State and you cannot have the remedy at \nthe Federal Government. The result will be more individuals like the \n59-year-old California woman who was almost killed by an allergic \nreaction to hair dye. Or the woman who lost her hair and was horribly \nscarred when her hair caught fire from a flammable hair treatment gel. \nThe 6-year-old daughter of an Oakland, CA, woman who used a hair \nproduct on her child who suffered second-degree burns. Two women who \nused eyelash dye, one of whom died and the other who went blind. A 16-\nmonth-old toddler died of cyanide poisoning after swallowing artificial \nnail remover, and a 2-year-old child from Utah was poisoned by the same \ncosmetic. If there is a State that wants to do something about \nchildren, like putting a warning label on these items in order to \nprotect children, it will never happen under this bill. We know that \nchildren get into all kinds of products in the household and there is \nthe chance of them ingesting some of these items. Obviously, some may \nbe considerably more dangerous than others, and consumers will want to \nhave labeling that says if the child ingests this, take the following \nsteps or contact the following people. But under this bill, if the \nState wants to do that, they are virtually prohibited from doing so. \nThey are denied the opportunity to protect their children in their own \nStates.\n  What if a review is made of the scientific information in these \nStates on these products if ingested by children, asking do they \npresent serious threats of poisoning among children that may be life-\nthreatening? Should warnings be placed on the labels? The result under \nthis bill will be: No, you are out. You can't do that. I just find it \ndifficult to understand why can't the States do this? Why can't they if \nthey want to in Massachusetts or any other State? The reason will be \nbecause the Congress of the United States, at the request of the \ncosmetic industry, says you can't do it. Congress and the industry say \nyou can't do it. That is what we are dealing with, Mr. President. It is \njust why I think this makes absolutely no sense.\n  We reviewed earlier this morning some of the groups that were opposed \nto this provision: The Governors and State legislatures, virtually all \nof the public health and consumer groups like the National Women's \nHealth Network, the wide range of agencies and officials with primary \nresponsibility over the public health. They are virtually unanimous in \ntheir opposition. I will happily wait to hear from public health groups \nin support of the provision. We will have time during the course of the \ndebate for other Members who are able to get that kind of information \nand place it in the Record. In the face of such unanimous opposition, \nthey will be few and far between.\n  Here is a letter from the United Food and Commercial Workers, Beth \nShulman, the international vice president.\n\n       We are appalled that the Senate is considering preempting \n     state cosmetic safety regulation in the almost complete \n     absence of any Federal protection.\n       Unlike all other products governed by the Food and Drug \n     Administration, such as food and drugs, the FDA has \n     essentially no authority to assure the safety of cosmetic \n     products prior to entry into the marketplace. The FDA has no \n     legal authority to require manufacturers to conduct safety \n     testing, submit lists of ingredients to the agency, company \n     data, or consumer complaints. Most consumers would be shocked \n     to learn that there is no Federal government regulation or \n     testing to assure the safety of cosmetics before they appear \n     on store shelves or are used by hair care professionals. It \n     is scandalous that the Senate is now considering stripping \n     states of their legal authority, so that the safety of \n     cosmetic products used by millions of consumers will now be \n     completely unregulated.\n       The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which \n     represents barbers and cosmetologists among its 1.4 million \n     members, has a long history of campaigning for stronger \n     Federal regulation of cosmetic products. Over the past twenty \n     years we have testified repeatedly about the hazards of \n     cosmetic products and the need to protect not only the \n     750,000 professional cosmetologists, but the millions of \n     consumers that use these products daily.\n\n  They point out they take strong exception to those protections. Now, \nwhy should they be concerned? They gave some excellent testimony \nseveral years ago to the Congress. Let me give an example. After 2 \nyears as a wig stylist, a cosmetologist from San Francisco began to \nexperience memory loss, nausea, and dizziness. She had troubles with \nvision and balance. She stated, ``I can't remember things I did just a \nshort while ago. I have to write everything down.'' Her condition was \nblamed on the ingredients in hair spray and other products she was \nusing in her work. She appeared as one of the witnesses where Congress \nwas working to regulate the largely unregulated industry.\n  Another example: Christy Smith enrolled in a beauty college in 1984. \nChristy began to have trouble breathing, a problem that worsened over \nthe\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\nyears. She dropped out of beauty school after 10 months. She was found \nto have irreversible occupational asthma. Again, her condition was \nattributed to cosmetics present at her school.\n  A 1997 study in the Journal of Environmental Medicine found evidence \nto support the claim that female hairdressers are at a higher risk of \nasthma as a result of occupational exposure to chemicals found in \nvarious hair products. This prompted a related study by the Palmer \nGroup, which found an increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms and \ndiseases among female hairdressers. These diseases included asthma, \nbronchitis, emphysema, and other chronic lung diseases.\n  Female hairdressers face daily exposure to many harmful chemicals \nthat are used in a wide array of hair care products on the job. I will \ngive a few examples. These chemicals include persulfates, which are \nused in hair bleaches and can cause allergic skin and respiratory \nsymptoms. Several indications of occupational asthma among hairdressers \nhave been reported. Polyacrylates mixed with chemicals and hydrocarbons \nin hair styling agents can cause irritation of airways and adversely \naffect other respiratory functions.\n  Ammoniac and sulfur compounds released in hair dying and permanent \nwaving can cause irritation of the airways.\n  The relative risk of asthma and chronic bronchitis among hairdressers \nwas measured almost twice that of a reference group between 1980 and \n1995. This study found that the youngest cohort of female hairdressers \nexperienced the greatest occurrence of asthma, 42 percent; and chronic \nbronchitis, 44. These women ranged in age from 35 to 44.\n  Mr. President, this is what is happening in the beauty parlors among \nbeauticians across the country. Why? Because they are inhaling these \nproducts. They suffer from the higher concentrations of these toxins, \nbut the women of this country who use these products at home are also \ninhaling them and endangering their health.\n  I am not here to say precisely what the extent of this problem is, \nbut we know now that it is happening as a result of studies that the \ncompounds that are being used are more toxic and there are more of them \nbeing used every year. The health hazards have to be greater. At a time \nwhen the health hazards have to be greater, why are we taking away the \nrights of the States to render judgments to protect their citizens? \nThis is especially true in an area of traditional State authority.\n  What if the States want to take some kind of action? We are \nprohibiting them from doing so. We are denying them that chance to do \nso. It makes absolutely no sense--no sense at all. It does make dollars \nand cents because the industry is going to benefit from it, but it \ndoesn't make any sense in terms of the public health. That is why \nvirtually every public health agency committed to protecting women and \nwomen's health wants this provision out. It undermines their ability at \nthe State level to give additional protections to consumers, and for no \nother reason than the financial interest of the cosmetic industry.\n  Mr. President, I will mention here how the United States compares \nwith the rest of the world. That doesn't happen to be the most \nimportant argument made this morning, but we heard on the floor of the \nSenate last Friday about how we have fallen behind other countries in \nterms of the FDA's work. In reality, the United States has been \ncompared with the rest of the world, and impartial sources such as the \nGeneral Accounting Office have found that the United States has the \nfastest and most vigorous product approvals. American consumers expect \nthe best and that is what they get from the FDA.\n  But when it comes to cosmetics, the U.S. motto should be: ``Expect \nthe best, but settle for less.''\n  Looking around the world, it is remarkable how inadequately the \nUnited States stacks up against other countries. The European Union \nrequires documented proof of good manufacturing practices and similar \nproof that extensive testing be carried out on all its products. What \ndo they know that we don't know? What are their scientists and research \nscientists finding? Are we taking the time of the Senate to go through \ntheir various studies that point out the health hazards in their \ncommunities? They have done it, and they are providing additional \nprotection.\n  Let us examine another major economic power: Japan regulates \ncosmetics likes drugs, requiring the companies to do safety tests \nbefore marketing. Why? What is it they understand about cosmetic \nsafety? Is it possible they have reviewed and found the same things \nthat we have talked about this morning? The same things that the GAO \nhas found out about the dangers posed by cosmetic products?\n  Japan requires testing before marketing. That is exactly what the \nCongress said in 1952 we should be doing in the United States. Forty-\nfive years later, we are still waiting for safety testing. The Japanese \nare not.\n  Let's look at North America. Mexico adopted a regulation mandating \nexpiration dates on all cosmetics. To the north in Canada, \nmanufacturers submit data to show the product is safe under normal use \nconditions.\n  The Scandinavian countries: Sweden and Denmark are initiating product \nregistration for cosmetics, something the FDA can't require.\n  Malaysia already requires mandatory registration of cosmetics. That \nis something the cosmetics industry would fight tooth and nail.\n  The bottom line is that the American consumers have less protection \nthan consumers in any other country that I have mentioned. The United \nStates is a First World country with a Third World cosmetics safety \nsystem. That is the way it is today, and this legislation is going to \nmake it worse. Much worse. That, Mr. President, is wholly unacceptable.\n  I want to mention more specifically the products of which I think \npeople should have some awareness. These are five common cosmetics \nproducts with potentially devastating health effects:\n  Alpha-hydroxy acid, used in face cream, causes skin cancer.\n  Feminine hygiene products cause infertility in young women;\n  Talc used in baby powder that may cause cancer; and\n  Mascara that can cause blindness.\n  Alpha-hydroxy acid is one of the hottest selling cosmetics on the \nmarket with sales of roughly $1 billion a year. This product is sold to \nerase fine lines and tighten the skin, but has devastating health \neffects that are unknown to most consumers. The agency has received 100 \nreports of adverse effects with alpha-hydroxy acid products ranging \nfrom mild irritation and stinging to blistering and burns. More \nimportantly, these products make users more sensitive to ultraviolet \nradiation from sunlight which causes skin cancer.\n  To find out if a cosmetic contains an alpha-hydroxy acid, the \nconsumer has to look for one of the following ingredients: glycolic \nacid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, L-alpha-hydroxy acid, mixed \nfruit acid, triple fruit acid, sugar cane extract. All of these are \nalpha-hydroxy acids, although you'd hardly know from their names.\n  The cosmetics industry sponsored a study linking alpha-hydroxy acids \nto increased ultraviolet sensitively and, most likely, skin cancer. An \nindustry panel concluded that alpha-hydroxy acid cosmetics are safe at \nconcentrations less than equal to 10 percent at a pH of greater than or \nequal to 3.5 percent when directions for use include daily use of Sun \nprotection.\n  Equal to less than 10 percent. This is what the cosmetic industry \nsays will be safe if used along with these other items.\n  Wouldn't it be useful for someone else or someone impartial to get a \nchance to look at the basic science and research that the industry has \nused to make a judgment? Wouldn't that be worthwhile? Wouldn't it be \nvaluable if the FDA had a chance to have that data submitted to them? \nThey could have their researchers look at it and see whether they come \nto the same conclusion as to the safety.\n  But, no, there is a recognition by the industry itself that if there \nis something wrong, they want to do their own study and make their own \nrecommendations. We, the public, don't know. We don't know whether they \nare accurate. We don't even know whether there is going to be any kind \nof enforcement, or by whom. By the industry? How? All we have is the \nindustry's\n\n[[Page S8887]]\n\nrecord and their willingness to comply voluntarily with the FDA. We \nhave less than 3 percent of them willing to submit adverse kinds of \nreactions to the FDA. So we have no way of knowing about the true \nsafety of cosmetics. What we do know is that the industry itself \nunderstands that there are health hazards with this specific product \nand want to control what's on the warning label.\n  Don't we want researchers out in the great centers of research in \nthis country to say, ``Look, we'd like to try to find out if and how we \ncan protect people.'' Maybe States with broad exposure to the Sun, such \nas the South and Southwest, should have particular interest in trying \nto do this. They might want to do some studies to find out.\n  Would they be able to try to make some kind of a judgment under this \nbill? Mr. President, the answer is no. We are preempting those States. \nLet us look at alpha-hydroxy acids again. Here we have one of the most \nhighly advertised products on the market today. We have the industry's \nown recognition of their health hazards. Again, are we doing something \non the floor of the Senate to protect the consumer from those hazards? \nAbsolutely not. We are undermining what protection there is out there \namong the States.\n\n  Consumers should be aware that alpha-hydroxy acid concentrations and \npH are generally not noted on these products, not unless FDA's two \nemployees find the time and resources to initiate rulemaking to \nestablish such a regulation. FDA is reviewing the industry report, as \nwell as other data, about these products and may initiate rulemaking \nsometime in the future, but do not expect the States to protect their \ncitizens from alpha-hydroxy because under the law, States could not \nwarn their citizens about alpha-hydroxy acid creams.\n  Feminine hygiene products are other harmful, largely unregulated \nproducts, with roughly $100 million a year in sales. Many women who buy \nthese products will be surprised to find the overwhelming majority of \nthese feminine hygiene products are regulated only as cosmetics. These \nproducts have been known to cause upper reproductive tract infection, \npelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, infertility in women. \nThis reduction in fertility is even greater in young women.\n  Researchers at the Center for Health Statistics in Seattle, WA, have \npublished studies regarding the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease \nfrom the use of feminine hygiene products. These researchers have found \nthat the risk of ectopic pregnancy doubles in women who use feminine \nhygiene products. Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard \nMedical School also published data regarding the adverse health effects \nof feminine hygiene products. We had better hope that those two people \nat FDA working on cosmetics labeling and warnings have time to work on \nadequate labeling for feminine hygiene products.\n  The National Women's Health Network has testified before an FDA \nadvisory committee that more has to be done to protect the reproductive \nhealth of women, which is clearly affected by these cosmetics. Just \nlook at the science. But the industry doesn't want the States to have \nthe authority to warn consumers. So, for the women of the State of \nWashington, we should say goodbye to the research studies conducted in \nSeattle and what they found out--because we are preempting what those \nStates can do with them.\n  Even in my own State, research conducted at Brigham and Women's \nHospital found that the risk of ectopic pregnancy doubles in women who \nuse feminine hygiene products.\n  It is worthwhile to inquire if there are other researchers who come \nto contrary conclusions. These are studies being done. What State is \ngoing to go out and perform studies, and which research centers, when \nthey know they are preempted from doing anything about it? That is why \nthe Women's Health Network is opposed to this provision. And for what \nreason are we risking women's health? Why are we risking lives? It is \nbecause of the cosmetic industry. It is going to be cheaper for them, \nallegedly, when they don't have to deal with warnings and disclosure of \nhealth risks. It's too much trouble for them. Talc is something widely \nused in baby powder and other body powders.\n\n  In 1992, the National Toxicology Program published a study of the \neffects of talc inhalation in animals and an epidemiology study on \nexposure to talc and ovarian cancer risk. The researchers reported an \nelevated risk of ovarian cancer associated with talc use. Workers at \nColumbia University have reported the detection of talc particles in \nthe ovaries of patients undergoing surgery.\n  The Cancer Prevention Coalition has submitted a citizen's petition to \nFDA addressing their concern about the possible health risks posed by \ntalc and requested the agency establish regulations to require \ncarcinogen warning labels on cosmetics containing talc as an \ningredient. FDA is reviewing the information and may respond sometime \nin the future. Those two workers are going to be hard pressed with this \none, too. If the State wanted to warn its consumers about the potential \ncarcinogen, they would be prohibited under S. 830.\n  A technique that has been used to extract ovarian tumor material \nfound talc particles in approximately 75 percent of ovarian tumors \nexamined. Subsequent evaluations have appeared to support the \ncontention of an association between talc and ovarian carcinoma.\n  The most recent study reported by the American Cancer Society has \nvalidated the claim that talc exposure increases the risk of ovarian \ncancer. Since the use of talcum powder is not an unusual practice for \nwomen, further studies need to be conducted to further understand the \neffects on a woman's female reproductive system. We had hoped that \nperhaps some of these research centers, some of these States would be \ninterested in this. They might have done some work and might have been \nable to provide some health and safety recommendations in this area.\n  But now we are saying that if the State of Washington, that was \ninterested in alpha-hydroxy, or if we are going to find out from \nColumbia University the work they have done with regard to the finding \nof talc particles in the ovaries of patients undergoing surgery, if \nthey wanted to do something in warning people in the State of New York, \nthose would effectively be off the table. Why are we not debating how \nwe are going to provide greater protection for women?\n  We have seen important research done up in Seattle, WA. Why are we \nnot out here debating what we are going to do about it? How can we \nprovide protections? What about these kinds of recommendations in terms \nof the talc? How dangerous is that to our children? Why are we not out \nhere debating that rather than saying, look, even though we have seen \nthis kind of study, we are not going to permit the States to get into \nthis--into this at all--because the cosmetic industry does not want it.\n  On mascara, the FDA had numerous reports of corneal ulceration \nassociated with mascara products, some of which caused partial \nblindness of the infected eye. In addition, many other reports of \nconjunctivitis caused by contaminated mascara were received.\n  In a 1969 FDA survey of hand and body lotions and creams, about 20 \npercent of the products sampled contained microbial contamination. \nResearchers at the Medical College of Georgia demonstrated that 10 \npercent of eye cosmetics were contaminated when sold. Bacteria were \nisolated from about 50 percent of all used eye cosmetics. Popular \nbrands of mascara were marketed without preservative systems and are \nparticularly vulnerable to contamination.\n  Mascara cosmetics can become easily contaminated during customary use \nbecause human skin is not sterile, and contact between the skin and a \ncosmetic leads to microbial contamination of the products. FDA \npublished a notice asking the industry to provide information covering \nmicrobial testing methods and standards of performance suitable to \nassure that cosmetics do not become contaminated with microorganisms \nduring manufacture as well as use. However, FDA's request for \ninformation resulted in no substantive response from the industry. The \nindustry just said no. What can FDA do about it? Since FDA has no \nauthority to request the safety data from the manufacturers or look at \nindustry records, FDA's inquiries likely stops\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\nthere. Can the States perhaps do something down the line? Perhaps they \ncould have at some point, but not under this proposal.\n\n  Expiration dates would help remind consumers to get rid of cosmetics \nbefore the bacterial contamination becomes dangerous. Under this \nlegislation, States could not act to require expiration dating on \ncosmetics.\n  So, Mr. President, the cosmetic provision of the bill is utterly \nirresponsible. It is a flagrant example of a special-interest lobby \nusing its back room muscle to attain unfair advantage over the public \ninterest.\n  You bring that bill out separately, Mr. President, and let us have an \nopportunity to debate that on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The votes \nare not there to carry that individually. And they should not be there. \nBut now we have seen that the cosmetics industry has added this on to \nlegislation that was initially devised for the extension of PDUFA, to \nensure adequate funding for FDA's drug review program so that the \nUnited States can be first in the world in terms of approving new \nproducts in the pharmaceutical industry.\n  It is time for the Senate to stand up for the health of the American \npeople, reject this unjustified, unwise, unacceptable provision that is \nnothing more than a tribute to the greed and recklessness of the \ncosmetic industry. The political power of the cosmetic industry is not \na license to ride roughshod over the rights of the States and the \nhealth of the Nation's men, women, and children who use their products \nevery day.\n  The American people deserve safe cosmetics. They have a right to full \nand fair information about the actual and potential danger of their \nproducts. The last thing Congress should do in a bill called the FDA \nreform is to give the cosmetic industry a blank check, poisoning the \nAmerican people with its products.\n  Mr. President, we allow States to decide whether their bottles will \nbe recycled or buried or whether their barbers are going to be \nlicensed, whether their pets will be registered, how close to a \ncrosswalk you can park your car, what hours the stores can be open. But \nthis bill prohibits the States from protecting the consumers from \ncosmetics that can give you cancer, catch on fire, or cause birth \ndefects.\n  As I mentioned, the language broadly preempts any public information \nor public communication. That is an ironclad guarantee that the \nconsumers will know less about their cosmetics. States will not be able \nto require warnings to parents or children about the dangers of a \nparticular product. American consumers are going to know less about \ntheir products. The cosmetic industry introduces 1,000 new ingredients \nevery single year into our cosmetics, everything from lipsticks, hair \ncreams, soap, deodorant, and hair dyes.\n  Do you think we will know how safe they are if this language becomes \nlaw? Who will be looking out after the public interest under this \nlanguage? I suppose it is left to the two employees at FDA--an agency \nwith limited authority and resources--who are charged with regulating \n$20 billion worth of cosmetic labeling and packaging. This language \nthat we are considering was drafted by the cosmetic industry itself so \nmake no mistake who it is intended to benefit.\n  Many challenges to State action have been rejected by the Federal \nappellant courts because the courts interpret preemption narrowly. This \nis because the courts cannot imagine that Congress would want to \npreempt the States from protecting their citizens. So what does the \ncosmetic industry do? They carefully drafted this language to give them \ntheir broad preemption. They have admitted that they drafted this law \nspecifically to force the Federal judges to interpret preemption very \nbroadly.\n  Mr. President, this provision should not become law.\n  Mr. President, beyond this issue, I will mention two other important \nitems that I hope we will have a chance to debate in the form of \namendments when we move to the bill itself. Others have spoken to them, \nand I will work with them or introduce legislation on these particular \nprovisions.\n\n  The overall legislation includes a number of provisions that will \nsignificantly improve and streamline the regulation of prescription \ndrugs, biologic products, and medical devices. I am pleased that, \nthrough a long process of negotiation both prior to and subsequent to \nthe markup of the legislation, many provisions that seriously threaten \npublic health and safety were dropped or compromised.\n  But despite our best efforts, this legislation includes several \nTrojan horses that I think undermine important positive proposals in \nthis bill. I would like to discuss the changes in the regulation of \ndevices that put consumers at unacceptable and unnecessary risk. They \nshould be removed from the bill before it goes forward. The \nadministration has made it clear that these provisions put the whole \nbill at risk.\n  A great deal of negotiation has taken place on the medical device \nprovisions of this bill. I compliment Senator Jeffords and Senator \nCoats and other colleagues in the committee for resolving most of the \ndivisive provisions in a way that is consistent with the protection of \nthe public health. I see in the chair Senator Gregg. We worked with \nSenator Gregg on the health claims issues in a constructive manner.\n  But there are at least two medical device provisions in the bill \nwhich still raise substantial concerns that could be corrected very \nsimply with negligible effect on the basic purpose and intent of the \nbill. Yet these corrections have not been made. My colleagues deserve a \nclear description of the hazards they pose. A brief explanation of how \nthe FDA regulates and clears the medical devices for marketing may be \nfirst in order.\n  Under the current law, manufacturers of new class I and class II \ndevices can get their products onto the market by showing that they are \nsubstantially equivalent to devices already on the market. For example, \nthe manufacturer of a new laser can get that laser onto the market if \nthey can show the FDA that the laser is substantially equivalent to a \nlaser that is already on the market.\n  Similarly, the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle can get that \nbiopsy needle onto the market by showing that it is substantially \nequivalent to a biopsy needle already on the market. And the \nmanufacturer of new patient examination gloves can get those gloves \nonto the market by showing that they are substantially equivalent to \npatient gloves already on the market.\n  Mr. President, these manufacturers are obliged to demonstrate \nsubstantial equivalence to the FDA by showing that the new product has \nthe same intended use as the old product and that the new product has \nthe same technological characteristics as the old product. If the new \nproduct has different technological characteristics, these \ncharacteristics must not raise new types of safety and effectiveness \nquestions in order for the product to still be substantially equivalent \nto the older product.\n  The logic of this process for bringing medical devices onto the \nmarket is quite simple: If a product is very much like an existing \nproduct, it can get to market quickly. If it raises new safety or \neffectiveness questions, those questions should be answered before the \nproduct can be marketed.\n  This process for getting new medical devices on the market, commonly \nknown as 510(k), is considered by most to be the easier route to the \nmarket. Devices that are not substantially equivalent to a class I or \nclass II device already on the market must go through a full premarket \nreview. Thus, device manufacturers have an incentive to get new \nproducts on the market through the 510(k) process. In effect, well over \n90 percent of all new devices get on the market through the submission \nof a 510(k) application.\n  This legislation seriously compromises the FDA's ability to protect \nthe public health through its regulation of medical devices that are \nmarketed through the 510(k) process. Of the dozens of provisions that \nwe have negotiated and discussed which affect medical devices in this \nbill, these two still raise fundamental public health \nproblems. Although few in number, these provisions raise substantial \nrisks to public health which simply cannot be ignored.\n\n  The first problem raised by the bill relating to medical devices is a \nprohibition on the FDA from considering how a new device will be used \nif the manufacturer has not included that use in its proposed labeling.\n\n[[Page S8889]]\n\n  You may think this approach makes sense. Why should the agency \nconsider the use of a device if the manufacturer has not specified the \nuse on the label? I'll tell you why--because that proposed label may be \nfalse or misleading. How would the FDA know that? Because the design of \nthe new device may make it perfectly clear that the new device is \nintended for a different use.\n  Let me provide my colleagues with a few examples. Let's talk about \nthe biopsy needle I mentioned before used on breast lesions. Most \nbiopsy needles for breast lesions currently on the market take a tissue \nsample the size of a tip of a lead pencil. Assume the manufacturer of a \nnew biopsy needle comes to the FDA with a 510(k) submission. But the \nnew biopsy needle takes a tissue sample 50 times as big, the size of a \n1-inch stack of checkers.\n  The manufacturer of this new needle has proposed labeling that says \nthat the needle will be used like the old, marketed needles to biopsy \nbreast lesions. But FDA knows the chunk of tissue being ``biopsied'' \nwill exceed the size of the lesion. This makes it clear to FDA--and any \nimpartial observer--that the needle in most cases will be used to \nremove the lesion.\n  Under these circumstances the FDA should be able to ask the \nmanufacturer to provide information on this use. Is it safe to remove \nlesions? Does it really work? The bill, however, categorically bars FDA \nfrom asking these essential questions. This means the FDA would be \nunable to make a complete review of the device and the public would be \ndeprived of existing assurances that devices are truly safe and \neffective.\n  The proponents of this provision have argued that the FDA could \nsimply say that the change in device design or technology--such as the \nchange and size of the biopsy needle--renders the new product not \nequivalent to the old product. But that is not always true. The \nmanufacturer could argue that there are no new questions of safety or \neffectiveness for the purpose claimed on the label. In the case of the \nbiopsy needle there are times when a large sample is needed--a sample \nlarger than a pencil tip.\n  So long as the larger needle is safe and effective for removing a \nsample, FDA could be barred from obtaining data about the new use of \nremoving lesions and to the extent the needle is used for the new use, \nwomen could be put at risk for effective or unsafe treatment of breast \ncancer.\n  Another example is surgical lasers that have been used for decades to \nremove tissue. Several years ago, a manufacturer added a side-firing \nmechanism to their laser to improve its use in prostate patients. While \nthe manufacturer did not include this specific use in its proposed \nlabeling, it was transparently clear that the new side-firing design \nwas intended solely for this purpose of treating prostate patients.\n  As a result, FDA required the manufacturer to submit data \ndemonstrating the laser's safety and effectiveness in treating prostate \npatients. This is precisely how the device review process should work. \nManufacturers must prove their devices live up to their claims, while \npatients and doctors receive all of the information needed to make the \nbest possible treatment choices.\n  Under this bill, FDA would be prohibited from getting adequate safety \ndata on the laser's use on prostate patients, even though that would be \nthe product's primary use. This defies common sense, yet this is the \nresult of one troubling and indefensible provision. Other examples in \nthe way this provision could allow unsafe and ineffective devices onto \nthe market abound. A stent designed to open the bile duct for \ngallstones could be modified in a way clearly designed for treatment of \nblockages in the carotid artery. Without adequate testing, it could put \npatients at risk for stroke or death. But under this bill, the \nFDA would be prohibited from looking behind the label to the actual \nintended use of the device. A laser for use in excising warts could \nhave its power raised so it was also possible for use in smoothing \nfacial wrinkles, but without FDA's ability to assure adequate testing, \nthe use of the laser for this purpose could lead to irreversible \nscarring.\n\n  Most companies, of course, will not try to bypass the process in this \npay. But some bad actors will. This legislation should not force the \nFDA to fight these bad actors with one hand tied behind it. This \nprovision is like asking a policemen to accept a known armed robber's \nassurance that the only reason he is wearing a mask and carrying a gun \nis that he is going to a costume party.\n  The second way this bill undercuts the FDA's ability to protect the \npublic's health and adequately regulate medical devices is the way it \nforces the FDA to clear a new device for marketing even if the agency \nknows that the manufacturer cannot manufacture a safe device.\n  Let me repeat that. It sounds, frankly, preposterous but it is true. \nOne of the bill's provisions actually requires the FDA to allow a new \ndevice on to the market even if the manufacturer is producing defective \ndevices. Surprisingly, the proponents of this provision freely admit \nthat this is true.\n  Under the current law, let's assume that a maker of a new examination \nglove submits a 510(k) to the Food and Drug Administration and claims \nthat the new gloves are substantially equivalent to gloves already on \nthe market. If the FDA knows for a fact from its inspectors that the \ncompany uses a manufacturing process that often results in the gloves \nhaving holes, FDA would simply not clear the gloves for marketing. FDA \nwould find that these gloves are not substantially equivalent to gloves \non the market because gloves on the market don't have holes. That is \ncommon sense, and fortunately that is also the law.\n  In contrast, this bill would force FDA to clear the gloves for \nmarketing. These defective gloves would be sold to hospitals, clinics, \nand HMO's where they would be used routinely by doctors, nurses, \nparamedics, and other health professionals every single day. Every \nsingle glove would expose these professionals needlessly to AIDS and \nhepatitis.\n  Here is the response of the provision's supporters. They argue that \nonce these defective gloves are in the market and being used by health \nprofessionals, FDA can simply institute an enforcement action to remove \nthem from the market. But when hundreds or thousands of defective \ndevices have been distributed, and when dozens or hundreds of \nfacilities may be using these devices, an enforcement action entails \nmore than blowing a whistle or picking up the phone to place a simple \ncall.\n  In reality, FDA must coordinate with the U.S. Attorney's Office, U.S. \nMarshal's Office, and persuade the court of jurisdiction to issue \nappropriate papers. As any attorney or law enforcement professional can \ntell you, that takes precious time. In the case of a defective device \nwhich is exposing people to unnecessary risk, time is absolutely \ncritical. The sooner a defective glove is pulled from the market the \nsooner the public is protected.\n  All this makes no sense when the FDA can prevent this from arising. \nIf this provision becomes law, the debater's point distinguishing \nbetween different forms of FDA authority will be paid for in the health \nand safety of American consumers, placed at needless risk of death and \ninjury. In fact, even the regulated industry is willing to compromise \non this provision because they recognize it is so unreasonable and \nshould be removed from this bill.\n  In the end, there is simply no justification for these troubling \nmedical device provisions. Our overriding priority in regulating \nmedical devices should be distinguishing between reforms which preserve \nthe public health and protections and those which endanger the public \nhealth.\n  Mr. President, we have had arguments on the other side of \nthat provision which say, well, on the labeling provision are we going \nto have to require the manufacturer to dream up every possible use and \nbe able to answer the charges that some nameless person at FDA can \npossibly imagine that a particular medical device would be used for?\n\n  We say, no, that is not what we are looking for. We are looking for \nwhat would generally be defined as the predominant or dominant use of \nthe device as a criteria. That ought to be the key. We know many \ndevices are used in different kinds of ways. We are looking here at the \npredominant or dominant use for the device. That is what we are \nconcerned with.\n  You might have a pacemaker which can speed up the activities of the \nheart\n\n[[Page S8890]]\n\nand some treatment might require that you slow down the beat of the \nheart. You might have one pacemaker that has already been approved, and \nsomeone else wanted to get on stream and say that they have a pacemaker \nthat speeds up the heart but also may slow it down. So they come in and \nsay, ``We want this approved because it will speed up the heart but it \nalso has the possibility of slowing it down,'' in order to circumvent \nthe safety requirements.\n  It seems to me we ought to be able to work that out. We are looking, \nas I said, as a criterium of the predominant and dominant device use as \nthe key. We are not looking for these other, incidental uses. It seems \nto me we ought to be able to work that through. For the reasons I \noutlined in discussing the good manufacturing practices provision, it \nseems to me we also ought to be able to find some common ground in that \narea, as well, but we are not there yet.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to consume as much \ntime as I may require under the pending debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, we are debating, in part, the FDA \nModernization Act, which is a very important piece of legislation \nbecause it goes to the issue of the health and safety of the Nation. I \ncongratulate the Senator from Vermont for having the foresight, \nability, and acumen to bring this bill to the floor after a \nconsiderable amount of negotiations and debate and discussion and \nactivity within the committee. In fact, we have been working on this \never since I have been on the committee. I believe that would be almost \n5 years now.\n  The need to modernize the FDA is obvious. I think it is obvious to \nanybody who represents any group of people, as we hear constantly from \nfolks in our States about problems that they have had with getting \ndrugs, getting devices in a prompt way and in a manner that will help \nthem live better lives. I, for example, had an instance where Helen \nZarnowski came to my office fairly regularly over the years as she \nsought to get approval, or wanted to be able to use various Alzheimer's \ndrugs, drugs being developed that were experimental, in order to help \nher husband, who, unfortunately, had Alzheimer's. She would come and \ntalk about how terrible this disease is--and it is a horrible disease--\nand how much she would like to be able to try this drug she had heard \nabout, or that drug which she knew was having positive effects. She had \nheard about some in Europe that had positive effects, which had been \napproved there. Yet, unfortunately, the process of approval in the FDA \ninvolved considerable delay, delay really well beyond what one would \nconsider to be common sense. Regrettably, her husband died in 1995. \nSome of the drugs that might have been able to be helpful were not \napproved by then.\n  Of course, we all, I suspect, have friends or people we know who have \ncontracted the AIDS disease and have had problems with AIDS. They are \nhistoric. The FDA has started to address that more aggressively in the \nlast few years. In the latter part of the 1980's, that was not the \ncase. Approval was delayed for an extended period of time in a variety \nof other areas, especially the device area, where people's lives could \nbe improved dramatically by getting a medical device that would assist \nin their rehabilitation. Or the testimony which was so heart rending \nand stark, given within our own committee by our own committee member, \nSenator Frist, a nationally prominent heart surgeon prior to becoming a \nU.S. Senator. He made it so clear that if he had simply had a device \nthat was available in Europe, he could have possibly saved some of his \npatients. But he could not get it because the FDA would not approve it \nin a manner that was timely enough to have it available for those \npatients.\n  So this is a very personal issue. It is brought up in the context of \nthe bureaucracy and the question of this huge institution called the \nFDA, but when you get right down to it, like most Government, this is a \nvery, very personal issue of people being impacted by their need to \nobtain care, by their belief that certain types of care that are \navailable maybe in other countries would help them, and their inability \nto get it in a timely manner in the United States. The FDA has had some \nreal problems. There has been, without question, an attitude that ran \nwell into the early part of this decade that caused FDA to be \nponderously bureaucratic in the manner in which it dealt with drug \napprovals and especially device approvals. That has changed. It has \nchanged for the better. It hasn't gone as far as it needs to go, no. \nBut that is what this bill is about--to give the FDA the capacity to go \neven further down the road toward being a positive force for the \napproval of drugs that may help people live longer, live better lives, \nand for the approval of devices that would help people live better \nlives. So especially for those individuals who are going to be \nimpacted, this is a very significant piece of legislation.\n  In addition, of course, it has the PDUFA language in it, which is \ncritical because PDUFA is the manner in which we fund the expedited \napproval process for all intents and purposes. And we need to have that \nfee system reauthorized so that we can keep on board the 600 or so \npeople who are employed through the PDUFA fee process to help us \nexpedite approvals. So that is one approval. In addition, it deals with \nthe question of a variety of questions such as health plans and what \ncan be said. And we approve that language in the bill. The issue of \nuniformity and how we deal with that--we have improved that language in \nthe bill for a variety of areas. But, most importantly, it is a piece \nof legislation which will--to use a nice term-- ``modernize'' the FDA \nand help us move more promptly to the approval of drugs and devices \nwhich will cause for better caring for Americans.\n  There has been a lot of discussion on this floor about the question \nof national uniformity in the area of over-the-counter drugs, and \nnational uniformity in the area of cosmetics. Certainly the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has expanded considerably on this topic. I must say \nthat at an entry point I do find it ironic that this bill would be \nfilibustered because when this bill is filibustered it slows down the \napproval process for people who have problems, for people who confront \ndiseases and who need new drugs and new devices. And the filibuster by \nvery definition when it was initiated on this floor in opposition to \nthis bill means people are going to have further delays--delays beyond \njust the bureaucratic delays, which are bad enough --delays which are \ncreated by the politics of the process. That is just not right. If the \nSenator from Massachusetts has a serious concern, which he, obviously, \ndoes about one or two items in this bill, he shouldn't be filibustering \nthis bill. He should be offering amendments to the bill letting us vote \nthem up or down and decide whether or not his position has the support \nof the body, or the bill as it was reported has the support of the \nbody. Clearly a filibuster is totally inappropriate and tremendously \nironic in the context of an issue which we are trying to expedite the \napproval of. And we run into a filibuster. It is bad enough, as I said, \nto have a bureaucratic slowdown of the approval process. But to have a \npolitical slowdown of the approval process is really, I think, \nunconscionable.\n  Independent of that point, let's go to some of the specifics here of \nthe concerns. The issue of uniformity is an issue which has been \naddressed and discussed at dramatic depths and lengths over the last \ndecade, at least--probably prior to that. That is the only time I \nrecall over the last decade. There have been commissions of very \nthoughtful people who are extraordinarily expert on the issue of how we \ndeal with the approval process and management of the drug and device \ndelivery system in this country, and who have looked at this. In fact, \nthere was a study, a group, a commission put together headed up by Carl \nEdwards, who was at one time head of the FDA, and the conclusion of \nthat commission, which was\n\n[[Page S8891]]\n\nput together at the request of the Congress as early as 1991, was that \nCongress should enact legislation that preempts additional and \nconflicting State requirements for all products--not a few, all \nproducts--subject to the FDA jurisdiction. States should be permitted \nto seek a preemption in areas where the FDA has acted based on \nconvincing local needs. States should in addition be allowed to \npetition for the adoption of national standards.\n  That is exactly what is proposed in this bill relative to the two \nitems that the Senator from Massachusetts appears to have problems \nwith--over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. It should, also, according \nto this language, have been proposed for food. We should have done \nuniformity for food if you follow the presentation of this commission \nproposal. And maybe there will be an amendment coming as we move \nforward on FDA reform which addresses the issue because I know there is \na lot of support on both sides of the aisle for the issue of uniformity \non food regulation as well as drugs--over-the-counter drugs and \ncosmetics.\n  But the point here is that an independent, thoughtful, \ncongressionally supported commission headed up by the former head of \nFDA concluded that this type of uniformity is exactly what we need in \norder to effectively administer and protect--administer the issue of \nfood and drugs and protect the public. In their 1-year review of their \nreport--1 year later. That was a unanimous agreement, I should have \nmentioned, reached by the commission, and 14 of the 17 people on this \ncommission said, ``We reaffirm our original recommendation that \nCongress should enact legislation preempting conflicting or additional \nrequirements for products subject to FDA regulation with provisions for \nthe States to be able to demonstrate a genuine need for distinctive \nrequirements to seek an exemption. Failing action by Congress, FDA \nshould adopt regulations to accomplish the same rules for national \nuniformity.''\n  They went a step further. They said even, ``If the Congress doesn't \ngo the uniformity route, the FDA ought to do it unilaterally with \nregulation.''\n  I don't agree with that. I think it is the prerogative of the \nCongress to decide this type of issue. But the fact is they felt so \nstrongly about this as a group of commissioners who had expertise in \nthis area that they asked for that type of an extraordinary action. \nThat would have meant uniformity for drugs, food, over-the-counter \ndrugs, and uniformity for cosmetics.\n  Then Commissioner Edwards reaffirmed this point in a letter that he \nsent to Chairman Jeffords by saying ``national uniformity should play a \ngreater role in FDA-State relations. If not, the agency's ability to \nprotect''--this is the issue; how do you protect? --``to protect \nconsumers will be further eroded and unnecessary concerns will be \nimposed on the national Congress.''\n  Former Commissioner Arthur Paul Hayes wrote in July 1997, ``I write \nin strong support of the national uniformity provisions in S. 830 for \nthe nonprescriptive drugs and cosmetics, I have long believed that a \nsingle national system for regulations for these FDA-regulated products \nis essential and now overdue.''\n  So you have a commission which was the brainchild of the Congress to \ndetermine what FDA should do and how they should manage the issue of \ndrugs, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, and food; a commission \nsaying: Use uniformity. Why did they say that? They said it because \nthey believe that to have 51 FDA's running around the countryside--50 \nStates plus the Federal FDA--would create chaos. It would confuse the \nconsumer and create a situation where a consumer in one State was to be \ngiven one piece of advice and the consumer in the next State was being \ngiven another piece of advice, and as a result, rather than having an \nencouragement of a comprehensive, thoughtful approach to health \nprotection, you would have confusion and anarchy in the public's mind \nas to what was correct in the area of health care and protection.\n  It is a pretty logical position. I have to say as someone who comes \nfrom the States' rights viewpoint, and who has spent most of my life \ndefending States' rights, that it runs against my grain to want one \nFederal agency to run the country on one issue but, when you think \nabout it, to do it any other way would be to undermine the health, and \ncertainly the veracity and the confidence of the public on the issue of \nhealth care provided.\n  This is especially true in the area of FDA because even though the \nFDA has been excessively bureaucratic, nobody would argue that they \nhaven't been extremely professional. They are an agency which has and \nmaintains the view that they are the world's premier reviewer and \nprotector of public health. And I think they have credibility in taking \nthat position.\n  That is why I think as a States' rights advocate I am willing--or one \nof the reasons I am willing--to say yes in this area. The role of the \nFDA is unique, and to undermine the role of the FDA--that is what you \nwould be doing--to undermine the role of the FDA by allowing the 50 \nStates to basically pursue arbitrary independent views in areas where \nthe FDA has the authority to regulate would be a big mistake. It would \nrun counter to the basic goals of having a strong system of health \nprotection in this country.\n  So we are talking here about how you protect the public health. And \nwhat we have is a commission set up with the support of the Congress \nwhich concluded--we have experts; they weren't Members of Congress on \nthis--concluding that the way to protect the public health is to have \nuniformity.\n  So let's give that a fair amount of credibility. Let's not just \ndiscard that. I think that is a fairly persuasive point in favor of the \nlanguage in this bill which tracks the proposal of the commission, the \nEdwards Commission, for all intents and purposes, and which was brought \nforward out of committee with a vote of something like 14 to 4--\noverwhelming support because the people on the committee who have taken \na long time looking at this sort of thing understand that the \ncommission made sense when it came to these conclusions.\n  Before I get into the specific responses to some of the points made \nhere, there is another general theme that comes out which is that if \nyou take the argument coming in opposition to the uniformity standards \nin this bill you are essentially taking an argument that says the FDA \ncan't do its job; the FDA isn't competent; that the States are more \ncompetent than the FDA. The corollary to that is you are saying the FDA \ndoesn't care; the FDA isn't really interested in health and safety; \nthat there are areas of health and safety under its regulatory \nresponsibility, under its portfolio, that it has no responsibility, and \nthat it is going to walk away from it. Those are heavy charges to make \nagainst the FDA.\n  But that is essentially the subtlety of the position in opposition to \nuniformity: It is that the FDA isn't capable of administering its \nportfolio and it doesn't care about safety. I personally disagree with \nthat. If anything, the FDA consistently errs in favor of safety, which \nis probably the right way to do it. We are asking in this bill that \nthey streamline their efforts, that they expedite their procedures, but \nwe are not asking that they do it at the expense of safety. And to \nimply that they aren't going to fulfill their obligations--which is not \nan implication but basically a statement made here on numerous \noccasions--citing that only two people are doing this, three people are \ndoing that, to imply that they are not going to fulfill their \nobligations is I think incorrect. I think the track record shows that \nthe FDA does fulfill its obligations in many ways, and it maybe is a \nlittle slow in doing it sometimes. But it sure does get into the issue \nof safety. And to presume that it would not is I think inappropriate or \ninaccurate. ``Inappropriate'' is not correct. Obviously, you can \npresume anything you want. So that is another point.\n\n  First, we have the commissions' support for this proposal.\n  Second, we have the logic of the committees' support for this \nproposal.\n  Third, we have the fact that the FDA is perfectly capable of pursuing \nthis proposal and should be pursuing this approach because a single \nuniform approach is what makes sense for the health and safety of the \nAmerican citizenry.\n  There were a number of specific points made in representations \nrelative specifically to cosmetics. But you have\n\n[[Page S8892]]\n\nto remember that cosmetics isn't any different here than over-the-\ncounter drugs for all intents and purposes. Thus, I am surprised with \nthe intensity of opposition of the colleagues; that we don't have the \nsame intensity of opposition to over-the-counter drugs. It seems to be \ninconsistent to me. And it may just be that the photographs are better \nfor cosmetics than over-the-counter drugs. I doubt that. You can \nprobably find some pretty heinous photographs that relate to over-the-\ncounter drugs. But the fact is that, I think, that is inconsistent.\n  In specific, the statement was made that the States will no longer be \nable to regulate, or to paraphrase it, the States will no longer be \nable to regulate the packaging and labeling of cosmetics. That isn't \nreally accurate. Nothing preempts State enforcement powers. States may \nseize, embargo, or pursue judicial proceedings whenever necessary to \nenforce the law; Federal law; the FDA law.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GREGG. States are also free to publicize any information or \nwarning they deem necessary. They simply cannot force the manufacturers \nto post warnings unless they can get the FDA to agree that that warning \nis legitimate.\n  What is wrong with that? Nothing. FDA is certainly going to want a \nwarning on a bottle if it is proven to cause cancer. It is absurd to \nthink they will let the bottle or whatever it is out on the market. If \nthere is some threat that is created by something, the FDA is going to \nstep forward.\n  States will have two specific options under this legislation. The \nStates may use the existing authority provided under 21 CFR 10.30 to \npetition the FDA to make any requirement a national requirement. So \nthey can ask that their proposals, their ideas, be moved up to the \nnational level. Under this provision, States may seek an exemption. If \nyou have a law or requirement that is different from the FDA's, the \nStates can come to the FDA and say we think there should be a national \nprotection.\n  For example, the Senator from Massachusetts was talking about the \nstudies in the State of Alaska and what the State of Massachusetts was \ndoing in the area of caring for women. If they feel strongly about \nthat, they can go to the FDA and ask that those types of disclosures \nwhich they think are appropriate in the State of Washington and the \nState of Massachusetts be national. Why shouldn't they?\n  The other side of that argument is that, well, women in Washington \nand women in Massachusetts should get a different warning label than \nwomen in New York State or women in Oregon. Why? If it is that serious, \nwhy would you want the people in Washington to know something different \nthan the people in Oregon? Obviously, you would not. The logic is that \nthe FDA should make the determination as to whether or not it is \nserious enough to require national disclosure or to make a \ndetermination whether it isn't so that you don't arbitrarily scare the \npeople in one State versus another State. It really makes no sense to \nhave a hodgepodge of disclosures on these over-the-counter drugs and \ncosmetics, requiring that over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics are not \ndrugs in the traditional sense that they are defined by the statute. \nDrugs are clearly something that the FDA is going to be involved in.\n  So it is just an inconsistency here to this argument that the FDA \nshould not be making the decisions but that the States should be making \ndecisions because you end up with inconsistency from State to State by \ndefinition. So I don't think that argument really applies.\n  Now, there was another representation that I believe 47,000 injuries \nresulted last year from cosmetics use. This calculation was not \nanalyzed in its representation, the specifics of it. I think it should \nbe.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic \nEmergency Injury Surveillance System came up with this figure in a 1988 \nHouse hearing. I believe that is what is being referred to here. Their \ncalculation included things such as slipping on soap in the shower, \nsuicide attempts, injuries from broken bottles, plus in the context of \ntotal usage 47,000 injuries, some of which clearly weren't involved in \nthe character of a cosmetics, represents .00044 percent, which I \nbelieve is less than five ten-thousandths--five ten-thousandths--of the \nnumber of products sold in the country; 10.5 billion products sold in \nthe country and 47,000 potentially caused injuries, some of which \ninvolved slipping on soap or broken bottles or possibly ingesting \nthings intentionally to cause harm, and that represented .00044 percent \nor less than five ten-thousandths of the products sold.\n  You have to put that in a little bit of context here because, as \nstudied by the same group, injuries caused by couches and sofas were \n70,000. Almost twice as many injuries were caused by couches and sofas \nas were caused by cosmetics. And 117,000 were caused by drinking \nglasses. Are we going to have that be State regulated--drinking \nglasses? And 253,000 were caused by pillows, mattresses, and beds. What \nis that, almost six times the number caused by cosmetics studied by the \nsame group. So when that number is thrown out here, I think it has to \nbe put in context, and I think that puts it in the context of ``less \nthan persuasive'' would be the adequate term to put to that statement.\n  Now, also, the point was made that cosmetics pose an inherent threat \nto a person's health and safety. I think we just saw from the numbers \nit is not very inherent if it is less than five ten-thousandths of a \npercent that are impacted.\n  But cosmetics by definition are inherently the safest products FDA \nregulates. Cosmetics, as defined by the Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetics Act, section 201(I), means:\n\n       Articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or \n     sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the \n     human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, \n     promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and (2) \n     articles intended for use as a component of any such \n     articles; except that such term shall not include soap.\n\n  We are not talking about products that affect the structure of any \nfunction of the body. Such products are viewed as drugs. So if it \naffects structure, if it affects function of the body, it is a drug; it \nis not a cosmetic.\n  In fact, former Commissioner Kessler stated in a hearing in the \nHouse, again in 1991:\n\n       People can take comfort from the fact that the cosmetics \n     industry is as safe as they come.\n\n  So cosmetics are not inherently dangerous, which would be what you \nwould think if you listened to the debate here for the last couple of \ndays.\n  There are problems with cosmetics. Nobody is going to deny that. And \nthat is what we have the FDA for. When there is a problem, that is what \nthe FDA is there for.\n  Now, there was another statement, I believe, made that 884 cosmetic \ningredients have been found to be toxic. That is a pretty strong \nstatement. Of course, we all know that things that are toxic are things \nthat we deal with every day. Salt is toxic if you take too much of it. \nIn fact, that list included chemicals such as water, salt, and vinegar. \nThis was a list derived from a list published by the National Institute \nof Occupational Safety and Health Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical \nSubstances, which list, as I mentioned, included such things as water, \nsalt, and vinegar.\n  So toxicity depends on the manner in which it is used and the manner \nof application as versus by definition that the substance is toxic. \n``Many substances that are common in everyday life are obviously \ntoxic.''\n  Mr. President, 884 ingredients were evaluated by the Cosmetic \nIngredient Review Expert Panel to determine if they were toxic. This \nwas not mentioned, I don't think, during the debate. They found no \nsignificant health effects with the cosmetic use of any of them. So, \nagain, I don't think that argument is persuasive.\n  Then there is the GAO report on which a considerable amount of \ndiscussion has been spent. I believe the Senator from Massachusetts was \nreferring to the 1978 GAO report that listed 125 ingredients which were \nthen available for use in cosmetic products that were suspected of \ncausing cancer, 25 that were suspected of causing birth defects, and 20 \nthat were suspected of adversely affecting the nervous system.\n  The GAO report goes on to state that:\n\n       Neither we nor NIOSH--\n\n  Which is the other Federal agency that would have responsibility \nhere; I just quoted their numbers--\n\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\n\n     has reviewed the adequacy of the tests performed or the \n     applicability of the tests performed or the applicability of \n     the results to exposure to the ingredients through the use of \n     cosmetics.\n\n  They haven't reviewed that. In fact, much of the limited scientific \nwork done before this list was first compiled by NIOSH was done at \nextremely high exposure levels, rather than against a relative \nbaseline.\n  Anytime the FDA would like the Cosmetics Review Panel, in its \ncapacity as an independent expert panel meeting the same criteria as \nany FDA review board, to review the data, to review the safety data on \nanything that can be used as a cosmetic ingredient, they may request \nthat it be done. But the FDA has never asked them to do that. The CIR \nhas never denied such a request. The FDA may have asked, but the CIR \nhas never denied the request. The fact is that if something causes \ncancer and if it were being used in some sort of cosmetic and as a \nresult cancer was being generated, you would have FDA action.\n  What do we think the FDA is, a potted plant? They are not going to \nsit around if there were any cancer-causing substances that were being \ngenerated by any cosmetic that were a threat. The idea that a State is \ngoing to step up and do a better job of evaluating whether or not there \nis a carcinogenic effect to anything is, I think, a bit of an affront \nto the FDA. The fact is the FDA takes cancer pretty darned serious. And \nthey aren't about to walk away from anything or not get involved in \nanything that has a cancer issue, a serious cancer issue. So bandying \naround numbers like that may create headlines, but I don't think it is \npersuasive if you look at the substance of this.\n  Now, there has been some representation that FDA doesn't have a whole \nlot of regulatory authority here. It has a lot of regulatory authority, \nas was shown again by the Edwards Commission. FDA is the regulatory \nagency, and that's why there should be uniformity.\n  Just let me read a few of these.\n  Section 301 prohibits the introduction into, or receipt of, any \ncosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded in interstate commerce.\n  Section 303 lists the penalties for violating section 301, starting \nat imprisonment for up to 1 year and a $1,000 fine.\n  Section 601 defines ``adulterated''--if it contains a poisonous or \ndeleterious substance; contains a filthy or decomposed substance--we \nare not even talking about things that are going to cause you cancer \nhere; we are talking about a filthy or decomposed substance--if it was \nprepared, packaged or stored under unsanitary conditions; its container \nis made of an adulterated substance; or if it contains a color additive \nnot approved by the FDA.\n\n  We heard a lot about color additives earlier.\n  Section 706 requires FDA to approve color additives as safe before \nthey can be used in cosmetics.\n  Again, we heard a lot about color additives, but the FDA has \nauthority here.\n  Section 602 defines ``misbranded'' as: False or misleading labeling; \nif the package is not labeled with the name and place of business of \nthe manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and with accurate quantity; \nif any word required by Federal law or regulation to appear on the \nlabel is not prominently displayed in a readable and understandable \nmanner; if the container is misbranded; if the color additives don't \nconform with requirements; or if the packaging or labeling violates the \nPoison Prevention Packaging Act.\n  Section 201(n) states that misbranding must also calculate the extent \nto which the required facts are not revealed.\n  The FDA has broad authority--broad authority--here. And they will use \nthat authority.\n  The FDA can ban or restrict ingredients for safety reasons, mandate \nwarning labels, inspect manufacturing facilities, issue warning \nletters, obtain court orders to seize illegal products, obtain court \norders to enjoin activities, prosecute any violators, publicize public \nhealth issues, and work with manufacturers to implement nationwide \nrecalls.\n  There are 41 pages--41 pages--in the FDA, in the Federal Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act applying to cosmetics--41 pages. There are 32 pages of \nFDA regulations of cosmetics in the Code of Federal Regulations. The \nfact is that the FDA knows this issue and has the capacity to deal with \nthis issue. The idea that the States are going to do a better job--\nwell, I suppose that if they are they can come to the FDA, under the \nlaw as proposed in this bill and say, ``We have done a better job. \nChange the Federal rule.'' And the FDA will do that, because that is \nwhat the law gives them the authority to do. Or if they think it is a \nunique situation, then the States can come and say we want special \ntreatment for this, and the FDA will give them that authority.\n\n  But the point here is that you should not have--and my colleague uses \nthe term women or children a great deal. I think it is just about \nanybody who would be impacted. But you should not have women in \nWashington State getting a different instruction from women in the \nState of Oregon, because it is going to confuse people. Who is going to \nknow who is getting the better instruction, the people in New York \nversus the people in Massachusetts? Let's have it done consistently, \nacross the country. That is why the commission decided in favor of \nuniformity. Uniformity on over-the-counter drugs, uniformity for \ncosmetics, uniformity for food. We don't have food in this bill. Maybe \nwe will. Maybe there will be an amendment.\n  There is some representation--I couldn't get it clear but I think \nthere was a representation relative to California's status. Let's \ndefine California's status. This law is prospective. It doesn't affect \nthe California situation at all. Prop 65 remains effective in \nCalifornia. So that bit of red herring should be put to bed.\n  There has been this representation there are only two people over at \nthe FDA doing this or that. The FDA regulates cosmetics. It has the \nfinancial capability--and we will give it the financial capability if \nit feels it doesn't have it--to have the personnel to do the job right. \nAnd I believe that, as part of its portfolio, the leadership of the FDA \nwill do the job right. To say they will not or imply they will not, \nwhich is the representation, I think, as I said earlier--the subtle \nundercurrent of these representations in opposition to this language \nthat the FDA cannot do its job is, I think, incorrect. I think the FDA \nhas shown its capacity. So, resources, here, is not really an issue at \nall. Resources may be an issue for us as the Congress. But I can assure \nyou that, as a member of the Appropriations Committee--sitting not on \nthe FDA subcommittee but on the overall committee--I would have no \nproblem funding whatever is needed in this area. I suspect none of my \ncolleagues would either. In fact, this bill is about that, with the \nPDUFA language. It is about funding the FDA in a more effective way. In \nfact, I put an adjustment in this bill so we would not end up cutting \nFDA, as a result of the PDUFA funding from base funding, which is \ncritical.\n  There was also, I believe, a representation that this prevents the \nStates from providing public information. No, it does not. Under this \nprovision, the States remain free to publicize any information or \nwarning they deem necessary. They simply cannot force manufacturers to \npost the warning unless the FDA says they agree with it. As I said \nearlier, what's wrong with that? If a State decides that something \nneeds to be put on a warning label, they can come to the FDA, say, \n``This is important.'' The FDA will evaluate it and tell them, ``Yes, \nit works,'' or, ``No, it doesn't work.'' If you do it another way, you \nget into this confusing, anarchic situation I spoke about earlier. This \nis a transient society. People coming from different States are going \nto see different statements, different warnings. They are not going to \nknow what to think, and that undermines health because it undermines \nconfidence. It's better to have a single agency making that decision \nbecause, when you are dealing with health, you have to have confidence.\n  There are a couple of specific claims--lead in hair dye was one, I \nbelieve. In 1980 the FDA approved the use of lead acetate as a color \nadditive, ``safe for use in cosmetics that color the hair.'' That \napproval was based on extensive testing that showed there was no \ntoxicological risk of lead absorption through the skin from lead \nacetate in hair dye. Hair dye is one of the most stringently tested \nproducts on\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\nthe market today. The FDA has the authority to impose any warning it \nchooses to promote the continued safety use of hair dye. The fact is, \nthe FDA is engaged in the issue and has made the decisions which it \ndeems appropriate for safety. We should have a consistency across this \ncountry, based on what they have decided.\n  Mercury in lipstick and nail polish was also cited as an example. \nMercury, through the Code of Federal Regulations, has been \naffirmatively banned for use in all cosmetic products except eye area \npreservatives, so I am not sure why this idea was thrown out. Maybe it \nwas a red herring.\n  ``Alpha-hydroxy in face creams causes cancer.'' That was, I believe, \nthe representation. Certainly it has been discussed at considerable \nlength as a concern. In 1995, the Office of Cosmetics and Colors' \nDirector stated that appropriate actions can be taken in product \ncharacterization or through proper label warning statements in regards \nto reactions to alpha-hydroxy. So the FDA stepped up to this issue. He \nnoted that the adverse reactions reported--often allergy-type \nsymptoms--could be due to the pH factor in the product and not the \nactual concentration. He did not raise any concerns about it causing \ncancer.\n\n  If the FDA is concerned that this type of product is causing cancer, \nit already is investigating such products generally and why would it \nleave this product on the market? Obviously, it would not. Alpha-\nhydroxy has been used literally for 3,000 years, in hundreds of \ndifferent ways. Just this past June the Cosmetic Ingredient Review of \nthis independent group I mentioned before, unanimously confirmed after \npublic debate that alpha-hydroxy is safe for use in a variety of \nproducts. However, if there is evidence now, or that comes to light \nlater to the contrary, I am certain that the decision would be reversed \nand these products would be prohibited nationally. And they should be \nprohibited nationally if they are that much of a problem. Why should \nthey be prohibited in just one State? Obviously, they should not be. \nWhy would you protect one State over another State? If the legitimacy \nof the science is such that it is determined that the product is a \nproblem, then obviously the FDA is going to sign on to that debate at \nthat point, and you are going to have a national ban or national \nwarning.\n  But to have the people in the State of Washington told one thing and \nthe people in the State of Oregon told another thing and the people in \nthe State of Nevada told another thing--six States in New England that \nsit right on top of each other such that you can't go shopping without \ngoing to one of the other States. At least that is what we hope. We \nhope that everybody from Massachusetts goes to New Hampshire to go \nshopping. The fact is, What are you going to do? Are you going to tell \nthem they are going to get a different labeling than they get in \nMassachusetts? Foolish, worse than foolish, because it undermines \nconfidence in the health care delivery system and the safety and \nefficacy of it, which has always been the core, always been the core, \nreally, of one of the great strengths of our health care system in this \ncountry, which is that we have public confidence in its safety, \nprimarily as a result of the work of the FDA.\n  If you have a lot of different States moving into this area you have \nconfusion, and confusion leads to lack of confidence and that is why, \nagain--it was not my idea. It was not the committee's idea to go to \nuniformity. It was a commission, set up by the Congress, with \nprofessionals, who said uniformity makes sense. It not only makes \nsense, it's essential--essential. So the alpha-hydroxy, I think is, \nagain, a matter of hyperbole, maybe, in this debate. Certainly the \nphotographs have been aggressively used. But is it substantively an \nissue? No. Because the FDA is already involved in that debate, has made \ninitial decisions on that debate, and if it were determined that there \nwere further decisions that had to be made on that product, it would \nmake them.\n  A side point--I believe there was a statement there is no cosmetic \nhotline. There is a cosmetic hotline. It's at the FDA. In fact I'll \ngive it to people, 1-800-270-8869. Call it up if you have a question.\n  As I mentioned, Prop 65 has been addressed.\n  So, overall this goes, not only to uniformity of cosmetics, that's \njust one, the uniformity of over-the-counter drugs, uniformity of \nmanagement of our health care system in the area of drug protection and \nquality of the drug delivery system in our country is something that \nhas been concluded to be essential. This bill tries to accomplish that \nand pursues that course.\n  I am not sure what energizes the opposition with such enthusiasm, \nexcept the leader of the opposition is an enthusiastic individual. But \nI do not feel the facts or the substance support any of the--or even a \nmarginal amount of the presentation made from the other side. The facts \nand the substance support the position of the committee; the position \nof the committee, which it passed out 14 to 4, which is that uniformity \nprotects the public. It protects the public health, maintains \nconfidence in the public system, and allows us as a nation to deliver \nbetter health care.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I commend the Senator. His expertise \nin this area has helped us greatly and I am sure will lead us to a \nfinal conclusion here.\n  I would also like to point out as another member of a small State, \nhow we would suffer if we had to rely upon others, since we have no \nresources to do any of this investigation ourself. We would be placed \nin a position without uniformity to have to rely on some big State or \nsomething to tell us what we should or should not do. We really have no \nability in ourselves to protect our citizens, that we would like to. I \nwonder if you would agree with that as well?\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree 100 percent with what the Senator from Vermont is \nsaying, being from New Hampshire, an equally small State, and knowing \nit would be confusing to our consumers who cross the borders all the \ntime to purchase products, if they were not able to rely on a \nnationally regarded, highly expert agency to evaluate their health care \nproducts instead of a hodgepodge from the States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I only anticipate speaking for a few \nminutes. I know Senator Coats will follow me.\n  This legislation to modernize the Food and Drug Administration and \nreauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will, upon enactment, \nstreamline the FDA's regulatory procedures. This modernizing will help \nthe agency review medical devices and drugs more expeditiously and will \nlet the American public have access sooner to newer, safer, and more \neffective therapeutic products.\n  I am disappointed that some of my Democratic colleagues are still \nattempting to block this bill.\n  I am especially chagrined given the months of bipartisan negotiating \nthat have led to this bill. Each major provision--every drug issue and \nall but one medical device provision of this measure, represents long-\nsought agreements with the minority and with the FDA itself. We have \nmade significant concessions on the uniformity provision objected to by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts to ensure that a State may act on \ncosmetic safety issues in the absence of FDA action. I do not \nunderstand this continued objection and delay. In particular, I am \ndisappointed that after countless hours and many concessions to his \npoint of view, the ranking minority member is opposing progress in \npassage. And I must add that I wish to applaud his willingness--and his \ntenacity--in working through several difficult issues to reach a \nconsensus on 99 percent of this legislation. In addition Secretary \nShalala and the FDA itself, has worked diligently, to reach reasonable, \nsensible agreements.\n\n[[Page S8895]]\n\nThis is a good, bipartisan measure that represents moderate, yet real \nreforms. There is no reason for further delay.\n  On June 11, prior to the committee markup of S. 830, I received a \nletter from Secretary Shalala outlining the Department's key concerns. \nIn her letter the Secretary stated:\n\n       I am concerned that the inclusion of non consensus issues \n     in the committee's bill will result in a protracted and \n     contentious debate.\n\n  Before and since our committee markup, we have worked hard to achieve \na consensus bill. And the measure before us today accomplishes that \ngoal. Bipartisan staff have worked diligently with the agency to \naddress each of the significant nonconsensus provisions raised by the \nSecretary.\n  The American people will hardly believe that anyone would suggest \nthat disagreement over 6 pages out of a total of 152 is grounds for \nholding up consideration of this important bill. A little over a month \nago, we all joined together to further the economic health of the \ncountry by voting for an historic budget bill, despite our many \nmisgivings, on each of our part, on far more than 6 pages of that \nlegislation. We must do no less here to promote the physical health of \nour citizens by moving forward to approve S. 830.\n  In her letter, Secretary Shalala felt the legislation would lower the \nreview standard for marketing approval. Key changes have been made to \nthe substitute to address these concerns. With respect to the number of \nclinical investigations required for approval, changes were made to \nassure that there is not a presumption of less than two well controlled \nand adequate investigations--while guarding against the rote \nrequirement of two studies. The measure clarifies that substantial \nevidence may, when the Secretary determines that such data and evidence \nare sufficient to establish effectiveness, consist of data from one \nadequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory \nevidence, totally under the control of the FDA.\n  Concerns were raised also about allowing distribution of experimental \ntherapies without adequate safeguards to assure patient safety or \ncompletion of research on efficacy. Changes to accommodate those \nconcerns were made. We tightened the definition of who may provide \nunapproved therapies and gave the FDA more control over the expanded \naccess process.\n  Other changes will ensure that use of products outside of clinical \ntrials will not interfere with adequate enrollment of patients in those \ntrials and also give the FDA authority to terminate expanded access if \npatient safeguard protections are not met. The provision allowing \nmanufacturers to charge for products covered under the expedited access \nprovision was deleted also.\n  In mid-June, the Secretary argued that S. 830 would allow health \nclaims for foods and economic claims for drugs and biologic products \nwithout adequate scientific proof.\n  In response, Senator Gregg agreed to changes that would allow the FDA \n120 days to review a health claim and provide the agency with the \nauthority to prevent the claim from being used in the market place by \nissuing an interim final regulation. In addition, the provision \nallowing pharmaceutical manufacturers to distribute economic \ninformation was modified to clarify that the information must be based \non competent and reliable scientific evidence and limited the scope to \nclaims directly related to an indication for which the drug was \napproved. That problem is taken care of.\n  This bill was further changed to accommodate the Secretary's \nopposition to the provision that would allow third party review for \ndevices.\n  Products now excluded from third party review include class III \nproducts, products that are implantable for more than 1 year, those \nthat are life-sustaining or life-supporting, and products that are of \nsubstantial importance in the prevention of impairment to human health. \nIn addition, a provision advocated by Senator Harkin has been \nincorporated that clarifies the statutory right of the FDA to review \nrecords related to compensation agreements between accredited reviewers \nand device sponsors. I would add that FDA's existing stringent \nregulations which protect against conflicts of interest in today's \nthird-party review program would apply to the expanded program created \nby this bill.\n  Finally, the Secretary was concerned about provisions that she felt \nwould burden the Agency with extensive new regulatory requirements that \nwould detract resources from critical agency functions without \ncommensurate enhancement of the public health. This legislation now \ngives FDA new powers to make enforcement activity more efficient, adds \nimportant new patient benefits and protections, and makes the review \nprocess more efficient.\n  First, we give FDA new powers and clarify existing authority, \nincluding mandatory foreign facility registration, seizure authority \nfor certain imported goods, and a presumption of interstate commerce \nfor FDA regulated products.\n  Second, to assist patients with finding out about promising new \nclinical trials, we establish a clinical trials database registry \naccessed by an 800 number. Patients will also benefit from a new \nrequirement that companies report annually on their compliance with \nagreements to conduct post-approval studies on drugs.\n  Third, FDA's burden will be eased by provisions to make the review \nprocess more collaborative. Collaborative review will improve the \nquality of applications for new products and reduce the length of time \nand effort required to review products. We also expressly allow FDA to \naccess expertise at other science based agencies and contract with \nexperts to help with product reviews.\n  Lastly, by expanding the third-party review pilot program for medical \ndevices, we build on an important tool for the agency to use in \nmanaging an increasing workload in an era of declining Federal \nresources.\n  In closing, I would echo another part of Secretary Shalala's June 11 \nletter:\n\n       I want to commend you and members of the Committee on both \n     sides of the aisle on the progress we have made together to \n     develop a package of sensible, consensus reform provisions \n     that are ready for consideration with reauthorization of the \n     Prescription Drug User Fee Act . . .\n       . . . a protracted and contentious debate . . . would not \n     serve our mutual goal of timely reauthorization of PDUFA and \n     passage of constructive, consensus bipartisan FDA reform.\n\n  From the beginning of this process, all of the stakeholders have been \ncommitted to producing a consensus measure--and we have accomplished \nthat goal. There is overwhelming agreement on this bill. For those who \nstill oppose a few pages of this bill I can only say that we will \ncontinue to bend over backward to accommodate their concerns and to \nbring about an even closer consensus. Dozens and dozens of changes have \nbeen made. The Secretary of Health and Human Services knows that we \nwill continue to work with her--this is not the end of the line. But at \nsome point, the Senate must move on, and we have reached that point, \nMr. President.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I know this debate today doesn't have the \nfireworks that the debate on Friday had about FDA reform. I know we are \ntoday detailing some of the specifics of the reform legislation that is \nbefore us, but I think it is important for us to lay out this record as \nto why it is important to go forward with FDA reform and what the FDA \nreform bill that is before this Congress actually proposes.\n  On Friday, I laid out the why of the need for reform, but I didn't \nlay out the what it is that we are actually doing to bring about this \nreform and what is included in this bill. I think it is important for \nour colleagues and Members to focus on the constructive things that we \nhave done through our exhaustive process in the Labor and Human \nResources Committee to conduct an FDA reform bill that can truly bring \ngreater efficiency to this agency.\n  On Friday, I indicated how much many of us resent the charge that we \nare somehow gutting the FDA. FDA is an important agency. It is an \nagency that does protect the health and safety of Americans, and we \nwant to do all that we can to give that agency the kind of resources \nand the necessary support that it needs to continue that effort. Yet, \nclearly, I think the case\n\n[[Page S8896]]\n\nthat was laid out Friday indicates the need for substantial reform of \nthe agency on how it does its business, how it is going to proceed in \nthe future.\n  Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts has stated the agency has improved \nso much in the last few years--and others have said the same thing, \nincluding a former commissioner--that it doesn't need congressional \nreform. I think the facts indicate otherwise. As I outlined on Friday, \nthe agency can't come close to meeting its statutory deadlines for \napproval of either drugs or devices. There have been egregious examples \nof delays that have affected people's safety and health, and we want to \ndo everything we can to minimize those delays and to make the agency a \nmore constructive force in terms of dealing with these questions.\n  The President's latest budget is outlined in this publication I have \nentitled ``Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug \nAdministration, Justification of Estimates for Appropriations \nCommittee.'' This is a backup document, material facts in terms of the \nPresident's budget decision, as to how much we should fund FDA for the \nnext fiscal year.\n  Having outlined all of these problems that exist at FDA in approving \ndrugs, in approving devices and expediting the process and even \nbeginning to attempt to meet their statutory requirements, it is \nastounding that the President's budget for next year does not only not \nstrengthen the agency, it diminishes its effectiveness.\n  The proposal here plans to cut the agency's total appropriated budget \nby 8 percent and cut the device center budget--that is the center that \nreviews and approves medical devices--by 27 percent. This is at a time \nwhen, if we need to do anything, we need to increase the funding for \nthe agency or at least find ways to help the agency with outside \nsources to try to do its job more effectively and more efficiently.\n  So that alone--I guess this was designed to meet some budget numbers, \nbut it certainly doesn't square with the assertions that the agency is \nwell on the way to solving its problems and, given a little more time \nand few more resources, those problems will be solved. It also flies in \nthe face, I think, of the facts that have been presented on this floor \nin terms of the agency's inability to meet its statutory requirements \nfor review and approval of devices.\n  In just a couple of areas, with respect to the 510(k) submissions, \nthe agency itself predicts that it will complete 6 percent fewer \napplications in fiscal year 1998 over fiscal year 1997 because it has \nfewer resources. It also predicts that it will review them 20 percent \nslower than it did in fiscal year 1996. In fiscal year 1996, it took \nthem an average of 110 agency days for review; in fiscal year 1997, 120 \ndays; for fiscal year 1998 it is predicted to be 130 days and will only \ncomplete 40 percent of the submissions in the statutory 90-day period \ncompared with 60 percent last year.\n  So it makes no sense whatsoever to assert that the agency is well on \nthe way to reforming itself and this legislation isn't needed when the \nagency's own predictions, own plan for what it is able to do with the \nresources it has for next year, indicates that it is going in the other \ndirection, not toward reform, not toward more efficiency, not toward \nmeeting their statutory requirements, but in the opposite direction.\n  With respect to PMA applications, the agency has said, while it \nexpects to receive slightly more PMA applications than in recent years, \nit will complete 27 percent fewer applications. In fiscal year 1997, \nthey completed 75. But for fiscal year 1998, they predict they will \nonly complete 55, and that they will review those applications 15 \npercent slower than last year, 250 days of review as opposed to 220 \ndays, that they will complete only 35 percent within the first 180 \ndays--that is the statutory limitation--as compared with 53 percent \nlast year, and they will have a 17 percent increase in the backlog.\n  If there has ever been justification for reform of FDA, it is in \nlooking at their own estimates of what they will be able to do next \nyear as compared to previous years. And so they are certainly not \nreforming themselves, certainly not going in the right direction. They \nare going in exactly the opposite direction.\n  What we are trying to do here with this legislation that Senator \nJeffords is leading the effort on--I might add with a lot of bipartisan \nsupport, both Republicans and Democrats, as indicated by the cloture \nvote last week with I think only five votes in support of Senator \nKennedy's support of a filibuster. People want to move forward here. We \nknow that hanging in the balance are decisions that can affect people's \nhealth and safety and their very lives. We want to do this in a more \nefficient and effective manner. So I think there is certainly \njustification for going forward with this reform bill.\n  I just point out, for the benefit of my colleagues, that even after \nextensive debate and markup in the committee, which produced a vote of \n14 in favor and only 4 against on the legislation that we are \ndiscussing today, there has been considerable negotiation. I have in my \nhand here a list of 33 separately negotiated compromises to try to \naccommodate the Senator from Massachusetts, four pages of single-spaced \nnegotiations on 33 separate items to try to address the concern of the \nSenator from Massachusetts and a couple of other Senators on the \ncommittee who thought that perhaps we should have addressed these in \ncommittee.\n  In good faith, we sat down with them and attempted to address their \nconcerns. I know that Senator Harkin had a particular concern during \nthe markup, and we were very close to getting an agreement on that. And \nI take responsibility for not accepting it at the time. In retrospect, \nI think Senator Harkin was correct. I think what he was suggesting in \nterms of how we classify medical devices and what devices will be \neligible for outside third-party review was correct. And so we notified \nhim of that. We worked with his staff, and we made the change.\n  So the bill before us incorporates the change that he thought we \nshould have made in committee. In retrospect, I wish I had made that \nchange in committee. I think it probably would have changed the \nSenator's vote. And I think it would have been wise for us. We would \nhave then had a 15 to 3 vote or maybe even a 16 to 2 vote if that was \nthe case. In review of that action, that was one of the compromises or \none of the negotiations that were made.\n  But to say that, you know, we are standing here on the floor \nunwilling to look at reasonable requests for some of the concerns and \nobjections of the Senator from Massachusetts, or from others, I think \nthis undermines that assertion. Mr. President, 33 changes have been \nmade to address the concerns raised by the Senator from Massachusetts \nand from others.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that we do not have to engage in \nanother filibuster effort as we move to the bill itself and open the \nbill up for amendment and consideration. With that vote on Friday, only \nfive votes in favor of proceeding with discussion of the bill, I think \nit would be a disservice to the American people, a disservice to the \nFDA, and to this body for us to engage in additional lengthy \nfilibusters of this where we have to go to another cloture vote.\n  So I hope that as soon as we finish the Labor-Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill, we can move with a definitive timetable \nwhich will allow amendments to be offered, hopefully debated with some \nkind of limitation on the time so we can move and then vote on, and \nthen move forward with this. It makes no sense to continue to delay it.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just talk a little bit about what the bill \nincludes--we talked about why we need it--about what the bill includes.\n  Back in 1990, I authored legislation which would allow some expedited \nprovisions within FDA for review of what is called humanitarian \ndevices. These are devices that affect only a small class of people and \nreally are not in the manufacturer's financial interest to proceed with \nthese devices because there is not a broad enough market for them. But \nyet there are individuals that can benefit from these devices, and it \nmakes no sense to have the same convoluted, time-consuming process, and \nparticularly some of the specifics of what the FDA requires for \napproval of these devices, if the sum total of all of that discourages \nthe manufacturer from going ahead because there is such a limited class \nfor whom these devices\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\nare applicable. Then the only losers in this are the people for whom \nthe devices could have improved their quality of life or perhaps have \nbeen of great benefit to their health.\n  And so in 1990 we enacted some humanitarian device provisions. But \nsince that time, as a result of I think what can only be described as \nbureaucratic delay and inefficiency, since that time only one company \nhas been able to take advantage of this provision. The bill that we \nhave before us expedites certain agency procedures. It allows a waiver \nof prior hospital review committee approval if the patient would suffer \nharm or death while waiting for supervised approval. So if a patient is \nin a position where waiting for approval could result in their death, \nit allows for the provision for a waiver of the agency procedures.\n  In addition, the agency is ordered under this legislation to review \nthe application in 75 days, and that is one of those compromises. We \noriginally had 60 days. The agency thought they needed a little more \ntime. We agreed to allow them to have 75 days. And the agency was no \nlonger allowed to arbitrarily force the manufacturer to seek reapproval \nof the product. In the past legislation the approval was only good for \na limited period of time and then they had to go through the whole \nprocedure again to get reapproval. We are saying once the agency \napproves it, absent evidence to the contrary, that approval sticks.\n  In addition, the humanitarian device provision is made permanent \nwhereas before it had a sunset. Now, perhaps one of the most important \nparts of this legislation is the increased access to expertise, outside \nexpertise, to allow the agency to accomplish its reviews and approval \nprocess in a much more expeditious timeframe.\n  We, in the bill, require the FDA to enter into contracts with \nnongovernmental experts--non-FDA scientists and reviewers--to assist in \nproduct approvals. We are still talking about medical devices here to \nassist in product approvals if the agency determines that doing so \nwould improve the timeliness or the quality of the review.\n  It is important to understand that the agency is going to retain \nfinal approval authority over the review, but for the first time we are \nrequiring them to utilize outside experts, outside resources to help \nthem with that review. They are saying, ``We're overwhelmed. We have \nall these applications. We don't have enough employees to review it. \nAnd that's why we have the delay.'' We are saying, ``There are \norganizations, institutions, agencies outside of the FDA that can help \nprovide these reviews. We are asking you to look to these to provide \nsome assistance. But you, the FDA, have approval authority.'' In other \nwords, it does not automatically go to an outside reviewing group, but \nit can go to a group that the FDA approves of.\n\n  I do not see what the problem is with that. I mean, final authority \nrests within the FDA. But if there is an organization outside the FDA \nthat the FDA can contract with or that the manufacturer can contract \nwith, to expedite it, as long as FDA retains approval authority, then \nwhy not utilize this? It is going to expedite the process.\n  The agency currently has a pilot program in place with which it is \ntesting out this concept. We want to expand that pilot program. We \nwould like to require that 60 percent of the nonexempt 510(k) \nsubmissions be included in the pilot. We also have language in here \nwhich limits the agency's ability to write all the guidance documents \nfor these organizations. Sometimes the writing of the guidance \ndocuments takes months, if not years, and in a sense is unnecessary \nbecause the agency can allow the outside organization to go forward \nwithout that as long as it retains authority.\n  We are concerned about a manufacturer contracting with an outside \nagency just to seek approval. And if the manufacturer were allowed the \ncontract with that outside agency, and they just said, ``OK, we \nreviewed it. Here is the approval. You have to take it,'' there would \nbe legitimate grounds for objection to that. But we have built in total \noversight authority and control into the FDA so that they really are \nnot giving up jurisdiction here, they are just utilizing that outside \nsource to help them do their work. It is not like somebody \nsubcontracting work out if they do not have the capacity to do it \nwithin their factory or within their business.\n  But because public safety and public health is at risk here, we want \nto make sure that FDA retains sufficient authority to oversee all of \nthis. FDA is given the authority in the bill to establish conflict of \ninterest protections because we do not want to get into a situation \nwhere there is a conflict of interest between the manufacturer and the \nreview authority. FDA decides what those protections are. FDA accredits \nthe pool of qualified organizations. In other words, a manufacturer \ncannot go to any organization unless FDA has preapproved that \norganization, that outside agency for review. They have to get FDA's \nstamp of approval, good seal of approval, before they are even eligible \nto do the work to assist FDA.\n  FDA selects from a pool of two or more accredited parties from whom \nthe product sponsor may select. In other words, FDA says these agencies \nare certified to do this work; the company selects one or two or a pool \nof accredited parties, and FDA then makes that selection. FDA has \nauthority to revoke the accreditation if it feels that it is not \nproceeding according to the way they want it to go. It has the ability \nto investigate any kind of conflict of interest and it has final \napproval authority.\n\n  Now, this is important, this final approval authority. At one point, \nI threw up my hands and said the FDA has so much authority why are we \ngoing outside? Are we not just defeating the purpose? But in order to \nget the legislation addressed, we built in all these protections, \nadditional protections, and of course the best protection of all for \nFDA is that it has final approval authority.\n  If it does not like what comes back from the outside agency despite \nall these other steps where it accredits and so forth it can say we do \nnot approve because we do not think the agency did such and such. So it \nhas preapproval authority. It has process approval authority. It has \nfinal approval authority. That is plenty of protection.\n  All of what you hear about how risky it is to American health and so \nforth, some agency which is not part of the Federal Government is \ninvolved in approving a particular product, that is not the case, \nbecause we have built into the legislation approval authority for FDA \nall up and down the line.\n  Title III improves the collaboration and communication between FDA \nand the various drug and device companies. There is a list of items \nthat I will not take time to detail.\n  Title IV clarifies a lot of the rules currently in place and improves \nthe certainty of the process. We address the whole question of policy \nstatements. In recent years, FDA has increasingly developed informal \npolicy statements without involving the public and has failed to make \nthe policies available to the public. In response to a petition from \ncitizens in my State, a group of Indiana manufacturers, the agency \npublished guidance that radically changed these practices. The bill \nrequires the FDA to make this ``Good Guidance Practices\" document \npermanent by promulgating it as a final regulation in 2 years.\n  In the area of labeling claims for medical devices, in the past the \nagency has looked beyond a manufacturers' legitimate labeling claims \nand requires that the company making the product provide extensive data \non a variety of claims for which the company never intended the product \nto address. The product was designed for a specific purpose. The FDA \nsaid we want you to conduct all kinds of trials and provide extensive \ndata for what other things it might be used for, not for what the \ncompany is marketing it for, not for what the company has designed it \nfor, but what it might be used for. That has clearly delayed the \nability to review products and to get them approved.\n  The bill clarifies the relationship of labeling claims to approval \nand clearance of products, and it further limits FDA's review of device \nsubmissions to the intended use of the device set forth in labeling.\n  We tried to build in certainty of review timeframes. I will not go \nthrough the details of that, but that is extensive and brings some \ncertainty to the process.\n  We have placed some limitations on initial classification \ndeterminations.\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\n Recently the agency denied due process of law to manufacturers by \nwithholding a substantial equivalence determination even when the \nproduct was in fact substantially equivalent whenever the manufacturer \nwas determined to have even a technical defect in the GMP inspection. \nThe bill prohibits the FDA from withholding the initial classification \nof a device based on failure to comply with unrelated provisions of the \nact, including good manufacturing practices. The agency is directed to \nuse its ample existing enforcement authority to ensure that products \nthat have the GMP violations at the time of classification do not reach \nthe market.\n  Title V, improving the accountability. It sets an agency plan for \nstatutory compliance in an annual report so we have a better handle on \nwhat is going on within the FDA.\n  Title VI, better allocation of resources by setting priorities. We \nexempt certain classes of devices from premarket notification \nrequirements. This really expands on the administration's reinventing \nGovernment initiative that exempts class I and class II medical devices \nthat pose little risk by exempting all class I devices, the least risk \ndevices, except those that are important in preventing impairment of \nhuman health or presents potential unreasonable risk of illness or \ninjury.\n  We had extensive discussion on this. This is an area where Senator \nHarkin raised what I believe are legitimate concerns and we have tried \nto address those concerns in this legislation.\n  We have evaluation of automatic class III designations. Current law \nrequires that all new devices not substantially equivalent to a device \nalready on the market must be automatically classified in a highest-\nrisk category. This does not make sense. If a very simple device that \nwould otherwise be a class I or class II device is not substantially \nequivalent to a device already on the market, it has to be \nautomatically classified as the riskiest of all devices and therefore \nfalls into class III for the review process, and the approval process, \nwhich takes an extraordinary amount of time and requires \nan extraordinary amount of data, clinical trials and so forth. That is \nnot necessary. So we have changed that so that it does not \nautomatically fall into class III.\n\n  It says ``if it is not substantially equivalent,'' what we have done \nhere is allow the agency to make a determination as to which category \nit would fall in rather than automatically go to class III. So the \nagencies could look at it and say we think this is class I or class II \nand is subject to those review procedures rather than automatically \nmoving into class III. It is a sensible change in the current status of \nhow this is handled.\n  We made changes regarding health care economic information, health \nclaims for food products, and pediatric studies of drugs.\n  Title VII, we have extended, and of course this is the engine that \ndrives the train here, and another reason why it is so necessary to \nmove forward with this legislation. We have reauthorized the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act for 5 years. That is the so-called PDUFA \nlegislation which the prescription drug companies have agreed to \nsupport. It is a tax on those companies for the specific purpose of \nproviding extra funds for FDA to hire personnel to expedite the reviews \nof drugs which are submitted for review and approval to the FDA.\n  It has worked out very, very well in response to an overwhelmed FDA \nwho could not begin to meet their statutory requirements for review of \ndrugs. A proposal was made that we would enact a tax against the \ncompanies submitting the product and the proceeds of that tax will be \nused to hire personnel and establish procedures whereby we could \nexpedite the approval drugs. It was needed. It was supported. It has \nworked. We need to reauthorize it because it expires October 1 this \nyear. That is why it is so important to move forward with this \nlegislation.\n  There are other things in the bill, Mr. President, but in the \ninterests of time I will not detail them unless the President wants me \nto go through them point by point, but I do not think we have the time \nstill allotted. I know the majority leader is anxious to move back to \nthe Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership on this \nissue. It has been a cooperative effort that has reached across the \naisle and involved Members from both parties in a very substantial \nnumber. Hopefully, we can move forward now in getting to the bill \nitself and the amendments and move this very needed legislation \nforward. I will be involved in this. I know there are a number of \ndiscussions coming up with some of these amendments.\n  I appreciate the leadership and support of the Senator from Vermont, \nwho is not testing but actually utilizing a medical device to address \nan unfortunate accident he had just last week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I commend the Senator from Indiana who has been \nextremely helpful on this whole bill in helping us bring it to \nconclusion. He made many offers, very reasonable, and I hope we can \nfind the magic one to bring us to fruition very quickly.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is not an amendment, and I know \nthe managers are not here. It is not really a debate I am trying to \ngenerate here. I thought I would take a little bit of time, while I \nhave the floor, to thank the managers of the bill for their work. \nReally, I think they have done a very, very impressive job, especially \nwhen you consider what they have been able to put into this bill.\n  These amendments that I have introduced have more to do with what is \nnot in the bill, and we will be debating that later. I want to also \nthank the managers of the bill for including an important item in this \nappropriations measure. This bill, on the Senate side, it is my \nunderstanding, includes the full amount requested by the President for \nthe budget of the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration.\n  As the ranking member of the Labor Committee's Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Training, I am very interested in this whole area of \noccupational health and safety. But, today, what I want to do is talk \nabout one aspect of this policy, and that is the sampling of coal mine \ndust and its relation to black lung disease. Madam President, this is \nof particular interest to me because of a recent trip that I took to \neastern Kentucky. I met with a number of coal miners, and I do think \nthat their story deserves to be told. It is a story that I intend to \nfollow, hopefully, as we in the Congress take further steps to make \nsure that the Federal Government lives up to its responsibility \nregarding miners' health and safety.\n  Mining has been really one of the most dangerous professions, and the \nFederal Government has done much to correct or address some of its \nhazards. But what I want to focus on is the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration and a request for new staff and money--which we have on \nthe Senate side, it is my understanding--to increase the Federal \nGovernment's sampling for respirable coal mine dust. The request is \nmodest, but it is significant; it calls for 24 new full-time employees \nand $1.7 million.\n  Madam President, though it is a small amount of money, I think it is \nvery important that we keep this in conference. Last year, there was an \nadvisory committee appointed by the Secretary of Labor, which \nrecommended that a key step that the Federal Government could take \ntoward eliminating black lung disease would be to increase the \nresponsibilities of the Mine Safety and Health Administration for coal \nmine dust compliance sampling. Simply speaking, that is a measurement \nof coal mine dust levels to determine whether or not they are a threat \nto the miners' health.\n  Madam President, the problem is that the majority of the dust \nsampling is done by the mineowners themselves--that is to say the coal \ncompanies. When I was in east Kentucky last week, what I heard over and \nover again were really miners describing conditions that I think many \nSenators would feel like they were in a time warp and they were really \nliving 50 years ago. We are talking about too many miners who work in \ncrawl spaces about this high for 12 or 14 hours a day and can't see 6 \ninches in front of them because of the dust level. So the problem is, \nwhen you depend upon the companies to actually do the measurements of \nthe dust levels, there is a pretty obvious conflict of interest. As a \nSenator, I am not naive to these conditions. Most of my work has been \nin communities around the country, starting in Minnesota, with hard-\npressed people.\n  I met a woman--to expand this discussion--whose husband had begged \nthe company over and over again to please give him some relief from his \nparticular work situation. He was afraid he was going to be \nelectrocuted. Basically, the position of the company was: Look, if you \ndon't like the job, leave. When there aren't a lot of $20-an-hour jobs, \npeople don't have much of a choice. She spoke. She was 27 years of age. \nHer husband was electrocuted. He lost his life.\n  I met other miners suffering from black lung. I met one woman, and \nshe is the only woman who is a deep mine miner. I said, ``Aren't you \nafraid * * *''--the common complaint is that most of the mines are \nnonunion, and if people complain, they lose their jobs. I said, \n``Aren't you afraid * * *''--since there were TV cameras in Hazard, \nKY--I said, ``Aren't you afraid that you are going to lose your job?''\n  She said, ``I don't think I will because I am the only woman miner. I \ndon't think they will let me go. I feel like I am speaking for a lot of \nother miners that aren't here.''\n  I said to her and to the other 12 or 14 miners sitting around \ntalking, ``Look, I have to ask you this question. Can you tell me very \nhonestly and truthfully, if all of your friends and coworkers could be \nhere, without fear of losing their jobs, would they be saying the same \nthing, or are you exaggerating in any kind of way?''\n  All of them, starting with this woman miner said, ``They would say \nthe same thing to you, except that people are afraid they may lose \ntheir jobs.''\n  I will tell you, it was a very, very powerful meeting. So this is a \nsmall step here to make sure there is some additional money for at \nleast some\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\ncompliance of the dust sampling. But it is terribly important.\n  Let me read from the testimony of Earl Shackleford, Jr., from Wallins \nCreek in Harlan County, KY. He was 36 years old last year. This was \npresented last year to the Secretary of Labor's advisory committee on \nthe elimination of black lung disease. He had been working as a miner \n17 years, though he is only 36. His testimony indicates that he, his \nfather, his grandfather, and other friends and relatives all suffer \nfrom black lung disease. Someone from my wife Sheila's family from \nCumberland in Harlan County, KY, also suffered from black lung disease. \nI will read four sentences from the conclusion of Mr. Shackleford's \ntestimony:\n\n       There is nothing more terrible to me than watching a fellow \n     coal miner smother to death, one slow gasp at a time. There \n     is nothing anybody can do for a dying miner but pray for him. \n     But we can do something for the miners who labor in the mines \n     today. We can make sure that the coal dust they breathe is \n     accurately monitored by a Government that cares about their \n     health and safety.\n\n  Madam President, this bill takes a step toward better Federal \nmonitoring of coal mine dust sampling. I hope we can keep this \nadditional funding in the conference committee. At the same time, I \npoint out that I agree with the recommendation of the Secretary's \nadvisory committee on the elimination of black lung disease, which is \nthat the Federal Government should take more responsibility in this \narea--perhaps full responsibility--of dust sampling.\n  I am going to be working with other colleagues. Eventually, I want to \ncome to the floor and push very hard on this. The story of these \nKentucky coal miners cannot be ignored. I had a chance to talk to \nSenator Ford, who has cared about these issues and about what the \nminers are facing. The testimony of Earl Shackleford, Jr., and others, \ncannot be ignored.\n  I would like to thank the managers again of this bill for putting \nmoney in here for at least some compliance work. I hope we can keep \nthat in conference committee.\n  I want to say to colleagues that one of the best things about getting \na chance to travel sometimes outside of your State--not necessarily to \nanother country, but in other communities --and for me, focusing on \npoverty in the country has been a tremendous education and very \nimportant. I met a lot of people who should be famous, a lot of strong \npeople who, under incredibly difficult conditions, can still manage to \nsurvive and not only survive but flourish. But of all the meetings I \nhave been to and of all the things I have seen--and I have seen a lot \nof children and a lot of pain, and I have seen a lot of housing that \nnobody should ever have to live in, and I have seen schools that are \njust as dilapidated as the schools that we talk about, where you can \nwalk in the hallway and you can smell the stench of urine, and you can \ngo into the bathrooms where the toilets don't even work, I have seen \nall that and more than I want to see. But this meeting with these coal \nminers in eastern Kentucky was jolting.\n  I asked one of the journalists that was there, off the record, to \ntell me whether or not she thought they were exaggerating. She said, \n``Absolutely not.'' My guess is that in some of the investigative work \nthat I hope will be done by journalists, we are going to see more \nreports of these conditions. We are talking about conditions that these \ncoal miners are working under that we thought existed 50 years ago--\npeople not able to see 6 inches in front of them because of the dust \nlevels, which not only means people are gone to go suffer from and die \nfrom black lung, it also means, it is my understanding, that when you \nhave that high concentration of dust levels, you have the ingredients \nfor all kinds of possibilities of explosions within the mine. And then \nsomebody will talk about a mine accident as if it were impersonal and \nrandom and never should have happened.\n  We have a huge problem here because the coal mine operators, the \ncompanies, are actually the ones doing the measurement of the dust \nlevels. I don't see how we can really get an independent and accurate \nmeasurement of the dust levels and how that affects these miners, \nunless we do much better by way of expanding the responsibility or at \nleast the resources for the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration. I am sure other people in the Senate would say \nthe same thing. But it is very difficult to meet with people and have a \ncouple of people talk about loved ones who were killed in the mines. I \nstill cannot remember. She is 27 years old. Her husband was 28 years \nold when he was electrocuted. I have met a lot of the older miners who \nwere suffering with black lung. For reasons I don't actually understand \nthe actual motive for being turned down when they applied for \ndisability, which is something I want to know more about.\n\n  But at the very least, I think we have to make sure that somehow the \nclock has not been turned back 50 years. People ought not to have to \nwork under conditions which are uncivilized. People have every right in \nour country to be able to focus on how they earn a decent living and \nhow they have a job that pays a decent wage under civilized working \nconditions. The miners in eastern Kentucky, or some of the miners and \nthe miners that I met with, should not be in a situation where if they \nshould speak up about this, they lose their jobs. The choice for them \nis whether you do and, if you work, you work under these uncivilized \nconditions and it is going to take years off your life, possibly kill \nyou, or you don't work and you lose your job.\n  I know that some of these issues are just like off the radar screen \nhere in the Senate. But I think really this should be part of our \nfocus.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like it known I also have one \nother amendment that I want to have considered by the Senate on this \nlegislation. I will wait before proposing that amendment, but make it \nclear I do have another one.\n  Madam President, I also intend to ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment. I understand there is still some uncertainty as to when a \nvote will be held on this particular amendment.\n  Madam President, I rise, with my colleague, Senator Phil Gramm, to \noffer an amendment that would eliminate the financing incentives \ncreated in the Balanced Budget Act for teaching hospitals to reduce \ntheir medical residency programs. This new program will make teaching \nhospitals eligible for hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars for \nnot training medical students. Let me repeat that, Madam President. \nUnder the Balanced Budget Act, which we voted on before we went into \nthe August recess, a program was created that would make teaching \nhospitals eligible for hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars for \nnot training medical students--not for training medical students, but \nfor not training medical students. In short, the Federal Government \nwill pay hospitals for doing nothing.\n  Unbeknownst to most of my colleagues when we considered and voted for \nthe Balanced Budget Act, that legislation created yet another wasteful, \nunnecessary, and inappropriate Federal subsidy program. This newly \ncreated subsidy is no different from the wasteful agricultural subsidy \nprograms which pay farmers millions of dollars not to grow certain \ncrops or to reduce their production of a certain crop. This is wasteful \nand a blatant misuse of taxpayers' funds.\n  Proponents of the new incentive program argue that there is an \noverabundance of medical doctors, particularly specialists, in this \ncountry. They believe that providing financial incentives to hospitals \nto reduce the number of medical students is a solution to the supposed \nglut of physicians in our country. Madam President, it springs to my \nmind that there is an argument that is being made by a lot of us today \nwho are not members of the legal profession that the same problem \nexists in that the country has too many lawyers. I wonder if in the \nnext Balanced Budget Act agreement, we are going to pay hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to law schools, because we have an overabundance, \nnot to teach lawyers. I might say, Madam President, as a personal \npreference I might lean toward that program more than the one that we \nhave just enacted in the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Let me also just point out here, the Berlin wall fell. Socialism, \nthat is communism, is a failure. It is only in Communist countries \nwhere they pay people not to do things. This might have been a great \nidea in North Korea, Cuba, or perhaps some other countries in the \nworld, but certainly not in the United States of America should we be \npaying hundreds of millions of dollars so that we will not train \nanybody, much less not train doctors. As I will point out later on in \nmy remarks, Madam President, there are 46 million Americans who do not \nhave access to medical care. Yet we are going to spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in order that teaching hospitals will not teach--\nwill not teach.\n  It is not the role of the Federal Government to determine if we have \nan appropriate amount of physicians or any other professionals in this \ncountry. This subsidy is a misguided attempt by the Federal Government \nto restrict the career choices available to individual Americans. This \nprogram places the Federal Government in control of a specific labor \nsegment in our country and allows the Government to directly restrict \nthe freedom of choice of our citizens who may want to become \nphysicians.\n  I have children. Most of the Members of this body have children. If \none of my children decides he or she wants to be a physician, should \nthat child be restricted from doing so if otherwise eligible to train \nas a physician? In a democracy, the Government does not determine the \nmakeup of the labor force or regulate the supply of workers in a \nspecific field. That was done in the former Soviet Union. Demand, not \nthe Government, in a market-driven economy, drives the number of \npracticing physicians. As the need for doctors increases or decreases, \nmedical schools and teaching hospitals must determine how many \napplicants to accept and if there is a need for expanding or reduction.\n  Government rationing of medical training and ultimately rationing of \nhealth care smacks of socialism not democracy.\n  Second, Federal subsidies don't work. They cost money and usually \ndon't achieve their stated goals. Every time we have ignored market-\nbased solutions to our Nation's health care problems and called for \nGovernment intervention, we have had paradoxical results. In the \n1960's, the Government predicted an undersupply of doctors and created \nincentives for individuals to pursue a medical career. The result was a \nperceived glut of medical doctors by the late 1970's.\n  Third, this new subsidy program totally ignores the needs of 46 \nmillion Americans residing in rural communities and inner-city \nneighborhoods who are faced with a shortage of physicians and health \ncare professionals. While proponents of this initiative argue that our \ncountry is producing more physicians than we need, many communities \nhave no resident physicians and have only limited access to trained \nmedical care.\n  I am seriously concerned about the disproportionate number of \nphysicians who elect to practice only in urban settings, leaving rural \nand inner-city neighborhoods underserved and without access to critical \nmedical services.\n  A better use of taxpayer dollars might be to strengthen existing \nprograms already in place to increase access to health care providers \nand services in underserved areas. This includes the National Health \nService Corps, Area Health Education Centers, Interdisciplinary \nTraining for Health Care in Rural Areas, Community Health Centers, \nMigrant Health Centers, and the Health Professions Workforce \nDevelopment Program. Those are all good programs. I have seen the \ncommunity health centers in my own State serve people who otherwise \nwould not receive health care. I repeat, 46 million Americans are \nunderserved or not served at all in light of their medical needs.\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\n  Finally, this subsidy will be financed using the Medicare part A \ntrust fund. As we all know, without significant reform to the Medicare \nsystem, this trust fund is expected to become insolvent. Using scarce \nMedicare resources to finance another Government subsidy program is \nunwise in the near term and unnecessary in the long term if market \nforces are permitted to determine the need for doctors in this country.\n  There is also going to be an argument raised that this would somehow \nupset the delicate agreement that was made in the Balanced Budget \nAgreement Act; that somehow this was an ironclad commitment that we \nwould agree to every single aspect of the balanced budget agreement. I \nwant to state right here, what a lot of us did was hold our nose and \nvote for it. A lot of people didn't vote for it, but a lot of us held \nour nose because we didn't like a lot of things associated with it. And \nto say that we should subsidize a program that is pure socialism in the \nname of preserving the balanced budget agreement, I think, borders on \ninsanity. But yet, strangely enough, Madam President, you will see \nSenators come to this floor and say that if we vote not to subsidize \nthrough hundreds of millions of dollars teaching hospitals not to \nteach, then somehow it will upset the balanced budget agreement. I find \nthat argument absurd, and we will hear it.\n  I understand that there was a request by others to speak against this \namendment. I also am not clear as to whether the votes will be held \nthis afternoon or later.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending McCain amendment so \nthat I may present another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1092\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that payments to certain persons captured and \n  interned by North Vietnam are not considered income or resources in \ndetermining eligibility for, or the amount of benefits under, a program \n    or State plan under title XVI or XIX of the Social Security Act)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 1092.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 49, after line 26, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the payments described in subsection (b) shall not be \n     considered income or resources in determining eligibility \n     for, or the amount of benefits under, a program or State plan \n     under title XVI or XIX of the Social Security Act.\n       (b) The payments described in this subsection are payments \n     made by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section 657 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 \n     (Public Law 104-201; 110 Stat. 2584).\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is basically to correct a \ntechnical problem that exists. It is to pay the Vietnamese commandos \nthat we authorized by legislation last year. They are a group of \nVietnamese soldiers who were recruited and trained by the United States \nto promote our cause during the Vietnam war. Unfortunately, they were \ncaptured soon after their deployment and imprisoned for 20 years for \nfighting on our side.\n  Last year, we passed legislation authorizing payment to the commandos \nfor their sacrifice, $2,000 a year for the 20 years they were detained, \nfor a total of $40,000 each. However, this payment, if interpreted as 1 \nyear's income will disqualify the commandos from Medicaid and other \nbenefits they currently receive, because it ostensibly raises their \nincome beyond the cutoff point for benefits.\n  This is a payment accrued to the commandos over the 20-year period \nduring which they were detained. As such, it represents not 1 year's \nincome but an annual payment of $2,000 over 20 years and should not, \ntherefore, disqualify them from Medicaid and SSI.\n  Mr. President, we have now placed the commandos in the awkward \nposition of being forced into accepting the funds we rightly owe them \nor maintaining their eligibility for needed benefits. This amendment, \nby myself and Senator Kerry, simply states the $40,000 payment to each \ncommando will not disqualify him from the various welfare benefits he \ncurrently receives. This measure has no cost and merely ensures the \ncommandos don't lose the benefits they already receive.\n  We are in debt to these men for their wartime sacrifices, and we \ncannot compensate them with one hand while we take away their benefits \nwith the other.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this measure to make sure \nthe commandos are not unjustly penalized for accepting the accumulated \npayment our country rightly owes them. I hope this will be a routine \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last year Congress enacted legislation that \nI sponsored with Senator McCain to provide payment to some 450 \nVietnamese commandos who were captured by North Vietnamese forces while \nperforming covert operations for the United States behind enemy lines \nand subsequently incarcerated in North Vietnamese prisons for 20 years \nor more. Under this legislation, each of the commandos would receive a \nlump sum payment of $40,000--payment their families did not receive \nduring their years of incarceration because the Pentagon wrote them off \nthe employment rolls by declaring them dead.\n  Presently about 200 of the commandos reside in the United States. \nMost are either U.S. citizens or resident aliens applying for \ncitizenship. Many of them receive Medicaid and related benefits. The \nproblem is that receipt of the long overdue lump sum payment will \ndisqualify them from Medicaid and other benefits they currently receive \nbecause it raises their income above the cutoff point for benefits.\n  Let me give you an example. Last year, I met with a group of \ncommandos including Ly Pho, who lives in my home State of \nMassachusetts. Ly and his colleagues wanted to express their thanks for \nour efforts to provide them compensation. Shortly after the meeting, \nwhich was widely reported in the press in Massachusetts, Ly was \nnotified by his social service case worker that his Medicaid assistance \nwould be terminated once he received the compensation.\n  Inadvertently, we have placed the commandos in an untenable position \nwhich forces them to choose between the funds we rightly owe them for \ntheir services and loyalty to our cause during the war and the benefits \nthey now receive. The amendment Senator McCain and I are offering today \nis designed to eliminate this Hobson's choice by making it clear that \nthe payment each commando receives will not disqualify him from \nreceiving these benefits.\n  I believe that this amendment is necessary and fair. These men made \ngreat sacrifices for the United States. They were incarcerated for \nyears and many of them were tortured during their incarceration. We are \nin their debt. We cannot give them compensation with one hand and take \naway the life sustaining health benefits that they need with another.\n  This is an important amendment with no additional financial burden to \nthe U.S. Government. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I not lose the \nfloor in the process of yielding to my friend from Idaho. Prior to \ndoing that, I ask unanimous consent that I be listed as a cosponsor on \nthe last amendment offered by my friend from Arizona, and I will also \nsay that the statement he just made regarding the doctor issue is \nsomething we need to talk about and discuss. I think it is a very \nimportant amendment and needs to be discussed in some detail rather \nthan just let go through as it is now on the legislation before us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, it has been made clear that \nthere will be a significant amount of debate on this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I am not opposed to it. It is just an \nissue we should talk about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the request of becoming a cosponsor, \nwithout objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\n  Without objection, the request of the Senator from Nevada regarding \nyielding to the Senator from Idaho is agreed to. The Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for \nyielding. May I inquire of the Chair, has the last McCain amendment \nbeen set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Section 13(b)(12) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 213(b)(12)) is amended by inserting after \n     ``water'' the following: ``, at least 90 percent of which is \n     ultimately delivered''.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator Bingaman. I am offering an amendment to S. 1061 that would \nmake a very narrow change in the Fair Labor Standards Act. This is a \nsmall amendment, but it is critically important to irrigators in Idaho \nand across the West.\n  My amendment would solve a problem with the interpretation of a \nprovision of the Fair Labor Standards Act clarifying that the maximum \nhour exemption for agricultural employees apply to water delivery \norganizations that supply 90 percent or more of their water for \nagricultural purposes.\n  My colleague, Congressman Mike Crapo, has introduced a like measure \nin the House. This is an issue we struggled with for some time, Mr. \nPresident. What we are simply saying is that nonprofit co-ops that \ndeliver water are exempt. We have always done it. We have done it for \nother provisions under the fair labor standards. But if that irrigation \nditch happens to cross a pasture and cattle drink out of it and there \nis some other measure or use other than irrigation that falls under \nfair labor standards, we are saying OK, but a narrow window. Ninety \npercent has to be for that purpose, the other 10 percent might \naccidentally be used for those purposes and might not fall under the \nqualifications. The intent of the amendment, I think, clarifies, and \ncertainly irrigators across the West working with other organizations \nhad hoped we could resolve this issue. It has been some time in the \nmaking.\n  Representative Mike Crapo of Idaho and I previously have introduced a \nsimilar provision as a bill--S. 259 in the Senate and H.R. 526 in the \nother body. Our amendment would restore the flexibility that was always \nintended by Congress.\n  Nonprofit organizations, such as independent water districts or \nnonprofit corporations, which deliver water for agricultural purposes, \nare exempt from the maximum-hour requirements of the FLSA. The \nDepartment of Labor has interpreted this to mean that no amount of this \nwater, however minimal, can be used for other purposes. Therefore, if \neven a small portion of the water delivered winds up being used for \nroad watering, lawn and garden irrigation, livestock consumption, or \nconstruction, for example, delivery organizations are assessed severe \npenalties.\n  Such uses may be closely related, but technically not interpreted as \nbeing, ``agricultural purposes.''\n  The exemption for overtime pay requirements was placed in the FLSA to \nprotect the economies of rural areas. Irrigation has never been, and \ncannot be, a 40-hour-per-week undertaking. During the summer, water \nmust be managed and delivered continually. Later in the year following \nthe harvest, the work load is light, consisting mainly of maintenance \nduties.\n  This adjustment would be better for employers, workers, and farmers. \nIt would reflect more accurately the realities of agricultural water \ndelivery.\n  Winter compensation and time off traditionally have been the method \nof compensating for longer summer hours. Without this exemption, \nirrigators are forced to lay off their employees in the winter. \nTherefore, this amendment would benefit employees, who would continue \nto earn a year-round income. It also would keep costs level, which \nwould benefit suppliers and consumers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this modest amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set \naside, and I yield the floor to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1094\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the conduct of a study concerning the health \n           and safety effects of perchlorate on human beings)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on my behalf \nand Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mrs. \n     Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 1094.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 49, after line 26, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Study.--From amounts appropriated under this \n     title, the National Institutes of Health shall conduct a \n     study on the health effects of perchlorate on humans with \n     particular emphasis on the health risks to vulnerable \n     subpopulations including pregnant women, children, and the \n     elderly.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 9 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the National \n     Institutes of Health shall prepare and submit to the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, a report \n     concerning the results of the study conducted under \n     subsection (a), including whether further health effects \n     research is necessary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered on my \nbehalf and that of the Senator from California deals with a serious \nproblem. The city of Henderson, NV, where I went to high school, has \nbeen in existence since the Second World War. Henderson, NV, was \ndeveloped as a result of the war effort during World War II. It is \nNevada's only industrial city.\n  At one time, that was the whole city. Everything in that town \nsupplied a job related to what we called the basic magnesium complex, \nBMI. So for more than 50 years, Henderson has been supplying products \nfor our war effort--the Second World War, Korea, Vietnam, the cold war.\n  During the cold war, the biggest use of products out of the complex, \nat least one part of the complex, was providing the fuel to send \nspaceships into the air, a product called ammonium perchlorate.\n  We, it is said, take our water for granted, especially the water we \ndrink. Those of us in the western part of the United States are very \nconcerned about water, as we should be, because we have so little of \nit. Just in the last 30 days, there are people in California and Nevada \nwho are concerned about the safety of the water. We have been told that \nthe water in Lake Mead is safe, and I am hopeful and confident that it \nis. But as people in this body know, water is an enormous issue for \nthose of us from the West. The scarcity of water and its availability \nrequires us to be extremely careful in how we apportion and use this \nmost basic natural resource.\n  In the Las Vegas area, for example, Mr. President, the annual \nrainfall is less than 4 inches a year. We get very, very little water \nin the Las Vegas area. Henderson is a suburb of Las Vegas. Because of \nthis, we do everything we can to make sure that the water is protected. \nThis is no easy task. The problem that we address in this amendment \ndeals with something called ammonium perchlorate. It is an interstate \nproblem. It involves not only the State of Nevada, but also the States \nof California and Arizona. Why? Because we share water out of the \nColorado River and the lakes that are up and down the Colorado River.\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\n  Over the August recess, it was reported that perchlorate was turning \nup in certain samples they were doing of the water at Lake Mead, \nsouthern Nevada's primary drinking water source. Perchlorate is also \nbeing detected, at really low levels, in Los Angeles, in the water they \nthink they get from the Colorado River. It has been detected in \nCalifornia in over 70 drinking water wells throughout that State.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, perchlorate is a common ingredient in \nthe manufacture of rocket fuel--especially rocket fuel--munitions, and \nfireworks. Forms of perchlorate are ammonium perchlorate, which we \nmanufacture in southern Nevada, potassium perchlorate, sodium \nperchlorate, and perchloric acid. Currently, the only treatment for \nthat is reverse osmosis and ion exchange.\n  Mr. President, perchlorate is not a compound that is regulated under \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. Why? Because all the tests in previous \nyears showed that there was no reason to be concerned. There are some \nscientists who say that it could be dangerous to pregnant women and to \nchildren. We do not know. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  We want to make sure that in the State of California and the States \nof Nevada and Arizona the water is safe. The only State that has set a \nlimit as to how much perchlorate is allowed to be in the water is \nCalifornia. They set a limit. We want to make sure we comply with that \nlimit, as does everyone in Arizona and California.\n  In the 70 wells that they have tested in California where they found \nperchlorate, about 18 of those wells exceeded the level that they had \nset. But the question is, what does that really mean? That is the \npurpose of this amendment. We have asked the National Institutes of \nHealth to run some studies during the next 9 months and report back to \nus to determine whether or not perchlorate in drinking water is unsafe \nfor children and pregnant women. Perchlorate is not listed as a RCRA or \nSuperfund hazardous substance.\n  We are in relatively new ground at this time, Mr. President. As I \nindicated, the primary health concern related to perchlorate is it can \ninterfere with the thyroid gland's ability to use iodine to produce \ncertain hormones. In a hormone-deficient condition, normal metabolism, \ngrowth and development can be affected. We don't know that perchlorate \ndoes that, but we need to find out.\n  In very high doses, perchlorate has been used as a medicine to treat \na thyroid disease called Graves' disease in which excessive amounts of \na thyroid hormone are produced. However, in thousands of parts per \nbillion, it can disrupt growth and bodily functions because of its \neffect on the thyroid gland, some people think. As I have indicated, \nthose people who are particularly vulnerable to unsafe consumption \nwould include pregnant women, children, and sometimes the elderly.\n  The problem, however, is there is no hard science on the health and \nsafety risks that perchlorate may pose to human beings. We need to \nbetter understand the potential health consequences of this compound on \nhuman beings.\n  The amendment that I have offered on my behalf and that of the \nSenator from California I believe should be accepted by this body. All \nof us can appreciate the necessity of ensuring that the water that we \nconsume is safe. We have been assured by the head of the Southern \nNevada Water Authority, Pat Mulroy, that the water is safe. I am \nconfident and very, very hopeful that it is. But we need to make sure \nthat that is the case.\n  I support this research and am pushing for its inclusion in this \nlegislation. I also believe that because it has been detected in wells \nin the West, we need to understand why it is there. In particular, we \nneed to understand the potential health risks. Nevada has a large \npopulation with elderly, children, pregnant women, as does certainly \nCalifornia and Arizona.\n\n  So we want this body to accept this. We think it is sound \nlegislation. We have been in contact with the National Institutes of \nHealth. They can do this. I ask my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Prior to offering an amendment, I ask unanimous consent to yield the \nfloor to my colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, and have the \nopportunity to reclaim the floor and present my amendment, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague for yielding, and ask unanimous \nconsent to lay aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1095\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amounts made available to promote adoption \nopportunities in order to eliminate barriers and to help find permanent \n                          homes for children)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment to the \nLabor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill for myself and \nSenator McCain. I have here a copy of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 1095.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 44, line 2, strike ``$5,606,094,000'' and insert \n     ``5,611,094,000''.\n       On page 85, line 19, strike ``$70,500,000'' and insert \n     ``75,500,000''.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. As the \nMembers of the Senate are aware, nearly one-half million children in \nthis country languish in foster care instead of permanent placement. We \nhave had little success in coping with the problem. While the numbers \nof children in foster care multiply, children trickle into adoptive \nhomes. Last year only a little over 20,000 children were formally \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, these numbers are unacceptable. Recent advances in \nscience and psychology have indicated that early childhood is the \ncritical stage for human development. The nurturing and attention that \ninfants need can only be provided by a loving family. Studies have \nindicated that the holding, touching, and play that good parents take \nfor granted, actually affects a child's brain size and activity. Sadly, \nthe children most in need of this kind of human warmth, our abused and \nneglected children, are ill-served by our Nation's adoption placement \nsystem.\n  Equally distressing is the fact that these same problems in the \nadoption system are reflected in our budget priorities. In the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill we propose to spend over \n$4.3 billion on support to foster care. At the same time, we are \ndevoting only $13 million to encourage innovation in state adoption \nsystems. This is a little more than one-third of 1 percent of all the \nmoney we are devoting to foster care.\n  Our spending priorities are another stark example of our spending \nbillions of dollars in a way that perpetuates a problem instead of \nresolving it. We need to reprioritize how we address the thousands of \nchildren in foster care. This amendment takes a modest step in the \nright direction. By reallocating $5 million from the administrative \ncosts of the bill to help fund State initiatives in adoption, we can \nbegin the process of addressing the source of the problem rather than \nits symptoms.\n  Presently, the Children's Bureau has 40 grants to States that were \neither approved but unfunded, or underfunded due to shortfalls. Among \nthe States with unfunded grant applications are Arizona, Arkansas, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, \nOklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, \nand the District of Columbia. These grants would affect States large \nand small and in every region of the country.\n  It is my hope that the programs that we fund by providing State grant \nsupport may one day provide a national\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\nmodel. Only through innovations like those funded by these grants can \nwe hope to resolve the foster care crisis. I hope you will join me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  I thank my colleague again for the time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be \ntemporarily set aside for its determination at the appropriate time for \na vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1094\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my friend from Rhode Island has the \nfloor. I ask that he yield to me for purposes of requesting the yeas \nand nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection for there being an order \nat this time to the ordering of the yeas and nays?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 56, line 19, strike ``and 3'' and insert ``, 3 and \n     4''.\n       On page 56, line 22, before the period insert ``, provided \n     that, $35,000,000 shall be available for State Student \n     Incentive grants derived from unobligated balances''.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment \nwith my Republican colleague from Maine on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, Senator Susan Collins, and we are joined by a host \nof other colleagues--Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee, Senator Smith of \nOregon, Senator Harkin, Senator Dodd, Senator Conrad, Senator Levin, \nSenator Kohl, Senator Wyden, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Murray, \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Bingaman, Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Dorgan, Senator Torricelli, Senator Kerrey, Senator \nJohnson, and Senator Landrieu. I believe this indicates the widespread \ndepth of concern and support for maintenance of the State Student \nIncentive Grant Program, or SSIG, as it is known.\n  This is a remarkable program, which requires State governments to \nmatch Federal resources on a dollar-for-dollar basis and provides \ndirect higher education grant assistance to needy students. I had \noriginally intended to offer, along with my colleague Senator Collins, \nan amendment which would have restored SSIG funding to last year's \nlevel of $50 million, but out of deference to the subcommittee chairman \nand also because of a lack of sufficient offset, the amendment today \nadds back $35 million for SSIG with an offset of unobligated balances \nfrom prior years.\n  In accepting this change, it is our intent to work with Chairman \nSpecter and Senator Harkin, as they have agreed, to ensure that funding \nfor SSIG, at no less than $35 million and hopefully even more, is \nsecured during conference deliberations with the other body.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell all of my colleagues why this amendment \nand saving student aid funding is so vitally important.\n  SSIG is critical to higher education, critical to the dreams of more \nthan 700,000 students across the Nation and 13,000 students just in my \nhome State of Rhode Island alone.\n  We are all familiar with another higher education grant, the Pell \ngrant, and, as I think many in this Chamber, as well as students, \nparents, and those involved in higher education know, the purchasing \npower of the Pell grant has fallen drastically in comparison to \ninflation and the skyrocketing cost of college education. Students have \nsearched for other sources of need-based higher education grants and \nhave come to rely upon SSIG, the State Student Incentive Grant.\n  With a relatively modest amount of Federal funding, this essential \nprogram encourages States to provide need-based financial aid to \nstudents in the form of grants and community service work study awards.\n  SSIG grants are targeted to the neediest undergraduate and graduate \nstudents. The average family income for SSIG recipients in 1991-92 was \napproximately $12,000, which is below the Federal poverty level for a \nfamily of four. The average SSIG-supported grant was about $1,200 in \n1995-96. This program reaches those families who are most desperately \nin need of support to send their children to college.\n  Moreover, this program is extremely efficient. Every SSIG dollar goes \nto the students. These funds are not used in any way to cover \nadministrative costs.\n  With an SSIG expenditure at the Federal level of $63 million in \nfiscal year 1996, the program leveraged more than $784 million in State \nmatching funds and served more than 700,000 students across America. In \nRhode Island, an SSIG Federal expenditure of roughly $334,000 leveraged \nover $8 million in Rhode Island expenditures, serving more than 13,000 \nstudents.\n  The history of this program is simple. Before its enactment 25 years \nago, only 26 States provided need-based assistance to students. Now, \nall 50 States provide such assistance.\n  While SSIG has been successful in increasing State aid, it is not \ntrue that it has outlived its usefulness. The statutory purpose of SSIG \nis not simply to start up State programs. Instead, its purpose is to \nencourage and assist States in making need-based grant and community \nservice work-study awards to students.\n  Indeed, if SSIG is eliminated, nine States, including Alabama, \nArizona, Georgia, and Mississippi, could lose their entire grant \nprogram. In these States, SSIG funds represent 25 percent or more of \ntheir entire student grant program. It is unlikely they would sustain \nthese programs without this Federal assistance and encouragement. In \naddition, if SSIG were eliminated, 43 States have already said they \nwould reduce the number and amount of need-based grants, according to \nthe National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs. \nThirteen States could face a 40-percent drop in funding for need-based \ngrants, according to PIRG's Higher Education Project.\n  Even with Federal funding, my home State of Rhode Island failed to \nmaintain funding for the State grant program in 1993 and lost Federal \nSSIG funding. So Rhode Island, a State known for its commitment to \neducation, also faces serious harm to its need-based program.\n  How could SSIG have outlived its usefulness if States have already or \nare threatening to shut down student grant programs and cut student \naid?\n  Even the Appropriations Committee has noted that there is wisdom in \nmaintaining funding for this program. In this Congress, the Senate will \nwork on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which covers \nmost higher education grants and loan programs including Pell grants \nand SSIG. During this reauthorization process, the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, on which I serve, along with Senator \nCollins, will comprehensively review all higher education aid programs. \nPrior to the Labor Committee's work, I believe it would be \ninappropriate and unfair for Congress to eliminate a successful program \nlike SSIG. It is a program that\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\ndeserves support, but also deserves review, which it will receive in \nthe reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  It is also interesting to note that at a time when the majority party \nin this Congress is calling for more Federal money to be returned to \nthe States, eliminating SSIG would end a successful program that gives \nStates substantial flexibility and resources to help them help their \ncitizens on to a better life.\n  In addition, it is important to note in the recent budget, we have \ngone a long way in providing tax incentives to send young people to \ncollege, tax credits and deductions from taxes, but the people that are \nserved by SSIG are those that cannot readily use the tax system to help \ntheir children go to college. In this way, SSIG is vitally important \nbecause it is a grant program directly to those low-income Americans \nthat need a chance to share in the same opportunity that we have, in \nour wisdom, provided through the tax system to upper-income and middle-\nincome Americans.\n  Now, let me emphasize that SSIG is more important than ever as \ncollege costs continue to grow faster than income and grant aid, and as \nthe grant-loan imbalance widens. In 1975, 80 percent of student aid \ncame in the form of grants and 20 percent in the form of loans. Now, \nthe opposite is true.\n  Let me also add that low-income students are finding it particularly \nhard to afford higher education. Less than 50 percent of high school \ngraduates with family incomes under $22,000 go on to college, while \nmore than 80 percent of their higher income counterparts go on to \npursue education beyond high school. Frankly, if we do not reverse this \ntrend, if we do not let every segment of our society go on to higher \neducation, we will continue to develop a bifurcation of our society and \nour economy as young people with a chance to go on to college gain \nskills that make them employable and, indeed, enhances their incomes \nand ability to seize all the opportunity in our society, while others \nare left out. We cannot let that happen.\n\n  SSIG continues to make a difference for needy students in many \nStates. However, I again remind my colleagues that nine States would \nlikely end their grant programs without Federal encouragement and \nfunding. Moreover, 43 States have said they would cut grants if SSIG \nwere eliminated.\n  Mr. President, we should be helping all our citizens achieve the \nAmerican dream by ensuring access to higher education, especially for \nhard-working families whose wages have not kept up with inflation.\n  Our amendment seeks to provide $35 million for SSIG. It is not a lot \nof money in a bill that contains more than $269 billion in funding, but \nit will make a huge difference to the students who rely upon it.\n  This amendment, I understand, is agreeable to the chairman and the \nranking member and they have committed to work with Senator Collins and \nmyself to fight for this funding in conference.\n  I have a letter from the American Council of Education in support of \nthe amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         American Council on Education, Office of the President,\n                                                  August 29, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: The associations listed below, representing \n     the nation's 3,700 colleges and universities, strongly urge \n     you to support the amendment that will be offered by Senators \n     Jack Reed (D-RI) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) during floor \n     consideration of the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education appropriations bill. This amendment \n     will restore funding for the State Student Incentive Grant \n     (SSIG) program, which serves as an effective inducement for \n     states to maintain need-based student financial assistance \n     programs.\n       In eliminating funding for the SSIG program, the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee expressed the view that the need \n     exists for an ongoing source of federal support that \n     encourages and leverages state contributions, along with its \n     hope that the imminent reauthorization will succeed in \n     modifying and strengthening SSIG. We believe this will be \n     accomplished, and we have submitted recommendations designed \n     to achieve this goal.\n       However, we believe that the current program is both \n     misunderstood and undervalued in terms of its unique role in \n     the array of existing student aid programs. Within the last \n     six years, for example, SSIG's maintenance of effort \n     requirement has prevented cuts or forced the restoration of \n     funding of state grants in Massachusetts, Arizona, Rhode \n     Island, Connecticut, and Oregon. Further, terminating the \n     program will have punitive consequences for the 680,000 \n     students whose average award of over $1,200 offers them an \n     essential alternative to borrowing. SSIG cuts also will be \n     felt by graduate students, since SSIG is the only Title IV \n     grant program for which they are eligible.\n       Terminating SSIG also will further strain the already \n     frayed relationship that exists between the state and federal \n     governments, families, students, and institutions. While \n     students and their families have borrowed increasingly \n     greater amounts; while institutions have increased \n     institutional student aid from $1 billion in 1979 to more \n     than $10 billion in 1995; and while the federal government \n     has arrested and begun to reverse the decade-long decline in \n     the value of Pell Grants, states have cut spending on higher \n     education to pay for increased expenses in Medicaid and \n     corrections programs. Between 1985 and 1997, the share of \n     state budgets dedicated to higher education fell from 14 \n     percent to 12 percent. Indeed, one analyst has now concluded \n     that if state support for higher education continues to \n     decline at the rate we have seen in the last two decades, it \n     could begin to hit zero in some states early in the next \n     century.\n       We believe that the SSIG program still plays an essential \n     role in leveraging a state/federal partnership in the \n     provision of need-based student aid. We oppose SSIG's \n     elimination, and we urge your support of the Reed/Collins \n     amendment to restore its funding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Stanley O. Ikenberry,\n                                                        President.\n       On behalf of the following associations: American \n     Association of Community Colleges, American Association of \n     State Colleges and Universities, American Council on \n     Education, Association of American Universities, National \n     Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, \n     National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges.\n\n  Mr. REED. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. We cannot \nafford to pass up this opportunity to aid students who in turn will \nbuild a stronger and more prosperous America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in offering an amendment to \nrestore $35 million in funding for the State Student Incentive Grant \nProgram.\n  First, I want to thank and recognize the able leadership of the \nSenator from Rhode Island in this area. I also want to say I very much \nappreciate the work of the managers of this bill, Senators Specter and \nSenator Harkin, in working with Senator Reed and myself to find an \noffset that will allow us to achieve funding for this very important \nprogram.\n  The SSIG program has successfully leveraged a relatively small \nFederal contribution and investment in student aid to build a State-\nFederal partnership supporting grants to the neediest college students. \nLast year, a Federal appropriation of $63 million resulted in a match \nof $784 million in State expenditures for need-based scholarship \ngrants. In the State of Maine alone, 12,000 students received \nassistance under this important program. Nationally, grants averaging \n$1,200 were awarded to about 700,000 students. The recipients, Mr. \nPresident, come from families with average incomes of $12,000 a year. \nAs the Senator from Rhode Island has pointed out, that is below the \nFederal poverty level for a family of four.\n  Mr. President, it would be a serious mistake to terminate this \nprogram. Every single Federal dollar that it provides goes to students \nwith financial need. The States bear the administrative costs, so every \nsingle Federal dollar goes for the grants for these needy students. \nThis program helps to close the widening gap between what students \nreceive in grant assistance and what they are forced to borrow to pay \nfor the ever-increasing costs of a college education.\n  Because of high tuition costs and increased borrowing, students are \ngraduating from college with higher and higher debt burdens. This \nCongress has recognized the problem that this mountain of debt poses \nfor new graduates. It has attempted to ease that burden by making the \ninterests on student loans tax deductible, but then if we turn around \nand eliminate the Federal contribution to the SSIG program we will, in \nfact, be counteracting part of this benefit to the most deserving \nstudents by increasing their loan burden.\n  Now, Mr. President, opponents to continuing the SSIG program argue\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\nthe purpose for the program no longer exists since each of the 50 \nStates have established a grant program. However, this overlooks the \nimportance of SSIG as the Federal-State partnership and the important \nrole this program plays in maintaining the State commitment to these \ngrants. According to the National Association of State Student Grant \nand Aid Programs, 43 States--43 States--would reduce their need-based \ngrants if the SSIG program were eliminated. Some would clearly \nterminate their grant programs altogether without the SSIG \ncontribution. Clearly, in spite of the impressive efforts ahead by many \nStates to help their neediest students, this program continues to be a \ncritical catalyst for State action.\n  As college costs continue to grow faster than income and grant aid, \nand as the grant-loan imbalance widens for students of modest means, \nthe need for SSIG is more important than ever before. This Congress has \njust acknowledged the value of grants by voting for a modest increase \nin the maximum amount of Pell grants. It would be inconsistent and \nincredibly poor timing if at the time we are recognizing the need for \nan increase in the grants under the Pell program, we turn around and \nreduce assistance under the SSIG program.\n  Mr. President, I recently received a letter from Stephanie D'Amico of \nBiddeford, ME, who speaks far more eloquently about the importance of \nthis program than I can. I ask unanimous consent her entire letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Senator Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins, I am writing to ask for your support \n     of State Student Incentive Grants (SSIG). College is one of \n     the best investments we can make in America's future. It is \n     critical to a strong democracy and a healthy economy. To me \n     personally, it represents opportunity for the future.\n       Unfortunately, a college education is becoming harder and \n     harder to afford. The costs of college are rising, but \n     financial aid remains inadequate. The average full time \n     student must devote 24 hours each week to work rather than \n     studies. And this is just to make ends meet.\n       SSIG is one of the best federal programs helping to provide \n     access to education. The federal money put into SSIG is \n     matched by each state. So for every federal SSIG dollar, two \n     dollars are spent on students that need it. Seventy percent \n     of the students who receive SSIG funds come from families \n     with incomes of less than $20,000. Without this program, it \n     is likely that 18 states will lose their entire grant \n     program, putting a college education at risk for many \n     students.\n       Students and families need help with the costs of college. \n     With students now graduating with decades of debt, loans are \n     not the answer. Studies show that students with grants are \n     more likely to stay in school. SSIG is a good, working \n     program that should be fully funded.\n       Thank you for making education funding a priority. I look \n     forward to hearing from you. Please let me know what you are \n     doing to support increased funding for education.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stephanie D'Amico.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I quote just briefly from Stephanie D'Amico's letter.\n  She wrote:\n\n       College is one of the best investments we can make in \n     America's future. It is critical to a strong democracy and a \n     healthy economy. To me personally it represents opportunity \n     for the future. Unfortunately, a college education is \n     becoming harder and harder to afford. . . . SSIG is one of \n     the best Federal programs helping to provide access to \n     education. . . . Students and their families need help with \n     the costs of college. With students now graduating with \n     decades of debt, loans are not the answer. . . . SSIG is a \n     good, working program that helps students stay in school.\n\n  Mr. President, if America is truly to remain the land of opportunity, \nwe must ensure that our citizens like Stephanie D'Amico do not face \ninsurmountable obstacles to higher education. This program will help \nStephanie D'Amico and many like her to achieve the American dream. I \nurge support of the Reed-Collins amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, which restores \n$35 million to the State Student Incentive Grant [SSIG] Program.\n  SSIG is an effective Federal/State partnership program which \nleverages State dollars for need-based student aid.\n  Ensuring that students have need-based grant aid available to them is \nvery important--especially when one considers the extraordinary debt \nthat many college students have taken on to pay for school. In 1995-96 \nSSIG benefited 688,000 students through the country and the median \nfamily income of those students was $12,000. In Vermont, 4,260 students \nreceived assistance through SSIG.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will vote in support of this important \nprogram. As chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I look \nforward to a thoughtful review and strengthening of SSIG as part of the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  So again, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for offering this \namendment and thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, \nfor his support.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Reed amendment, I \nwant to explain why the Senate should restore $35 million to the State \nStudent Incentive Grant [SSIG] program.\n  First, SSIG funds go directly to the students, not to Federal \nbureaucrats or administrators. One hundred percent of these funds go to \nthe students.\n  Second, SSIG grants go to those who need them most: the median family \nincome for SSIG recipients is $12,000--well below the Federal poverty \nlevel for a family of four.\n  Third, because every Federal dollar directly leverages State \neducation dollars, each additional Federal dollar may make the \ndifference whether another student gets the chance to go to college. In \nmany States SSIG grants truly make or break a student's chance to go to \ncollege.\n  Fourth, at a time when costs are limiting access to higher education, \nwe must do everything we can to give every student the opportunity to \ngo to college. I was an early supporter of tax credits to help middle-\nclass families pay the cost of higher education, and this program is \njust as crucial for the most needy students.\n  This program is especially important for Oregon. In the 1995-97 \nperiod, the SSIG Program made the difference for 49,400 students in \nOregon, with an average grant of $1,060. SSIG helped account for 5-\npercent of the funding for the Oregon Need Grant program. And there are \nmore than 16,700 students who did not receive the grant because of \nunderfunding.\n  The Oregon Need Grant program helps provide basic access for Oregon's \nmost needy student population. If we cut off SSIG for the l997-98 \nacademic year, some 620 students could be forced to drop out of \ncollege. In pure dollar amounts, the grant may not seem like much to \npeople in Washington, DC who are used to dealing in billions of \ndollars. But it will enable thousands of students in Oregon to make the \ndecision to go to college.\n  It is the students, of course, who say it the best. One student who \nworks at the U of O admissions office on work study said ``My father \nhas been unemployed for about 4 years even though he has 20 years of \nnaval experience and a college degree. My mother works for the local \nschool system, but her income can't even provide for our family, let \nalone my college education. Without the need grant that I receive, I \nwouldn't be able to attend a 4 year university and work towards my \ndegree in psychiatry and business.'' Another student at the University \nof Oregon said: ``The state need grant has literally been godsend. I \ncome from a single parent household and my mother was laid off from a \n[major] corporation a few years ago and has only been able to get jobs \nas a waitress since. If it were not for the state need grant, I would \nnot be able to attend the University of Oregon. I have lived in Eugene \nall of my life and I've always wanted to attend the U of O. I am \nmajoring in journalism and hope to graduate this year. The grant made \nit possible for my mother to send me to school and still put food on \nthe table for a family of four.''\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and \nask unanimous consent that my full statement be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the education amendment offered \nby Senator Reed to appropriate $35 million to maintain the State \nSupplemental Incentive Grant Program.\n\n[[Page S8908]]\n\n  The SSIG Program is effective in encouraging States to allocate funds \nfor need-based student aid programs. Elimination of SSIG will cause a \nsignificant loss of funds for many needy students and will discourage \nStates from providing this important type of student aid.\n  Continued funding for SSIG is supported by the American Council on \nEducation, the United States Student Association, US PIRG, the National \nAssociation of Graduate-Professional Students, the National Association \nof State Student Grant and Aid Programs, and the Education Trust.\n  SSIG is a Federal-State partnership in student aid. States must match \nthe Federal funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Eliminating the Federal \nshare will inevitably result in many States dropping their programs \nentirely.\n  SSIG constitutes a significant percentage of need-based aid in \nseveral States. It is also an incentive for State legislatures to \nprovide their own need-based student aid. In 13 States, Federal SSIG is \n20 percent or more of the total need-based aid in the State. In Hawaii \nand Mississippi, the elimination of SSIG funds would cut the State \nneed-based aid in half.\n  In Rhode Island, the State legislature provided need-based aid in \norder to obtain the Federal SSIG funds. The Connecticut Legislature \nincreased need-based aid in order to meet the SSIG requirements. \nLouisiana will end all need-based aid if Federal funds for SSIG are not \nappropriated.\n  One of the fundamental goals of the Higher Education Act is to \nprovide greater access to higher education for all qualified students, \nregardless of income. Expanding this access is still a major challenge. \nIn the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, we will be \nconsidering all aspects of the roles of the Federal Government, the \nState governments, colleges, students, and their families in meeting \nthe costs of higher education.\n  SSIG is a program that works. It's a sensible Federal-State \npartnership, and it may well be a model for other steps to leverage the \nuse of Federal funds. I urge my colleagues to support the Reed \namendment to appropriate adequate funds for SSIG, so that needy \nstudents across the country will not lose this critical aspect of \ncollege aid.\n  Mr. REED. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I understand this vote is scheduled for 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at 5 p.m. today \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to Senator Reed's \namendment numbered 1096.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. REED. Would the Senator also include in this request a \nmodification that precludes any second-degree amendments on my \namendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is my understanding, that both sides would agree, \nand I ask unanimous consent the Senator's request be honored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1097\n\n   (Purpose: To enhance food safety for children through preventive \n                    research and medical treatment)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside in order to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1097.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, after line 26, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Transfer.--Using $5,000,000 of the amounts \n     appropriated under this title, the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall carry out activities under subsection \n     (b) to address urgent health threats posed by E. coli:0157H7.\n       (b) Use of Funds.--From amounts transferred under \n     subsection (a) the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall--\n       (1) provide $1,000,000 for the development of improved \n     medical treatments for patients infected with E. coli:0157H-\n     related disease (HUS);\n       (2) provide $1,000,000 to fund ongoing research to detect \n     or prevent colonization of E. coli:0157H7 in live cattle;\n       (3) provide, through the existing partnership between the \n     Federal Government, industry, and consumer groups, $1,000,000 \n     for the National Consumer Education Campaign on Food Safety \n     as part of the activities to address safe food handling \n     practices;\n       (4) provide $1,000,000 for a study to determine the \n     feasibility of the use of electronic pasteurization on red \n     meats to eliminate pathogens and to carry out activities to \n     educate the public on the safety of that process; and\n       (5) provide $1,000,000 for a contract to be entered into \n     with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the \n     effectiveness of testing to ensure zero tolerance of E. \n     coli:0157H7 in raw ground beef products.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1098 to Amendment No. 1097\n\n   (Purpose: To enhance food safety for children through preventive \n                    research and medical treatment)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes an \n     amendment No. 1098 to amendment numbered 1097.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and add the following:\n       (a) Transfer.--Using $5,000,000 of the amounts appropriated \n     under this title, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall carry out activities under subsection (b) to address \n     urgent health threats posed by E. coli:0157H7.\n       (b) Use of Funds.--From amounts transferred under \n     subsection (a) the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall--\n       (1) provide $1,000,000 for the development of improved \n     medical treatments for patients infected with E. coli:0157H7-\n     related disease (HUS);\n       (2) provide $550,000 to fund ongoing research to detect or \n     prevent colonization of E. coli:0157H7 in live cattle:\n       (3) provide, through the existing partnership between the \n     Federal Government, industry, and consumer groups, $1,000,000 \n     for the National Consumer Education Campaign on Food Safety \n     as part of the activities to address safe food handling \n     practices;\n       (4) provide $1,000,000 for a study to determine the \n     feasibility of the use of electronic pasteurization on red \n     meats to eliminate pathogens and to carry out activities to \n     educate the public on the safety of that process; and\n       (5) provide $1,000,000 for a contract to be entered into \n     with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the \n     effectiveness of testing to ensure zero tolerance of E. \n     coli:0157H7 in raw ground beef products.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am only going to speak to this \namendment briefly. Let me just say that, at the appropriate time, it \nwill be discovered that this is a rather broadly based amendment to \ndeal with food safety.\n  The amendment includes provisions for funding for research in the \ndevelopment of improved medical treatment for patients infected with E. \ncoli and related diseases.\n  The amendment provides funding to help detect and prevent \ncolonization of E. coli in live cattle. Research would focus on \ndetermining the pathogen relationship between cattle and E. coli.\n  The amendment will provide funding for the administration's food and \nsafety initiative and, more directly, for the important consumer \neducation component.\n  Mr. President, the amendment provides provisions to implement a much-\nneeded study on the feasibility of a irradiating raw meat to eliminate \nE. coli and to develop a consumer education program on the process of \nsafety.\n  Mr. President, the amendment will require the Department of Health \nand Human Services to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to \ndetermine the effectiveness of USDA's zero-tolerance standard for E. \ncoli.\n  I am pleased today to be introducing an important amendment in my \ncapacity as Agriculture Subcommittee\n\n[[Page S8909]]\n\nchairman with jurisdiction over inspections. I am proposing what I \nthink is a commonsense, effective approach to confronting the deadly \npathogen E. coli:0157H7. As we are all aware in Congress, our Nation is \nfacing a difficult battle with this bacteria as we work to assure the \nsafety of our domestic food source. Scientists are confronting \ntraditional difficulties in fighting E. coli on the farm and \ncontrolling the toxins it releases once in the body. Looking closely at \nthis issue over the past two weeks, it has become increasingly clear to \nme that some of the best answers to E. coli and other food safety \nproblems can be found in advanced research, education, and study. The \ncommittee report on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill repeatedly calls \nfor greater emphasis on food safety and development of priorities in \nthis field. Consequently, firewalls must be built to prevent, to the \ngreatest extent possible, the growth, transmission, and human health \ndestruction that can be caused by this rare but virulent bacteria. The \nfollowing amendment takes recommendations, which were issued in the \n``Final Report of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Solving the E. coli \n0157:H7 Problem'' in 1994. This task force was comprised of the experts \nfrom the government, industry, academia, and consumer and producer \ngroups. These recommendations are all backed by good science and will \nhelp strengthen existing standards and build new safeguards against \nhuman exposure to and illness from E. coli 0157:H7. The following is a \nsummary of my amendment:\n\n\n                           amendment summary\n\n  First, this provision provides funding for research on the \ndevelopment of improved medical treatment for patients infected with E. \ncoli 0157:H7 related disease [HUS]. The most vulnerable members of \nsociety susceptible to the chronic effects of E. coli 0157:H7 infection \nare--children and the elderly. Funding should focus on helping these \nindividuals to recover fully.\n  Second, this provision provides funding to help detect and prevent \ncolonization of E. coli 0157:H7 in live cattle. Research should focus \non determining the host/pathogen relationship between cattle and the E. \ncoli microbe, and explore which factors contribute to its incidence in \ncattle.\n  Third, this provision provides funding for the Administration's Food \nSafety Initiative, more directly for the important consumer education \ncomponent. This national consumer education campaign on food safety \nrepresents a partnership between government, industry, and consumer \ngroups. This is an important link in the food safety chain and critical \ninitiative endorsed last year by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett \nKoop, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Fourth, this provision implements a much-needed study on the \nfeasibility of irradiating raw red meat to eliminate the E. coli \n0157:H7 pathogen and to develop a consumer education program on the \nprocess' safety. Currently available for poultry products, irradiation \nis a proven method of confronting this disease, and its feasibility on \nred meat needs to be explored.\n  Fifth, requires the Department of Health and Human Services to \ncontract with the National Academy of Sciences to determine the \neffectiveness of the USDA's zero tolerance standard for E. coli 0157:H7 \nin raw ground beef products and the effectiveness of its current \nmicrobiological testing program. An updated report on this testing will \nbe helpful to the Congress, USDA, consumers, and the industry in their \nsearch for tools to effectively identify and eradicate E. coli 0157:H7 \nin raw ground beef products.\n  I would request that this amendment be carefully examined by my \ncolleagues and by the administration. Upon their review, I hope that \nthe amendment will be agreed to in order to continue solidifying our \nNation's food as the safest in the world.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, can you tell me the order of the day?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A vote will occur at 5 p.m. with respect to \namendment No. 1096. It is an amendment offered by Mr. Reed of Rhode \nIsland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1094\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Would it be \nappropriate for the Senator to speak in favor of the Harry Reid \namendment at this time by unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a new contaminant called perchlorate, with \npotentially serious health risks, has recently been detected in \ndrinking water in California and Nevada. It is expected to also be \nfound in drinking water in other States.\n  Perchlorate is a chemical component of solid rocket fuel, munitions, \nand fireworks. The potential source of the drinking water contamination \nis solid fuel and munitions factories that produce and use large \namounts of ammonium perchlorate.\n  According to preliminary research, perchlorate causes the thyroid \ngland to malfunction by interfering with the gland's ability to use \niodine and produce hormones. A malfunctioning thyroid affects the \nmetabolism and therefore interferes with growth and development of \nhumans.\n  New safe drinking water technology to measure perchlorate became \navailable in May 1997. Since then, groundwater wells in the most likely \nareas in the country have begun to be tested.\n  Perchlorate has so far been detected in 69 drinking water wells in \nCalifornia--out of the 232 tested so far--as well as in the Colorado \nRiver and Lake Mead which is the source of water for over 10 million \npeople in California, Nevada, and Arizona.\n  It is expected to be present in drinking water wells in other States. \nEPA has stated that the contamination is a very serious issue.\n  There is no Federal standard for perchlorate in drinking water. \nCalifornia is the only State that has a temporary safety standard for \nconsuming water that contains perchlorate--18 parts per billion--but \nthis temporary standard is based on very preliminary health effects \ndata.\n  There is no research data on the possible carcinogenic effects of \nperchlorate.\n  Twenty-four wells in California have been closed because perchlorate \nlevels exceed the California standard--with some wells registering a \nperchlorate level of 280 parts per billion--including wells at the San \nGabriel Superfund site.\n  Mr. President, this amendment requires the National Institutes of \nHealth [NIH] to ``from amounts appropriated under this title'' conduct \na study on the health effects of perchlorate with particular emphasis \non the health risks to vulnerable subpopulations including children, \npregnant women, and the elderly.\n  It also requires that the NIH report back to the committee within 9 \nmonths--and annually thereafter--on the results of the study--including \na recommendation on whether further health effects research is \nnecessary.\n  This is an important first step.\n  First we need to understand more about what the potential health \neffects of perchlorate are. Then we will take whatever measures are \nappropriate to ensure that our drinking water remains safe for all, \nespecially for our most vulnerable people--children and our elderly.\n\n\n                           other initiatives\n\n  First, the fiscal year 1998 EPA appropriations bill includes a $2 \nmillion earmark for treatment technology research at the Crafton-\nRedlands plume in California (that is, research on how to filter out or \nextract perchlorate. Perchlorate is a salt-based soluble so \ncontamination moves as quickly as the water moves.\n  Second, Senator Boxer is working to include the following report \nlanguage in the EPA appropriations bill:\n\n       The Committee directs the Environmental Protection Agency \n     to work with the Department of Defense, the National \n     Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and other \n     relevant federal and state agencies to assess the state of \n     the science on (1) the health effects of perchlorate on \n     humans and the environment, and (2) the extent of perchlorate \n     contamination of our nation's drinking water supplies; and to \n     make recommendations on how this emerging problem might\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\n     be addressed. The EPA will submit a report on the interagency \n     findings to the Committee within six months.\n\n  I don't think we have a more serious charge of protecting the health \nand safety of the American people.\n  I thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1096\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Of the funds made available under this title, \n     $450,000 shall be awarded by the Secretary of Education for \n     grants for the establishment, operation, and evaluation of \n     pilot student safety toll-free hotlines to provide elementary \n     school and secondary school students with confidential \n     assistance regarding school crime, violence, drug dealing, \n     and\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\n     threats to the personal safety of the students.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is a grave condition in our \nelementary and secondary schools across the land. Today, 40 percent of \nour children do not feel safe in school. It's hard to believe, Mr. \nPresident, that:\n  At least 2.7 million violent crimes take place annually either at or \nnear school.\n  Every hour, on school campuses, more than 2,000 students and about 40 \nteachers are physically attacked.\n  One in every nine students said they cut classes or stayed away from \nschool last year to avoid being beaten or shot.\n  One in every eight students carries a weapon to school for \nprotection, with 100,000 children taking a gun to school each day.\n  Last year, a 12-year-old student at a Los Angeles middle school was \nraped on campus, during school hours, by another student. The victim \nwas forced to attend alone a school disciplinary hearing for the \naccused which the offender attended with his parents and his lawyer. \nThe State education code afforded protection for the accused but not \nfor the victims or witnesses.\n  Recently, four teenage boys gang raped a 14-year-old girl at a public \nhigh school in Queens. The girl reluctantly reported the crime the next \nday to a school counselor. When she didn't provide enough detail the \nassistant principal merely referred her back to the counselor. Almost 1 \nmonth later the crime was finally reported to law enforcement and the \nfour were arrested.\n  A 15-year-old boy killed himself in a GA classroom after being \nassaulted and bullied almost daily at school because he was overweight.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow our children to continue to be \nterrorized at school. We cannot ignore these kids who are victimized or \nwho witness their friends being abused. The amendment I am offering \ntoday begins to address this problem for those children already facing \nviolence. It will: Require the Secretary of Education to establish a \nprogram to provide training and technical assistance to State and local \neducation agencies in developing and implementing procedures to protect \nvictims/witnesses of school crime, including protections associated \nwith school disciplinary hearing, and require the Secretary of \nEducation to utilize $500,000 of the funds appropriated under this bill \nto award grants for pilot school safety hotlines to provide K-12 \nstudents with confidential assistance regarding violence, crime, drugs, \nand threats to personal safety.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the 52 million children who attend our \nschools this year, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1101\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a comprehensive program for the prevention of \n                        Fetal Alcohol Syndrome)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. COMPREHENSIVE FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME PREVENTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading known cause of \n     mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;\n       (2) each year, up to 12,000 infants are born in the United \n     States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering irreversible \n     physical and mental damage;\n       (3) thousands more infants are born each year with Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects, which are lesser, though still serious, \n     alcohol-related birth defects;\n       (4) children of women who use alcohol while pregnant have a \n     significantly higher infant mortality rate (13.3 per 1000) \n     than children of those women who do not use alcohol (8.6 per \n     1000);\n       (5) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects are \n     national problems which can impact any child, family, or \n     community, but their threat to American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives is especially alarming;\n       (6) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol \n     dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a \n     newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects are up to 30 times greater than national averages;\n       (7) in addition to the immeasurable toll on children and \n     their families, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects pose extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, \n     including the costs of health care, education, foster care, \n     job training, and general support services for affected \n     individuals;\n       (8) the total cost to the economy of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     was approximately $2,700,000,000 in 1995, and over a \n     lifetime, health care costs for one Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     child are estimated to be at least $1,400,000;\n       (9) researchers have determined that the possibility of \n     giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects increases in proportion to the amount and \n     frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that \n     stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy \n     reduces the emotional, physical, and mental consequences of \n     alcohol exposure to the baby; and\n       (10) though approximately 1 out of every 5 pregnant women \n     drink alcohol during their pregnancy, we know of no safe dose \n     of alcohol during pregnancy, or of any safe time to drink \n     during pregnancy, thus, it is in the best interest of the \n     Nation for the Federal Government to take an active role in \n     encouraging all women to abstain from alcohol consumption \n     during pregnancy.\n       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     establish, within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, a comprehensive program to help prevent Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects nationwide. Such \n     program shall--\n       (1) coordinate, support, and conduct basic and applied \n     epidemiologic research concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and \n     Fetal Alcohol Effects;\n       (2) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State, and \n     community-based public awareness, prevention, and education \n     programs on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects; \n     and\n       (3) foster coordination among all Federal agencies that \n     conduct or support Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects research, programs, and surveillance and otherwise \n     meet the general needs of populations actually or potentially \n     impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects.\n       (d) Establishment of Program.--Title III of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n          ``PART O--FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     ``SEC. 399G.

If the Secretary determines that less than 95 \n     percent of such amount appropriated for a fiscal year is \n     being used directly for teachers and students, the Secretary \n     shall certify the percentage of such amount that is being \n     directly used for teachers and students.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, my amendment will directly help \nstudents and teachers in this country. It is an amendment that simply \nrequires accountability of our spending at the Department of Education. \nThis amendment will require the Secretary of Education to certify that \n95 percent of the amount we appropriate in this bill goes directly to \nstudents and teachers. If the Secretary cannot certify that 95 percent \nof our spending directly benefits students and teachers, then the \nSecretary must certify what percentage is being spent.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Education will spend $31 billion in \n1998. The Department is receiving an increase of nearly $3 billion in \nfunding for 1998. No one is a stronger supporter of education than I \nam, but education has, and hopefully will be, a local issue. So I would \nhope that the role of a Federal Department of Education is to provide \nadditional funds for students and teachers, not bureaucrats.\n  I think we need to fire bureaucrats, and feed teachers!\n  The Department will spend $400 million on management alone. My \nconcern is the Department is rife with wasteful programs. For example, \nthere is $4 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts. \nThere is money for education of prisoners in Hawaii and money to study \nwaste disposal in Hawaii. There is $15 million for education of \njuveniles in prison. More than $64 million will be spent on just \nresearch. These are just a few examples.\n  Most people think the Department is spending money on teachers and \nstudents alone. But we know this is not true. This amendment will for \nthe first time require the Department of Education to tell the American \npeople just how much is being spent by the Federal Government on \nteachers and students, not bureaucrats and wasteful programs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment spoken \nof by my colleague, Senator Faircloth. The Faircloth-Craig amendment \nwould require that the Secretary of Education certify each year the \npercentage of Federal moneys used directly for teachers and students.\n  The point of the amendment is not the 95 percent figure--it is to \ndraw attention to the vast amount of Federal waste inherent in the \nDepartment of Education. Much of what we spend on education each year \nis lost by Federal managers and bureaucrats.\n  Increased spending has done little to advance classroom instruction. \nFederal spending on education has increased 41 percent since 1989. Yet, \nper-pupil spending at the school level has increased only 34 percent. \nThe rest has been siphoned off to support the enormous Federal \nbureaucracy.\n  This year's appropriations bill includes a significant increase in \neducation--we don't know yet how much of it will ever see the inside of \na classroom.\n  Mr. President, teachers in Idaho, and around the country, want to \nknow where their money has gone. I believe we must, in a time of fiscal \nrestraint, examine where each Federal dollar is spent and cut waste \nwherever it is found.\n  The Faircloth-Craig amendment is a sound first step in the right \ndirection.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1103\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Education to conduct a study \n   regarding the costs of the anticipated increase in enrollments of \nsecondary school students during the period 1998 through 2008, and the \n   creation of smaller class sizes for students enrolled in grades 1 \n                               through 3)\n\n       On page 61, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\n       Sec.   .

Such report shall include recommendations regarding what \n     local school districts, States and the Federal Government can \n     do to address the issue of the increase in enrollments of \n     secondary school students and the need for smaller class \n     sizes in grades 1 through 3.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nmanagers of this bill for including language in the managers' amendment \nat my request. The amendment I intended to offer, which has been \nincluded in the managers' amendment, directs the Department of \nEducation to conduct a study of the economic costs of addressing our \nNation's burgeoning elementary and secondary student enrollment, \nprojected to grow by over 2 million young people in the next decade, \nand the expected impact that this growth will have on student \nachievement. It directs the Department to estimate the costs to local \nschool districts, States, and the Federal Government of the upcoming \nsurge in enrollment, and to outline policy options for addressing this \nissue and make recommendations to resolve it. In estimating the costs \nand impact on students of increasing enrollment and making policy \nrecommendations to address this problem, the study will also consider \nthe costs and benefits of reducing class sizes in the earliest grades.\n  Mr. President, parents are increasingly interested in enrolling their \nyoung children in schools that place an emphasis on small class size \nand individualized attention from teachers. Cities and States across \nthe country are developing programs to help schools meet this goal. \nCalifornia's statewide initiative to reduce all classes in grades K-3 \nto no more than 20 students is the most ambitious, but by no means the \nonly example.\n  In my own State of Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in \nEducation, or SAGE, Program was developed several years ago to study \nthe benefits of small class size in schools with high poverty rates. \nWith student-teacher ratios of 15:1, the program is extremely popular \nwith students, parents, teachers, and school administrators. Although \nis has only been implemented in a relatively small number of Wisconsin \ncommunities thus far, the reason for the program's widespread appeal is \nobvious--with fewer students in the classroom, teachers have more time \nand energy to devote to meeting children's particular needs and helping \nto spark their interest in learning in creative ways. This may seem \nlike common sense, and it is--but now, we have science to back up what \nparents and teachers have known for years.\n  Research indicates that children who are placed in small classes--\nclasses of 15 to 20 students--in the earliest years of elementary \nschool achieve better academically than their peers in larger classes. \nThese benefits are retained in later years of school, even if students \nare not kept in small classes for later grades. The leading scientific \nstudies of the impact of small class size, Tennessee's STAR study and \nits follow-up, the Lasting Benefits Study, found that small class sizes \nin grades K-3 produce substantial improvements in learning which are \nsustained in later years, even if students are placed in larger classes \nfor later grades.\n  Unfortunately, at the very time that States and localities are \nstarting to apply the lessons learned in the Tennessee studies, many of \nour Nation's schools are on the brink of an explosion in student \nenrollment. According to a report released last month by Education \nSecretary Richard Riley, entitled ``A Back to School Special Report on \nthe Baby Boom Echo: Here Come the Teenagers,'' there will be more \nelementary and secondary students in America this school year than \nthere ever have been before. These increases will occur primarily among \nsecondary school students; public high school enrollment is projected \nto increase by 13% in the next 10 years, while elementary school \nenrollment will increase only slightly. Total public and private school \nenrollment in the 1997-98 school year will rise to a record level of \n52.2 million students, and it won't stop there. By the year 2007, total \nenrollment is expected to peak at 54.3 million students.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a problem that isn't going away. Unlike our \npast experience with the baby boom, when there was a sharp rise in \nstudent enrollment which eventually declined, the U.S. Bureau of the \nCensus projects that the number of births will remain stable or even \nincrease slightly in the next few decades. States and local school \ndistricts are going to have to develop strategies for accommodating and \neducating very large numbers of students. This is likely to be costly, \nand will require creative solutions and the balancing of priorities.\n  To some degree, this is a regional problem. Wisconsin, for example, \nalong with many States in the Midwest, will actually experience small \ndecreases in student population in the next decade. However, this will \ncertainly not be the case in every community in my State, or in any of \nthe States which are projected to experience decreases in student \nenrollment. Across the Nation, school districts are going to need to \nadapt to their larger student bodies, at the same time that many of \nthem, rightly, will be investing in the creation of smaller classes for \ntheir early elementary students.\n  Mr. President, smaller class sizes are the wave of the future. \nParents want them, students benefit from them, and schools are \nrecognizing the need. I thank my colleagues, the Senators from \nPennsylvania and Iowa, once again for accepting my amendment, which \nwill lay out options for schools to consider as they plan for a future \nwith smaller classes and larger enrollment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1104\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the National Occupational Information \n Coordinating Committee, offset by reducing other national activities)\n\n       On page 3, line 3 strike ``$8,000,000'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof: ``$10,000,000''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1105\n\n    (Purpose: To provide a disability return to work demonstration \n                              initiative)\n\n       On page 70, line 1, strike ``$16,160,300,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof: ``$16,162,525,000''.\n       On page 70, before the period on line 4, insert the \n     following: ``:Provided further, That not less than $2,225,000 \n     shall be available for conducting a disability return to work \n     demonstration initiative, which focuses on providing persons \n     who have lost limbs with an integrated program of prosthetic \n     and rehabilitative care and job placement assistance''.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my amendment would provide $2,225,000 to \nestablish a demonstration project to assist persons with disabilities \ndue to the loss of a limb to return to work.\n  According to a 1996 GAO report on SSA disability programs, \n``[r]eturn-to-work strategies and practices may hold the potential for \nimproving federal disability programs by helping people with \ndisabilities return to productive activity in the workplace and at the \nsame time reduce program costs.''\n  The GAO report goes on to note that the three most important \nstrategies to mainstream individuals back into the work force are: \nintervene as soon as possible; identify and provide necessary return-\nto-work assistance; and structure benefits to encourage people to \nreturn to work.\n  Using these GAO suggestions as a guide, I have attempted to address \nthe medical, rehabilitative, and job training needs of individuals who \nhave lost their limbs.\n  Experience has shown that for people who have lost limbs, access to \nappropriate medical rehabilitation can mean the difference between \nprolonged dependence and a successful return to the work place. Due to \nadvancement in modern rehabilitation medicine, persons who experience \nlimb loss can now routinely expect to attain high levels of \nindependence and functionality.\n  Over the last several years, I have worked with Limbs for Life \nFoundation which provides financial help to amputees nationwide. As a \nresult of my association with them, I have observed\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\nthat a significant percentage of people who lose limbs do not return to \nthe work force and subsequently become dependent on Social Security's \nSupplemental Security Income [SSI] and Disability Insurance [DI] \nprograms. A leading cause for this dependence has been the inability to \ngain access to appropriate rehabilitation care.\n  According to the Social Security Administration, less than half of 1 \npercent of Social Security beneficiaries return to work. Yet, they also \nestimate that as many as 3 out of 10 persons on disability may be good \ncandidates for return to work but the system does not encourage it.\n  I believe this partial due to the Social Security Administration's \nprocess for determining disability which does not generally assess the \nindividuals functional capacity to work, but rather presumes that \ncertain medical conditions are in themselves sufficient to preclude \nwork. However, the link between medical condition and work incapacity \nis weak. While there are certainly some medical impairments which \nprevent individuals from working, others factors such as vocational, \npsychological, economic, environmental, and motivational are often more \nimportant determinants of work capacity.\n  My proposed demonstration program will result in a better rate of \nreturn to work because it will provide people with the tools needed to \nsuccessfully overcome many of the impediments which have traditionally \nheld them back from main streaming into the work place.\n  Specifically, by providing appropriate prosthetic and rehabilitation \nservices, followed by an intensive regimen of occupational therapy the \ndemonstration program will prepare amputees to meet the physical \ndemands of the work place. Practical assistance such as job training \nand job placement are also critical for successful main streaming and \nwould be a part of the program.\n  Not only will we be helping people who want to work, but will more \neffectively spend our limited disability money. The Social Security \nAdministration's estimates that lifetime cash benefits are reduced by \n$60,000 when an individual receiving Disability Insurance returns to \nwork; $30,000 when an individual receiving Supplemental Security Income \nreturns to work.\n  The Limbs for Life Foundation has estimated that they could provide \nservices for 775 individuals with the proposed $2,225,000 demonstration \nprogram. Under their proposal, this money would be combined with the \nFoundation's own funds and services and result in a net savings of $9 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a sound investment and I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1106\n\n  (Purpose: Provide for additional Security Administration continuing \n    disability reviews as authorized by cap adjustment legislation)\n\n       On page 71, line 23, strike ``$245,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof: $290,000,000.\n       On page 71, line 25, after ``Public Law 104-121'' insert: \n     ``, section 10203 of Public Law 105-33,''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1107\n\n                   (Purpose: Millennium 2000 Project)\n\n       On page 60, line 7, strike ``$338,964,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$340,064,000: Provided, That $1,000,000 shall \n     be used for the Millennium 2000 project''.\n       On page 56, line 21, strike ``$8,557,741,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$8,556,641,000''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to thank the managers of this \nlegislation for including language offered by myself and Senator \nKennedy that will provide the Department of Education with $1.1 million \nto begin planning efforts for the Nation's celebration of the \nmillennium. These funds were requested by the Department of Education \nand will be offset within the Department.\n  The Clinton administration recently established the White House \nMillennium Program to coordinate the Nation's efforts to celebrate the \nmillennium. Having served as Administrator of the American Revolution \nBicentennial Administration, I know the importance of advance planning \nand preparation for national events. While not comparable in historic \nsignificance to our bicentennial, the millennium is, nevertheless, an \nevent many Americans will wish to recognize and to participate in. To \nthe extent there is national governmental participation, it should be \nto focus on dignity and quality. These funds will be critical to that \neffort.\n  It is my hope that the White House Millennium Program will work \nclosely with an organization I have been affiliated with for a number \nof years--the Millennium Society. This respected international \norganization has been in existence since 1979 and is devoted to \norganizing a global celebration of the millennium. Most importantly, \nthe Millennium Society has focused much of its efforts on establishing \nand administering the Millennium Society Scholarship Program.\n  I would like to particularly recognize Cate Magennis Wyatt, a founder \nof the Millennium Society, who was instrumental in building the \norganization. Her dedication and hard work have focused international \nattention on this issue in a positive manner.\n  Over the past several years, along with much support from Senators \nDodd and Stevens and others, I have worked closely with the firm of \nAlcalde & Fay and, in recent months, Tommy Boggs, a volunteer \ncounselor. All of us have worked with one goal in mind--ensure that the \nmillennium is celebrated in a proper and dignified manner. Providing \nadequate planning funds will help us achieve that goal.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1108\n\n    (Purpose: Provide authority to use fees collected for provider \n           requested audits to cover the cost of such audits)\n\n       On page 39, line 17, after the word ``expended'' insert: \n     ``, and together with administrative fees collected relative \n     to Medicare overpayment recovery activities, which shall \n     remain available until expended''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1109\n\n (Purpose: To require that estimates of certain employer contributions \n   be included in an individual's social security account statement)\n\n       On page 49, after line 26, add the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, for many years, I have worked to identify \nand eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare Program. Senator \nSpecter and I have held hearing after hearing and released report after \nreport through our subcommittee. And along the way, we have had some \nsuccesses. We've stopped a number of scams and ripoffs and we've forced \nMedicare to reduce excessive prices for a number of devices. These \nactions have saved Medicare and taxpayers over $1 billion. However, the \nproblem continues to grow. Much more needs to be done.\n  Several years ago, the General Accounting Office testified before our \nAppropriations Subcommittee that, based on their analysis, Medicare was \nlosing up to 10 percent of its expenditures, or $16 billion to fraud, \nwaste, and abuse. However, on July 17, HHS Inspector General June Gibbs \nBrown released a major new report that indicated that the problem was \neven worse. It was the first national audit of a statistically \nsignificant sample of Medicare claims for payment errors. This chief \nfinancial officer [CFO] audit found that up to 14 percent of Medicare \npayments in 1996 were made inappropriately. That's up to $24 billion in \n1 year alone.\n  And this was not a flimsy study. It was detailed and in-depth; 5,300 \nclaims of all types--physician and hospital services, home health care, \nlab tests--were thoroughly audited. Patient medical records were \nreviewed and providers and beneficiaries were interviewed. Fully one \nthird of all the claims were found to contain mispayments--all or a \nportion of the claims should not have been paid.\n  Some 46 percent of the mispayments were for claims that had either \ninadequate or no documentation to justify their need; 36 percent of the \npayment errors involved services that upon review were found not \nmedically necessary. For example, Medicare was charged for x rays on \nboth knees for one patient, when the patient only had problems with one \nknee. And 8 percent of the payment errors were due to improper billing \ncodes used by health care providers. For example, a physician billed \nfor one office procedure when upon review of the medical records it was \nfound another less expensive procedure was actually performed.\n  This report is a devastating indictment of the administration of \nMedicare. And if it goes unaddressed, Medicare will lose as much money \nover the next 5 years to fraud, waste, and abuse as was cut by \nthe balanced budget act we just passed. That is simply unacceptable.\n\n  Making sure that doesn't happen should be at the top of the priority \nlist for the Department of Health and Human Services and this \nadministration. I am afraid, however, that this may not be the case.\n  The Department has drafted a corrective action plan that, if fully \nimplemented, would take some important steps to addressing the problems \nidentified in the CFO audit. My understanding is that it calls for a \n10-percent increase in medical reviews, a 20-percent increase in \nprepayment review of hospital claims, a 20-percent increase in post-\npayment review of physician claims, and increases in provider \neducation, expanded audits of home health agencies and nursing, and \nother improvements.\n  These are important improvements, but they are woefully inadequate. \nWe need to at least double the number of audits Medicare is conducting. \nRight now, only about 3 percent of claims are reviewed and only 3 of \nevery 1,000 providers receive a comprehensive audit in any year. That \nneeds to change. And this amendment would help Medicare meet this need.\n  I send an amendment to the desk for myself and Senator Graham of \nFlorida, who has been tireless in the fight against Medicare fraud, and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  This amendment would direct the Department of Health and Human \nServices to obligate no less than an addition $50 million this fiscal \nyear to increase Medicare audits and to comply with its correction \naction plan developed in response to the CFO audit.\n  Mr. President, there is about $53 million in the Medicare contractor \naccount for fiscal year 1997 that will likely go unspent. This is due \nto problems the Department has encountered in the administration of its \nMedicare transaction system [MTS] initiative. Rather than seeing this \nmoney lapse or be rushed inefficiently into a last minute contract, our \namendment would assure that this money is well spent to address a \npressing problem. It would be easy for the Department to implement \nbecause it would simply obligate it to existing contractors to expand \nthe number of audits and reviews that they undertake--it will simply, \nin effect, increase a current work order.\n  Mr. President, it would be unconscionable for the Department to let \nthese funds lapse when they know how inadequate their current efforts \nand resources are to combat Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse. This is \nnot time for bureaucratic business as usual. We need to take bold \naction to begin to turn the tide against these losses. Our amendment is \na simple, commonsense step that would have a significant impact.\n  If properly implemented, it would more than double the percentage of \nproblem providers receiving comprehensive audits. This would save \nMedicare and taxpayers many times over its costs.\n  I understand the amendment has been cleared on both sides. I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1113) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1114\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize \nappropriations for refugee and entrant assistance for fiscal years 1998 \n                               and 1999)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of Senator \nGraham, who is proposing this on behalf of Senators Kennedy and \nAbraham. I also lend my support to the measure. I understand it also \nhas been accepted by both sides. This has to do with immigration.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That amendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] for Mr. Graham, for \n     himself, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Abraham, proposes amendment \n     numbered 1114.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, after line 26, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . That Section 414(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1524(a)) is amended by striking \n     ``fiscal year 1995, fiscal year 1996, and fiscal year 1997'' \n     and inserting ``each of fiscal years 1998, and 1999''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect October 1, 1997.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The United States has for years been a leader in refugee \nprotection. Since 1975, over 2 million refugees have resettled in the \nUnited States. The Refugee Act is the core of U.S. refugee policy. This \nact sets out the criteria for persons to be designated as refugees. In \naddition, the\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\nRefugee Act allows the Department of Health and Human Services to run \nseveral important programs to assist refugees in adjusting to their new \nlife in the United States. These programs include the Refugee \nAssistance Program, which provides assistance to refugees to help them \nbecome self-sufficient in the shortest time possible, social services \nprograms which provide funding to States to support English language \nclasses and employment training for refugees. Refugees receiving cash \nand medical assistance under this program are required to be enrolled \nin employment services and accept employment offers.\n  Furthermore, the Refugee Act allows HHS to provide overseas medical \nscreening of refugees before they enter the United States. Also, it \nprovides targeted assistance to States and counties with high refugee \npopulations. For instance, in 1996, Polk County IA received $160,500 in \ntargeted assistance. HHS also provides a matching grant to voluntary \nagencies which take responsibility for resetting refugees and ensuring \nthey become self-sufficient. In Iowa, the Refugee Act allowed HHS to \nprovide a targeted assistance award of almost $50,000 to the State and \nLutheran Social Services for a program which helps former political \nprisoners achieve economic independence.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to be working with \nSenators Kennedy, Abraham, and Harkin in their efforts to reauthorize \nthe Refugee Act of 1980.\n  Through the Office of the U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs, we \nare better able to develop a comprehensive national strategy to help \nour State and local governments assimilate the individuals that have \nfled persecution, injustice, and war.\n  The Federal Government has welcomed these individuals to our shores. \nOur local governments welcome them to their communities--and through \nthe programs of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, we make sure that \nthey acquire the skills needed to adjust to our society and become \nself-sufficient, productive members of society, as soon as possible.\n  More than 17,000 refugees and entrants arrived in Florida in fiscal \nyear 1996. In fiscal year 1995, this number was higher than 36,000. \nBetween 1992 and 1996, more than 70,000 refugees and entrants settled \nin Dade County. Without the programs of the Office of Refugee \nResettlement, this influx would be a tremendous financial burden on \nState and local governments.\n  The arrival of refugees and entrants is a Federal decision; these \ncosts should not be shifted to State and local taxpayers.\n  By reauthorizing the Refugee Act of 1980, we can continue to offer \nprotection from those fleeing persecution--and make sure that we are \naddressing the needs of these vulnerable members of our society in a \nhumane, just, comprehensive, and cost-effective manner.\n  Senator Kennedy is to be commended on his leadership on this issue. I \nam proud to work with him and our Senate colleagues to ensure the \npassage of this measure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Graham has introduced, on behalf \nof Senator Abraham and me, a 2-year extension of the Refugee Act. That \nact is the core of U.S. refugee policy. It sets the criteria under \nwhich persons can be designated as refugees and provides funds for \nrefugee resettlement. Last year, the United States admitted more than \n75,000 refugees under the Refugee Act's criteria.\n  In addition to determining who qualifies as a refugee, the Refugee \nAct allows the Department of Health and Human Services, through the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement [ORR], to provide services to refugees \nresettled in the United States. For example, ORR provides job training \nand employment assistance to new refugees to help them become \neconomically self-sufficient. ORR helps States provide English language \nclasses, preventive health services, and cash assistance to new \nrefugees to help them get on their feet in the United States. Refugees \noften arrive here terrified and with few possessions. Most have fled \npersecution in their home countries and left virtually all their \npossessions behind. These programs make a refugee's assimilation into \nthe United States a little easier.\n  In addition to providing assistance directly to refugees, the Refugee \nAct makes funds available to the Public Health Service to provide \noverseas medical screening for U.S.-bound refugees for the protection \nof public health against contagious diseases. ORR also provides \ntargeted assistance to States and counties with large refugee \npopulations and has matching grant programs for voluntary agencies to \nassist States in refugee resettlement. For example, the Boston Tech \nCenter in Massachusetts received $250,000 in discretionary targeted \nassistance to give refugees short-term skills training and teach basic \nEnglish and math. The International Rescue Committee in Boston received \nfunds under the Refugee Act to provide a youth program for newly \narrived Somali children.\n  The Refugee Act is the heart of our refugee law and policy. If it is \nnot re-authorized, the United States will send a signal worldwide that \nrefugees are no longer welcome here. We cannot let that happen. The act \ndeserves to be extended and I urge the Senate to approve this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1114) was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendments Nos. 1087, 1088, 1089\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Now, Mr. President, I have three amendments on behalf of \nMr. Wellstone which I am resubmitting for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes amendments numbered 1087, 1088, 1089.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I have an amendment for myself and Mr. \nBingaman and Mr. Kennedy regarding school testing. This has not been \nagreed to either.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the National Assessment Governing Board established under \n     section 412 of the National Education Statistics Act of 1994 \n     (20 U.S.C. 9011), using funds appropriated under section \n     413(c) of that Act (20 U.S.C. 9012(c)), shall formulate \n     policy guidelines for voluntary national tests of reading or \n     mathematics for which the Secretary of Education uses funds \n     appropriated to the Department of Education.\n       (b) In carrying out subsection (a), the National Assessment \n     Governing Board shall--\n       (1) develop test objectives and specifications; test \n     methodology; guidelines for test administration, including \n     guidelines for inclusion of, and accommodations for, students \n     with disabilities and students with limited English \n     proficiency; guidelines for reporting test results, including \n     the use of performance levels; and guidelines for test use;\n       (2) have final authority over the appropriateness of \n     cognitive items; and\n       (3) ensure that all items selected for use on the test are \n     free from racial, cultural, or gender bias.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the amendment being offered by Senator Harkin.\n  As I have said on the floor a number of times today and in the past, \nwe must not delay the time when every parent and teacher really knows \nhow each child is doing academically.\n  For that reason, I am proud to cosponsor the amendment, which \ntransfers oversight over the new tests to the independent and \nbipartisan National Assessment Governing Board.\n  This is an approach that I, having long worked with this Board \nthrough\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\nmy participation on the National Education Goals Panel, believe will \nensure that the new tests are fair, and independent of political \ninfluence.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, in accordance with the procedure, I ask the \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be set \naside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1116\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding Federal Pell \n                Grants and a child literacy initiative)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

110 Stat \n     2112) was to allow States to take into account the effects of \n     the epidemic of domestic violence in establishing their \n     welfare programs, by giving States the flexibility to grant \n     individual, temporary waivers for good cause to victims of \n     domestic violence who meet the criteria set forth in section \n     402(a)(7)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     602(a)(7)(B));\n       (2) the allowance of waivers under such sections was not \n     intended to be limited by other, separate, and independent \n     provisions of part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);\n       (3) under section 402(a)(7)(A)(iii) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     602(a)(7)(A)(iii)), requirements under the temporary \n     assistance for needy families program under part A of title \n     IV of such Act may, for good cause, be waived for so long as \n     necessary;

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and I ask \nit be read in its entirety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the concurrent \nresolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 51\n\n       Whereas the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong \n     Kong guarantees Hong Kong a high degree autonomy in all \n     matters except defense and foreign affairs, and an elected \n     legislature;\n       Whereas the United States policy regarding Hong Kong, as \n     stated in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 \n     (Public Law 102-383), is based on the autonomy and self-\n     governance of Hong Kong by the Hong Kong people;\n       Whereas a democratically elected legislature enabling the \n     Hong Kong people to elect representatives of their choice is \n     essential to the autonomy and self-governance of Hong Kong;\n       Whereas the provisional legislature of Hong Kong was \n     selected through an undemocratic process controlled by the \n     People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas this provisional legislature has adopted rules for \n     the creation of the first legislature of the Hong Kong \n     Special Administrative Region which rules are designed to \n     disadvantage and reduce the number of pro-democracy \n     politicians in the legislature; and\n       Whereas the autonomy of Hong Kong cannot exist without a \n     legislature that is elected freely and fairly according to \n     rules approved by the Hong Kong people or their \n     democratically elected representatives; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress urges Hong Kong Chief Executive \n     C.H. Tung and the government of the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region to schedule and conduct elections for \n     the first legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative \n     Region according to rules approved by the Hong Kong people \n     through an election-law convention, referendum, or both.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be appropriately referred.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I offered this resolution just now \nregarding Hong Kong, it occurred to me that it is a coincidence that \nHong Kong's Chief Executive, the Honorable C.H. Tung, is visiting in \nthe United States this week.\n  I confess the hope that he will get the message everywhere he goes on \nCapitol Hill, and everywhere else in Washington, that the provisional \nlegislature's attacks on civil liberties, which Mr. Tung has defended, \nalong with a new plan for an undemocratic legislature for Hong Kong, \nare totally unacceptable.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, I am grateful to the several cosponsors \nwho are joining in the offering of this resolution: Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nKerry of Massachusetts, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Mack of Florida.\n  Last July 1, when Hong Kong was returned to China, in accordance with \nthe terms of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, the joint \ndeclaration made absolutely clear that Hong Kong was to be autonomous \nand have an elected legislature, among many other things.\n  But, Mr. President, in the past few weeks, new rules for Hong Kong \nelections have been prepared that clearly violate the joint declaration \nand threaten to cause irreparable damage to Hong Kong's autonomy. New \nrules being prepared by the provisional legislature--a body that itself \nis a violation of the joint declaration because it is unelected, and \nthis provisional legislature, it will be remembered, is the body chosen \nlast December in a process tightly controlled by Beijing. Though the \npeople of Hong Kong had no say whatsoever, yet, it is this very \nprovisional legislature that is writing the rules for Hong Kong's \nelections.\n  Mr. President, this provisional legislature is now planning to adopt \nelection rules for a new body comprising 40 totally undemocratic seats. \nThirty of these seats will be ``functional constituency'' seats, as \nthey have been described. The functional constituencies allow small \nnumbers of trade, professional and other groups to choose a \nrepresentative. In many cases, these functional constituencies are \ntiny--about 1,000 members.\n  Britain introduced this system during its colonial rule, and it was a \nmistake. Britain's last governor, Chris Patten, attempted to improve \nupon the system by adding new, larger constituencies. Reportedly, even \nthese broader functional constituencies will be slashed, drastically \nreduced in terms of the number of voters. The functional constituencies \nbelong, as the Wall Street Journal stated, ``on the ash heap of \nhistory.'' Ten more seats will be chosen by an election committee \ncomprised of pro-Beijing groups.\n  Finally, the real motives of the provisional legislature can be \ndiscerned in their treatment of the 20 democratically elected seats. \nThese seats will be chosen according to a proportional representation \nscheme expressly designed to reduce the number of prodemocracy \ncandidates in the legislature.\n  Mr. President, this is by no means inadvertent. It is deliberate. It \nis a deliberate attempt to reduce the influence of the most popular and \nardently prodemocracy candidates and parties.\n  The resolution just offered urges C. H. Tung and the Government of \nHong Kong to schedule and conduct elections for the first legislature \nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region according to the rules \napproved by the Hong Kong people through an election law convention, \nreferendum, or both.\n  If the United States is to have a relationship with an autonomous \nHong Kong, Hong Kong must have the democratically elected legislature \nit was promised--it was promised, Mr. President--in the joint \ndeclaration. The provisional legislature, which the United States has \nrejected as illegitimate and unjustified, is simply not intended to \nproduce a legitimate electoral law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I yield back such time as I may \nhave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8919-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8919-S8924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, last week when I \nfiled this amendment regarding the application of the process of safety \nmanagement to distilleries, I started working with the Labor Department \nand particularly the OSHA division of the Department of Labor.\n  When PSM regulations were developed as part of the 1990 Clean Air Act \namendments, however, I don't believe these regulations were meant to \napply to the distilled spirits industry. Clearly, OSHA disagrees with \nmy position, but after discussing the issue with OSHA and Labor \nDepartment officials, I have decided to withdraw my amendment.\n  I want to clearly thank Secretary of Labor Herman for her \nleadership--and she exercised it very well--in finding a way to resolve \nthis issue. So, under the compromise we have reached today, the \nSecretary has agreed to make a review of the PSM's as it relates to \ndistilleries, a key part of OSHA's revision of the PSM contract. During \nthe review, OSHA has agreed not to cite the industry under this \nstandard.\n  I also want to commend the distilled spirits industry, whose \nexemplary record on safety helped make this compromise possible. It is \nmy hope that OSHA and the industry will put this temporary suspension \nto good use by working together to determine the extent to which PSM \nshould apply to this industry.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 1058) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  If I desire to introduce an amendment on behalf of Senator Gorton as \nthe prime sponsor, and myself as one of the cosponsors, is that in \norder at this point? It is an amendment on the Labor-Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is in order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not need unanimous consent? Is that what the Chair \nsaid?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1122\n\n   (Purpose: To provide certain education funding directly to local \n                         educational agencies)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an amendment with reference to \nthe appropriations bill on the Departments of Labor-Health and Human \nServices, and Education. I want to make sure that everybody understands \nthis is Senator Gorton's amendment. I am offering it on his behalf. I \nwould just like to make a couple statements before I send the amendment \nto the desk to become part of the itinerary of the Senate.\n  First, this amendment takes most of the education funds for \nkindergarten through 12th grade and creates a block grant to the local \nschools based on the number of school-aged children and the relative \nwealth of the States.\n  My purpose in doing this is to make sure that every child in the \nUnited States will graduate from high school with basic skills in \nreading and writing, mathematics, and the kind of skills that everybody \nknows we should have by the time we complete 12th grade.\n  I am firmly of the opinion that we have to try something new and \ndifferent. Our schools need to do things differently. We keep adding to \nthe inventory of programs, and we keep adding money to various \nprograms.\n  I join Senator Gorton in this amendment because I believe when the \nnumbers are all figured out, the schools will find out that they will \nreceive a very significant increase in money. This is not just an \nefficiency move, but it is to see if we can't give the States an \nopportunity to do things differently. Essentially, this is a way to \nhelp our schools, instead of having a one-shoe-fits-all approach.\n  We need to attempt to give the schools an opportunity to improve the \nquality of education by using this money to move decisionmakers closer \nto the schools. Schools need to come up with a master plan for \nimproving the basic skills that we require if we are going to be \ngraduating children from our high schools who can make it in this \neconomic environment.\n  This amendment provides a mechanism of giving slightly more money to \nthe poorer States which, in turn, would mean slightly less money to the \nmore wealthy States. However, everybody would get more money because \nyou would be eliminating all of the categorical bureaucracies that \nexist which are enormously expensive, both at the national level and to \nthe school districts who have to administer them. Local school \ndistricts across America, and our superintendents and our principals \nwould say, Let's see if we couldn't do better\n  The amendment would not affect Title VIII of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act; Individuals with\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\nDisabilities Education Act funds; Adult Education Act funds; Museum and \nLibrary Services Act funds; Departmental management expenses; \nEducational Research Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act \nfunds; or funds to carry out the National Education Statistics Act; to \ncarry out section 10501--funds for civic education--or 2102--Eisenhower \nProfessional Grants--and Park K--National Writing project--of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act;\n  By eliminating the Federal strings attached to the money, the Federal \nGovernment would be recognizing that one size does not fit all.\n  The amendment would allow State and local governments to design \nprograms that best meet the needs of the local schools.\n  The reason for this amendment is simple.\n  Our schools need to do things differently.\n  Too many kids are merely getting social promotions to keep them in a \nclass with their age group regardless of whether they have learned \ntheir lessons. It is a sad state when many of our graduates can't read \nthe diplomas they receive at graduation.\n  Too many schools don't teach the basics any more.\n  In ``Teaching the New Basic Skills'' by economists Frank Levy of MIT \nand Richard Murnane of Harvard, the authors argue that employers hire \ncollege graduates because they have little confidence that high school \ngraduates have mastered ninth grade level math; that is, the ability to \nmanipulate fractions and decimals and to interpret line and bar graphs.\n  They contend one of the reasons we are paying so much more for \ncollege graduates than we ever did before is because we are doing such \na poor job at the high school level.\n  The central educational task today is to do better teaching high \nschool students. That can't be done from Washington. To keep up, calls \nfor local decision making, not cumbersome programs developed in \nWashington.\n  Robert W. Galvin and Edward W. Bales of Motorola have written, ``The \nmajor issue . . . is that the education system is undergoing \nincremental change in an environment of exponential change.''\n  Americans spend a lot on education. Last year $550 billion a year in \ntotal private and public money was spent on education. This is more \nthan what was spent on defense and second only to health care in \ntapping American's pocketbook. Yet as defense firms have restructured, \nand health care providers have turned themselves upside down moving to \nHMO's, education experts start another school year excusing failure and \ndemanding more money.\n  Effective reform involves parents, teachers, and local businesses.\n  In New Mexico we need to train kids to work at Intel and other high \ntech firms. In Detroit, the schools need to prepare kids to work in \nauto plants. In recent studies it was found that only half of the kids \nhad the basic reading and math skills to get a job in an auto plant.\n  This amendment will give the control back to the local schools so \nthat they can use their Federal education funds to meet the local job \nmarket and better educate our kids. Local school districts are proving \nit can be done and this amendment will help others following in those \nsuccessful footsteps.\n  I hope my colleagues will support Senator Gorton's amendment.\n  I want everybody to understand that Senator Gorton did not include \nevery single kindergarten through twelth grade programs in this new \napproach to give our schools an opportunity to do things differently. \nThe amendment will not affect title VII of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act funds; the \nAdult Education Act funds; the Museum and Library Services Act funds; \ndepartmental management expenses; Educational Research Development, \nDissemination, and Improvement Act funds; funds to carry out the \nNational Education Statistics Act, to carry out section 10501; funds \nfor civic education; 2102 Eisenhower professional grants; or the Park \nK, the national writing project, of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Gorton, \n     for himself and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1122.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, after line 23, insert the following:\n       Sec.    . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of Education shall award the total amount of \n     funds described in subsection (b) directly to local \n     educational agencies in accordance with subsection (d) to \n     enable the local educational agencies to support programs or \n     activities for kindergarten through grade 12 students that \n     the local educational agencies deem appropriate.\n       (b) The total amount of funds referred to in subsection (a) \n     are all funds that are appropriated for the Department of \n     Education, the Department of Labor, and the Department of \n     Health and Human Services under this Act to support programs \n     or activities for kindergarten through grade 12 students, \n     other than--\n       (1) amounts appropriated under this Act--\n       (A) to carry out title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965;\n       (B) to carry out the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act;\n       (C) to carry out the Adult Education Act;\n       (D) to carry out the Museum and Library Services Act;\n       (E) for departmental management expenses of the Department \n     of Education; or\n       (F) to carry out the Educational Research, Development, \n     Dissemination, and Improvement Act;\n       (G) to carry out the National Education Statistics Act of \n     1994;\n       (H) to carry out section 10601 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (I) to carry out section 2102 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965; or\n       (J) to carry out part K of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965; or\n       (2) 50 percent of the amount appropriated under title III \n     under the headings ``Rehabilitation Services and Disability \n     Research'' and ``Vocational and Adult Education''.\n       (c) Each local educational agency shall conduct a census to \n     determine the number of kindergarten through grade 12 \n     students served by the local educational agency not later \n     than 21 days after the beginning of the school year. Each \n     local educational agency shall submit the number to the \n     Secretary.\n       (d) The Secretary shall determine the amount awarded to \n     each local educational agency under this section as follows:\n       (1) First, the Secretary, using the information provided \n     under subsection (c), shall determine a per child amount by \n     dividing the total amount of funds described in subsection \n     (b), by the total number of kindergarten through grade 12 \n     students in all States.\n       (e) Second, the Secretary, using the information provided \n     under subsection (c), shall determine the baseline amount for \n     each local educational agency by multiplying the per child \n     amount determined under paragraph (1) by the number of \n     kindergarten through grade 12 students that are served by the \n     local educational agency.\n       (3) Lastly, the Secretary shall compute the amount awarded \n     to each local educational agency as follows:\n       (A) Multiply the baseline amount determined under paragraph \n     (2) by a factor of 1.1 for local educational agencies serving \n     States that are in the least wealthy quintile of all States \n     as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the per capita \n     income of individuals in the States.\n       (B) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of 1.05 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     second least wealthy such quintile.\n       (C) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of 1.00 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     third least wealthy such quintile.\n       (D) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of .95 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     fourth least wealthy such quintile.\n       (E) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of .90 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     wealthiest such quintile.\n       (e) If the total amount of funds made available to carry \n     out this section is insufficient to pay in full all amounts \n     awarded under subsection (d), then the Secretary shall \n     ratably reduce each such amount.\n       (f) If the Secretary determines that a local educational \n     agency has knowingly submitted false information under \n     subsection (c) for the purpose of gaining additional funds \n     under this section, then the local educational agency shall \n     be fined an amount equal to twice the difference between the \n     amount the local educational agency received under subsection \n     (d), and the correct amount the local educational agency \n     would have received if the agency had submitted accurate \n     information under subsection (c).\n       (g) In this section--\n       (1) the term ``local educational agency'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Education; and\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\n       (3) the term ``State'' means each of the several States of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, \n     the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to thank profusely my friend from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, for his remarks and for introducing this \namendment on my behalf. I was able to get here just in time to second \nhis remarks.\n  I believe this amendment is going to give us an opportunity to debate \nan issue of great importance to the people of the United States with \nrespect to the education of their children.\n  More and more, our local school boards, our teachers, and our local \nschools are being suffocated by a tide of papers, forms, and programs, \neach of which have a good purpose, at least in theory, but the net \nresult of which is to make it difficult to set priorities in each of \nthe many varied school districts in the United States as to what will \nbest serve the students of those districts.\n  I am firmly of the belief, and I know my friend from New Mexico \nshares this belief with me, that elected school board members in cities \nand towns through the State of New Mexico, through the State of \nWashington, through the State of Colorado and all across the country, \nare dedicated to providing the best possible education for those \nschoolchildren that they possibly can and that they are better able to \nmake decisions about what is best for their students than our \nbureaucrats in the Department of Education in Washington, DC, or than \nare Members of Congress.\n  It is almost unspeakably arrogant of us here in this body that we set \ndetailed requirements for very specific education programs all across \nthe United States with the great variety of people, attitudes, and \nchallenges that we have.\n  So this amendment is designed to consolidate, for this year at least, \nthe great bulk of all of the dozens or more programs fitting in the \nnarrow categories going to school districts of the United States; to \nset up a reasonably fair formula which benefits the poorer States \nslightly more than it does the wealthy States, but with the exception \nof the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, Impact Aid, and a \nnumber of other very high profile programs; that each school district \nshould be allowed to take the money that we appropriate in this bill \nfor the education of our children from kindergarten through 12th grade, \nand each school district should set its own priorities for the spending \nof that money on that education, trusting they can do a better job than \nwe can or than the bureaucrats can.\n  Not the least of the benefits of an amendment of this sort, Mr. \nPresident, is the fact that we will not have to take 10 percent, 20 \npercent, or 30 percent off the top for administering the program, for \nfilling out the forms, for all of the activities which chew up money \nbut are not reflected in education at all.\n  Mr. President, I present this as a significant amendment to this \nbill. I hope for a significant debate on this issue here in this body. \nWe all, when we are at home, laud local control of our schools, with \nelected school board members and hands-on education, but all too much \nof the time we take exactly the opposite view in the programs we \nactually create and vote for here.\n  This amendment will be discussed at considerably greater length \ntomorrow by a wide variety of people. I cannot possibly express my \ndelight at having my friend from New Mexico as a cosponsor of this \namendment. I suspect, Mr. President, there will be a number of other \ncosponsors as we go through the debate on the amendment tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reviewed this in an effort to make a statement of \nintroduction today because you asked me to because you did not think \nyou could be here. I am very pleased you are. I think we ought to talk \nabout this exciting proposal from the standpoint of reality. The \nreality, to me, is that our schools need to do things differently, and \nwe are not doing things any differently here with our programs except \nfrom time to time adding a little money here and there. For the most \npart, we are stuck.\n  If there is a growing mediocrity--and I assume that is putting it \nmildly--we are probably part of it. We should not be talking just about \nsaving money or about giving schools more money without strings, but \nabout educating children better. I almost would call our approach \ngiving the schools an opportunity to get the basics done again.\n  I was part of the budget negotiations, and I am not changing that \nhere because I realize a certain amount of money has to go to \neducation, and I believe this bill honors that. That was one of the \ncategories where the President received his preference. This \namendment's approach to current education monies gives the schools the \nflexibility to try to do things differently. We are saying, let's look \nat our education situation because we are kind of stuck, and we want to \nget out of that rut.\n  Is that how you see our bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. Well, my friend, the Senator from New Mexico, whose views \nare so thoughtful and so carefully enunciated on a wide variety of \nsubjects, is, I am afraid, more eloquent on my own amendment than I am \nmyself.\n  Yes, I say to my friend from New Mexico, that is exactly what this is \nabout.\n  Earlier this year, during the course of the debate over the budget, \nthere was a request by the President that we increase the amount of \nmoney going to our common schools. That received wide support from both \nRepublicans and Democrats in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is entirely correct, there is nothing in \nthis bill except more money. There is nothing in this bill about a \ndifferent approach. There is nothing in this bill about getting more in \nthe way of a 21st century education for our children. It is just more \nof the same stuff we have already been doing.\n  I think I can say this amendment may, to a certain extent, be \nanalogous to the welfare reform bill that we passed more than a year \nago. What we decided then, I say to my friend from New Mexico, was that \nmaybe we did not know everything there was to know about welfare here \nin Washington, DC. Maybe there was not just one welfare system, to be \nrun out of Washington, DC, that was going to work. In fact, it worked \nso poorly that almost every condition it was designed to alleviate it \nmade worse.\n  What we did a year ago with welfare was to say we are not all that \nsmart. Governors and legislators of 50 States, you try it. We will give \nyou broad discretion in welfare programs. We suspect some of you will \ndo really well, but regrettably some of you will do not so well, but we \nwill learn more about what can get people back to work and out of a \nwelfare mentality.\n  Now, I think this amendment is a little bit like that, I say to my \nfriend. What we are doing here is something we do not like doing very \nmuch in the Senate, admitting that somebody else may know a little bit \nmore than we do about a subject. Here we are saying we think perhaps \nthat wisdom lies right down in individual school districts with \nteachers in the classroom, with principals in the schools, with school \nboard members who, almost without exception, are public-spirited \ncitizens who have run for election for a job that does not pay, but \nthat they know something maybe that we do not know, and if we give them \nmore freedom to use these billions of dollars we come up with, we will \nget better education for our kids.\n  That is, of course, the whole goal of the exercise.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I want to make this last point and see if you \nconcur. This is different from other efforts to encapsulate our Federal \nprograms into some kind of block grant, and for the most part that was \nalways to cut education. There is no effort to cut education here.\n  The major increases that are in this bill that are in response to the \nbudget agreement are all used in this fund--not a penny less--and it \nmay be much bigger when it reaches the districts. That money will \nincrease the level so nobody should think that Senators\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\nGorton and Domenici are for reducing the expenditure.\n\n  If we save administrative money, we want to spend it on the kids, and \nit ought to be a rather substantial amount of money.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico is, of course, entirely \ncorrect. The total amount of the appropriation in this bill for \neducation is not reduced by a single dollar.\n  On the other hand, the total amount of money that gets to the \nclassroom will be considerably greater because so much less will get \nlost in the gears of administration at two, three, or four different \nlevels between here and the classroom.\n  We hope that we will be able to get much more for the same amount of \nmoney fundamentally because we will actually be spending more on direct \neducational expenditures.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1076\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, while I have the floor I ask unanimous \nconsent to set the pending amendment aside and call up amendment No. \n1076.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1076.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1076, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify \namendment No. 1076, which I have sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 1076), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, after line 26, add the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, just a few weeks ago, Congress and the \nPresident agreed to provide $48 billion over the next 10 years as an \nincentive to States to provide health care coverage to uninsured, low-\nincome children. To receive this money, States must expand eligibility \nlevels to children living in families with incomes up to 200 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level.\n  Three years ago, Washington State decided to do what Congress and the \nPresident have now required other States to do. In 1994, my State \nexpanded children's health care coverage to children through age 18 who \nlive in families up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  Under the budget agreement, Washington State, like every other State \nwill receive an allotment, a portion of the money the Federal \nGovernment makes available for children's health care each year. The \nbudget agreement provides an ``enhanced Federal match'' to States to \nencourage them to raise eligibility levels. That incentive is available \nto States which cover kids at the current mandatory levels of 100 \npercent to 133 percent of poverty depending on the age group, if they \nexpand up to the new 200-percent-of-poverty threshold. However, for the \nfew States which already meet this requirement, these States must \nexpand their eligibility levels an additional 50 percentage points \nbefore being able to tap into the money available under the Children's \nHealth Initiative.\n  Unfortunately, the budget provisions essentially penalize Washington \nbecause of the State's progressive policies on children's health care. \nFirst, Washington and a few States which have done these broad \nexpansions, will essentially pay more than every other State to cover \nthis population of kids. Second, the budget agreement actually provides \nmore incentive to cover kids in families with higher discretionary \nincome than it does for children living in poorer families. In \nWashington 100,000 kids under 200 percent of poverty are still \nuninsured in spite of the success of enrolling kids over the last 3 \nyears, while somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000 kids between 200 and \n250 percent of poverty are uninsured. Clearly the need is at lower \nincome levels, I expect this holds true for most other States. Yet my \nState receives more Federal money to cover kids in this higher income \nbracket. Finally, the budget agreement provides no incentive to the \nState legislature to further expand coverage to kids. After all, \nWashington already did what Congress is now asking other States to do \nand instead of being recognized for doing a good job of covering kids, \nmy State is penalized. If I were a State legislator I would argue that \nwe should simply wait for the Feds to mandate further coverage for \nchildren, then we would receive the same contribution from the Federal \nGovernment as other States.\n  For example, Washington currently receives a 50-percent Federal match \nfor kids covered under Medicaid. Another State which also gets a 50-\npercent Federal match but has not already expanded eligibility levels \nfor kids, will receive an enhanced match as an incentive to cover this \nnew population. In a nonexpansion State for a child living in a family \nwith an income of 150 percent the State would receive an increased \nFederal match level. However, under the budget agreement in a State \nlike Washington, for that same child the State would only be reimbursed \nat the current rate. Even if the child is currently uninsured. \nProportionately more money will come out of Washington State revenues \nto cover kids below 200 percent of the poverty than in other States \nwhich have not expanded coverage to kids at this level. Thus taxpayers \nin my State will pay more to cover the same population of kids than \ntaxpayers in other States that did not choose to expand eligibility to \nkids before Congress did it for them.\n  The spirit of the legislation is to provide health insurance coverage \nfor uninsured, low-income children first. In Washington we have 100,000 \nkids that are uninsured below the 200 percent FPL threshold and only \n10,000 to 30,000 between 200 percent and 250 percent FPL. For States \nwith high eligibility thresholds, the Child Health Initiative provides \nmore incentive--a higher Federal match rate--to cover kids at higher \nincome levels than it does for kids living in families with lower \nincomes. With an enhanced match for new kids below 200 percent of FPL \nbrought into the State health program, the State can target a bigger \npool of low-income, uninsured kids, more expediently producing the \nresults intended by the legislation.\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\n  My amendment stays within the spirit of the Child Health Initiative, \nit focuses Federal money on providing health care coverage to new, \nuninsured children at low income levels first. It does not take money \nfrom any other State, but merely allows Washington to draw on its own \nallotment. Staff discussions with CBO and CRS confirm that the \namendment does not change the amount other States will receive. CRS is \nin the process of developing an official memo to that effect. A \nprogressive think tank, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also \nstates that the amendment would not alter State allocations. The \namendment allows States which have already expanded eligibility levels \nto 200 percent to receive an ``enhanced Federal match'' if it provides \nhealth care coverage to uninsured kids between the current mandatory \nlevels and the new level of 200 percent set in the budget agreement. \nAdditionally, my State would be required to maintain its current \neffort. Washington must spend the same amount on children's health care \nthat it does in fiscal year 1997, in subsequent years before it can \nreceive any money provided for under the Child Health Initiative.\n  The proposal does not take money from other States nor does it \nprovide additional Federal subsidies for children the State is now \ncovering, it simply allows Washington and the other few expansion \nStates to continue to do the good work they have already started.\n\n\n                       SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Senator Specter for his leadership and support in my recent \nefforts to provide full funding for the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act [IDEA].\n  For the past 2 years, one of my top priorities has been to ensure \nthat the Federal Government lives up to its promise to provide 40 \npercent of the funding for the costs of complying with Federal special \neducation mandates. The current level of 8 percent or 9 percent is \nunacceptable. In addition, I believe that it is important to secure \nincreased funding for IDEA to ease the burden on local schools and \ncommunities. For these reasons, I am grateful to Senator Specter for \nhelping us move closer to full funding to help these communities.\n  As a result of our combined efforts, in the fiscal year 1998 Labor-\nHHS appropriations bill, State grants for part B of IDEA are allocated \n$3.94 billion, which is a $834 million or 27 percent increase over last \nyear's funding level. As chairman of another appropriations \nsubcommittee, I know how difficult, if not virtually impossible, it is \nto provide such a significant increase to a large account. Thus, I \ntruly appreciate Senator Specter's efforts and leadership on this \nissue. I'm sure that the Nation's special education students and the \nlocal communities that educate them are equally as grateful to Senator \nSpecter for his support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8919-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

ROBERT C. KLOSTERMAN, U.S. NAVY, COMMANDING OFFICER, \n                       U.S.S. ``JOHN C. STENNIS''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding naval officer, Capt. Robert C. Klosterman, \nwho served with distinction for 41 months as commanding officer of the \nU.S.S. John C. Stennis nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, named for the \ngreat Senator from Mississippi. It is a privilege for me to recognize \nhis many outstanding achievements and commend him for the superb \nservice he has provided the Navy and our great Nation.\n  A native of Cincinnati, OH, Captain Klosterman graduated from the \nU.S. Naval Academy in 1969 and was designated a Naval Aviator in 1970 \nat NAS Kingsville, TX. He flew over 440 combat missions in Vietnam, \npiloting UH-1B gunships with Helicopter Attack (Light) Squadron 3. \nFollowing his service in Vietnam, Captain Klosterman returned as a \nflight instructor with VT-9 at Meridian, MS, where he served as \nDirector of Flight Training and Operations Officer through 1973.\n  Captain Klosterman's service at sea includes junior officer and \ndepartment head tours in VA-86 (U.S.S. Nimitz) and two instructor pilot \ntours in VA-174. He joined Attack Squadron 46 (VA-46) as executive \nofficer in June 1984 and took command in January 1986. During his tour, \nVA-46 participated in combat operations against Libya from U.S.S. \nAmerica, and was awarded the 1986 COMNAVAIRLAN Battle ``E.'' Captain \nKlosterman completed naval nuclear power training in 1988 and was \nexecutive officer of U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) from June \n1989 to April 1991. He is a veteran of Operations Desert Shield/Desert \nStorm, as well as Operations Restore Hope and Southern Watch.\n  During his naval career, Captain Klosterman has accumulated over \n5,800 flight hours and made over 1,000 carrier arrested landings. His \ndecorations include the Legion of Merit, 3 Meritorious Service Medals, \n15 Air Medals, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and the Combat Action \nRibbon. He was also the recipient of the 1986 COMLATWING ONE Pat \nAnderson Award for weapons delivery excellence.\n  As commanding officer of the U.S.S. John C. Stennis, he delivered to \nthe Nation and the U.S. Navy the most modern and technologically \nadvanced nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the world. He did this \nwhile realizing over $75 million in savings to the taxpayers, for which \nwe owe him a debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, Robert C. Klosterman, his wife Rebecca, and son Todd \nhave no doubt made many sacrifices during his 28-year naval career. \nThey have made significant contributions to the outstanding naval \nforces upon which our country relies so heavily. Captain Klosterman is \na great credit to both the Navy and the country he so proudly serves. \nAs this decorated combat veteran now departs the Navy, I call upon my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him fair winds and \nfollowing seas. He is a sailor's sailor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8924-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to establish a National Environmental Technology \nAchievement Award, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n      The National Environmental Technology Achievement Award Act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation to \nestablish a National Environmental Technology Achievement Award.\n  The annual award would be presented jointly by the EPA and the \nDepartment of Commerce to recognize our Nation's premier environmental \ntechnology advancement. Specifically, the award would recognize the \nmajor technological improvements in the prevention and cleanup of \nthreats to the Nation's air, land, and water resources. The yearly \nprize would include a financial award to be raised from the private \nsector.\n  In order to achieve our Nation's environmental protection goals in \nthe face of a growing population and expanding economy, we must develop \nmore efficient and effective technologies to reduce and cleanup \npollution, including advanced smokestack emission controls, improved \nwater treatment systems, and manufacturing processes which reduce \nwaste, just to name a few.\n  While the financial rewards for developing such technology are \npresumably large, a national award would provide additional incentive \nto innovators and would highlight the importance of such advancements \nto our Nation.\n  The bill would create a 14-member volunteer board to set the award \ncriteria; design the award; establish a monetary prize; raise funds; \ndevelop a consideration and selection process; and select the annual \nrecipient.\n  The board would be comprised of the Administrator of EPA, Secretary \nof Commerce, National Science Advisor, Director of the National Science \nFoundation, Secretary of the Interior, or their designees. In addition, \nthe panel would include three representatives from academia; three \nrepresentatives of industry; and three representatives from \nenvironmental and conservation organizations. One in each category \nwould be chosen by the President, one by the Speaker of the House and \none by the majority leader of the Senate.\n  The bill is supported by the Environmental Defense Fund, the National \nParks, and Conservation Association; the World Wildlife Fund and other \nenvironmental groups. I urge my colleagues to support this simple, but \nI believe appropriate and helpful, initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Burns, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Ford, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Helms, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerrey, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1153. A bill to promote food safety through continuation of the \nFood Animal Residue Avoidance Database program operated by the \nSecretary of Agriculture; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n\n\n                        FOOD SAFETY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation providing for the permanent authorization of the Food \nAnimal Residue Avoidance Databank [FARAD] program. I am joined by 15 of \nmy colleagues and I hope the Senate will pass this legislation very \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, food safety has long been of tantamount importance to \nthe veterinary profession and to the American consumer. Customers \nrightly expect that the food they purchase is of the highest quality. \nMore importantly, consumers must know that the food they consume is \nsafe. And our veterinarians work to help consumers in this endeavor. \nThis legislation is designed to help Americans maintain their safe, \nwholesome food supply.\n  In 1982, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Extension Service \nundertook an educational effort to prevent chemical residues in food \nanimal products. That same year, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection \nService [FSIS] sponsored a Residue Avoidance Program as a repository of \nresidue avoidance information and educational materials.\n  FARAD was founded as a cooperative, multi-State effort by Drs. \nStephen Sundlof of the University of Florida, Jim Riviere of North \nCarolina State University, Aurther Craigmiller of the University of \nCalifornia, Davis, and William Buck of the University of Illinois. Each \ninvestigator brought a unique expertise to the collaboration. Since \nthat origin, FARAD has evolved into an expert-mediated residue \navoidance decision support system which is crucial to food safety \nacross the Nation.\n  FARAD provides an invaluable service to the animal health profession, \nhelping veterinarians provide appropriate, science-based therapy--\nimproving animal health while preventing food safety risks to consumers \nfrom residues. FARAD's computer-based decision support system is \ndesigned to provide livestock producers, pharmacists, and extension \nspecialists with immediate access to practical information on drugs, \npesticides, and environmental contaminants which hold the greatest \npotential for residue formation in livestock food products.\n  Since its inception, FARAD has published three handbooks and two \npractical software products, while maintaining a telephone hotline and \nan internet access site--all devoted to providing the information \nnecessary to protect the livestock food system from contamination.\n  Through the USDA Extension Service, FARAD has received approximately \n$200,000 per year since its inception. These funds have been awarded on \nthe basis of competitive grants, relying\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\non matching funds from the participating universities. However, for the \nuniversities providing this valuable service the price has been too \nhigh. It is time to provide adequate Federal funding to accomplish this \nvital work.\n  FARAD provides a vital service across the country. Congress must now \nexpress its support for this tool which can help maintain the well-\nfounded confidence of the American consumers in their food supply.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis valuable legislation and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

COMPREHENSIVE FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME PREVENTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading known cause of \n     mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;\n       (2) each year, up to 12,000 infants are born in the United \n     States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering irreversible \n     physical and mental damage;\n       (3) thousands more infants are born each year with Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects, which are lesser, though still serious, \n     alcohol-related birth defects;\n       (4) children of women who use alcohol while pregnant have a \n     significantly higher infant mortality rate (13.3 per 1000) \n     than children of those women who do not use alcohol (8.6 per \n     1000);\n       (5) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects are \n     national problems which can impact any child, family, or \n     community, but their threat to American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives is especially alarming;\n       (6) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol \n     dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a \n     newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects are up to 30 times greater than national averages;\n       (7) in addition to the immeasurable toll on children and \n     their families, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects pose extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, \n     including the costs of health care, education, foster care, \n     job training, and general support services for affected \n     individuals;\n       (8) the total cost to the economy of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     was approximately $2,700,000,000 in 1995, and over a \n     lifetime, health care costs for one Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     child are estimated to be at least $1,400,000;\n       (9) researchers have determined that the possibility of \n     giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects increases in proportion to the amount and \n     frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that \n     stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy \n     reduces the emotional, physical, and mental consequences of \n     alcohol exposure to the baby; and\n       (10) though approximately 1 out of every 5 pregnant women \n     drink alcohol during their pregnancy, we know of no safe dose \n     of alcohol during pregnancy, or of any safe time to drink \n     during pregnancy, thus, it is in the best interest of the \n     Nation for the Federal Government to take an active role in \n     encouraging all women to abstain from alcohol consumption \n     during pregnancy.\n       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     establish, within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, a comprehensive program to help prevent Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects nationwide. Such \n     program shall--\n       (1) coordinate, support, and conduct basic and applied \n     epidemiologic research concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and \n     Fetal Alcohol Effects;\n       (2) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State, and \n     community-based public awareness, prevention, and education \n     programs on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects; \n     and\n       (3) foster coordination among all Federal agencies that \n     conduct or support Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects research, programs, and surveillance and otherwise \n     meet the general needs of populations actually or potentially \n     impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects.\n       (d) Establishment of Program.--Title III of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n          ``PART O--FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     ``SEC. 399G.

Mr. President, I heard some good words about a \nprovision of the tax bill from the folks back home during August \nrecess, and I want to pass on their comments.\n  The subject was income averaging for farmers. The tax bill restored \nthis important financial management tool. I commend Senator Shelby and \nSenator Burns for their fine leadership on this bill.\n  The American farmer is the most efficient food producer in the world. \nThe average farmer grows food and fiber for close to 130 people. The \npeople of the United States thus enjoy the most plentiful and \naffordable food supply in the world.\n  However, the American farmer faces numerous obstacles, from \nunpredictable weather to natural disasters, from outbreaks of insects \nand disease to excessive Government regulations.\n  As a farmer for more than 50 years, I know that there is one constant \nin farming, and that is unpredictability.\n  For many years, the American farmer was permitted to average his \nincome over a 2-year period, and this brought some predictability to \ntheir Federal income taxes. It meant that farmers were allowed to \nmoderate the tax effects of the natural boom and bust cycle that is so \nfamiliar to many farmers.\n  The 1986 Tax Reform Act, however, abolished income averaging for \nfarmers. The tax bill reduced the number of tax brackets and cut the \ntop rate to 28 percent. Of course, just 7 years later, the number of \nbrackets jumped and the top rate soared to 39.6 percent.\n  Further, the American farmer faced another major change, the 1996 \nfarm bill. The new farm bill abolished the traditional price deficiency \npayments--the price supports that guaranteed a certain farm income--and \nit set the farm programs on a market-oriented path.\n  The increased exposure of the farmer to the risks of the markets and \nthe risks of the elements, coupled with tax rates that approach 40 \npercent, underscore the need to restore income averaging.\n  It is difficult for the small farmer to create a farm business plan \nthat can anticipate the surges and dives in income that are part of \nfarm life. It is tough to plan for tax management due to the \nuncertainties of farm operations.\n  The farmer struggles to pay his bills, much less save, in a bad year, \nand he faces high tax rates in his good years. As a result, compared to \npeople who earn stable incomes, farmers pay taxes at a higher \ncumulative rate.\n  Mr. President, the farmer is the backbone of this Nation, and he \nkeeps us fed. He is essential to our Nation and to the health of rural \ncommunities.\n  The current Tax Code and regulatory requirements are burdens that \nplague North Carolina farmers and all American farmers and ranchers.\n  The Tax Code needs to reflect their contributions to our health and \nour balance of trade. This provision will be a real help for farmers \nand farm communities across this Nation. It will save American farmers \nmore than $150 million, and, more important, it will save some farms \nand the families who work them from financial ruin in the rough years \ninherent in agriculture.\n  That's good for farmers and good for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8932-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8932-S8933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING RICHARD B. McCALL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nremarkable public servant from my home State of Connecticut--Richard B. \nMcCall, who this past month left the Connecticut Department of Motor \nVehicles after 31 years of working as the head of its Handicapped \nDriver Training Program.\n  The Connecticut DMV's Handicapped Driver Training Program is the only \none in the country where a licensed state agency provides free driver \ntraining for the handicapped. It began in 1945, in order to meet the \nneeds of disabled World War II veterans, and for more than five decades \nthis program has helped handicapped residents of Connecticut to \nfunction as independent and productive members of society. No \nindividual is more closely linked to this program and its long-term \nsuccess than Dick McCall.\n  Since taking charge of the program in 1966, Mr. McCall has personally \nhelped to train more than 3,500 Connecticut residents with disabilities \nwho now hold driver's licenses. He made\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\nsure that anyone who wanted to drive would receive an evaluation and \nhave a fair chance to get a license.\n  Performing his duties required great diligence, patience, and \ncompassion. Mr. McCall would sometimes make as many as 50 trips to a \ntrainee's house, while preparing him or her for a test. In addition, he \nmade himself available to help his students at all times including \nnights and weekends.\n  Dick McCall's attitude toward his job has been described as a one-man \ncrusade to give people with disabilities an opportunity for equality \nand personal freedom. Mr. McCall recognized that the ability to drive \nbrings with it the dignity of having a job or just being able to drive \nto the supermarket, library, or church. Dick McCall felt that, short of \ncuring their disability, the greatest gift that he could give to these \npeople was mobility and independence, and he worked tirelessly to help \nas many people as was humanly possible.\n  While Dick McCall is ending his career with the DMV, he is by no \nmeans retiring from public service. He has taken a job with the Easter \nSeals, where he will continue working with people with disabilities.\n  Too often, the work of people like Dick McCall goes unnoticed by \nsociety at large. However, the thousands of people whose lives have \nbeen touched by Dick McCall recognize the sacrifices that he has made \nin his life, and his work has earned him the nickname ``Saint \nRichard.'' I would like to personally commend him for his ongoing \ncareer of public service. He is truly an inspiration to all those \npeople who have been fortunate enough to know him, and I wish him only \nthe best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8932-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          McCAIN-FEINGOLD CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my support \nfor the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform legislation currently \nbeing considered by the Congress.\n  I am cosponsoring the McCain-Feingold bill because I believe this \nCongress must address the issue of campaign finance reform. The \nAmerican public and the people in my State of North Dakota are \ndemanding that we clean up the system and that we clean it up now. Day \nafter day, they read another story in the newspaper about the ever-\nincreasing, and often unregulated, money flowing into campaigns, all \nthe while seeing a Congress that appears unable or unwilling to tackle \nthe problem. The time has come for us to do the job we were sent here \nto do and enact meaningful, comprehensive reform.\n  Mr. President, the current system of electing Members of Congress is \nbadly in need of reform. Elections are too long, too negative, and too \nexpensive. Voter participation continues to drop to new lows, and far \ntoo often, the bulk of the debate the American public sees takes place \nin 30-second attack ads. And the costs of running for office are \nexploding. The average Senate race in 1996 cost $3.6 million. Twenty \nyears ago, the average Senate race cost just $609,100. The cost of a \nrace for the House of Representatives has increased sixfold over the \nlast 20 years, from $99 million in 1976 to $626 million in 1996.\n  Spending on Federal election campaigns increased to an estimated $2.7 \nbillion in the most recent election cycle, a threefold increase over \ncampaign spending just 20 years ago, even after adjusting for \ninflation.\n  Even worse, the money is increasingly coming through channels \ndesigned to skirt the Federal Election Campaign Act. The use of soft \nmoney, which I call legalized cheating, has skyrocketed in the last 4 \nyears. In the 1995-96 cycle, the two major parties spent $263 million \nin soft money, compared with $81 million in the 1993-94 cycle. That's \nan increase of 224 percent.\n  Now, these contributions often come in very large amounts, and are \nclearly intended to have an impact on Federal elections even as they \nare designed to snake around the laws that are supposed to regulate \nFederal elections. So we have large chunks of money entering the system \nin ways that are largely unlimited, unregulated, and undisclosed. No \nwonder the American people think the system is broken.\n  Just as our campaign law has been stretched to the breaking point in \norder to push more money into the system, the protections in current \nlaw have recently been handed a severe blow by the Supreme Court. As a \nresult of a decision handed down last year, independent expenditures \nthat aren't really independent can be spent and have a dramatic impact \non elections without any notion of what the source of the money was.\n  These, and many other areas of campaign spending cry out for reform \nand this Congress must address it now.\n  McCain-Feingold is a strong step in the right direction, and I am \npleased to serve as a cosponsor of the legislation, consistent with the \nchanges the sponsors announced on May 22. It includes voluntary \nexpenditure limits, with a variety of carrots and sticks to encourage \ncandidates to comply. It tightens the definition of independent \nexpenditure in ways that will help make sure the expenditures truly are \nindependent. It will prohibit the national political parties from \nraising and spending soft money to influence Federal elections. And it \nmakes a strong first step toward controlling soft money spent by \noutside groups on so-called issue advocacy.\n\n  This last point is important, Mr. President, so I want to take a \nmoment to elaborate. As currently defined under FEC regulations, only \ncommunications which use such words as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' \n``support,'' ``defeat,'' ``reject,'' or ``Smith for Congress'' are \nconsidered express advocacy which must be paid for with money raised in \ncompliance with Federal election law, that is, hard money.\n  This overly narrow definition of what constitutes express advocacy \nhas created a giant loophole for attack ads. Simply by avoiding the \nmagic words I mentioned above, corporations, unions, and other special \ninterest groups can pay for brutal attack ads. Anyone who has seen some \nof these ads can tell they're intended to influence the outcome of \nFederal elections. And because they can be paid for with soft money, \ngroups can raise money for them without limits, buy them in the \nmillions of dollars, and never have to disclose what they're doing to \nthe FEC.\n  This is a critical part of the soft money puzzle, Mr. President, and \nMcCain-Feingold takes strong steps to remedy it. Far from limiting \ndiscussion of the issues as some of its critics would suggest, this \nprovision simply says that if an ad is meant to influence a Federal \nelection, it should be paid for with money raised under the purview of \nFederal election law. It's simple common sense, and it's a badly \nneeded, and long overdue, reform.\n  Now, I admit, there are several provisions in the McCain-Feingold \nbill that I would write differently and that I hope we might change \nalong the way. I'd like to add a provision that provides that the \nlowest television rate for political advertising will apply only to \ncommercials which are at least 1-minute in length and in which the \ncandidate appears 75 percent of the time. The 30-second political \nattack ad does little, if anything, to inform the public about the \nissues and advance the debate. And by appearing in the commercials, \ncandidates will be more accountable for the ads and will likely be more \nresponsible about their content. When selecting their leaders, the \nAmerican people deserve better than a ``hit and run'' debate.\n  I would also like to add provisions with greater inducements for \ncandidates to participate in the voluntary spending limit system, and \nwith greater penalties if they choose not to, in order to virtually \nrequire people to adopt the limits for their campaigns. I would like to \nencourage more participation in the process by ordinary citizens by \nrestoring an annual 100 percent tax credit for the first $100 of \ncontributions to congressional campaigns. And I would like to see some \nchanges in the provisions dealing with political action committees as \nwell.\n  But having said that, I think this is a worthy campaign finance \nreform proposal and I am going to fight hard for it. I want to get it \npassed, and get it signed by the President.

On \nSunday, September\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\n26, 1993, less than 2 weeks after the signing of the Oslo accords, I \naddressed a public forum in New York City with Israeli Foreign Minister \nShimon Peres and declared, inter alia:\n\n       And now, the Palestinian leaders have said, we will--at \n     long last--beat our swords into plowshares. We will yield up \n     Kalishnikovs and Katyushas to concentrate on the arts of \n     accounting, civil administration, health care and \n     construction. Now if any nation on Earth has a right to say \n     ``no'' it was Israel. But Israel said ``yes,'' declaring, in \n     the moving words of Prime Minister Rabin: ``Enough!'' We are \n     willing to take this chance. To see your words converted to \n     deeds. The Knesset has voted after a vigorous and thoughtful \n     debate. The bedrock of the United States-Israeli friendship \n     is our deep respect for Israeli democracy. The democracy has \n     spoken and will have our support as it always has.\n\n  The question of what response the Congress takes toward aid to the \nPalestinian Authority should reflect first and foremost the results of \ncareful consultation with the Government of Israel. The Israeli \nGovernment has taken appropriate and firm measures in response to this \nlatest atrocity. We must support them and let Chairman Arafat know that \neven the perception of his supporting terror is unacceptable to the \nAmerican people, much less the thinly veiled utilization of terror as \ndiplomacy by other means.\n  May I also commend to the Members of the Senate a thoughtful \nresolution from the leadership of the Union of Orthodox Jewish \nCongregations which addresses the issues raised by the bombing in \nJerusalem. I ask that the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The resolution follows:\n\nOrthodox Union Resolution on the Jerusalem Bombing of September 4, 1997\n\n       The Union of Orthodox Congregations of America, \n     representing nearly 1,000 Orthodox Jewish synagogues \n     nationwide, expresses its outrage at the deadly terrorist \n     attack perpetrated this morning by suicide bombers in \n     Jerusalem. Again, acts of terrorism and murder against \n     innocent civilians in Jerusalem streets have been committed \n     including the wounding of American youth studying in Israel. \n     This latest atrocity once again makes a mockery of the \n     Palestinian Authority's solemn commitments to fight the \n     terrorist organizations, their infrastructure and prevent \n     violence and incitement to terror, the condition upon which \n     the late Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin and Israeli Knesset \n     agreed to the Oslo process. Arafat's embrace of Hamas, the \n     release from prison of Hamas terrorists, and the incendiary \n     statements made by Arafat and other Palestinian officials \n     have given the terrorist organizations a virtual green light \n     for terror operations in Israel. Ironically, the Palestinian \n     Authority dares to use this failure to combat terrorism as a \n     means of pressuring Israel into making concessions, a tactic \n     which completely negates the peace negotiations. The hope for \n     success of any peace negotiations in the continuing \n     atmosphere of terrorism, death and ongoing calls for Jihad, \n     is dramatically and sadly diminished. The recent New York \n     Times photo of Mr. Arafat embracing Hamas leaders is not an \n     isolated instance but illustrative of an apparent agreement \n     between Hamas and the PA to countenance terrorism provided it \n     did not emanate from areas controlled by the PA. In essence, \n     the Hamas is acting as an adjunct of the PLO, clearly \n     demonstrating that Mr. Arafat views terror as an instrument \n     of diplomacy.\n       The Orthodox Union has long been on record calling for \n     suspension of any United States and European aid to the \n     Palestinian Authority unless they comply with the agreements \n     they signed. Those who sanction mass murder do not deserve \n     the support of civilized nations. The Orthodox Union urges \n     Congress to continue suspending U.S. aid to the Palestinian \n     Authority in light of the PA's continuing refusal to disarm \n     or outlaw terrorist groups, its refusal to extradite \n     terrorists to Israel and Arafat's continued speeches praising \n     the murderers of Jews as ``heroes and martyrs''. Chairman \n     Arafat has to learn once and for all that terror and violence \n     are the antithesis of peace. Words are not enough. The \n     American administration must take concrete measures in order \n     to ensure that Mr. Arafat shuts down the terrorist mechanism \n     that operate to threaten Israel.\n       Israel's first responsibility is to the safety and security \n     of its people. Israel cannot move forward in the peace \n     process unless the threat of terror and violence that is part \n     and parcel of the Palestinian policy is permanently \n     eradicated.\n       The Orthodox Union grieves with the families of the \n     murdered victims of this horrendous, senseless attack. May \n     they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and \n     Jerusalem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8933-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF HENRY FORD COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR 60 YEARS OF SERVICE \n                            TO THE COMMUNITY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to the 60th anniversary of an important educational \ninstitution in Michigan. On October 10, 1997, Henry Ford Community \nCollege will dedicate a new Learning Resource Center and kick off a \nyear of special events to celebrate its six decades of providing \neducational opportunities to the people of Michigan.\n  Henry Ford Community College, which is located in Ford Motor Co.'s \nhometown of Dearborn, first opened its doors in 1938 as Fordson Junior \nCollege with 200 students. Today, approximately 20,000 students attend \nclasses at HFCC's 75-acre main campus and its auxiliary learning center \nin Dearborn Heights. Many transfer to 4-year institutions after \ncompleting 1 or 2 years at HFCC. Others are enrolled in two-year \nassociate degree programs in arts, science, or business. Still others \nare enrolled in non-credit or continuing education courses, seeking to \nupgrade their job skills to remain competitive in the marketplace.\n  I know that the administrators and instructors at Henry Ford \nCommunity College are proud of their reputation for turning out \ngraduates who are well prepared to enter the work force. In fact, HFCC \nbelieves that this is so central to its mission that it offers up to 16 \nhours of free additional workplace training to any graduate whose \nentry-level technical job skills are deemed to be lacking by an \nemployer. HFCC's Office of Corporate Training works with area \nbusinesses and manufacturers to design training programs for their \nemployees, which are held either at HFCC or on the job site. HFCC also \noffers skilled trade and special job training programs designed to help \nlaid off workers return to the work force more quickly.\n  While preparing students for additional education and the workplace \nare the central goals of Henry Ford Community College, it is also \ndeeply involved in the cultural life of the community. HFCC's cultural \nactivities program provides lectures, performances, and films for the \ngeneral public. They also sponsor the Enrichment for Young People \nprogram, which gives young students the opportunity to take classes in \nart, theater, and music. Senior citizens are welcomed at the annual \nSenior Citizens Day on campus, and they may take classes free of charge \nyear round. Concerts, plays, art exhibits, and other performances are \noffered throughout the year, and are open to the public.\n  For 60 years, Henry Ford Community College has been an integral part \nof the educational and cultural fabric of metropolitan Detroit. This \nvibrant institution has helped tens of thousands of people to realize \ntheir dreams, whether to upgrade professional skills, attain a degree, \nor simply learn something new about an interesting subject. Mr. \nPresident, I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in extending \ncongratulations to the men and women of Henry Ford Community College on \nthe occasion of its 60th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8934-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8934-S8935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CELEBRATING DURHAM MANU-FACTURING'S 75TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to commemorate the 75th \nbirthday of one of the oldest and most respected companies in my home \nState--the Durham Manufacturing Co. of Durham, CT. Few companies ever \nenjoy such long-term success, but Durham Manufacturing has been able to \nthrive for so many years because it is committed not only to \nmanufacturing excellence, but also to its workers and to its \nsurrounding community.\n  The Durham Manufacturing Co. was founded after a fire destroyed the \nfactory for Merriman Manufacturing Co., which had been Durham's largest \nemployer for decades. The residents of Durham were determined to keep \ntheir community together, and in 1922, the Durham Manufacturing Co. \nbegan operations out of a wooden barn. Durham Manufacturing specialized \nin the manufacture of tin-coated iron cash boxes and cash boxes with a \nhandle and combination lock which were used to store insurance \npolicies.\n  During World War II, Durham Manufacturing adapted its production to \nmeet the needs created by the war and became the leading supplier of \nfirst aid boxes to the Armed Forces. After the war, Durham saw many of \nits Government contracts expire, and unfortunately, in 1947, the wooden \nfactory was destroyed by fire.\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\n  While many companies would have folded up their tents under such \nadversity, there was never any doubt that the Durham Manufacturing Co. \nwould continue. After the fire, the company took on a new direction as \nits focus shifted from custom contract work to developing proprietary \nproduct lines, which have evolved into their current product lines of \nfirst aid boxes, storage cabinets and bins, and office products. Today, \ntheir products are used throughout North America and Europe, and this \ncompany, which began operating out of a wooden barn, now has its own \nsite on the World Wide Web. Clearly, the future of Durham Manufacturing \nappears even more promising than its past.\n  It is only appropriate that Durham Manufacturing's current factory is \nlocated on Main Street, because theirs is an All-American success \nstory. But while there is a Main Street in most every town in the \ncountry, companies like Durham Manufacturing have become all too rare--\na business where generations of family members have worked to build not \nonly a profitable company, but a prosperous community, as well. \nCompanies like Durham Manufacturing represent the backbone of small \ncities all around this country, and it is important that we recognize \nand celebrate their longevity.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate the Durham Manufacturing Co. on \nthe occasion of their 75th birthday, and I wish many more years of \ncontinued prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8934-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Tomorrow the Senate will immediately resume consideration \nthen of S. 1061, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. As Members are \naware, under the order, all amendments had to be offered today in order \nto be considered as part of this legislation. Therefore, the Senate \nwill continue debating amendments in order throughout Tuesday's session \nof the Senate. It is hoped that all debate and votes on amendments to \nS. 1061 can be completed on Tuesday. The next rollcall votes will occur \nbeginning at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday. In addition, the Senate will recess, \nas I got permission just a moment ago, between 12:30 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. \nfor the weekly luncheons to meet. As indicated earlier, it is hoped \nthat the Senate can complete this work on the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill. We will then go to the FDA reform legislation, and our intent is \nto complete that work this week also. Once we have completed the \nappropriations bill that we have approval for here, plus the FDA, then \nwe would go to the Interior appropriations bill.\n  Members can anticipate votes throughout the day each day of this \nweek, including Friday as it now stands. And, also, depending on what \nhappens with regard to committee meetings, we may have to go into the \nnight. I hope that is not necessary. I think it is better for us to do \nour work in the daylight, and I will do everything to try to make sure \nthat happens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/08/senate-section/article/S8935-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
