Mr. President, 161 years ago yesterday, 54 delegates \nof the Convention of 1836 signed the Texas declaration of independence \nat the village of Washington-on-the-Brazos, which is near Houston, TX. \nEach of the settlements of Texas were represented. Texas was, at the \ntime, a territory of Mexico. The delegates hurriedly wrote and adopted \nthe declaration of independence, prepared a constitution for the newly \nformed Republic of Texas and organized an interim government.\n  Mr. President, my great-great-grandfather was one of the signers of \nthe Texas Declaration of Independence. His law partner, Thomas \nJefferson Rusk, was also one of the heroes of Texas' quest for \nindependence. Thomas Rusk also went on to serve as a Senator from \nTexas, and was the first Senator to hold my Senate seat.\n  So I have grown up knowing much about Texas history since its days as \na territory of Mexico. In fact, my great-great-grandfather was the \n``alcalde,'' which was the mayor of the territory for the country of \nMexico. Then, he, Thomas Rusk and Sam Houston, all hailing from \nNacogdoches, TX, where my mother grew up, were leaders in the effort to \nwrest their independence from Mexico and for Texas to be able to set up \nits own government.\n  I am proud, Mr. President, that Texas is the only State in America \nthat was once an independent nation and, in fact, we were a republic \nfor 9 years before becoming a State. So we like to recall the history \nof our independence, just as we do our history of American \nindependence, every year. Yesterday in Texas we celebrated our Texas \nIndependence Day.\n  We commemorate the time that we became a nation, and we remember the \nbrave and wonderful people, not only those who signed the declaration \nof independence that day, but those who were at the same time girding \nfor war\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nat the Alamo several hundred miles away. Former Texas Senator John \nTower began a tradition among Texas Senators. Senator Tower would read \nWilliam Barret Travis' letter from the Alamo. As I alluded to a moment \nago, as they were declaring independence at Washington-on-the-Brazos in \n1836, 6,000 Mexican troops were marching to the Alamo. They were \nmarching to the Alamo to take on soldiers who had come from many \nStates--Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, \nand so on--to help defend Texas in its stand against the Mexican Army \nat the Alamo.\n  The declaration of independence said:\n\n       . . . We, therefore . . . do hereby resolve and declare \n     that our political connection with the Mexican Nation has \n     forever ended, and that the people of Texas do now constitute \n     a free, sovereign and independent republic . . .\n\n  Several days earlier, William Barret Travis had written from the \nAlamo his famous letter to the people of Texas and to all Americans. He \nknew that the Mexican Army was coming, and he knew that they had few \npeople to help them defend the Alamo. Here is the letter by Colonel \nTravis:\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged, by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken--I have answered the demands with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     wall--I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you \n     in the name of liberty, or patriotism and of everything \n     dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with \n     all dispatch--The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily \n     and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in \n     four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am \n     determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die \n     like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own \n     honor and that of his country--Victory or Death.\n                                  William Barret Travis, Lt. Col.,\n                                                        Commander.\n       P.S. The Lord is on our side--when the enemy appeared in \n     sight we had not three bushels of corn--we have since found \n     in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20 \n     or 30 heads of beeves.\n\n  Despite that declaration, Mr. President, we did not win independence \nfrom Mexico at the Alamo. In the battle of the Alamo, known as the ``13 \nDays of Glory,'' 184 brave men died fending off Santa Anna's huge army. \nBut the Alamo was crucial. It gave time to Gen. Sam Houston, who was \nthe commander in chief of our Armed Forces, to get more volunteers and \nto decide when to take on this vast Mexican Army again. And because \nthose brave men at the Alamo held out for so long, Houston had time to \nmuster his forces. Gen. Sam Houston was wounded in the battle, but was \nable to take the surrender of General Santa Anna. Texas won her freedom \non April 21, 1836.\n  San Jacinto is near Houston, and home to the battle we commemorate as \nthe ``Great Battle of Freedom.''\n  So, Mr. President, I like to recall this time because it is an \nimportant time in the history of America as well as in the history of \nTexas. Our independent nation lasted for 9 years; for 9 years we \nbrought our State together to prepare it for admission into the United \nStates of America.\n  In fact, the debate recorded in the Congressional Record on whether \nTexas would become a State was very interesting.\n  Texas would join the Union if several conditions were met. Those \nconditions were outlined in a treaty. In the treaty, Texas was able to \nkeep certain rights when she joined the Union--rights to her tidelands, \nrights to her public lands, which is why much of our public land is \nState owned rather than federally owned. This is why we have some \ndifferent issues in Texas. We were able to control the tidelands \nbecause that was part of the treaty. We also had the right to turn into \nfive States if the State of Texas decided to break away from the Union. \nNow, that causes a little concern here on Capitol Hill when they think \nof having the possibility of 10 Senators from Texas instead of 2. There \nare a few cold stares when that is brought up. But I must say that was \nall part of the treaty.\n  The treaty did not pass because supporters couldn't muster the two-\nthirds vote necessary to ratify it. So President John Tyler introduced \na bill to annex Texas as a State. Texas became a State because of a \nbill, not a treaty. The interesting thing was that the bill passed by \nonly one vote in each House of Congress. Any of those who think it \nmight have been a mistake to annex Texas almost won a victory. We did \nhave a long, hard-fought battle before we joined the Union. One of the \nannexation proposal's most vocal opponents at the time was President \nJohn Quincy Adams, who had returned to Congress by that time. He spoke \nevery day on the floor against the annexation of Texas. The reason he \nwas so far out on the limb against Texas is because he was afraid Texas \nwould become another slave State. He did not want to disrupt the \nbalance that existed in the United States of America at the time. Once \nwe did become a State, I think we began a tradition of great \ncontributions to the United States. And, of course, just recently we \nhave become the second largest State in America--second to California, \novertaking New York State.\n  So that is a little bit of Texas history, which I am always glad to \nrecall on Texas Independence Day. I like to read the letter from \nWilliam Barret Travis to remind you of the pride Texans share for their \nindependence from Mexico and their membership today in the United \nStates of America. We are proud that we were an independent nation for \n9 years and then took our rightful place in the United States of \nAmerica. I hope that people feel that we have earned the right to be \nproud of that, and also hope that people feel that Texas has done her \npart as a State.\n  We are proud of our heritage. We are proud of our history. And most \nof all, today, I want to pay tribute to the brave men who died at the \nAlamo and the brave men, numbering among them the first Senator to hold \nmy Senate seat, the first Senator to hold the other Texas Senate seat, \nGen. Sam Houston, and my own great-great-grandfather who signed the \nDeclaration of Independence and later became the chief justice of \nNacogdoches County.\n  These were brave men who forged a new nation at great cost. They went \nthrough many of the same things that our forebears in the United States \nof America did in wresting our independence from England. So I am proud \nof that. I am proud of the patriots who gave their lives for our \nfreedom or who risked their lives for our freedom. I want to pay \ntribute to them today, and I will do so every year that I am able to \nserve as a Senator from the great State of Texas.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota [Mr. Johnson], is recognized to speak for up to 15 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1807-7", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1808-S1809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, a version of a balanced budget amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution currently pending before the Senate.\n  Throughout the more than 10 years that I have had the honor and \nopportunity to represent the people of South Dakota as a Congressman \nand now as a U.S. Senator, I have consistently supported a policy of \nfiscal prudence and restraint. I have supported, among other \ninitiatives, a line-item veto and enhanced line-item rescission, the \n1990 budget agreement initiated by President Bush and the 1993 budget \nagreement initiated by President Clinton. The latter two budget \nagreements having played a very significant role in capping \ndiscretionary spending, placing our Government on a must-pay-as-you-go \nbasis and contributing to over a 60-percent reduction in the annual \nFederal budget deficit. I am pleased that these and other efforts taken \nby the Clinton administration, though almost universally opposed by the \nRepublican congressional caucuses have led to economic growth, \nprosperity, and now a deficit that is smaller relative to our economy \nthan in any industrial nation on Earth. Even so, we have farther to go \nto bring our Federal expenditures and revenue into greater equilibrium. \nTo that end, I have also voted in favor of various balanced budget \namendments while serving in the other body.\n  I do not take the amendment of our Nation's Constitution lightly. I \nam mindful that this is the legislative body that served as the forum \nfor Clay and for Webster and many other great names of American \nhistory. Unlike ordinary legislation, a constitutional\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\namendment cannot be easily changed if it proves faulty--it must be \ncrafted in such a manner that serves the interests of our Nation not \nonly now, but for 200 years and more from now. We must of necessity \napproach such a difficult task--that of drafting a constitutional \namendment for the ages--with some humility and with a full recognition \nof the great care that is required if future generations are to look to \nour deliberations with the same respect that we today hold for the \nFounders of our Republic.\n  Over the past 4 years, we, and in particular the Clinton \nadministration, have taken an exploding deficit that had reached nearly \n$300 billion annually and a cumulative national debt that had \nquadrupled on the watch of Presidents Reagan and Bush, and cut that \nannual deficit by over 60 percent. Yet, despite this progress, I began \nmy service in the Senate at the commencement of the 105th Congress with \nthe assumption that I would cast a vote in favor of a constitutional \namendment drafted in much the manner that Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nappears before us today. However, the findings of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service later substantiated by an analysis of \nthe Office of Management and Budget and the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities have cast such grave doubts about the wisdom of Senate Joint \nResolution 1 as it is currently drafted, that I cannot cast a vote for \nan unamended version with the confidence I need to have that it truly \nwill achieve the goals its advocates claim.\n  The CRS report makes it clear that Senate Joint Resolution 1 would \nprohibit the Federal Government from conducting its financial affairs \nin the same prudent manner that every South Dakota family attempts to \nachieve. It would effectively prevent the Federal Government from \nsetting aside cash reserves in good times in order to have them \navailable in times of crisis--a policy that flies in the face of common \nsense and one that certainly should not be imposed on all future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  While the Social Security trust fund is the source of the greatest \nattention in this debate, and that is understandable since Senate Joint \nResolution 1 would convert the Federal Government's largest effort to \nset aside resources for a future generation into a virtual fraud on the \ntaxpayers, the implications of denying the Federal Government the \nability to raise funds now for future needs goes far beyond damage to \nSocial Security. Such a provision diminishes the usefulness of all our \ntrust funds, especially those that have been designed to gain revenue \nduring good times and to be available to fall back on during bad times. \nIt makes any realistic effort to set aside funds now to be available \nfor a future countercyclical economic strategy much more difficult--a \ncriticism that has been the chief reason why Republican economic \nexperts such as Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 11 \nNobel laureate economists, and even the conservative Wall Street \nJournal have condemned Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  While a few Members of this body may attempt to lecture me about what \npledges I have made to the people of South Dakota during the past \ncampaign, I will refrain from attempting to impugn their motives or to \nengage in self-righteous assertions about their responsibilities to \ntheir constituents or to their oath of office.\n  I have pledged to the people of South Dakota that I would support a \nbalanced budget and that I would vote for a balanced budget amendment--\none that works--one that would help achieve the goal of balancing the \nFederal budget without destroying Social Security or otherwise placing \nour Nation's economic growth and prosperity at great risk. What \narrogance for anyone to suggest on this floor that a vote for any \nproposed amendment other than Senate Joint Resolution 1 constitutes a \nbreach of honor.\n  I have voted, and it is duly recorded in the Senate Journal, for a \nbalanced budget amendment and for modifications to Senate Joint \nResolution 1 which would promote a balanced budget without the \ndisastrous flaws of Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  I am a fourth generation South Dakotan. My family homesteaded in our \nState and I'm proud that my children now represent the fifth \nconsecutive generation of our family to claim Clay County, SD as home. \nWith that background, I have a profound appreciation for the concerns \nand more importantly the values of the citizens of my State. During \nthis past campaign I pledged to them the most important pledge of all--\nthat I would exercise my best judgment and greatest care in casting my \nvote in the Senate and that in doing so, I would ignore the immediate \nwinds of political pressure and cast my votes in a manner consistent \nwith the long-term needs of our State and Nation.\n  There is no doubt that the easy thing for me to do would be to \ncapitulate to the current political pressures ginned up and funded by \nthe special interests promoting exclusively Senate Joint Resolution 1. \nThat would be the path of least resistance, and, clearly, the negative \nimpact of that particular version of balanced budget amendment would \nnot be felt until after my next election where I too choose to run for \nanother term in this body.\n  It would take, frankly, several years to ratify any amendment and \nsome years beyond that before the public would fully recognize the \nenormous wrong this body would have done to the Constitution. But I \ntold my constituents that I would do the right thing, not the \npolitically expedient thing. While I respect the integrity of \neveryone's professed views, as I look about this Chamber, I have to \nwonder if there would in fact be a close vote on Senate Joint \nResolution 1 if the ballot were secret, and intellect and conscience \nthe only driving forces in this debate.\n  Mr. President, when this debate concludes tomorrow, I will have the \nsatisfaction of knowing that I have honorably lived up to my pledges to \nthe people of South Dakota and to my sacred responsibilities to this \nNation and to the U.S. Senate. To cast a vote for this specific version \nof a balanced budget amendment knowing what I know today, would \nconstitute a betrayal of the people of my State, and inasmuch as I am a \nU.S. Senator, it would be a betrayal of my commitment and my love for \nour Nation--that I will not and cannot do.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1808-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1809-S1810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, last month, the Secretary of Agriculture \nannounced the new rules and regulations on the Conservation Reserve \nProgram in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We find that we are \nstarting to take a program that has been claimed as one of the great \nsuccess programs, as far as soil conservation, watershed management, \nwildlife habitat, in our respective States. There is no doubt about it, \nthat we have land that was taken out of production that was marginal \nland, should never have been in row crop or crop production, should \nhave been grass all those years, and we have noticed an increase, a \nnotable increase in upland bird populations, also in white tail deer \nand other wildlife that depend on a habitat that the CRP would afford.\n  There has been a rule change, however. This was brought to our \nattention by our good friends and neighbors who are living and working \non the grain farms of Montana, and especially in eastern Montana. The \nannouncement by U.S. Department of Agriculture to start a sign up for \nan extension, or increased acreage received into the program going up \nto 220 million acres across this country. Now, it would look like the \nacreage is capped around 36.4 million acres, but there have been new \nrules made on about half of American cropland making it now eligible \nfor CRP. It was brought up in this new announcement and the timing is \nflawed.\n  The new rules give the worst lands the lowest rate, the best lands \nthe highest rate. So right now we have figures coming in from the \ndifferent counties and it could be on dirt farms as low as $17 an acre. \nWhat happens when you get a bid to take lands out of production at $17 \nan acre--I do not care what you do on that land, it will produce more \nthan $17 an acre. So, what is happening is that the good land is going \ninto the CRP--in other words, taken out of production--and we will farm \nour worst land, having the exact\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\nopposite effect that was desired in the first place.\n  The process is a burden to participants if you have between now and \nthis month of March to sign up. Just think, that has to go to the local \nlevel, whenever you make those arrangements, that application for CRP. \nIt goes from the local board to the State board to the Federal board \nbefore it is approved back to the farmer. The farmer does not know what \nhe will be planting or harvesting this year.\n  It could be June or July. In fact, the president of the National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, Philip McClain, testified before the \nHouse Forestry Resource and Conservation and Research Subcommittee and \nexpressed his concern that the USDA will not decide which offers being \nmade by the growers during that March CRP signup will be accepted into \nmost areas until June. Now, if it is July in our country--in other \nwords, the winter wheat people are really put at a disadvantage if you \nare in the southern climes. In the northern climes, it is too late to \nplant a spring crop. The delayed signup really puts a hardship on wheat \ngrowers, no matter in which part of the country you farm--whether it's \nTexas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, or going on north to the Canadian \nborder.\n  So the National Association of Wheat Growers, all at once over the \nweekend, has said, wait a minute here, we need immediate congressional \naction, maybe to recommend that we extend the present contracts, which \nexpire this fall and which qualify for participation under the current \neligibility criteria. I think that is a good recommendation. Even the \nUSDA State staff feels that the problems that are associated with this \nprogram make a mockery of the intent of the program. It does not \nprovide the original intent of why CRP was put in in the first place.\n  So I recommend to the Department of Agriculture--and they have time, \nI think, to look at this, and, if not, I think Congress should take a \nvery serious look at it, because it is just not fair if you have a \nprogram that will work exactly the opposite from what was intended and \nput all the grain producers at a disadvantage. I suggest that the \nSecretary extend the current program for 1 year. Let's give it some \ntime and take a look at it and try to get the desired results and \nrewrite the rules to reflect the intent of the program. The intent of \nthe program was to take marginal land out of production so that we can \nmanage watershed, we can manage soil erosion, we can manage wetlands, \npotholes, all of the environmental concerns that this country has. We \ncan take a look at this, given more time to do it. Of course, these \nrecommendations are supported by the National Association of Wheat \nGrowers.\n  So with this in mind, with the good record of CRP, a program that has \nbeen highly successful in doing two things that were most desired in \nrural America, I think it is only right to extend those rules through \nthe program this year. Let's look at it, and this time we might be able \nto get it right. Right now, we are extending some programs that would \nsuggest exactly the opposite.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1809-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today there will be legislation that will \nbe introduced in the Congress having to do with estate taxes. I know \nestate taxes and capital gains are viewed by many as tax relief for the \nrich. Last week, a week ago today, I was watching a television program \nand there was a financial organization, or a mutual fund, who had \ndeclared that they had been so successful that they have to declare a \ncapital gain. The people who had investments in that mutual fund would \nbe assessed a tax because of those capital gains. I didn't see one rich \nman in that line that came down to complain about that. So it is not \njust that.\n  If you are really concerned about keeping farmers on the land and \nletting young farmers get started, we have to start taking a look at \ncapital gains, because I think we have to lower the average age of the \nfarmers today, and also estate taxes, so that we can pass these farms \nand ranches and small businesses on to the next generation.\n  Mr. President, I see my time has expired.

Mr. President, I rise today to again express my strong \nsupport for the balanced budget amendment.\n  I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for providing a forum which has encouraged debate on all \nsides of this critically important issue. The public has been well \nserved by these many hours of discussion.\n  Mr. President, let me describe the need for the balanced budget \namendment by comparing it to a situation to which many Americans can \nrelate.\n  By repeated abuse of a high-interest credit card, your debt is \nrapidly mounting until you reach the point of maxing out. You're barely \npaying enough to cover the minimum monthly payments--let alone make any \ndent in the principal--and your debts threaten to consume the entire \nfamily budget.\n  With every available dollar being funneled into your credit card \npayments, there is no money left over to meet your daily needs or \ninvest in your family's future.\n  You, the overextended consumer, are left with only two viable \noptions: Either file for bankruptcy or drastically cut your spending.\n  If you're so far in debt that you see nothing in your future but \ndespair, you may seek out the help of a credit counseling service. I \nguarantee they'll take one look at the horrendous mess you've created \nand demand you come up with an immediate plan for climbing out of debt.\n  They'll tell you there are only three options that will return you to \nfinancial solvency: Discipline, discipline, and discipline.\n  Now imagine that scenario multiplied several trillion times, where \nthe reckless consumer is not an individual but the Federal Government \nitself. That's very much the predicament the United States will soon \nface.\n  As Washington continues to spend dollars it does not have, each \nannual budget deficit is added to the balance of the overall national \ndebt.\n  The national debt today stands at $5.3 trillion, or $20,000 for every \nAmerican man, woman, and child.\n  The debt is increasing by $721 million every day, and $1 in every $7 \nFederal tax goes to service just the interest on a debt so massive.\n  If an individual acted with equal irresponsibility, the consequences \nwould be severe.\n  The Federal Government, however, simply writes another IOU in the \nname of our children and grandchildren and keeps right on spending, \ndemanding services today that it wants our kids to pay for tomorrow.\n  In recent years, the credit counselors--in this case, the American \ntaxpayers--have been scrutinizing Federal spending and demanding that \nthe Government be accountable for every tax dollar.\n  But instead of hearing ``discipline, discipline, discipline,'' \nWashington somehow hears it as ``spend, spend, spend.'' And spend it \ndoes--even when every ounce of common sense demands that it should not.\n  Despite all the recent talk about controlling Federal spending, there \nis no reason to believe Washington has fundamentally changed its ways.\n  Without the constitutional protections of a balanced budget \namendment, the outlook for our fiscal future is grim: The national debt \nwill continue to explode, America will eventually run out of IOU's, and \na bankrupt nation will surely follow.\n  For an entire generation--more than three decades--Washington has \ntalked about eliminating the deficit. ``[My program] is the surest and \nsoundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget,'' said President \nJohn F. Kennedy in his State of the Union Address in 1963.\n  That sentiment has been echoed by every President since Johnson, \nNixon,\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\nFord, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton.\n  The fact that we haven't balanced the budget since 1969 demonstrates \nthat talking about balancing the budget is far easier than actually \ndoing it.\n  Many budget balancing plans have been proposed over the years, yet \neven the most well-intentioned of them have not brought about balance, \njust larger deficits.\n  The pervasive growth of government makes it painfully obvious that in \na government where politicians exhibit compassion by spending other \npeople's money, we cannot be assured our budgets will ever balance \nwithout the moral authority of the Constitution to enforce it.\n  The latest budget proposal from the White House illustrates the real \nneed for a balanced budget amendment.\n  Although President Clinton's plan is billed as being balanced, it \nreally isn't--the deficit would increase next year and early reports \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office say the Clinton plan would remain \nabout $80 billion short of balance in 2002. Seventy-five percent of the \nPresident's deficit reduction would not occur until after the year \n2000, meaning the Clinton administration will never have to make the \ntough choices it will take to eliminate the deficit. In other words, \ntalk about it but leave it up to somebody else to do it. And most \ndisturbing, instead of cutting spending and asking Washington to \nsacrifice, the President's budget raises taxes by $76 billion and asks, \nonce again, that the taxpayers step forward and sacrifice. I can think \nof no more compelling justification for enacting the balanced budget \namendment.\n\n  Despite guarded optimism in Washington about reaching agreement this \nyear to balance the budget, surveys show most Americans do not believe \nthe deficit will be eliminated by the target date of 2002. They realize \nthat all the laws, goals, plans, and pledges may not be strong enough \nto hold back the tide of rising deficits.\n  Even if the budget were to be balanced in 2002, there is nothing to \nstop a future, less-vigilant Congress from picking up where the big \nspenders left off. The constitutional protections guaranteed by the \nbalanced budget amendment remain our best hope of enforcing future \nfiscal restraint.\n  Mr. President, I am greatly disappointed by the efforts of some of \nour colleagues who have chosen to use Social Security as a shield to \ndisguise their opposition to the balanced budget amendment. Most of us \nhave come to the conclusion this is nothing more than a transparent \npolitical ploy to defeat the amendment, while playing to the fears of \nsenior citizens by demagoguing the Social Security issue.\n  I have absolutely no doubt that if the Social Security concerns were \nerased today, another problem with the amendment would crop up \ntomorrow, and we would once again find ourselves in the position of \nbeing a single vote short of passage. This is already evident through \nthe lineup of amendments we have been considering the last few weeks.\n  I wonder if my colleagues are aware of the massive tax increase the \nAmerican people would be forced to accept if we did indeed factor \nSocial Security surpluses out of the budget process.\n  Between 2002 and 2007 alone, the tax hike required to bring the \nbudget into balance would amount to $706 billion. Yes, $706 billion.--\nThat dwarfs the record-breaking $265 billion tax increase President \nClinton ushered through Congress in 1993.\n  As their share, taxpayers in my home State of Minnesota could face a \ntotal Federal tax hike of about $12 billion. That is an average \nhousehold tax increase of $1,085 per year. And again, that is just from \n2002 to 2007.\n  Mr. President, Social Security is facing serious problems, and \nreforms are needed to ensure that retirement benefits will continue to \nbe available to all Americans. But taking Social Security off budget \ndoes nothing to help the trust fund remain solvent.\n  We all know that, by law, any Social Security surpluses must be \ninvested in Treasury securities. Without serious reform, as long as the \nGovernment is allowed to grow and to continue its deficit-spending \nways, it will still borrow from the trust fund, leaving nothing but \nIOUs to future beneficiaries.\n  Therefore, first and foremost, we must overhaul the way Washington \nspends taxpayer dollars by imposing some constitutionally mandated \nfiscal discipline. We must pass the balanced budget amendment and we \nmust take appropriate actions to protect and preserve the trust fund.\n  While I understand the arguments of those who have supported the \nvarious Social Security amendments during this debate, a more \nreasonable approach would be to take Social Security off budget after \nthe budget is balanced. Congress should begin considering legislation \nthat ensures Social Security benefits will be payable for the current \nand future generations, stops the use of trust fund surpluses on other \nGovernment programs, and puts real assets in the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  For now, let us face it: we will never achieve a balanced budget if \nSocial Security is taken off budget and omitted from our deficit \ncalculations. President Clinton himself has come to that very \nconclusion.\n  Mr. President, a bipartisan coalition in Congress is committed to \npassing a balanced budget amendment in 1997 because we believe the \ntaxpayers deserve a responsible Government that pays its bills and \nsaves for the future.\n  We also support passing the balanced budget amendment in 1997.\n  Ending deficits and lowering the national debt will free up public \nand private resources for more productive and innovative uses in the \nglobal economy of the 21st century. On a more personal level, working \nAmericans will benefit directly when a balanced budget leads to lower \ninterest rates that could save a middle-class family about $125 a month \nin lower mortgage, car, and student loan payments.\n  The 105th Congress has a historic opportunity and obligation to leave \na legacy of responsible governing for the generations to come. The path \nis well marked: To one side leads the road to bankruptcy and America's \nfiscal ruin; to the other, the path of political promises which may or \nnot be kept; while directly ahead lies the trail of discipline, \ndiscipline, discipline we must--pursue the road to prosperity and \naccountable governing marked by passage of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank you.

Mr. President, people continually talk about using Social \nSecurity. ``Let's use Social Security until we balance the budget, and \nthen after that we will not use it any more.''\n  That argument says it all, Mr. President, because, if you use Social \nSecurity, it makes it pretty easy to balance the budget. If we want to \nreally balance the budget let's do it the right way, the hard way, the \nhonest way. Let's not use the surpluses--this year alone over $8 \nbillion. That is the easy way to balance the budget. But it is not the \nright way.\n  Dorothy Ray from Reno, NV, wrote to me:\n\n       I urge you to fight all attempts to cap, cut, tax, or \n     otherwise cut Social Security benefits and to focus on the \n     real causes of the Federal deficit. Social Security is an \n     earned entitlement that does not contribute 1 cent to the \n     Federal deficit. We workers and retirees and employers have \n     paid and continue to pay special taxes. We fund Social \n     Security. The Federal Government has no right to borrow our \n     Social Security and deplete all the reserves which we \n     contributed for this purpose. Please fight all attempts to \n     cut or rob us of our earned benefits.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dorothy Ray.\n\n  I heard also from Sparks, NV, from Bernice Murray. She wrote to me:\n\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\n\n       Dear Mr. Reid. In reference to your stand on Social \n     Security I stand behind your views 100 percent. I have lived \n     in Nevada since 1946, and most of that time in Sparks. I am \n     72 years old. My husband just passed away January 17, '97. My \n     only income now is his Social Security. I agree with what you \n     are trying to accomplish, and please keep up the good work. \n     Us older Nevadans need you.\n\n  Mr. President, not only do the older Nevadans need this, but all \nNevadans. All Americans need this.\n  The Social Security Program is for people over age 62 or 65 who are \nnow receiving the benefit. But it is the benefit for future \ngenerations. All across America, as we speak, in certain specific \nregions there are huge amounts of money being spent on television, on \nradio, and in newspapers against people like Senator Reid from Nevada. \nThese ads say, ``Why won't Reid support a balanced budget amendment?'' \nI say to those people that are spending these hundreds, thousands, and \nmillions of dollars on these ads all over the country that I do support \na balanced budget amendment. I just do not support theirs. I support \nmine, the one that excludes Social Security. This isn't some new-found \nreligion for Senator Reid. I have been doing this. This is the 4th \nyear. I have offered my amendment every year, and will continue to do \nso until we prevail because the people about whom I speak, Bernice \nMurray, Dorothy Ray, and others cannot afford hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in the State of Nevada to run ads. All they can do is write \ntheir letters hoping that right will prevail. It has so far. I hope it \nwill continue.\n  We need to balance the budget. We need to do it though, Mr. \nPresident, the right way. I have heard people say, ``We will never be \nable to balance the budget without using Social Security.'' Well, we \ncan balance the budget without using Social Security. It is going to be \nharder, and we may not be able to do it by the year 2002. But we can do \nit. And, when we accomplish that, we will have prevailed in righting \none of the biggest wrongs in the history of this country; that is, \ndepleting these trust funds for purposes other than what the money was \npaid in for by employers and employees.\n  For many people in America today, Social Security is the only money \nthey get. Only 50 percent of America's workers have access to pensions. \nThat does not count Social Security. Most people working in America, \nand especially women, have no hope of ever getting a pension. To \nenshrine in the Constitution any amendment that would guarantee to the \nAmerican workers that these contributions are no longer going to be \nprotected I believe is wrong.\n  How much of an impact does Social Security make on the lives of \nAmericans? Nationally, in December 1995, benefits were paid to about 44 \nmillion Americans. This includes 27 million retired workers, about 5 \nmillion widows, a few widowers, 4 million disabled workers, and more.\n  The monthly average benefit paid to a Social Security retired worker \nis $720. A wife gets $354, because it usually is a wife at this stage. \nMost husbands have Social Security benefits. Wives have not up to this \nstage. It is changing in the future years.\n  In the State of Nevada, we have about 229,000 people who receive \nSocial Security benefits. Said another way, that is about 15 percent of \nthe people in Nevada depend on Social Security for support. In Nevada, \n153,000 of these people are retired, 21,000 are widows, about 23,000 \nare disabled, and then there are, of course, some children, about \n17,000 children, whose parents have been killed or died in some fashion \nwho receive benefits.\n  The average benefit in the State of Nevada is $5 a month more than \nthe national average; $725 a month is what Nevadans get on an average \nfrom Social Security. For $725 a month, they are not able to pay for \nads in the larger newspapers in Nevada, full-page ads at a cost of \nabout $5,000. They are not going to be able to do that. Ads running in \nradio stations today alone will cost tens of thousands of dollars, and \nin television, no telling how much money.\n  These people cannot pay for the ads, but the large corporations are \nhelping pay for these ads or are paying for these ads. Why? Because \nthey know, Mr. President, that if we balance the budget the right way \nand do not use Social Security benefits and we really want to balance \nthe budget, they are probably going to have to chip in a few dollars or \ntake longer or they are going to have to make more cuts. So they are \nwilling to spend money up front to save them a few dollars.\n  In the State of Nevada, $2.1 billion was paid into Social Security \nlast year. Drawing out of that was far less than $2 billion--about $1.4 \nbillion. The rest went to surplus, the surplus the people in this body \nwant to use to mask the deficit. I say they should not be able to do \nthat. These moneys should be set aside for Social Security recipients.\n  Social Security in every State plays a vital role. It is a program \nthat keeps people off poverty. It gives people dignity. It is not only \nin Nevada. This is the way it is all across the country. In fact, the \namendment I offered, which was defeated by a vote of 55 to 45, had two \nvery courageous Republicans from different parts of the country who \nvoted in favor of it. The senior Senator from Arizona voted for it; the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania voted for it.\n  In addition to that, we now have held up in the House the balanced \nbudget amendment. Why? Because some very courageous sophomore \nRepublicans are saying we will vote for a balanced budget amendment but \nwe want to exclude Social Security benefits. My office has received \nsome phone calls about people in this body on that side of the aisle \nwho are now considering offering amendments of their own. I hope that \nthere will be further thought given to that, that we will exclude \nSocial Security from the calculations of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Social Security is the major source of income for 63 percent of all \nthe beneficiaries. For 63 percent of the people who draw Social \nSecurity benefits, that is all the money they get. It is for this group \nthat I am most concerned and speak on their behalf today. They are not \ngoing to run ads in the newspapers. They are not going to be able to \npay for television or radio ads. But their thoughts are just as \nimportant, their ideas are just as important as the people who are \nspending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get out the message \nthat they want to be able to mask the deficit.\n  Currently, about 90 percent of older households get Social Security \nbenefits. Benefits keep about 15 million Americans above the poverty \nline and even more from near poverty. While this is nothing to be proud \nof, I think it is something we should reflect upon as to how much \nbetter we are doing. Today, 10.5 percent of our senior population falls \nbelow the poverty line.\n  It was just a few years ago that we had poorhouses where people who \nhad no money went. Most of the counties--the States helped a little \nbit--had poorhouses for these people. The difference between poorhouses \nand no poorhouses is this program we call Social Security.\n  So I am concerned about approximately 44 million Americans and \n229,000 Nevadans who depend on this program to maintain their dignity. \nThis is by no means the time to turn our backs on the success of this \nprogram or the citizens who rely on this program. We must listen to the \npeople who tell us: balance the budget but do not do it using Social \nSecurity.\n  The vast majority of Americans agree with my position in spite of the \nads, in spite of the media blitz. The Wall Street Journal, the New York \nTimes, NBC, CNN have all run polls showing that about 75 percent of the \nAmerican people support balancing the budget but without using Social \nSecurity.\n  Franklin Roosevelt said upon signing the Social Security act, ``We \ncan never insure one hundred percent of the population against one \nhundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have \ntried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the \naverage citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against \na poverty-ridden old age.''\n  This statement, given in August 1935, was visionary because we have \ndone just that. We have given dignity to the old of America. They do \nnot have to live in poverty. You can see the impact of this program, \nwhich I have said on this floor is the most successful Social Security \nprogram in the history of the world. It is my hope that Members on both \nsides of the aisle will think long and hard about the impact of the \nbalanced budget amendment on Social Security and vote accordingly.\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\n  News accounts indicate that the Republican leadership is open to \nmodifying the underlying amendment. I understand that as we speak some \nare shopping language they believe would address this issue. As long as \nthey focus on Social Security, I am willing to do that. I have been \nvery narrow in my advocacy on this floor. While I think some of the \nother ideas about capital budgeting, emergencies and the military are \ngood, I am not willing to focus on those amendments. I want to focus on \nSocial Security and the importance I think it plays in our society, and \ntherefore I hope those who are shopping amendments will shop in a very \nnarrow fashion and wind up supporting the amendment where we give \ncontinued dignity to the seniors of this country.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of the people of \nOhio, to express our deepest sympathy to the families of all those who \nhave suffered injury and loss of life in this weekend's tornadoes, \nflooding, and other natural disasters. Our hearts certainly go out to \neveryone who has suffered, at this time of their need.\n  I personally experienced the Xenia tornado of 1974, and I know how \nawful such devastation can be. When I saw the pictures over the weekend \nof the homes totally torn apart in Arkansas, I was reminded of what I \nsaw in 1974 in Xenia, OH. I was assistant prosecuting attorney at the \ntime. We heard the tornado was coming and got down in the basement. \nAfter the tornado had passed over, I literally crawled out of the \nbasement of the building, what was left of it, and looked at Xenia and \nsaw the unbelievable devastation. So I have some understanding of what \nthe people of Arkansas and the people of other States are going through \nwith regard to these natural disasters.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the terrible tragedy that took place \nin my home State of Ohio this weekend, and what we possibly can do to \ngive assistance. The southern part of our State was ravaged by the \nworst flooding we have experienced in at least 33 years. At least four \npeople have died so far, and 14 counties are now in a state of \nemergency. Bridges have been wiped out; houses and cars have been swept \naway. Our thoughts and prayers go to the families of those who have \nlost their lives, and to all those who have been evacuated from their \nhomes and all those who face this disaster.\n  Along with Senator Glenn and my colleagues from Ohio in the House of \nRepresentatives, I will be working with the administration to make sure \nthe Federal Government helps these Ohioans get back to their homes. I \nam encouraged by President Clinton's swift response with Federal aid \nfor Arkansas, and I encourage him to help Ohioans as well. We will be \nworking to make sure everyone gets home safely as soon as possible.\n  Let me also talk about the tremendous job the American Red Cross, the \nOhio National Guard, local volunteer groups, local fire departments, \nand rescue squads are doing in my home State. They have been working \nthis weekend, they are working right now, as we speak. My hat is off to \nthem. I send my congratulations and thanks for the tremendous amount of \nwork they are doing. They are offering a desperately needed helping \nhand to some families who are having a very, very difficult time.\n  My wife Fran and I extend our prayers to all who have been touched in \nany way by this tragedy. To those who have lost their lives and those \nwho have been forced from their homes, and to their families, I stand \nready to work with all Ohioans to help their communities return to \nnormal just as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1813-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1813-S1814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, at this point let me turn to something I \nhave talked about on this floor on many occasions in the past 2 years, \nthe issue of the banning of partial-birth abortion.\n  When the President of the United States justified his veto of the \npartial-birth abortion bill last year, this is what he said. I will \nquote now from President Clinton as he vetoed our bill:\n\n       There are a few hundred women every year who have \n     personally agonizing situations where their children are born \n     or about to be born with terrible deformities, which will \n     cause them to die either just before, during or just after \n     childbirth. And these women, among other things, cannot \n     preserve the ability to have further children. . . .''\n\n  That was a quote from the President, when he vetoed the partial-birth \nabortion bill.\n  In light of those remarks by President Clinton, I hope all Americans \nheard the media reports last week about the shocking confession of a \nleader in the abortion rights movement. It turns out that in every \nmaterial detail the President's comments that I have just quoted, the \ncomments he made in defense of his veto, are false. And the confession \nof this leader in the abortion rights movement, the confession he made \nlast week which I am going to talk about in more detail in just a \nmoment, that confession shows the comments made by our President were \nsimply not true because the fact is, President Clinton based his veto \non information that was not true.\n  For the last 2 years, a number of us here in the Senate have been \ntrying to ban this horrible practice of partial-birth abortion, a \npractice in which a baby is partially removed from the mother, \npartially delivered, and then killed. I believe the horror of this \npractice is so clear, so heinous, it should truly offer some common \nground for those of us who oppose abortion and those who do, in fact, \nsupport abortion rights. In my view, one does not have to join the pro-\nlife side in order to oppose this practice. In fact, if you look to \nsome of the Members of the House, for example, who voted with us on \nthis issue, who voted to ban the partial-birth abortion, many of them \nby their own definition would be classified as pro-choice.\n  So, this should be an area where pro-choice and pro-life come \ntogether. The sad fact is though, Mr. President, we were not, last \nyear, able to get our bill banning partial-birth abortion past \nPresident Clinton's veto pen, in large measure because of the rationale \nused by the President, which was simply wrong. The American people were \nassured that partial-birth abortion was an extremely rare procedure--\none that occurs only a few hundred times a year--and is only used to \nsave mothers whose lives are in extreme danger or where the child has \nbeen malformed.\n  Thomas Jefferson had a good phrase for arguments like this. He called \nthem, ``false facts.'' Because these very impressive sounding \narguments, as many of us suspected, turn out to be wrong.\n  For those of my colleagues--and there can't be very many by now--who \nhave not heard about the startling revelations by Ron Fitzsimmons, let \nme talk for a moment about them.\n  Mr. Fitzsimmons is the national director of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers. In 1995, when the Senate was considering the \npartial-birth abortion bill, he was helping lead the fight against it. \nIn fact, he went on ``Nightline'' to argue that the procedure ought to \nremain legal.\n  At that time, Mr. Fitzsimmons said that the procedure was rare and \nwas primarily performed to save the lives or the fertility of the \nmothers.\n  Now, as we found out last week, because of Mr. Fitzsimmons' own \ncomments, own revelations, own confession, his conscience started \ngnawing him almost immediately after he had appeared on ``Nightline.'' \nHe says now that he felt physically ill at the lies that he had told. \nHe said to his wife the very next day, according to him, ``I can't do \nthis again. I can't do this again.''\n  Meanwhile, President Clinton was using Mr. Fitzsimmons' false \nstatements to buttress his case for vetoing the partial-birth abortion \nbill. And, as I said last week, Mr. Fitzsimmons at long last came in \nfrom the cold. He admitted that, to use his own words, he ``lied \nthrough his teeth.''\n\n\n                         Lied through his teeth\n\n  The facts, as he now publicly acknowledges them, are clear. Partial-\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\nbirth abortion is not a rare procedure. It happens all the time, and it \nis not limited to mothers and fetuses who are in danger. It is \nperformed on healthy women and healthy babies all the time, and that is \nwhat the facts are.\n  Mr. President, it is true that everyone is entitled to his or her own \nopinion, but people are not entitled to their own facts. On partial-\nbirth abortion, the facts are out, the facts are clear, and I join our \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from New York, in hoping, \nas he was quoted this weekend, in light of these facts, that the \nPresident will reverse his decision to veto this bill.\n  Mr. President, it would seem fairly simple that when one makes a \ndecision, in this case President Clinton's decision to veto this bill \nthat was passed overwhelmingly by the House and overwhelmingly by the \nSenate, that when he made his decision to veto the bill and when he \npublicly stated why he made that decision to veto the bill, when it \nturns out later that the facts are proven to be false, the underlying \nfacts, the underlying rationale by which he apparently made his \ndecision, it would seem that it would not be too hard for the President \nthen to change his mind, based on a new understanding of what the facts \ntruly are.\n  We will be debating this issue again on the floor, we will be holding \nhearings again in the Judiciary Committee, and we will be back out here \nagain talking about this very important matter. I hope that as we do \nthat, my friends and colleagues who opposed us on this issue will \nremember what Mr. Fitzsimmons said, what he said when he could no \nlonger apparently stand it anymore, that he had, in fact ``lied through \nhis teeth,'' that the facts he gave the public, the facts he gave \nCongress, the facts he gave the President were simply not true.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Presiding Officer and appreciate the \nopportunity to come to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1813-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMPLIMENTING SENATOR JOHNSON ON HIS MAIDEN SPEECH IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I did not have the opportunity to hear \nour majority leader last week discuss matters of concern to him, \nespecially as they related to the balanced budget amendment. But I was \ndisappointed to read press reports, and then read the Record this \nmorning, with regard to some of his comments relating to some of our \ncolleagues.\n  He has noted on the floor that in the past, this has been a positive \ndebate, an instructive debate and a debate that clarifies differences \namong us. I think that characterization is accurate. Oftentimes on the \nSenate floor, in heated debate, we say and espouse things we wish we \ncould take back later. But this debate has largely been devoid of that. \nI think that has been productive and ought to be the way we conduct \nourselves.\n  So it was somewhat surprising to me to hear the majority leader so \npersonally attack some of our colleagues and express himself as he did. \nIt was, in my view, uncharacteristic of the majority leader. I hope \nthat we can retain the level of decorum and the level of civility on \nthe Senate floor that will lend itself to a good debate on this and \nmany other very controversial and extraordinarily contentious issues in \nthe future. We, as leaders, need to set the example. We, as leaders, \nneed to demonstrate that there is a threshold of civility and a \nstandard which we should follow that, in my view, ought to be \ndemonstrated first and foremost by the leadership.\n  I know of many cases where colleagues on the Senate floor, Republican \nand Democratic, have taken positions on any one of a number of issues \nand concluded, having been presented with more information, that the \noriginal position they took was not one they could accept now. That has \nhappened in cases involving constitutional amendments, involving \nstatutory law, and involving other legislation. I hope it would be the \nway we conduct ourselves in considering many of the issues affecting \nour country and its future.\n  Obviously, with new information, and under different circumstances, \none comes to different conclusions. I, myself, faced a similar set of \ncircumstances early on. I have always wanted to be on the side of those \nsupporting a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  On reflection, much of the language that we have resorted to in the \npast, that we have used in the past, is language that, in retrospect, \nis not as appropriate for the Constitution as we had originally thought \nit might be.\n  I am very concerned about the implications of any amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution, but especially one involving our economy, especially \none involving our own fiscal responsibility, especially one involving \nour ability to cope with a myriad of circumstances that this country is \ngoing to confront at some point in the future.\n  So clearly, as my colleagues have indicated, new information has been \npresented to us this year. We have received new information from the \nCongressional Research Service, new information from the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and new information from the Treasury \nDepartment, all reporting that the circumstances involving the Social \nSecurity trust fund are vastly different than what we were originally \nled to believe during the 1980's.\n  There is a difference in the interpretation of the Social Security \ntrust fund than what I was originally presented as fact in years past. \nWhat we are now told, not by some partisan organization but by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service, and by the Office of \nManagement and Budget, is that funds used for Social Security purposes \nare going to have to be offset with other funds, such as tax increases \nor spending cuts, in order to be paid out at an appropriate time in the \nfuture.\n  Now, if we worked for a company and we were told that we had invested \na certain amount of dollars--say $100,000--in our own retirement fund \nand then told that, before we could draw those funds out, the company \nwould have to replenish those funds with other funds in order for that \nto be available, Mr. President, I think every single prospective \nretiree would feel very cheated. They would feel robbed.\n  Yet, that is exactly the circumstances now with the Social Security \ntrust fund. Workers are paying into that fund with the expectation that \nit would be paid out in time to those who paid in. That will not be the \ncase if we enshrine in the Constitution the utilization of the Social \nSecurity trust fund for purposes other than Social Security.\n  The same can be said for the capital budget. I know that we could \nhave a good debate for days about whether or not we have a capital \nbudget in this country. We all recognize that most States have them. We \nrecognize that most businesses have them. There is not a family I know \nof, that pays off its mortgage in any one year. Families, businesses, \nand States currently have capital budgets or a very similar budgeting \nconcept that allow them to differentiate between long-term investment \nand operating expenses. My family does that. My father's business used \nto do that.\n  The question is, Should we as a country do that at some point in the \nfuture? I think the answer is resoundingly, yes, we should. We need to \ndifferentiate between long-term investment and capital costs.\n  Mr. President, we are not doing that. But whether we subscribe to \nthat concept or not, the question should be, Should we forevermore \npreclude this country from even considering a capital budget? We are \nnow told by the Congressional Research Service that we will preclude \nthe consideration of a\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\ncapital budget if this amendment passes in its current form.\n  So, Mr. President, both on the basis of Social Security as well as \nthe analysis of the Congressional Research Service--also confirmed by \nthe Treasury Department--that we would be precluded from even \nconsidering a capital budget, I think these are issues that ought to \nweigh very heavily prior to the time our colleagues vote tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  I am also very concerned about the implications for recession. When \nthere is an economic downturn, there is no doubt that we need to \nrespond in ways that will allow us adequate time, adequate resources, \nand adequate flexibility to ensure that the downturn does not get any \nworse. We must ensure that we have some sort of a reflexive \ncountercyclical approach to the economic consequences that we could be \nfacing were we to do nothing. This legislation undermines our ability \nto do that.\n\n  I have heard it said many times that if it is a national emergency, \nclearly by the very definition of ``national'' you are going to have a \nsympathetic Senate responding to the circumstances and a sympathetic \nHouse responding to these circumstances in ways that would easily allow \nus to reach that threshold.\n  Well, I ask, what about a regional recession? During the early 1990's \nand late 1980's, there were seven or eight very deep regional \nrecessions. The fact is that on many occasions were we to have \npresented some sort of a countercyclical, antirecessionary legislative \nremedy, I think it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, \nto reach that 60-vote threshold simply because of the circumstances \nthat involve the regional implications of a recession.\n  So, I think it is very disconcerting to be locking into place \nforevermore the requirement that a supermajority be the threshold by \nwhich a countercyclical recession package be considered.\n  In addition, a poorly crafted balanced budget amendment deprives us \nof the automatic stabilizers that cushion the blows of a weakening \neconomy. As an economic downturn begins, Government spending \nautomatically increases just as tax revenues decline. Such a time would \nprove the worst moment to increase taxes or cut spending. Yet, a \nbalanced budget amendment could require exactly that result, with \npotentially devastating consequences. A recession could be turned into \na depression under those circumstances.\n  The risk of default and shutdowns are also very disconcerting. The \nfact is that a supermajority requirement under this constitutional \namendment may preclude our ability to reach the threshold necessary to \nincrease the statutory debt limit at times in the future. A minority of \nour colleagues could hold U.S. creditworthiness hostage were we to pass \nan amendment that allows the minority in this country to dictate \nwhether or not we are going to increase the debt limit. How many times \nhave we been on the floor and struggled to find a simple majority to do \nwhat has been required? I think it is going to be extraordinarily \ndifficult for us with the supermajority requirement to do it at any \ntime in the future.\n  National security is also a very serious matter. Section 5 of the \npending amendment jeopardizes our ability to prepare for situations \nthat we know will require intervention, such as the Persian Gulf \neffort. For Congress to waive the balanced budget amendment, the United \nStates must be engaged in military conflict--must be engaged.\n  In Desert Shield we needed to build up before the conflict. In Desert \nShield we stipulated that the conflict was imminent, and, as a result, \nwe needed to prepare to be as aggressively engaged as that resolution \nprovided. To say that there has to be conflict before we can issue or \nprovide for any legislative support, in my view, is extraordinarily \npoorly worded and ill-founded.\n  Finally, Mr. President, with regard to the budget itself, I think our \nrecord over the last 5 years demonstrates that where there is a will \nthere is a way. There has been a will. We have reduced the deficit from \n$295 billion to $107 billion since 1993. We have reduced the deficit by \n60 percent through congressional action.\n  Obviously, we need to go the rest of the way. But clearly, if we are \ngoing to achieve our goals in balancing the budget, we can do so if we \ncontinue to commit as successfully and as aggressively in the next 5 or \n6 years as we have in the past.\n  But I am troubled in that regard as well, Mr. President, because \nthere are proposals, including the one offered by the majority leader, \nthat would create a deficit of more than $500 billion in new tax breaks \nwere we to pass the bill that he has proposed--$500 billion over 10 \nyears and $750 billion, three-quarters of a trillion dollars, in the \nsecond decade that that tax bill would go into effect.\n\n  So, it is very difficult for me to understand how some of my \ncolleagues on one hand can argue that we need to pass a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, but then offer legislation which \nexacerbates the problem by a substantial margin of $500 to $750 billion \nin additional deficits if that legislation were to pass.\n  I might remind my colleagues, even if we balance the budget, we have \na $5.5 trillion accumulated debt that we have not yet paid down.\n  The difference between the deficit and the debt is that the deficit, \nof course, is what we accumulate in new debt every year; the debt is \nwhat we have already accumulated. And we have accumulated a lot. When \nare we going to start buying that debt down? And how are we going to do \nthat if we continue to exacerbate the problem, continue to complicate \nour situation by offering tax measures that allow a deficit of that \nmagnitude to be added on to the troubles that we are facing over the \nnext couple of years? Mr. President, for all those reasons, I hope my \ncolleagues will take great care as they make their choices tomorrow \nafternoon.\n\n  The leader had suggested that he has a couple of potential surprises \nin his pocket. Well, I guess I have to announce to my colleagues that I \nhave a couple of surprises that I do not wish to talk about right now \nto ensure that the vote will be as we expect it will. But I do not \nthink it ought to be a question or a contest of surprises or \nparliamentary maneuvers or amendments that may or may not be in our \nbest interest.\n  The question can be and will be and should be: Can we have a good \ndebate about any one of a number of divisive issues like we know we \nhave to face in this Senate, on a number of very, very difficult \nmatters that will keep coming back? Can we do it in a civil way? Can we \ndo it in a way that does not in some way question the motives or the \npositions taken by some of our colleagues? Can we do it with an \nexpectation that will resolve that matter and go on to yet another and \nanother day?\n  I hope we can do that. I hope the leadership will set the example as \nwe do that. I hope that after the vote tomorrow we can move on to other \nthings. We are prepared to debate this longer if we need to do that. I \nhope that will not be the case. We should move on and get work done in \nthe body and move on with some expectation that bipartisanship is still \nalive and well and flourishing here in this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DICKINSON\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I pay tribute to my most senior staff \nmember who is departing after a well-earned career to take on other \npursuits. I do so with a sense of sadness, but indeed, a great sense of \nrecognition for an individual upon whom I have relied, as have many \nother Senators. Rem is meritorious among his peer group of staff in the \nSenate and is recognized as the type of individual who is the very \nfoundation upon which we, the 100 Senators, have to rely every day. His \nsupport and advice enables us to represent our respective \nconstituencies and to do what we individually think is in the best \ninterests of our Nation.\n  Remmel T. Dickinson's service in my office began February 12, 1979, \nand he is to complete his Senate career on Wednesday, March 5, an \nimpressive 18 years, on my staff, and serving 20 years in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\n  He proudly hails from Little Rock, AR, but developed early on in his \ncareer in the Senate an equal if not greater loyalty to the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. I must hail him for that.\n  From the campaign on which I was first elected, in 1978, he came on \nto the Senate, and like so many, he did not want to start anywhere but \nright down at the threshold level where he could learn the system all \nthe way up. Indeed, he started in that all-essential institution known \nin the Senate as the mail room, which in many respects is the heartbeat \nof every Senate office.\n  With meticulous attention to detail and congenial personality, and I \nwant to underline that, Rem gained the admiration of his peers in the \nSenate wherever they may work, and his peers throughout the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, because he was very loyal to many, many \npeople in Virginia. He was a true friend, and is today and always will \nbe, to those that are disadvantaged in our society--be it with physical \nproblems, educational problems, health problems, or whatever it is. The \nbigger the problem, the bigger the challenge, the harder Rem Dickinson \nworked to solve it.\n  The Federal employees are often a very beleaguered group. He was \nthere no matter what the challenge, to step up and advise me and other \nMembers of the Senate, and indeed, staffers throughout this \ninstitution, on what he felt was best and equitable for the Federal \nemployee. And not just those in the greater Metropolitan Washington \narea, but all across the United States he was recognized for his \nknowledge as it related to the essential services provided to the \nFederal employee by our country. Equal access for quality education \nopportunities and equal access in our health care system were his \ngoals, and indeed we have achieved that and will go on to try and \nimprove on those achievements here in the Senate.\n\n  In past years, Rem worked tirelessly on the Republican Health Care \nTask Force striving for solutions to the dilemma confronting millions \nof Americans who simply did not have health insurance and the millions \nmore attempting to cope with the ever-increasing problems associated \nwith increasing health costs.\n  In the area of education, Rem has helped in supporting our States to \nprovide educational service for students with disabilities, known as \nIDEA. His attention has also focused on impact aid, a program which \nlocal school districts, those local districts colocated with military \nbases all across our Nation, and helping to get those funds which will \nenable the children of military families to receive their education in \nthe local school districts without too severely impacting the costs of \nothers who contribute, by and large, through local real estate taxes.\n  Rem believes, as I do, that education is the key to a better quality \nof life for all Americans. He has earned a reputation for honesty and \nprofessionalism both in the Senate and, as I said, throughout Virginia. \nMy constituents have had an open door to the Senate's work through \nRem's expertise in these areas.\n  As the years have passed, I am impressed by his dedication to duty, \nhis loyalty to this Senate, to those on my staff, and to those on other \nSenate staffs, and indeed on a one-on-one basis with many Senators. \nAbove all, he is a gentleman of honor in the finest traditions of the \nSouth which he loves.\n  Indeed, Rem has earned the loyalty, respect, admiration, recognition, \nand gratitude of virtually everyone with whom he has come in contact \nduring his lifetime.\n  And I can only presume that the manner in which he has carried \nhimself, and the care he has exercised in the performance of his duties \nwill continue in whatever Rem chooses to do when he departs the Senate.\n  We will miss Rem's daily good counsel. I commend Rem for a career \nwell spent and well conducted, and I congratulate him on the \ncontribution he has made to our Nation, to Virginia, and we wish him \nthe best in his future pursuits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first I would like to call attention to \nseveral recent reports that have come out on the issue of high academic \nstandards and the need for high standards and national standards in our \nschools, and refer to those reports and perhaps put them in context.\n  I think it is clear from the reports that I am going to refer to here \nthat there is a need for accelerating the progress that our country is \nmaking in developing world class academic standards. It is also clear \nthat the States and local school districts are having great \ndifficulties in determining for themselves what those standards ought \nto be, which is a large and costly task.\n  First, I will refer to the comprehensive Third International Math and \nScience Study that was recently released. It shows that math standards \nhave not yet been implemented at the classroom level in many of our \nschools, and our students score at or below the average on math and \nscience compared to students in other nations.\n  Mr. President, you will remember that one of the goals which the \nGovernors and President Bush established in Charlottesville in 1989 was \nthat the United States would be first in the world in math and science \nby the year 2000. In fact, the reality is very different from that \nlofty goal that was set 8 years ago.\n  This first chart here indicates the average math scores of eighth \ngraders on international tests. We can see in the group of nations that \nare considered top performers that the United States is not listed. \nThose nations are Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and \nBelgium-Flemish.\n  In the middle range, the United States is at the very bottom, far \nbehind the Russian Federation. After us, there are the bottom \nperformers, and the most we can say with pride is that we are not in \nthat category.\n\n  But, Mr. President, I think most parents in this country would aspire \nto our doing better than we are showing we have done on this test. And \nI hope very much that we can.\n  Here is a second chart that makes somewhat the same point. This chart \nindicates that of students scoring among the top 10 percent of eighth \ngraders on international tests, 45 percent of these were from \nSingapore, and 34 percent from South Korea. It goes on down to where, \nin math the United States had only 5 percent of the world's top \nstudents in math, and only 13 percent in science. So, clearly, again, \nwe find ourselves very far down on the list of nations in this \ncomparison.\n  There is also a new national report card on education that has been \npublished by Education Week, which is a respected publication in our \ncountry. It confirms the findings of several previous reports that the \nstandards many States have now established may not be rigorous enough \ncompared to other nations' standards, and, also, that there are all too \nfew States that plan to hold students or teachers accountable for \nmeasurable results.\n  Let me show you these two charts to make this point, Mr. President. \nThe first of these is a chart entitled, ``Who's Accountable?'' What \nthis essentially says is that only those few States that come up on the \nmap here as colored yellow are States that have standards for their \ngraduates from high school. Clearly, most of the country--and, \nunfortunately, my State included--do not have accountability standards \nthat students have to meet in order to graduate from high school. \nClearly, this is a problem that we need to address as a nation.\n  Another chart, ``8th Grade Math Course-Taking.'' This indicates very \nclearly that most of our eighth-graders are simply taking general math \nand only 19 percent, according to this analysis, are, in fact, taking \nalgebra at the time they go into the eighth grade. This is one of the \nreasons we do so poorly on the international comparisons of mathematics \nscores.\n  Finally, the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress math \nscores, which were just released last week, show that over 30 percent \nof 4th, 8th, and 12th-graders lack basic math skills, despite recent \nprogress.\n  Let me show you that chart, Mr. President. When you look at this, you\n\n[[Page S1817]]\n\ncan see a very modest upward trend from 1990 to 1992 to 1996 at the \nthree different grade levels, 4th, 8th, and 12th. As you can see, we \nare nowhere near approaching the level of improvement that is necessary \nif we are going to meet any of the national goals that we have set out \nfor ourselves.\n  Delays in developing standards have been made worse by the fact that, \ndespite the abundance of tests and report cards published by State and \nlocal education agencies, very little of the information is comparable \nfrom district to district, or very little of the information is set at \na high enough standard for us to make reasonable comparisons to these \ninternational tests.\n  As Education Week recently pointed out, ``If the data that we depend \non to monitor the economy were as incomplete, as unreliable, and as out \nof date as the data we depend on to monitor education in the United \nStates, we might as well have the economy of a Third World country.''\n  Instead, we have a hodgepodge of different tests and standards, most \nof them testing basic skills rather than world-class materials, a lot \nof data that only describes how students in one area are doing compared \nto how they did in the previous year.\n  Differences in student ``pass rates'' on State and national testing \nindicate enormous gaps in what we are testing for. Let me show you the \nfinal chart that I have here, Mr. President, to make that point. You \ncan see from this chart entitled ``State NAEP Scores for 4th Grade \nReading Compared to the State's Own Assessment'' that, for example, in \nthe State of Wisconsin, it shows here that 35 percent of the students \nare shown to reach the standard that NAEP sets on their National Fourth \nGrade Reading Test. In their State standard test, Wisconsin shows 88 \npercent of their students meeting the standards. So you can see there \nis very little comparability between what the States are testing for \nand the level of performance that they are expecting and what the NAEP, \nthe national assessment, is testing for.\n\n  As a result, we still have schools that are doing superbly, and we \nalso have schools that are doing miserably. Many times they are in the \nvery same areas and in the same school districts. Parents and educators \noften do not even know which of those types of schools their own \nchildren are in.\n  In response to this situation, many have come to agree that we need \nto set our standards much higher and we need to gather more accurate \ninformation in order to improve achievement, as has been done with \ngreat success in several parts of the private sector.\n  The National Association of Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nand the Business Round Table have now focused their joint efforts on \nraising standards and promoting more accountability in our schools.\n  The National Education Association president, Bob Chase, spoke out \nabout the need for his 2.2-million-member union to support key changes \nsuch as these.\n  Frequent education critics Checker Finn and Diane Ravitch recently \noffered surprising enthusiasm for standards. Let me quote: ``how \npowerful it will be for parents and teachers to compare the math \nprowess of 8th graders in, say, Phoenix and Minneapolis, to the \nperformance of their peers in Korea and the Czech Republic.''\n  In addition to national polls showing strong support for high \nstandards, a Public Agenda poll last month showed that high school \nstudents themselves know that our expectations for them are low, and \nthose very high school students respond accordingly.\n  Raising academic standards has proven to be an immense and costly job \nfor States and for school districts, who have been left to do the job \nlargely on their own. They have been struggling to make the necessary \nprogress but have been unable to do so. For these reasons, we need \nrenewed national efforts toward making standards a reality in the near \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1816-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ALBERT SHANKER\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe recent death of a great education leader, Albert Shanker, who was \nas committed and effective in the fight for National standards as \nanybody in our country. For those of us who believe that the Federal \nGovernment should do more to improve the quality of education in the \ncountry, Al Shanker's death was a great loss. More than anyone else in \nthe Nation, Al Shanker was the visionary pushing for higher standards \nand national standards for teachers and students alike.\n  In a recent piece in the Washington Post, E.D. Hirsch, Jr., said it \nvery well:\n\n       If a single person could be said to be responsible for the \n     shift in sentiment that prompted the President to call, in \n     his State of the Union Address, for national educational \n     standards--a proposal that would have been unthinkable a few \n     years back--it would be Al Shanker.\n  Albert Shanker had an abiding belief that collectively we in America \ncould improve the lives of all of our citizens. He dedicated his life \nto that belief. He also believed passionately that public schools were \nthe great strength of our country and were the means by which we could \nimprove the lot of Americans.\n  A recent essay by Albert Shanker was contained in the New York Times. \nI would like to read two paragraphs from that. This is an essay that he \nwrote in a publication a few years ago. He said:\n\n       Why do I continue when so much of what I've worked for \n     seems threatened? To a large extent because I believe that \n     public education is the glue that has held this country \n     together. Critics now say that the common school never really \n     existed, that it's time to abandon this ideal in favor of \n     schools that are designed to appeal to groups based on \n     ethnicity, race, religion, class, or common interests of \n     various kinds. But schools like these would foster divisions \n     in our society; they would be like setting a time bomb.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Public schools played a big role in holding our nation \n     together. They brought together children of different races, \n     languages, religions, and cultures and gave them a common \n     language and sense of common purpose. He was not outgrown our \n     need for this; far from it. Today, Americans come from more \n     different countries and speak more different languages than \n     ever before. Whenever the problems connected with school \n     reform seem especially tough, I think about this. I think \n     about what public education gave me--a kid who couldn't even \n     speak English when I entered first grade. I think about what \n     it has given me and can give to countless numbers of other \n     kids like me. And I know that keeping public education \n     together is worth whatever effort it takes.\n  Al Shanker believed that the National Government needed to commit \nitself to improving our Nation's schools. Should we have national \neducation goals? Al Shanker believed strongly that we should. Should we \nhave educational standards? Al Shanker believed we should so that every \nparent could determine whether their child was getting the education \nthat they deserved.\n  Mr. President, I was privileged to work with Al Shanker on several \nissues but, most importantly, on the issue of improving standards for \nour schools. His vision and his strength of commitment were always an \ninspiration.\n  With his death, the American Federation of Teachers lost a superb \npresident and all of us in America lost a tireless champion for public \neducation and for a better America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1817-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1817-S1818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO ROY D. NEDROW\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a lifetime \ncommitment to law and order in the United States. On March 1, 1997, Mr. \nRoy D. Nedrow retired as the Director of the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service, ending 33 years of law enforcement service to \nthe community at the local, State, and Federal levels.\n  Mr. Nedrow began his law enforcement career in 1964 with the \nBerkeley, CA, Police Department and served there for 6 years, first as \na patrolman and later as a training sergeant and detective. In 1970, \nMr. Nedrow was appointed a special agent with the U.S. Secret Service \nwhere he distinguished himself during assignments in the field and at \nthe Service's Headquarters. As a result of his outstanding performance \nand talents, Mr. Nedrow earned a number of promotions culminating in \nhis appointment to the Senior Executive Service and assignment as the \nService's Deputy Assistant Director for the Office of Investigations \nwhere he oversaw the investigations and protective support activities \nconducted by the Service's 1,200 special agents at its more than 100 \nfield locations.\n  On December 28, 1992, Mr. Nedrow retired from the Secret Service to \naccept\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\nthe appointment as the Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative \nService. His induction came a critical time in the Agency's history. \nHis strong leadership restored stability to an agency which needed \ngreater independence and a change of direction. Assembling a team of \nhighly qualified professionals, Director Nedrow overhauled the Service, \nreorganizing it to diminish its bureaucracy, and to provide greater \naccountability and responsiveness to its consumers. He provided his \npeople with a new vision, the necessary resources and support, and the \ninspiration to achieve positive change. Under his leadership, the Naval \nCriminal Investigative Service gained national recognition for its \ninnovation in the field of homicide investigation. Its approach to the \ninvestigation of previously unresolved or cold case homicides, some as \nold as 28 years, was lauded in October 1996 by the International Chiefs \nof Police [IACP] during its prestigious Webber Seavey Award for Quality \nin Law Enforcement Ceremony for innovation and excellence in law \nenforcement programs. The NCIS cold case methodology has since been \nadopted by numerous law enforcement agencies throughout the United \nStates. Director Nedrow also recognized the problems and anxieties \nendured by families of deceased service men and women whose deaths \noccurred under other than natural circumstances. He revitalized and \nchampioned a Family Liaison Program to assure responsiveness to the \nneeds of, and issues raised by, surviving family members during the \ndeath investigation process. His legacy of additional achievements with \nand for the Service include a well-respected Critical Incident \nDebriefing Team, a proven Alternative Dispute Resolution system, and a \ncutting edge Computer Crimes Investigation Group.\n  ``The final test of a leader,'' renowned journalist Walter Lippman \nwrote in 1945, ``is that he leaves behind him in other men the \nconviction and will to carry on.'' The testimony to Roy Nedrow is that \nthe Naval Criminal Investigative Service is indeed a better agency \ntoday and that he leaves it in most capable and inspired hands.\n  Mr. President, in closing I wish to commend Roy Nedrow for \noutstanding leadership and service and thank him for his dedication to \nthe Nation as a guardian of our peace. I wish him, and his wife, \nClaudia, Godspeed in his retirement.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. HAGEL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Mr. President, over the last 15 years, the balanced budget \namendment has been debated over and over again in this Chamber. Members \nof one or both Chambers of Congress actually have voted on this \nproposal six times. The arguments, by this point, are familiar. We have \nheard them over the last several weeks and the last several years in \nthese debates. So there is the disturbing process by which the vested \ninterests of this institution are protected against the clear will of \nour democracy.\n  We are not, of course, debating about passage of a balanced budget \namendment. We are debating whether or not to send that decision to the \nStates and to the people of America. Often that gets confused. People \nthink that the entire decision, the entire vote, rests with the 100 \nMembers of this Senate body, when in fact the only thing that rests \nwith us is whether or not we will make the decision to give the people \nof America, to give democracy, an opportunity to decide whether or not \nwe ought to have a balanced budget directing our fiscal affairs here in \nWashington.\n\n  We are debating whether to prefer our interests above their wisdom, \nand it appears we will once again by the narrowest of margins decide to \nsustain this corrupt and corrupting Federal power of unlimited debt.\n  Once again our debate on this matter has been conducted to maximize \npublic cynicism--not intentionally but that is certainly the result--\nwith twisted arms, violated promises, pressure tactics, and broken \ncommitments. We have seen it all surround this issue time and time \nagain. And, once again, as we are debating this, people are switching \ntheir position, people pledging to their constituents during the \ncampaign: ``I will be there when the balanced budget call is taken; \nwhen the roll is called, I will be on the plus side.'' And, of course, \nnow we hear the excuses as to why since the election is over that is no \nlonger the case. Even those who have voted for the balanced budget \namendment in the past now find convenient reasons not to do so in the \npresent.\n  So I guess we cannot really blame the American people for being \ncynical, for being apathetic about what takes place here in this body, \nin the Congress, in Washington. All of this in a desperate attempt to \nprevent the American citizen from having a voice and having a vote, all \nto prop up, if just for a few more years, the ability of Congress to \ncripple the success and the prosperity of the future.\n  There are many divisive issues debated in this Chamber, but this \nissue is unique in one way. The defeat of a balanced budget amendment \nrepresents the raw exercise of political power against the desires of \nover 80 percent of the American public. In my experience in politics, \nno proposal with support so strong and so consistent has ever been \nfrustrated for so long by the Congress.\n  Make no mistake. A balanced budget amendment will eventually be sent \nto the States for ratification. I think that is guaranteed by the \nbreadth of public commitment which will not go away and will only grow \nin strength. We can delay this process, as apparently we will do once \nagain, but not deny it. Every year of delay increases our danger and \nought to add to our shame and guilt.\n  Rather than rehearse the detailed arguments of this debate, let me \ntake, if I could, a long review of what I think we have learned. First, \nthe history of the last few decades and the nature of the political \nprocess itself argues that the Congress is incapable of self-restraint. \nWe have a system in place, a system that allows us to vote public \nbenefits to the very people who keep us in office. We have a system \nthat allows us to place the burden of those benefits on the future \nwhile we gain political support from the present. We have found an \nefficient way to betray future generations in favor of the present. And \nit is easy and relatively painless because our generation can vote \nwhile future generations cannot and our silence and their anger is \ndistant. We do not feel or hear their anger at the next election \nbecause they do not have a vote at the next election. So we please \nthose who benefit us now at the expense of those in the future.\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\n  The only thing we sacrifice in this process--Mr. President, I would \nsay it is a great sacrifice--is our integrity and our historical \nreputation. In a distortion of the Constitution, we promote the general \nwelfare for ourselves at the expense of our posterity. As it stands, \nthere is no weight on the other side of this balance. There is no \nreliable check on this process of intergenerational theft. It is \npolitically prudent, even popular, and this political calculation will \nnot change, will never permanently change without some kind of \nsystematic institutional counterweight, without some measure to give \nposterity a voice in our affairs. Nothing, in my view, will permanently \nchange until the accumulation of popular debt is a violation of our \noath to the Constitution. Perverse incentives of the current system \nwill not be altered until the system itself is altered, until our \npolitical interests are balanced by the weighty words of a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The second lesson I believe we have learned in the last few decades \nis that despite all the talk we hear in Congress, despite all the \nposturing, despite all the rhetoric, we are simply ignoring the coming \nentitlement crisis. We are not facing up to the hard question. We have \nchosen cheerful oblivion over public responsibility. The train wreck is \na precise, measurable distance away. Trustees predict that the Medicare \npart A will be bankrupt by the year 2002. Trustees of Social Security \nbelieve that the system will begin to run a deficit in 2013 and could \ncollapse by 2029.\n  Former Commerce Secretary Pete Peterson recently wrote that if \nentitlements are not reformed, the cost of Social Security and Medicare \nby the year 2040 will take between 35 and 55 percent of every worker's \npaycheck. It is a crisis propelled by demographics and propelled by \nFederal irresponsibility. Every year we avoid real reform we make real \nreform more painful.\n\n  Oh, and the attitude here is, well, 2002, 2013, 2029, I will probably \nbe out of office by then, or hopefully something will change by then, \nor let us not think beyond 1998. That is the next election, isn't it. \nLet us see what we can do to slip by one more election. But it is \nalways one more election, one more election, one more election.\n  When I came here in 1980, we were charged with the responsibility of \ndealing with deficit spending. We were charged with the responsibility \nof getting a handle on the entitlements and being straightforward and \nreal with the American people, but each time it slipped one more \nelection, one more election, one more election. Now we are looking at \n1998.\n  There does not appear to be any movement out of this administration \nto address entitlements in a serious structural way--some tinkering at \nthe edges suggesting but not proffered, some concerns about the \npolitical implications of making the hard choices, making the difficult \ndecisions, but nothing concrete before us as a body. And so we will \npass again for 2 more years.\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment talk a great deal about \nSocial Security, but they do not talk about solving its most \nfundamental problems. Instead, their efforts are designed to move it \noff budget, creating the illusion that this action will somehow save \nthe system.\n  This is a distraction, as I think everyone in this Chamber knows. It \nis not a solution. It is a distraction from the fact that our current \nbudget rules are deceptive. We are borrowing from the Social Security \ntrust fund and replacing real money with T-bills. There is not some \ngiant pot of money out here waiting for Social Security recipients. It \nis a pay-as-you-go system. Some have called it the ultimate pyramid \nsystem. We are borrowing from it and putting pieces of paper into it to \npay it back someday. That payback has to come from the general revenue. \nThose T-bills are a promise to pay benefits in the future, yet this \nborrowing is not reflected in our deficit calculations each year.\n  As a matter of budgeting integrity, we should stop the shell game. We \nneed an accurate accounting of the yearly deficit and the Federal debt. \nIn fiscal 1996, we reported a budget deficit of $107 billion, but we \nfailed to report an additional $66 billion borrowed from and owed to \nSocial Security. Where does that money come from? It comes from the \nAmerican taxpayer. It comes from taxes imposed against their paychecks. \nIt is money that is going to have to be paid back.\n  To say we can solve this problem by conveniently taking it off budget \nis a shell game. It is a deception of the American people. What it \nreally amounts to is keeping two sets of books. These kinds of budget \ntricks make the job of balancing the budget easier in the short term--\nand of course it is the short term here that everyone is concerned \nabout, the next election-- but they compound the problems of future \ngenerations.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside this phony debate over Social \nSecurity. It is impossible to disentangle Social Security revenues and \nexpenditures from the budget. Congress should address the national debt \nby passing the balanced budget amendment and then turn quickly to real \nsolutions, real reform of Social Security.\n  It is unfortunate and it is undeniable that President Clinton's \nbudget currently on the table understands none of these lessons, and \nactually deepens our problems. It is a symbol of the Federal \nGovernment's failure of will and nerve.\n  When I came to the Congress in 1981, our total Federal debt was just \nunder $1 trillion. In the plan the President submitted recently to this \nCongress, his budgets will contribute another $1 trillion to the debt \nbefore those budgets are supposed to come into balance. This is hardly \nan act of courage. In fact, the President's plan demands that nearly \nall the courage be shown by others, since it postpones real spending \ncuts until after he leaves office. Moreover, if the President's own \noptimistic estimates about future deficits do not prove accurate, he \nrelies on triggers--automatic cuts in spending and increased taxes--to \nbring the budget into balance. All of this occurring, again, after he \nhas left office, after he no longer will be held to account.\n  Harry Truman's famous injunction, ``the buck stops here,'' apparently \nnow reads: The buck stops at the desk of the next person to occupy this \noffice.\n  Now we will apparently learn from CBO later this week that even the \nPresident's budget numbers are not accurate. They are not even close. \nWe will, in fact, be about $70 billion short of balance in 2002. This \nyear's budgets alone will see a 20 percent increase in the deficit.\n  This budget is the embodiment of the point I am trying to make. \nDeferring responsibility is easy. Shifting hard choices to the future \nis easy. Deficit spending is easy. Everybody plays the game unless a \nconstitutional amendment changes the ground rules, unless fiscal \ndiscipline is imposed from above, not from within. Unless the system is \nchanged, exposing and ending all of our tricks and excuses, that is the \nonly way we can be honest with the American people. That is the only \nway we can end the cynicism toward our efforts here in the Congress, \nwhich are falling, I am afraid, ever more on deaf ears.\n  There is a great deal at stake here. As others have argued at length, \nincreasing debt has an economic cost in higher interest rates. For \nbusinesses, this means slowed or stalled expansion, and for families it \nmeans that buying that new house or sending that child to college \nbecomes more difficult each year.\n  Another cost is measured in lost opportunities to meet justified \npublic needs. By fiscal year 1998, interest payments on the national \ndebt will approach $250 billion--$250 billion in interest payments. \nThat figure is 21 times more money on interest than on the entire \nFederal expenditure for agriculture; 17 times more than the entire \nFederal expenditures for international affairs; 11 times more than on \nnatural resources and the environment combined; and 4 times more than \non education, training, and employment. We stand on this floor and \nargue, and we work in committee, just to try to scratch a little bit \nmore money out for job training, for education, to deal with problems \nof the environment and our natural resources, to deal with \ninternational affairs and pressing problems in agriculture. We try to \nscratch a few million dollars here, a few hundred million dollars \nthere. Yet $250 billion simply goes to pay interest.\n  What could we do with that $250 billion if we did not have to pay any \ninterest? A big healthy return to the\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\nAmerican people would be the first start, a big tax cut to give them \nback some more of their hard-earned money. And there may be priorities, \nthere may be roads that need to be repaired or built, there may be \neducation expenditures that are appropriate, there may be natural \nresource and environmental concerns that ought to be addressed, there \nmay be agricultural items that ought to be funded, and a whole raft of \nother appropriate spending efforts. Yet those are squeezed ever more, \nas more and more of our budget goes to pay interest.\n  Beyond this, there is a moral cost of continued debt, a price paid in \nthe character of our Nation. I have quoted Thomas Jefferson in this \ndebate before, but let me quote him once more. It is an injunction that \nthis Congress has ignored time after time:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts and be morally bound to pay \n     for them by ourselves.\n\n  Those were words of a great American a long time ago. I wonder what \nhe would say today, looking at over $5.4 trillion of national debt and \ncontinuing budget deficits year after year after year after year. ``We \nshould consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our \ndebts and be morally bound to pay them ourselves,'' said Thomas \nJefferson, one of the most fundamental principles of government.\n  In this debate we are accustomed to thinking in terms of dollars and \ncents. We should also be thinking in terms of right and wrong. It is \nsimply wrong to accumulate power in the present by placing burdens on \nthe future. And that is exactly what we are doing. We are accumulating \npower in the present, the power of spending, and the way we are doing \nit is placing burdens on the future. It is an important part of our \nmoral tradition, to sacrifice for posterity. It is rank selfishness to \ndemand that posterity sacrifice for us. And there is only one way to \nensure that this strong and constant temptation is defeated, by making \na balanced budget a fundamental institutional commitment of our \nGovernment.\n  After 25 years of budget deficits, the call to voluntary restraint is \nhollow. Too many promises have been made and broken. Congress has spent \nthe full measure of public trust. Meaningful budget restraint, if we \nfind it, will come from above, not from within. This fundamental \nprinciple of government should be, and hopefully someday will be, and I \npredict it will be, in America's fundamental law. That day cannot come \ntoo soon. We should be ashamed if that process does not begin tomorrow.\n  Tomorrow we will vote once again. Two years ago I sat in my seat, one \nrow down, listening to the final debate on the balanced budget \namendment, listening to the call of the roll. As every Senator sat at \nhis or her desk, each stood to record his or her vote, and as we went \nthrough the roll we tallied the numbers and we stopped at 66. We came \none vote short. One vote short, not of adopting a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, one vote short of exercising the right \nin a democracy of the people to determine that matter for themselves. \nIt appears that we will stop one vote short again. I hope that is not \nthe case. I pray that is not the case.\n  We desperately need to arrest the power of the purse that has so \ncorrupted our ability to represent the will of the people. I hope \ntomorrow we will demonstrate the courage to finally say: Power to the \npeople. Let them decide the fiscal course for this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1818-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1820-S1822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SAY ``NO'' TO A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to talk \nabout the vote that is pending tomorrow and the subject of the balanced \nbudget amendment. We are coming to the close of yet another marathon \ndebate on this subject, and I hope that I can crystallize the \nperspective and detail some of the major concerns of those of us who \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is tempting, as the debate goes on, to accept right \nbeing on our side; the other side claims right and the moral imperative \nthat says we should pass this balanced budget amendment, put it into \nthe Constitution, open it up, have the courage to step forward.\n  The courage is to be in the minority and say, ``No,'' though the most \npopular view is to amend the Constitution because the folks we \nrepresent, each of us in our States, really have not been made aware of \nwhat the penalty is if we lock ourselves into an amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  We will be saying to people that in the future, programs that you \nrelied on to sustain your family, to take care of your health care, to \ntake care of your child's education, to take care of your unemployment \ninsurance, may not be available, and if this country starts to slide \ninto a recession, we may go the whole route.\n  So, as we listen to the debate, it is very hard not to get to feeling \nrather sanctimonious about the side that we are on. I simply point out, \nas we talk about bipartisanship, and note that the Democrats are all of \nthe votes in opposition, the 34 contemplated votes in opposition to the \nbalanced budget amendment. Not the majority. The majority says, ``We \ncan't manage our own behavior; we have to be controlled by other \nstrictures, we have to be told that we are not allowed to do these \nthings,'' not that we were sent here, elected to this honorific body, \none of 100 out of 260 million people, who say we have the guts to stand \nup and make the decisions or pay the consequences.\n  We talk about courage. The courage is to say, ``No; we will accept \nthe voters' decision in the future when we run for election if we \ninsist on maintaining the posture as it is.'' Good news brought us to \nthis point, to where the budget deficit has been reduced by over 60 \npercent in the last 4 years, where job growth is up to 11 million new \njobs, as major company after major company shrinks down, closes its \ndoors, sends its jobs overseas. The good news is inflation is under \ncontrol, that our percentage of deficit to GDP is the smallest among \nthe advanced nations of the world and the envy of all the other \ncountries.\n  So, Mr. President, I would like to discuss four points that go to the \nheart of the debate and hope that we will stay the course as it is and \nsay no to a balanced budget amendment and say yes to the American \npeople, that we have the backbone to stand up to this debate and we are \nobliged to carry on your wishes.\n  First, the evidence is mounting and the public tide is turning \nagainst this amendment. Economist after economist, newspaper after \nnewspaper, academic after academic believes this amendment is bad for \nthe Nation, and for good reasons.\n  Two, we will balance the budget without a balanced budget amendment.\n  Third, the balanced budget amendment could wreak havoc with the \neconomy and the economic security of millions of Americans.\n  And four, it would be almost impossible to undo the damage of a \nbalanced budget amendment once the harm is done.\n  On the first point, the mounting opposition to the balanced budget \namendment is not confined to one group of Senators or Members of the \nHouse. It is also not limited, when we consider both bodies, to a \nparticular party or segment of the political spectrum.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, former CBO Director Rudy \nPenner, former Solicitors General Robert Bork and Charles Freid, not to \nmention our former and esteemed colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield, have \nall weighed in against the balanced budget amendment. Even last year's \nVice Presidential candidate, Jack Kemp, appearing on ``Meet the Press'' \ncalled the amendment ``a recipe for future disaster in this country.''\n  In the November 25, 1996, edition of Newsweek, conservative columnist \nGeorge Will wrote:\n\n       The Constitution should not be amended, unless there is a \n     compelling reason to do so.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Current conditions do not constitute a compelling reason.\n\n  In its November 15, 1996, lead editorial entitled ``An Amendment is \nPoor Substitute for Backbone,'' USA Today said:\n\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\n\n       Drafting a balanced budget amendment is a waste of \n     parchment. The history of balanced-budget measures show that.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, not exactly a bastion of liberal thought, \nlabeled the amendment a ``constitutional boondoggle,'' calling the \namendment a ``flake-out.'' The Journal went on to say:\n\n       The notion of amending the Constitution to outlaw budget \n     deficits is silly on any number of counts.\n\n  The Washington Post, too, had a scathing review of the balanced \nbudget amendment. In its January 30, 1997, editorial, ``No to a Bad \nAmendment,'' the Post concluded:\n\n       This is a fake show of strength and abuse of the \n     Constitution whose effect would be to harm the system of \n     government it purports to help.\n\n  The New York Times called it ``an idea that looked good in the \nabstract but is dangerous in the reality.''\n  And one of my home State newspapers in New Jersey, the Bergen Record, \ntagged the balanced budget amendment as ``a misguided measure'' and a \n``bad idea.''\n  On the economic policy front, Federal Reserve Chairman Dr. Alan \nGreenspan, who is known for choosing his words carefully, recently \nexpressed his reservations about the balanced budget amendment. At a \nJanuary 21 Budget Committee hearing, in response to a question that I \nasked on the balanced budget amendment, Dr. Greenspan said:\n\n       I have not been sympathetic to the specific details of most \n     balanced budget amendments largely because I think they are \n     very difficult to enforce, and I am terribly much concerned \n     about the issue of employing detailed economic policy within \n     the Constitution itself.\n\n  Mr. President, on January 30, along with some of my colleagues, I \njoined with a message from over 1,000--it was printed in the paper--\nleading economists, including 11 Nobel Prize winners in economics, in \nspeaking out against this amendment. At the press conference releasing \nthis statement, one of the participants asked a very good question. He \nsaid: ``Where are all of the conservative economists in favor of the \nbalanced budget amendment?''\n  The answer is that most of them are keeping a safe distance from it, \nand with good reason. The balanced budget amendment is fatally flawed \neconomic policy.\n  Mr. President, my second point is that we do not need this amendment.\n  During the 1980's and the early 1990's, those who supported the \namendment could point to historic increases in our annual deficits and \nthe persistent unbalanced budgets submitted by both Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents. Their concerns were understandable. In 1979, the \ndeficit was $41 billion. In 1979 --almost 20 years ago--it was $41 \nbillion or 1.7 percent of GDP. When President Clinton took office, the \ndeficit was $292 billion and was expected to crest at $347 billion in \n1997. The deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product stood at a \nwhopping 4.9 percent.\n  This staggering rise in the deficit led many to conclude that only a \nconstitutional amendment could force the Federal Government to be \nfiscally responsible. The proponents pointed to the tide of red ink \nflooding the Nation and argued for this stop-me-before-I-spend-any-more \namendment.\n  But that sense of hopelessness has been now proven wrong.\n  Since President Clinton took office, the deficit has gone down \nconsistently and dramatically. Last year, it fell to $107 billion and \n1.4 percent of GDP. It is now the lowest deficit, as a percentage of \nGDP, of any major industrialized country. President Clinton has a plan \nto make it balance in the year 2002, and it will be a real balanced \nbudget, not this raincheck of an amendment that may be--and it is a big \n``may be''--redeemed at a later date.\n  We have proven that the Congress and the President can be fiscally \nresponsible. I want to state in the strongest possible terms that we do \nnot need an outdated and dangerous constitutional gimmick to do the \njob. We can do the job on our own, and we will.\n  Mr. President, my third point is that the balanced budget amendment \nis a catastrophe waiting to happen. Perhaps most importantly, it would \nsubstantially aggravate economic downturn and it could turn a slowdown \ninto a recession and a recession into a great depression. For example, \nduring the Bush recession, real GDP fell 2 percent. If the balanced \nbudget amendment had been in place, real GDP might have declined by 4 \npercent or more.\n  Last year, the Treasury Department issued a very interesting report \non how a balanced budget amendment would have worsened the Bush \nrecession. I want to quote from it. They said:\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would force the government to \n     raise taxes and cut spending in recessions--at just the \n     moment that raising taxes and cutting spending will do the \n     most harm to the economy and aggravate the recession.\n\n  That is what the Treasury Department said.\n  During a recession, we need every tool at our disposal to deal with \nthe economic downturn. The Government must be nimble and responsive, \nbut the balanced budget amendment autopilot could send the economy into \na tailspin. One President tried to balance the budget during a \nrecession. His name was Herbert Hoover, and the recession quickly \nbecame the Great Depression.\n  I am also very concerned that the balanced budget amendment could \neliminate many of the automatic stabilizers, like unemployment \ninsurance that protects people during a downturn and cushions some of \nthe pain. Under current law, if unemployment goes up, so do \nunemployment insurance payments. That not only helps the workers and \ntheir families, but it moderates the impact of a recession on industry.\n  Secretary Rubin estimates that without our automatic fiscal \nstabilizers, unemployment in 1992 may have crested at 9 percent, \ninstead of 7.7 percent, which would have meant more than a million \nadditional jobs could have been lost.\n  It is possible that eventually we could have found the three-fifths \nsupermajority needed to waive the provisions to the amendment. But \nCongress moved slowly even without a supermajority requirement, and \nmost likely by the time we had reacted to the unfolding slowdown, the \ndamage would have been done.\n  Another major problem with this balanced budget amendment is that it \nincreases the likelihood that the Government will default on its debt. \nThe amendment includes language that requires a three-fifths majority \nvote in both Houses in order to raise the debt limit. This little-known \nprovision is extremely dangerous, as one can imagine, to have a small \nminority denying the ability to raise the debt limit when it could very \nwell be essential.\n\n  Mr. President, the Nation was taken to the brink of default in 1995. \nFortunately, cooler heads prevailed in that feverish atmosphere, and we \nwere able to raise the debt ceiling by a simple majority vote. But what \nwould have happened in 1995 if the supermajority rule had been in \nplace? A minority, as I said, in Congress could have caused a default \non our financial obligations.\n  A default would have disastrous consequences. The Treasury would be \nprevented, at least temporarily, from issuing checks for Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and veterans benefits. Our creditworthiness would \nbe shot. The Nation would suffer a profound and long-lasting increase \nin interest rates, harming all those who borrow. Homeowners making \npayments on adjustable rate mortgages would be especially hard hit. And \nthese higher interest rates would make it even harder to balance the \nbudget thereafter as the Nation would have to devote an even larger \nshare of the budget to interest on the national debt.\n  Mr. President, my fourth and last point is that there is no fail-\nsafe, sunset or automatic review built into this amendment. Congress \nhas passed far lesser measures that contain at the very least a sunset, \na time when this automatically stops for review. A case in point is the \nline-item veto that was enacted into law last year and contains a 9-\nyear sunset.\n  But this balanced budget amendment, that is by far one of the most \nsweeping and dangerous pieces of legislation ever to come before the \nCongress, has none. This is most troubling to this Senator, as it \nshould be to all Americans.\n  What would happen if the balanced budget amendment caused the type of \nproblems that I just outlined? Remember, this is not a simple piece of \nlegislation. This is a constitutional amendment. Imagine our Nation, \nwracked by recession or, even worse, depression. Millions are out of \nwork. Factories are\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\nshuttered. Bankruptcy and foreclosures are rampant. Because a \nconstitutional amendment is in force, Congress could not take the quick \nand responsive action that may be necessary, as we did during the Bush \nrecession. The only legal course of action left to us would be yet \nanother constitutional amendment to repeal this bad one and undo the \ndamage.\n  But hang on a minute. The last time that happened was in 1933, over \n60 years ago, when the 21st amendment was ratified repealing the 18th \namendment to the Constitution. The 18th amendment was prohibition. It, \ntoo, was supposed to save us from ourselves and legislate backbone. It \ntook 14 years to repeal it.\n  During a depression we could not wait that long. The American people, \nwho depend on our sound judgment and rely on our fiscal stewardship, \ncertainly cannot wait that long. And neither should we. We should vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me again emphasize that I agree with the need to \nbe fiscally responsible, and I am committed to working toward a \nbalanced budget. The President of the United States proposed a budget \nthat balances in the year 2002. We have a challenge. Let us examine it. \nAs the ranking Democratic Member of the Budget Committee, I believe we \ncan reach a balanced budget agreement this year. But we can do it \nwithout this flawed constitutional amendment.\n  The former majority leader of the Senate, Mike Mansfield, said that \nhe owed the people of his State more than an echo; he owed them his \njudgment. It is my best judgment, Mr. President, that this amendment is \nbad for the people of New Jersey, as it is bad for the people all \nacross our Nation. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and \noppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and see my colleague, who is the right stuff, from \nOhio about to take the floor. We will listen with interest.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1820-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1822-S1826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my comments to the many \nothers who have voiced their opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 1, \nthe balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, like the others before me, let me preface my comments \nby stating clearly that I support balancing the Federal budget. I have \nfor a long time. I wanted to balance the Federal budget clear back when \nit was only $1 trillion way back in the days when Jimmy Carter was \nstill President. I note that the total Federal debt at that time was \nstill under $1 trillion, totaled up for every President between George \nWashington and the end of the Carter years.\n  So I do not come lately to this idea of balancing the Federal budget. \nI wholeheartedly agree we need to exercise discipline to both balance \nthe budget and eliminate the deficit. But, Mr. President, I do not \nbelieve that changing our Constitution to require a balanced budget is \nin this country's best interests. For reasons I will outline, I believe \nthat a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget is far more \nlikely to cause more trouble, more harm, than good.\n  The amendment before the Senate would dramatically change the way our \npolitical process has worked for over 200 years. While there have been \ntimes when partisan fighting may have caused what many term gridlock, I \ndo not believe it is necessary or desirable to turn the fundamental \nconcept of our system of Government on its head.\n  Moreover, this amendment would ensure that gridlock is the rule \nrather than the exception. By requiring supermajorities in order to \nconduct the routine business of the Congress, this amendment overthrows \nthe concept of majority rule and empowers minority factions to hold the \nCongress and the country hostage. I submit that this type of minority \ncontrol of our Government is the exact evil the framers sought to \neliminate in the drafting of our Constitution. For this reason alone I \noppose the balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  It is not hyperbole when I say it is dangerous to our form of \nGovernment. Compounding the problem, Mr. President, is the fact that \nthe proponents of this amendment would topple one of the basic tenets \nof our Government, as I see it, for no reason at all.\n  First, from a historical perspective, the constitutional amendment is \nnot needed. The only time in this country's history outside of times of \nwar, the Great Depression, or recession that we have run up a \nsignificant deficit, one viewed as unmanageable, is in the preceding \ntwo decades through our time right now on the floor. We had the \nexperiments in supply-side economics back during the last 12 years \nbefore President Clinton came in, which ran our debt from $1 trillion \nup to nearly $5 trillion.\n  But we are no longer debating how we got into this situation we find \nourselves in, pointing fingers, or placing blame for a deficit so \nstaggering that it is beyond our comprehension or imagination. Instead, \na more productive political consensus does now exist to bring the \nbudget into balance and eliminate our deficit. So I do not think we \nneed a constitutional requirement to balance the budget. Congress and \nthe President, working together, have the ability, and now, I believe, \nthe will to bring our budget into balance.\n  Now, everybody describes this as being a political climate that is \noverly divisive. I agree. Congress in both Houses, on both sides of the \naisle, and the President, all profess to want a balanced budget, and I \ndo not doubt that. I think everyone does, and they want to eliminate \nthe huge deficit that is the legacy of the 1980s. Now we have different \nways we are looking at this thing, but we have made substantial strides \nin at least getting unanimous consent or unanimous opinion that this is \nsomething that we do have to deal with and do have to deal with now. \nBut there are still some very basic disagreements on how to achieve the \nbalance and how to reduce the deficit.\n  The Democrats and Republicans alike have proposed balancing the \nbudget by the year 2002, and the deficit has been reduced from 5.1 \npercent of our gross domestic product in fiscal year 1986 to only 1.4 \npercent in fiscal year 1996. Mr. President, 5.1 of GDP in 1986 down to \n1.4 percent just 10 years later in 1996. Right here and right now we \nare working toward achieving the very goal of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment without sacrificing our democratic form of \nGovernment to get there.\n  I might put those figures in a different term. When President Clinton \ncame in, our national budget deficit was running at $290 billion a \nyear. We passed on this very floor one of the toughest votes that many \nof us have made since being in the Senate. We passed during the \nReconciliation Act in August of 1993 the President's program, without \nhaving one single Republican vote--not a one in either the Senate or \nthe House of Representatives; not a one--and there were all sorts of \npredictions about what horrible things were going to happen to the \neconomy and the millions of unemployed that would be added to the \nrolls. What happened? Well, that did not happen and we have gone on \nwith a very, very, strong economy, and we have gone from a budget \ndeficit of $290 billion down to $107 billion for the latest estimate \nfor what 1996 will turn out to be.\n\n  We are in the middle of doing something right here. We are doing it \nright now with action that we have taken in this Congress. This is not \nsomething we are waiting for and hoping for some magic wand like a \nbalanced budget amendment. This is something that we are doing right \nnow and we are headed toward a balanced budget. I grant anyone that \nwants to discuss this, we, in fact, are looking forward to some times \nout here where it will be tougher to do that, tougher to balance the \nbudget. We know that. But that will require some equally tough votes on \nthis floor.\n  I hope when we make those tough votes on this floor we have support \nfrom the other side of the aisle that we did not have when we made that \nvote the summer of 1993. Now, in Treasury Secretary Rubin's words, a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment ``could turn slowdowns into \nrecessions, and average recessions into more severe ones,'' and he \nadded, ``it would seriously increase the risk of default on our \nnational debt.''\n  Those are quotes taken from Secretary Rubin's February 2, op-ed in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\nthe Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent that his Washington Post \nop-ed piece be printed at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. It is a thoughtful piece that makes a very powerful \nargument against this amendment.\n  Economists consider a balanced budget requirement to be what they \nwould call procyclical. In other words, adding to the cycle instead of \ncorrecting the cycle. It makes it worse. It is an economic autopilot. \nWhen revenues are slow coming into the Federal coffers because the \neconomy is slow, deeper spending cuts have to be made to make up for \nthe revenue shortfall in order to keep the budget in balance.\n  We have AFDC, food stamps, unemployment insurance, trade adjustments \nassistance, all of these things cut in during the beginning of a \nrecessionary period, and the farther we get into that approach to a \ndepression the more these programs sort of prime the pump or level \nthings off. There is no way that can be shown better than the chart \nthat has been on the floor here many, many times in the past. I will \nhold this up to illustrate, but we have seen this real economic growth, \nand you can see what happened on this chart. Way back in the 1880's and \n1900's on the wide cyclical swings and what happened post World War II, \nand we got some of the countercyclical programs in place.\n  Look how the economy has just leveled out in that period of time. The \neconomy has leveled out with no great huge swings down like we had \nduring the Great Depression when I was a boy back home in New Concord, \nOH. These are things that would happen again, we would get back into \nthe wild swings, if we, indeed, had the balanced budget amendment \npassed, because there is no other way to get the money to take care of \nthe requirements of a balanced budget amendment unless you either cut \nmany of those programs back or raise taxes. That is the other source of \nrevenue. If you did that, either one of those things would be exactly \nthe wrong thing to do and would add to the inclination, the trend, \ntoward a cycle that we want to stamp out, not make worse.\n  It is sort of a perverse, Look, Ma, no hands approach to budget, the \nexact wrong thing for a slow economy. That is why Secretary Rubin says \nthe balanced budget amendment ``can take an economic slowdown and turn \nit into a recession and then take a recession and make it even worse.''\n  I submit that is probably exactly an analysis that most economists \nwould show happened back during the days of Herbert Hoover when he \ntried to raise taxes to make sure we were not going into more of a \ndeficit position.\n  I cannot believe the proponents intend to force us into this kind of \nan economic straitjacket. I know the people across the country want a \nbalanced budget. So they say, ``Balanced budget amendment, oh, that \nsounds great, that sounds magical after the last 12 or 14 years when we \nhad budgets run sky-high and deficits running sky-high.'' So that \nsounds very attractive.\n\n  I think when the people of this country know what will be cut, they \nare informed about what will be cut, informed they will have difficulty \nwithin their communities with AFDC and food stamps and unemployment \ninsurance and things like that that are administered by the States, but \npartly with Federal dollars, then I think they would realize this is \nmore of a danger than anything they have come up against for some time.\n  Mr. President, I grew up during the Great Depression. I was about 10 \nor 12 years old in the depths of the Great Depression. During those 4 \nyears we had 20 percent of the country unemployed and 1 year when \nalmost 25 percent were unemployed. What happened? The country had hit a \nsituation it had never been able to handle before.\n  We always were proud in this country of families taking care of \nfamilies, of communities taking care of themselves. They didn't look \nfor outside help. In those days of the Great Depression, in the town of \nNew Concord, OH, my hometown, everybody planted big gardens. My dad \nrented an extra couple of acres, in addition to our big garden, and we \ngrew our own food and took it down and gave it to neighbors. We shared \nin those days. That's how we got by.\n  But everybody wasn't that fortunate. In some of our cities, we had \nsoup kitchens on the corner where people could get something to eat in \norder to keep them going. We used to see what we called the ``bums'' \ngoing by on Route 40, and that went right by our house, as a matter of \nfact. We called them the ``bums'' because they were people who were, \nquite often, walking or getting a ride in a railroad boxcar across \ncountry someplace. They would get off sometimes and come up to the \nhouse and knock on the back door and ask my mother if she could give \nthem something to eat. She never turned anyone down that came to that \nback door, I can guarantee you that. They were good people, down on \ntheir luck. I'm sure some were deadbeats that weren't much to begin \nwith. But they were Americans and they were hungry, and it was the \nGreat Depression and it was tough.\n  The movie reels of those days show the Okies heading west out of the \ndust pit in Oklahoma with the mattress on top of the car, because \ncommunities had lost control. What happened? Programs were put in by \nRoosevelt--programs that we still argue about on the floor of the \nSenate to this day--and they primed the pump. That is the point I want \nto make. They primed the pump. They may have been very wasteful for 1 \nor 2 years, but they primed the pump and got our economy going again. \nYou can make a million jokes about those time periods, but they are not \na joke, as far as I am concerned, because I remember them very well.\n  I remember one conversation between my dad and mother that I will \nnever forget as long as I live. We had finished dinner and I went in \nthe other room. I heard them quietly talking at the kitchen table, and \nthey were discussing whether the mortgage was going to be foreclosed on \nour home. You talk about striking terror in the heart of a 10-year-old \nboy--that was me. I didn't know where we were going to go. That was a \nbad one. Do you know what happened? FHA was put in, and it was possible \nto negotiate a mortgage then with that kind of a Government guarantee \nthat helped people like my dad and mom have a shot at keeping the home. \nLots of mortgages were foreclosed and people could not keep their \nhomes. Those are the days we were living in then.\n  The point I'm making is that the pump-priming efforts at that time \nworked. They largely put our economy back to work again and got it \ngoing again. It wasn't perfect and never had been completely healed \nuntil we got through World War II, I guess. That was the ultimate \nprimer of pumps, World War II. Anyway, the program of having \ncountercyclical funds that cut in when a recession starts or when a \ndownturn really gets serious is something that works. It works just as \nwell as it did back in those days of the Great Depression. It worked, \nobviously, from the time, since 1946, that we started the first of \nthese programs, and we have built on similar programs since that time \nthat really do work.\n  A balanced budget amendment would force us, in a time when we are in \ndeficit, to dig into those things and cut down on those funds, or raise \ntaxes, either of which would be exactly the wrong thing to do at that \ncycle of depression or near depression.\n  Another truly frightening consequence of the adoption of a balanced \nbudget requirement is the fact that it puts the creditworthiness of the \nUnited States of America at risk. Mr. President, this is a concept that \nI admit I find to be almost unimaginable. By requiring a supermajority \nto raise the debt ceiling, this constitutional amendment would allow 41 \nMembers of this body--not a majority, but a minority of the Senate--to \ntrade the creditworthiness of this country for the passage of \nlegislation that otherwise would not pass the Senate. In other words, \nit is what has been termed in the past as the ``tyranny of the \nminority.''\n\n  Try and imagine what default by the Government of the United States \nof America would do to the world's financial markets. I can't. I am not \nsaying this will happen necessarily, Mr. President, but I cannot \nsupport an amendment to our Constitution that would allow a minority to \ndictate legislation to a majority of the Senate or place our \ncreditworthiness at risk.\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\n  I want to take a minute to talk about what this amendment would do to \nour ability to make expenditures in order to respond to emergencies, \nnatural disasters, or even military operations, like Desert Shield, \nwhere we were not technically engaged in a military conflict. I will \nonly take a minute. This amendment prevents us from doing anything in \nthese situations without the agreement of a supermajority, for all \nintents and purposes--even for military. The practical implications of \nthis amendment are that Congress may be able to offer assistance to \ntornado or hurricane victims, or victims of any other natural disaster, \nif that disaster happens early in a fiscal year because only a majority \nvote would probably be necessary while we are still on budget, while \nthings are looking well. But if a disaster happens in the third or \nfourth quarter of the fiscal year, those disaster victims are on their \nown, unless three-fifths of the Congress agrees to provide some sort of \nassistance.\n  These same accounting practicalities will not be lost on our \npotential adversaries, either. I don't think it is too big a leap of \nlogic to say that Saddam Hussein would not have to be a financial \ngenius to figure out that if he wants to make another run at Kuwait, it \nis better to move the republican guard units in the third or fourth \nquarter of a fiscal year, because it will take the action of three-\nfifths of both Houses of Congress to approve funding for any military \noperations, which would bring the budget out of balance.\n  Mr. President, that is a completely unacceptable way for the United \nStates of America to act, I feel. That is the straitjacket that this \nbalanced budget amendment would put us into if it were passed.\n  So, to me, these are some very serious flaws in the constitutional \nrequirement. There are also separation of powers concerns raised by \nthis amendment. Let us take the situation in which it is discovered \nduring a fiscal year that the budget will not balance and that outlays \nwill exceed expenditures. If the Congress fails to approve additional \nspending by the required three-fifths majority, the President might \nfeel compelled to impound funds in order to bring the budget into \nbalance. Now, the President would decide what to fund and what not to \nfund. Mr. President, let me state that again. The President, in that \nsituation, would decide what to fund and what not to fund, because that \nis what he would be required to do by law. This represents a shift in \npower to the President that once rested with a simple majority in the \nCongress.\n  A similar troubling situation would be where the budget goes out of \nbalance or never gets into balance, and the President does not correct \nthe situation. Say the President doesn't want to do anything about \nthis. He says, OK, we are not going to correct it. What do we do? In \nthat circumstance, do you know what would happen? The courts would step \nin and decide which programs would be funded and which programs would \nnot be funded, again, taking away what has heretofore been a \ncongressional prerogative.\n  Then there are equity issues that argue against passage of the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. This amendment is a policy \ndecision not just about how to keep the books, but also about who will \nbenefit from Federal spending programs. It cannot be denied, and should \nnot be overlooked, that the Tax Code's tax breaks to individuals and \ncorporations are a type of Government spending. Not everyone realizes \nit, but when an individual's or corporation's tax burden is reduced by \na tax break, that is Government spending, and we should not forget \nthat. Eliminating these tax breaks is considered increasing revenues. \nUnder the balanced budget amendment before us, Congress can increase \nrevenues only by a majority vote of both Houses.\n\n  In contrast, cutting funding for programs requires only a majority \nvote by those present and voting or could even be passed on a voice \nvote. This is not an esoteric point, Mr. President, because in program \nterms, this amendment creates a presumption in favor of cutting funding \nfor programs because it is easier to do. I argue that this presumption \nfavors the more affluent in our society, because their Federal spending \nprograms, known as the Tax Code, are more difficult to cut than the \nspending programs of the less affluent.\n  That kind of an imbalance just plain is not fair.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I must mention the relationship that exists \nbetween this balanced budget amendment and Social Security. As the baby \nboom generation reaches retirement age, Social Security expenditures \nwill increase dramatically.\n  And despite the fact that some action has been taken in anticipation \nof this demographic shift in the population, this balanced budget \namendment would have us pay for baby boom Social Security out of \ncurrent year revenues and will likely break the bank.\n  Right now, we are paying more into Social Security so that we can \ngenerate surpluses to pay for the baby boomers when they reach \nretirement age. This approach is far sounder than expecting to pay this \nenormous expense out of a single year's revenues. I'm afraid that the \nonly way we would get there under a balanced budget requirement is \neither to reduce substantially the benefit baby boomers receive or cut \nradically other Government programs.\n  This is just another example of where, in my view, a constitutional \nrequirement to balance the budget in the manner proposed will do more \nharm than good.\n  Mr. President, we all want to eliminate the enormous deficits of the \nrecent past. We all want to bring the budget into balance and keep it \nin balance when it makes sense to do so. And, it would be a lot easier \nto stand here and have the American taxpayer believe that supporting \nthis legislation is a simple way to solve all of our problems.\n  But it's not the right thing to do, Mr. President. This legislation \nforces this country into a budgetary straightjacket and it limits \ndemocracy as we have known it for more than 200 years.\n  It's unsound from an economic perspective and it is unfair to the \nless wealthy. It puts this Nation's security at risk and it prevents us \nfrom responding to disasters.\n  And it could result in the elimination of virtually all Government \nprograms except Social Security once the baby boom reaches retirement \nage.\n  As I said, Mr. President, it would be easy to say that I support the \nlegislation before us because the concept of requiring a balanced \nbudget appeals to the average American--but only on a superficial \nlevel.\n  Regrettably, for the reasons I've outlined, the solution isn't so \nsimple and I cannot support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, let me just summarize once again.\n  We are on the way to a balanced budget now with the existing Federal \nbudgeting processes. We have been since the summer of 1993. I do not \nthink most Americans yet have gotten this fact driven home to them. \nThey are so accustomed to deficits coming out of Washington that they \ncan't believe that we really are heading toward a balanced budget. We \ncan't do it all in 1 year or we would destroy the economy. But what we \nhave done is, with the budget reconciliation bill that was passed in \nAugust 1993, we are proceeding step by step toward a balanced budget. \nIt has gone from a budget deficit of $290 billion a year when President \nClinton came into office down to an estimated $107 billion for the year \n1996. That is certainly measurable progress. It was estimated earlier \nthat would go down this year to about $40 billion. That may be revised \nup a little. We have to take some action to do that.\n  But to go the drastic step of a balanced budget amendment that would \ndeal so unfairly with so many people I think is something that we do \nnot want to do.\n  Mr. President, we have programs that are called countercyclical. \nThose programs cut in as the economy gets worse. They automatically cut \nin and dampen that slide and bring it back up again. It prevents things \nlike the deep Depression of the early thirties and all of the wild \nswings that used to occur back before we had some of these \ncountercyclical programs.\n  There is no way that you can get by it with a balanced budget \namendment. You are going to be cutting some of these programs like \nAFDC, Social Security, food stamps, unemployment insurance, maybe \nMedicaid, and trade adjustment assistance. Those are all\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\nthings that would be targets for potential cuts. The money has to come \nfrom somewhere. With the balanced budget amendment you have no choice \nbut to cut, or, if you want to keep the balance, raise taxes, either \none of which would be absolutely wrong on an economic cycle basis.\n  Mr. President, for all of those reasons, and others that I have not \neven mentioned here today but which Mr. Rubin refers to in his Outlook \npiece in the Washington Post that I asked to be placed in the Record, I \nthink it would be unwise to go for a balanced budget amendment that \nputs us in an economic straitjacket. I think we need to continue our \nefforts here on a bipartisan basis, on both sides, here and over in the \nHouse, and do the things that we see are working right now with our \nbudget. Continue those, and we can have a balanced budget if we all \nwork together on this without violating the Constitution or without \ngoing back into the Constitution, which will enable us to do it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 1997]\n\n                       The Balanced Budget Brawl\n\n                          (By Robert E. Rubin)\n\n       I spent 26 years on Wall Street before joining the Clinton \n     administration and came to believe deeply in the profound \n     importance of fiscal responsibility to our national economy. \n     I have now spent four years working in government to \n     implement this conviction, which members of both parties \n     share.\n       However, I have an equally strong conviction that a \n     balanced budget amendment is a threat to Social Security and \n     our economic health. it will expose our economy to \n     unacceptable risks and should not be adopted. Like the 11 \n     Nobel Prize-winning economists and 1,000 other economists who \n     signed a letter on Thursday to ``condemn'' the amendment, I \n     believe it is strongly against our national interest.\n       A balanced budget amendment would reduce our ability to \n     cope with recessions, risk putting budgetary decisions in the \n     hands of the courts and create risks with respect to Social \n     Security. Should we balance the budget? Yes. Do we need a new \n     constitutional amendment? No.\n       Throughout our history, with the exception of wartime and \n     the Depression, budget deficits--when they existed at all--\n     were generally small. In the 1970s and 1980s, they began to \n     rise and the cumulative federal debt grew sharply. But after \n     experiencing this period of fiscal indiscipline. I believe \n     the atmosphere in Washington has changed.\n       In 1993, we took an enormous step forward with the deficit \n     reduction program, which has cut the deficit from 4.7 percent \n     to 1.4 percent of gross domestic product. Last year, both the \n     administration and Congress proposed budgets that would \n     eliminate the deficit by 2002, and both are expected to do so \n     again this year.\n       There is also a new enforcement factor at work, which is \n     the emergence of global markets attuned to fiscal \n     responsibility. Those markets will punish a national that \n     does not address fiscal matters by imposing high interest \n     rates that can severely impair its economy.\n       Today, politically, historically and economically, the \n     forces are in place to balance the budget. And I believe we \n     will. However, there is a distinction between that and \n     passing a constitutional amendment. I believe the balanced \n     budget amendment proposal would subject the nation to \n     unacceptable economic risks in perpetuity.\n       First, it could turn slowdowns into recessions and average \n     recessions into more severe ones.\n       Second, it could prevent us from dealing expeditiously with \n     emergencies such as natural disasters or military threats.\n       Third, it would seriously increase the risk of default on \n     our national debt.\n       Fourth, the escape clauses it provides are likely to be far \n     from fully effective. The escape clauses would also enable a \n     minority in either the House or Senate to use its leverage to \n     subject the nation to unacceptable economic risks.\n       Fifth, a balanced budget amendment poses immense \n     enforcement problems that might well lead to the involvement \n     of the courts in budget decisions, unprecedented impoundment \n     powers for the president or the temporary cessation of all \n     federal payments, including, for example, Social Security. \n     Alternatively, the balanced budget amendment might be \n     unenforceable and therefore have no effect at all, \n     contributing to cynicism about the process of government.\n       For these and other reasons, a balanced budget amendment \n     poses unacceptable risks. Let me elaborate.\n       More severe recessions. As secretary of the treasury, I am \n     deeply concerned that a balanced budget amendment could \n     worsen recessions or downturns, first by eliminating \n     automatic stabilizers that protect people during a downturn \n     and, second, by forcing tax increases or spending decreases \n     precisely in the midst of a slowdown or recession when the \n     economy is already suffering from lack of demand.\n       Since World War II, we have made substantial progress in \n     reducing the toll of the boom-and-bust cycle through the \n     introduction of automatic fiscal stabilizers and effective \n     use of counter-cyclical fiscal policy. For example, if \n     unemployment rises, unemployment insurance payments rise as \n     well, moderating the economic impact of recessions and job \n     losses on companies workers and their families.\n       A balanced budget amendment would undo this progress and \n     put more people out of work during downturns by turning \n     off these stabilizers and foreclosing action to soften a \n     recession.\n       Even if Congress wanted to put back the stabilizers (an act \n     that would require a three-fifths vote), slowdowns and \n     recessions are hard to recognize or anticipate. Congressional \n     action would almost surely come, at the very best, months \n     later, by which time critical damage to the economy would \n     already have been done.\n       Inability to cope with crises. A balanced budget amendment \n     would also prevent us from dealing quickly and effectively \n     with major problems, from a second savings and loan crisis to \n     a second Hurricane Hugo to an escalating military threat.\n       For example, in September 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the \n     Carolinas, causing billions of dollars of damage. After \n     President Bush declared a disaster, Congress immediately \n     appropriated $2.7 billion in emergency assistance. Under the \n     balanced budget amendment, if the budget were otherwise in \n     balance, this could not be done until after a vote of 60 \n     percent in both houses.\n       Increased risk of default. As secretary of the treasury, I \n     am also concerned that limits on our flexibility would \n     increase the risk of default on the federal debt. The \n     possibility of default should never be on the table. Our \n     credit-worthiness is an invaluable national asset that should \n     not be subject to question.\n       Default on payment of our debt would undermine our \n     credibility with respect to meeting financial commitments, \n     and that in turn would have adverse effects for decades to \n     come. A failure to pay interest on our debt could raise the \n     cost of borrowing not only for government, but for private \n     borrowers including small businesses and homeowners.\n       Finally, as we saw in 1995 and 1996, the history of debt \n     limits shows that raising the statutory debt limit is never \n     an easy process. Yet right now it is possible to raise the \n     debt limit with a simple majority vote in both houses. By \n     requiring a three-fifths supermajority vote, the amendment \n     would make it far more difficult.\n       Potential for gridlock. Proponents argue that when \n     necessary, Congress would waive the provision of this \n     amendment with a three-fifths vote. But, in fact, the history \n     of Congress shows that it can be extremely difficult to \n     obtain such a majority, and would be even more difficult when \n     the issue is the momentous one of waiving a provision of the \n     Constitution.\n       While 60 votes are usually required in the Senate for \n     cloture--that is, ending debate and bringing a matter to a \n     vote--and the members have long honored the rights of a \n     minority, the Senate also recognizes that certain matters \n     should not be held up. It therefore permits a reconciliation \n     bill, which can be a vehicle for passing a budget or \n     increasing the debt limit, to be passed by a simple majority.\n       Under this amendment, 41 Senators or 175 House members \n     could hold our economy hostage to a special agenda.\n       Enforcement difficulties. A balanced budget amendment poses \n     immense enforcement problems. If the budget is not in \n     balance, there is no way to compel Congress and the president \n     to enact legislation to cut spending or raise taxes to make \n     it so. Yet there is also no way to compel enactment of \n     legislation to waive the provisions of the amendment. It is \n     not hard to imagine a situation in which a two-fifths \n     minority of Congress opposes tax increases, a different two-\n     fifths minority opposes spending cuts, and another two-fifths \n     minority opposes a waiver of the balanced budget amendment or \n     a raise of the debt limit. The amendment provides no method \n     for resolving such an impasse and it could well end up being \n     decided by the courts.\n       Some proponents have suggested that under these \n     circumstances, the president would stop issuing checks, \n     including those for Social Security. Alternatively, judges \n     might become deeply involved in determining budget policy, \n     including whether Social Security or Medicare checks should \n     be stopped. The president might also impound funds of his \n     choosing, including Social Security. Of course, the amendment \n     might just prove to be unenforceable, reducing respect for \n     the Constitution. All of these potential outcomes are \n     extremely undesirable.\n       A balanced budget amendment would embed economic policy \n     inflexibility into the Constitution in the face of unknowable \n     economic and political conditions 10, 20, 30 or 40 years from \n     today.\n       I have a deep commitment to the importance of deficit \n     reduction and fiscal discipline to our nation's economic \n     health, and I believe that we can put in place balanced \n     budget legislation this year. But I have an equally strong \n     conviction that a balanced budget amendment poses real risks \n     for our nation's economy. Congress should not adopt it.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, millions of people watch the Kentucky Derby \nbecause it is a spectacular moment of chance.\n  When the 123rd Run for the Roses takes place May 3, that's what the \nspectators will see--a riveting 2 minutes when anything can happen. \nWhat they won't see are the thousands of small details that go into \nmaking that moment one that goes down in sport's history.\n  While thousands of people work to make the Kentucky Derby and the \nfestival events a success, Kentuckians know that for the past 17 years \none man has stood out in his commitment and drive to nailing down every \nlast derby festival detail.\n  That man was Dan Mangeot, the Kentucky Derby Festival's long-time \npresident. He died in February, leaving behind a legacy and equally \nimportant, many, many devoted friends and colleagues.\n  Described by some as a ``legend'' and by others as a ``father \nfigure,'' Dan did the impossible. He took a legendary event and somehow \nmade it even better.\n  Under his management, attendance at derby festival events doubled to \n1.5 million, while the economic impact on the community grew from $17 \nmillion to $53 million.\n  When Dan decided to focus on something, the outcome was inevitably a \nhuge success. Whether it was selling more derby pins--going from a few \nthousand a year to 600,000 a year--or instituting a derby festival \nposter--a regular award winner--he knew how to deliver.\n  But Dan was about more than ringing up financial successes. He knew \nhow to create a sense of community ownership in an event. Every year \nthe entire community not only had a sense of pride in the festival \nactivities surrounding the derby, but a stake in seeing them succeed.\n  Dan couldn't imagine doing things differently. Community ownership \ntranslated into a board of directors truly representative of \nLouisville's diversity. And when it came to awarding contracts, he \nworked to ensure that minority-owned firms weren't shut out.\n  It's true the derby is about the fastest horses in the world. But for \nKentuckians it's also about showing the world the Commonwealth at her \nfinest.\n  And thanks to Dan that's what the world saw.\n  Mr. President, let me close by expressing my deepest thanks to Dan's \nfamily for sharing such a great man with us. I know I speak for all \nKentuckians when I tell Dan's family how very sad we are for their \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1826-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The \nSecond Supplementary Agreement, signed at Ottawa on May 28, 1996, is \nintended to modify certain provisions of the original United States-\nCanada Social Security Agreement signed at Ottawa March 11, 1981, which \nwas amended once before by the Supplementary Agreement of May 10, 1983.\n  The United States-Canada Social Security Agreement is similar in \nobjective to the social security agreements with Austria, Belgium, \nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The \nNetherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the \nUnited Kingdom. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited \ncoordination between the U.S. and foreign social security systems to \neliminate dual social security coverage and taxation, and to help \nprevent the loss of benefit protection that can occur when workers \ndivide their careers between two countries.\n  The Second Supplementary Agreement provides Canada with a specific \nbasis to enter into a mutual assistance arrangement with the United \nStates. This enables each Governments' Social Security agency to assist \nthe other in enhancing the administration of their respective foreign \nbenefits programs. The Social Security Administration has benefited \nfrom a similar mutual assistance arrangement with the United Kingdom. \nThe Second Supplementary Agreement will also make a number of minor \nrevisions in the Agreement to take into account other changes in U.S. \nand Canadian law that have occurred in recent years.\n  The United States-Canada Social Security Agreement, as amended, would \ncontinue to contain all provisions mandated by section 233 and other \nprovisions that I deem appropriate to carry out the provisions of \nsection 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4) of the Act.\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared \nby the Social Security Administration explaining the key points of the \nSecond Supplementary Agreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph \nexplanation of the effect of the amendments on the Agreement. Annexed \nto this report is the report required by section 233(e)(1) of the Act \non the effect of the agreement, as amended, on income and expenditures \nof the U.S. Social Security program and the number of individuals \naffected by the amended Agreement.

A bill to provide reimbursement under the Medicare Program \nfor telehealth services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                THE COMPREHENSIVE TELEHEALTH ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Harkin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Cochran, and Senator Inouye to introduce legislation to help \nimprove health care delivery in rural and underserved communities \nthroughout America through the use of telecommunications and telehealth \ntechnology.\n  Telehealth encompasses a wide variety of technologies, ranging from \nthe telephone to high-technology equipment that enables a surgeon to \nperform surgery from thousands of miles away. It includes interactive \nvideo equipment, fax machines and computers along with satellites and \nfiber optics. These technologies can be used to diagnose patients, \ndeliver care, transfer health data, read x-rays, provide consultation, \nand educate health professionals. Telehealth also includes the \nelectronic storage and transmission of personally identifiable health \ninformation, such as medical records, test results, and insurance \nclaims.\n  The promise of telehealth is becoming increasingly apparent. \nThroughout the country, providers are experimenting with a variety of \ntelehealth approaches in an effort to improve access to quality medical \nand other health-related services. Those programs are demonstrating \nthat telecommunications technology can alleviate the constraints of \ntime and distance, as well as the cost and inconvenience of \ntransporting patients to medical providers. Many approaches show \npromising results in reducing health care costs and bringing adequate \ncare to all Americans. For the first time, technological advances and \nthe development of a national information infrastructure give \ntelehealth the potential to overcome barriers to health care services \nfor rural Americans and afford them the access that most Americans take \nfor granted. But it is clear that our Nation must do more to integrate \ntelehealth into our overall health care delivery infrastructure.\n  Because I believe telehealth holds incredible promise for rural \nAmerica, I formed the Ad Hoc Steering Committee on Telemedicine and \nHealth Care Informatics to explore telehealth and related issues in \n1994. The purpose of the steering committee, which includes telehealth \nexperts from government, private industry, and the health care \nprofessions, is to evaluate Federal policies on telehealth and how to \nuse telecommunications technology more effectively to increase access \nto health care throughout America.\n  Throughout the last few years, as the steering committee held \nmeetings and policy forums, it became increasingly apparent that there \nis enormous energy and financial effort being devoted to telehealth \ntoday, both by government and private industry.\n  Because so many rural and underserved communities lack the ability to \nattract and support a wide variety of health care professionals and \nservices, it is important to find a way to bring the most important \nmedical services into those communities. Telehealth provides an \nimportant part of the answer. It helps bring services to remote areas \nin a quick, cost-effective manner, and can enable patients to avoid \ntraveling long distances in order to receive health care treatment.\n  Telehealth is already making a difference in my State. The University \nof North Dakota has a fiber optic two-way audio and video interactive \nnetwork that has been used to train students in areas like social work \nand medical technology. Recently, I had the opportunity to spend some \ntime with two of the premier telehealth systems in the State of North \nDakota. I was amazed at the capabilities of these systems. They \ncurrently supply speciality care to rural North Dakota clinics, manage \nchronic disease, lower administrative costs, and reduce the isolation \nfelt by rural and frontier practitioners.\n  Because telehealth is in many respects an emerging health care \napplication, it is particularly important to constructively capitalize \non efforts like these. My proposal attempts to facilitate this in a \nnumber of ways.\n  The first element of my proposal builds on current demonstration \nprojects to require the Health Care Financing Administration to put in \nplace a reimbursement system for telehealth activities under Medicare. \nMedicare reimbursement policy is an essential component of helping to \nintegrate telehealth into the health care infrastructure, and must be \nexplored. It is particularly important in rural areas, where many \nhospitals do as much as 80 percent of their business with Medicare \npatients. While rural areas are the most in need of telehealth \nservices, I also realize there are other groups that would greatly \nbenefit from an expansion of this service. That is why I am also asking \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a report that will \nexamine the impact of expanding telehealth reimbursement for nonrural \nMedicare beneficiaries who are home-bound or nursing home-bound and for \nwhom being transferred for health care services imposes a serious \nhardship.\n\n  The second element of this proposal asks the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to submit a report to\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\nthe Congress on the status of efforts to ease licensing burdens on \npractitioners who cross State lines in the course of supplying \ntelehealth services. Currently, consultation by almost any licensed \nhealth professional in this situation requires that the practitioner be \nlicensed in both States.\n  In talking with telehealth providers in my State, and with experts on \nthe ad hoc committee, I have been told repeatedly that this is one of \nthe most significant barriers to developing broad integrated telehealth \nsystems. More importantly, they tell me States have actively been using \nlicensure to close their borders to innovative telehealth practice. In \nthe past 2\\1/2\\ years, 11 States have taken legislative action to \nensure that out-of-State practitioners must be fully licensed in their \nState in order to provide telehealth services, even if they are fully \nlicensed in their own State. During a recent discussion with a \ntelehealth practitioner from my home State of North Dakota, I was told \nabout a group of telehealth specialists who, among their small group \npractice, were licensed in more than 30 different States. That means \nthey pay 30 different fees, are responsible for 30 different continuing \neducation requirements, and are overseen by 30 different regulatory \nbodies. This is a costly and burdensome procedure for many \npractitioners, but the burden falls particularly heavily on rural \npractitioners, who face long travel times to acquire continuing \neducation, and who frequently run on lower profit margins than urban \npractitioners.\n  While I am not prepared at this time to propose that the Federal \nGovernment get involved with professional licensure, I have asked the \nSecretary to study the issue and report to Congress yearly on the \nstatus of efforts by States and other interested organizations to \naddress this issue. This will allow us to reach out to the States and \nwork together to find solutions to cross-State licensure concerns. As \npart of this report, I have asked the Secretary to make recommendations \nto Congress, if appropriate, about possible Federal action to lower the \nlicensure barrier.\n  A third element of my proposal involves coordination of the Federal \ntelehealth effort. Vice President Gore has been making outstanding \ncontributions in the area of the information super- highway. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, in large part at the urging of \nthe Vice President, has created an informal interagency task force that \nis examining our Federal agency telehealth efforts. This group recently \ncompleted a report on telehealth that highlights current Federal \nactivities and also provides a thorough examination of many of the \nimportant issues in telehealth.\n  My bill attempts to use that task force to inventory Federal activity \non telehealth and related technology, determine what applications have \nbeen found successful, and recommend an overall Federal policy approach \nto telehealth. Many departments and agencies of the Federal Government \nare engaged in telehealth activity, including the Veterans' \nAdministration, Department of Defense, Department of Agriculture, \nOffice of Rural Health Policy, and many others. The more these agencies \nwork together to coordinate the Federal effort and consolidate Federal \nresources, the more effective the Federal Government will be in \ncontributing to telehealth in a positive way. I believe this is \nespecially important in light of the recent GAO report calling for an \nexpanded role for this group and more coordination of telehealth issues \nacross the Federal agencies. The efforts of this group, along with the \nongoing activities of the congressional ad hoc steering committee, will \nprovide a renewed focus for telehealth across the Federal Government. \nSuch coordination will also help protect the American taxpayer from \nunnecessary duplication of effort.\n  The fourth part of my proposal helps communities build homegrown \ntelehealth networks. It attempts both to build a telehealth \ninfrastructure and foster rural economic development and incorporates \nmany of the most important lessons learned from other grant projects \nand studies on telehealth from across the Federal Government.\n\n  Clearly, the scarcity of resources in many rural communities requires \nthat the coordination and use of those resources be maximized. My bill \nencourages cooperation by various local entities in an effort to help \nbuild sustainable telehealth programs in rural communities. It plants \nseed money to encourage health care providers to join with other \nsegments of the community to jointly use telecommunications resources. \nUsing a unique loan forgiveness program, it rewards telehealth systems \nthat supply appropriate, high-quality care while reducing overall \nhealth care costs.\n  Most importantly, it does not create a system where various \ntechnological approaches are imposed upon communities. Rather it \nenables potential grantees to determine user-friendly approaches that \nwork best for them. This homegrown approach to developing user-friendly \ntelehealth systems, as well as the preference for coordinating \nresources within communities, will help ensure the long-term viability \nof such programs after the grant expires.\n  Mr. President, my proposal is a sound first step in our national \nefforts to integrate telecommunications technology into the rapidly \nevolving health care delivery system. This bill is very similar to \nlegislation, S. 2171 I introduced late in the 104th Congress. I am very \nencouraged by the positive feedback I have received from telehealth \nnetworks across the country. Over the past few months, I have attempted \nto reach out to different groups and incorporate their ideas into this \nproposal. As a result, I have made several changes in the bill that I \nbelieve will make this a stronger proposal. But, as with any complex \nissue, I understand that some may prefer different approaches. By \nintroducing this legislation early in the 105th Congress, I hope to \nsend a message to all interested parties that now is the time to come \nforward with creative solutions to these important issues. It is my \nhope that comprehensive telehealth legislation can be attached to any \nMedicare reform legislation enacted in this Congress so we can improve \naccess to needed health care services for rural and underserved \npopulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Hospitals, clinics, and individual health care \n     providers are critically important to the continuing health \n     of rural populations and the economic stability of rural \n     communities.\n       (2) Rural communities are underserved by specialty health \n     care providers.\n       (3) Telecommunications technology has made it possible to \n     provide a wide range of health care services, education, and \n     administrative services between health care providers, \n     patients, and administrators across State lines.\n       (4) The delivery of health services by licensed health care \n     providers is a privilege and the licensure of health care \n     providers and the ability to discipline such providers is \n     necessary for the protection of citizens and for the public \n     interest, health, welfare, and safety.\n       (5) The licensing of health care providers to provide \n     telehealth services has a significant impact on interstate \n     commerce and any unnecessary barriers to the provision of \n     telehealth services across State lines should be eliminated.\n       (6) Rapid advances in the field of telehealth give Congress \n     a need for current information and updates on recent \n     developments in telehealth research, policy, technology, and \n     the use of this technology to\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\n     supply telehealth services to rural and underserved areas.\n       (7) Telehealth networks can provide hospitals, clinics, \n     health care providers, and patients in rural and underserved \n     communities with access to specialty care, continuing \n     education, and can act to reduce the isolation from other \n     professionals that these health care providers sometimes \n     experience.\n       (8) In order for telehealth systems to continue to benefit \n     rural and underserved communities, the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et \n     seq.) must reimburse the provision of health care services \n     from remote locations via telecommunications.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To mandate that the Health Care Financing \n     Administration reimburse the provision of clinical health \n     services via telecommunications.\n       (2) To determine if States are making progress in \n     facilitating the provision of telehealth services across \n     State lines.\n       (3) To create a coordinating entity for Federal telehealth \n     research, policy, and program initiatives that reports to \n     Congress annually.\n       (4) To encourage the development of rural telehealth \n     networks that supply appropriate, cost-effective care, and \n     that contribute to the economic health and development of \n     rural communities.\n       (5) To encourage research into the clinical efficacy and \n     cost-effectiveness of telehealth diagnosis, treatment, or \n     education on individuals, health care providers, and health \n     care networks.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Health care provider.--The term ``health care \n     provider'' means anyone licensed or certified under State law \n     to provide health care services who is operating within the \n     scope of such license.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n        TITLE I--MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, as this Congress moves forward to \nstrengthen and secure the Medicare Program for future generations, \nthree issues are crystal clear.\n  First, we must have the political will to modernize Medicare to \nreflect both the quality and the efficiency of private health care \nplans now serving most working Americans, and in particular the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program which many Members of Congress, their \nstaff and families, and other Federal employees enjoy.\n  Second, we must maintain our commitment to current and future \nMedicare beneficiaries by preserving a basic, high-quality portfolio of \nhealth services for all enrollees, irrespective of their income, where \nthey live, or their particular health circumstances.\n  Third, we must begin the transformation of Medicare financial \nfoundations in a way that is first fair to all beneficiaries, and \nsecond insures that Medicare will be there for our children and their \nchildren, and that it will not bust the Federal budget in the bargain.\n  I believe that the legislation I introduce, today, The Medicare \nModernization and Patient Protection Act of 1997, meets all three of \nthese primary goals. While fully preserving traditional, fee-for-\nservice Medicare, this legislation also will create an array of new, \nhigh-quality, cost-efficient health plans for Medicare beneficiaries, \nand offer those enrollees positive incentives to try them. It will \nprovide new protections and consumer rights to Medicare beneficiaries \nin capitated health plans. It will mandate new penalties and \nenforcement mechanisms to eradicate fraud and abuse now stripping \nbillions of dollars per year from the program. And it will create new \nsupport systems for some of Medicare's most desperately ill and poor \nbeneficiaries, and their families.\n  Finally, through new cost-conscious management systems and a firm \nfiscal control mechanism, this plan will reduce Medicare cost growth by \napproximately $100 billion over the next 5 years, and with financial \nconstraints that will continue to control runaway spending growth after \nfiscal year 2002.\n  The Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act will offer \nseniors more health plan choices by eliminating the huge variability in \ncapitated payments to health plans in counties around the nation. At \nthe same time, it will raise the minimum payment to 80 percent of the \nnational average payment, leveraging higher reimbursements and I \nbelieve more plan offerings in up to 20 percent of our counties.\n  This proposal also establishes an outlier fund, an account fueled by \nwithholding up to five percent of payments to Medicare health \nmaintenance organizations. Medicare managers would have discretion to \nwithhold those payments from plans which are being over-compensated by \nthe HMO payment formula, and disburse those funds in the form of extra \npayments to plans which have avoided risk selection in their \nbeneficiary recruitment and as a result are providing services to \nsicker enrollees with above-average health care costs. Compared to the \nmeat-cleaver approach of reducing all plan payments from the current 95 \npercent of local average health care costs, to 90 percent, this is a \nsurgical solution to two significant Medicare managed care plan \nproblems: (a) plan overpayments and (b) plans which avoid enrolling \nolder, frailer beneficiaries because they cut profit margins.\n  At the end of the year, any funds remaining in this account would be \nrolled back into the Medicare hospital insurance budget.\n  At the same time, this bill reforms current rules for Medicare \nsupplemental insurance, or Medigap policies, requiring that such \npolicies must be issued to any eligible beneficiary at any time. This \nchange will encourage more seniors to try capitated plans, because they \nknow the Medigap safety net always will be available to them.\n  Seniors would be protected from unfair denial of service decision and \nother health plan abuses through a strengthened and streamlined appeals \nprocess. Also, seniors would receive more informative and easily \ncomparable information on health plans in their communities, and \nthrough the mail on a regular basis through annual enrollment fairs.\n  The legislation also would require the collection of customer service \nand satisfaction data, and performance information to be used in \nqualitative analysis by Medicare to produce published report cards on \nplan performance, and help consumers make kitchen-table assessments of \ntheir plan options.\n  By Federal statute, plans also would be barred from muzzling doctors \nand other health care practitioners in their conversations with \npatients about their medical condition and all treatments appropriate \nto their case.\n  New criminal and civil penalties are created for practitioners and \nplans who rip off the system.\n  Programs for hospice care, Alzheimer's respite care, and prospective \npayment for both home care and skilled nursing care are added to \nMedicare. The legislation requires Medicare to study and make \nrecommendations on the more extensive and appropriate use of community \npharmacy, telemedicine and so-called social health maintenance \norganization plans for dual eligibles in its portfolio of services to \nbeneficiaries.\n  The fiscal integrity portion of this bill would set overall part A \nand part B spending limits for each of the next 5 years. These overall \nspending limits would include target spending allotments for each of \nthe several major areas of Medicare activity: doctors, hospitals, \ndiagnostic services, nursing homes, and the like.\n  Typically, Medicare has sought to control costs in these areas in the \npast by rolling back reimbursement rates for goods and services. \nProviders, however, have watered down Medicare's attempts at thrift by \nincreasing volume in the face of lower per-service payments. Too often \nthis has led to waste and inefficiency, with providers ordering \nprocedures and services that beneficiaries really don't need, crippling \nMedicare with unnecessarily high costs.\n  With $100 billion in cumulative savings expected in 5 years, my \nproposal would require that Medicare practitioners live within the \nbudget's ceiling by mandating reduced reimbursements if cumulative \nbillings otherwise would bust an individual service sector's annual \nspending plan.\n  Despite these restraints, Medicare fee-for-service providers will \nenjoy generally healthy annual increases under this proposal. \nBeneficiaries should see no change in the level or quality of care they \nreceive. Expensive, unnecessary care, however, could be sharply \ncurtailed.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this Congress should not as a first \nstep relinquish Medicare restructuring to a special commission. I think \nmost of us have an acute awareness of what is needed to fix the program \nfor the long term. Some steps will be harder than others. But as the \nold Chinese proverb reminds us, a trip of a thousand miles begins with \nthe first step.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with me that the Medicare \nModernization and Patient Protection Act is that good first step, and \njoin with me in co-sponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1833]]\n\nThe Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act of 1997--Section-\n                          by-Section Analysis\n\n\n  title i: promoting competition, quality, and beneficiary choice in \n                                medicare\n\n     Section 1: Short title; table of contents, definitions.\n     Section 2: Findings\n     Section 101: Establishment of Plan Inprovement and \n         Competition Office\n       Subsection (a), establishes an office within Health Care \n     Financing Administration to carry out several of the pro-\n     quality, pro-consumer mandates of the legislation.\n       Subsection (b), defines duties.\n     Subsection 102: HMO and Competitive Pricing Demonstration \n         Projects\n       Subsection (a), directs the Secretary to conduct \n     demonstration projects for competitive bidding between HMO \n     contractors in counties in which the AAPCC rate is 120 \n     percent of the national average AAPCC rate, or higher.\n       Subsection (b), directs reports to Congress.\n       Subsection (c), waives certain requirements under the \n     Social Security Act.\n       Subsection (d), requires that the projects be conducted \n     within existing department funding.\n     Subsection 103: Medigap amendments\n       Subsection (a), guarantees issues of Medicare supplemental \n     insurance regardless of preexisting health conditions.\n       Subsection also requires community rating of Medigap \n     policies. Further, this subsection guarantees offer of \n     Medigap coverage to persons who leave Medicare risk plans for \n     any one of several reasons, including voluntary disenrollment \n     at any time during the first 12 months of enrollment in a \n     risk plan (and had not been in a risk plan, earlier).\n       Subsection (b), limits exclusion from coverage due to pre-\n     existing health conditions.\n       Subsection (c), clarifies non-discrimination requirements \n     during initial enrollment periods.\n       Subsection (d), extends the six-month initial enrollment \n     period to non-elderly Medicare beneficiaries.\n       Subsection (e), sets effective dates.\n       Subsection (f), defines transition rules including a \n     directive that the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners amend its Model Regulation to reflect Medicare \n     supplemental insurance policy changes required by the \n     section.\n\n\n             title ii: increasing medicare coverage options\n\n                   Subtitle A: Risk Plan Improvements\n\n     Section 201: Changes in medicare managed care program\n       Subsection (a), HMO payments, amends the current formula \n     for determining local HCFA annual reimbursement rate \n     increases for persons insured by risk-sharing plans providing \n     both Part A and Part B benefits (Medicare Risk plans). The \n     reformulation would, beginning in 1998, set a new minimum \n     payment ``floor'' requiring that HCFA pay no plan less than \n     80 percent of the national average for payments to all plans \n     in 1997. For each community, payment increases in subsequent \n     years would be determined by selecting the highest figure \n     from three alternative formulas; (1) 102 percent of the \n     previous year's rate, (2) in 1999, 80 percent of the 1998 \n     national average, and in 2000 and in subsequent years \n     increasing the rate by the previous year's national average \n     growth rate for Medicare managed care plan reimbursements, or \n     (3) an increase determined by a ``melded'' rate of local and \n     national managed care average reimbursements, according to \n     the following formula:\n       1998: area specific percentage of increase is determined by \n     the sum of 80 percent of the local average increase in the \n     average adjusted per capita cost (AAPCC) in previous year, \n     and 20 percent of the national AAPCC increase.\n       1999: area specific percentage determined by the sum of 75 \n     percent of the local AAPCC increase in the previous year, and \n     25 percent of the national AAPCC increase.\n       2000: area specific percentage determined by the sum of 70 \n     percent of local AAPCC increase in previous year, and 30 \n     percent of the national AAPCC increase.\n       2001: area specific percentage determined by the sum of 65 \n     percent of the local AAPCC increase in previous year, and 35 \n     percent of the national AAPCC increase.\n       2002: area specific percentage determined by the sum of 60 \n     percent of the local AAPCC increase in previous year, and 40 \n     percent of the national AAPCC increase.\n       2003, and in each subsequent year: area specific percentage \n     determined by the sum of 60 percent of the local AAPCC \n     increase in previous year, and 40 percent of the national \n     AAPCC increase.\n       This section also contains certain budgetary protections \n     for beneficiaries receiving treatment for end-stage renal \n     disease, and for high-cost-growth metropolitan counties.\n       Subsection (b) creates additional quality standards for \n     section 1876(c)(6) of the Act, requiring Medicare managed \n     care plans to meet new standards established by the Secretary \n     of HHS in consultation with private accreditation \n     organizations, and addressing such issues as ongoing quality \n     assurance programs stressing (1) health outcomes, and (2) \n     providing review by physicians and other certified health \n     professionals.\n       Plans meeting these additional standards may waive the \n     requirement of at least 50 percent non-Medicare beneficiary \n     enrollment for participation as a Medicare Risk contractor.\n       Subsection (c) requires coordinated enrollment and \n     disenrollment periods for Medicare managed care plans, \n     similar to so-called ``open season'' periods for Federal \n     Employee Health Benefit Program plans.\n       Subsection (d) sets service area requirements for \n     participating plans, including requirements that plans \n     provide enrollment within all of a metropolitan statistical \n     area if such organization provides enrollment in any part of \n     the metropolitan area. Some limited exclusions may be \n     allowed.\n       Subsection (e) provides other enhanced enrollee protections \n     involving provision of emergency room care and services, \n     renal dialysis, and reimbursement of services outside the \n     plan's services area (specific to renal disease).\n       Subsection (f) allows the Secretary in certain instances to \n     make additional payments to plans insuring certain \n     individuals, for reasonable costs related to anomalies in \n     specific service areas.\n       Subsection (g) provides for intermediate sanctions against \n     plans for program violations, short of termination. These \n     intermediate sanctions may include civil penalties of not \n     more than $25,000 per offense, and suspension of new \n     enrollment. The section also provides for reasonable notice \n     to the organization and a right of appeal.\n       Subsection (h) requires that Medicare managed care plans \n     must submit to standardized quality review through \n     independent organizations to determine and demonstrate that \n     they have maintained the new, higher quality performance \n     levels required under this legislation. The section also \n     requires a review of plans' quality performance by the U.S. \n     General Accounting Office, no later than July 1998.\n       Subsection (i) sets an effective date for Section 101 as \n     the contract years beginning with 1998.\n     Section 202: Quality report cards and comparative reports\n       Subsection (a) requires that beginning in calendar year \n     1998, the Secretary will begin distribution of quality report \n     cards to beneficiaries on eligible managed care plans and on \n     Medicare supplemental policies, including a comparison of \n     benefits, costs and quality indicators developed under this \n     section.\n       Subsection (b) directs the Secretary to develop quality \n     indicators on (1) disenrollents statistics, (2) care \n     outcomes, (3) population health status, (4) appropriateness \n     of care, (5) consumer satisfaction, (6) access to care, \n     including waiting time for scheduled appointments and access \n     to emergency room care, and (7) preventative care programs.\n       Subsection (c) directs the Secretary to develop \n     standardized reports comparing plans on the basis of (1) \n     monthly premiums, (2) choice of doctors, (3) choice of \n     hospitals, (4) service area, (5) emergency room care \n     coverage, (6) hospital charges, (7) physician charges, (8) \n     prescription drug coverage, (9) ambulance coverage, (10) \n     coverage of routine eye exams and eyeglasses, (11) coverage \n     of skilled nursing facilities and home health care, (12) \n     coverage of hearing exams and hearing aids, (13) coverage of \n     mental health therapy, (14) the number of beneficiaries in \n     the plan, and several other indicators of plan coverage.\n       Subsection (d) requires that plans divulge to the Secretary \n     information required to complete this comparative analysis. \n     The Secretary also is empowered to collect, on a pro rata \n     basis, costs from plans to carry out the requirements of this \n     section.\n       Subsection (e), definitions.\n     Section 203: Preemption of state laws restricting managed \n         care\n       Subsection (a) preempts states from establishing care \n     mandates for health insurance coverage in Medicare.\n       Subsection (b) preempts state laws restricting managed care \n     arrangements. This preemption would lift state laws which (1) \n     prohibit or limit carriers from offering incentives to \n     enrollees to use services of participating providers, (2) \n     prohibit or limit carriers from limiting services to \n     participating providers, and other state restrictions on \n     managed care plans.\n       This subsection also includes a number of definitions.\n       Subsection (c) preempts state laws restricting utilization \n     review programs. However, the section specifies that this \n     preemption exempts laws preventing denial of lifesaving \n     medical treatment pending transfer of enrollees to another \n     health care provider.\n       Subsection (d), effective date, January 1, 1998.\n     Section 204: Appeals\n       Subsection (a) requires all Medicare Risk contractors to \n     designate an independent ombudsman to assist enrollees in \n     exercising rights to dispute plan decisions, and in other \n     grievances.\n       This section also directs the Secretary to establish no \n     later than January 1, 1998, an office for the collection of \n     data one each plan pertaining to decisions on the \n     disallowance of services to beneficiaries, in full or in \n     part.\n       Subsection (b) requires that plans provide enrollees with \n     clear and understandable description of grievance and appeal \n     procedures.\n       Subsection (c) creates an expedited HCFA grievance and \n     appeals procedure.\n     Section 205: Medicare HMO Enrollment Fair\n       Subsection (a), mandates that the Secretary require and \n     coordinate annual enrollment fairs in each Medicare payment \n     area to inform beneficiaries of plans offered by health care \n     organizations.\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\n            Subtitle B: Maintaining Fee-for-Service Program\n\n     Section 211: Failsafe budget mechanism\n       Subsection (a) requires payment adjustments to achieve \n     specified Medicare targets. Sets annualized, five-year \n     spending targets for Medicare, Parts A and B, according to \n     budget estimated under Clinton Administration plan.\n       Includes a ``fail-safe'' budget mechanism allowing the \n     Secretary to undertake proportional reductions in provider \n     reimbursements if spending targets otherwise would be \n     exceeded by billing volume.\n     Section 212: Maintenance of part B premium at current \n         percentage of part B program costs\n       Subsection (a) maintains monthly premium setting formula at \n     the current percentage of actual Part B program costs.\n       Subsection (b) sets effective date, applying to premiums \n     paid for months beginning with January 1997.\n\n\ntitle iii--promotion of programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly \n     (pace) and of social health maintenance organizations (shmos)\n\n     Section 301: Definitions\n     Section 302: Expanding the availability of qualified \n         organizations for frail elderly community projects \n         (program of all-inclusive care for the elderly (pace))\n       Subsection (a) directs the Secretary to establish PACE \n     provider status for public or nonprofit organizations to \n     provide comprehensive health care services, on a capitated \n     basis, to frail elderly patients who are at risk of \n     institutionalization in skilled nursing facilities, and who \n     would qualify for benefits under both Medicare and Medicaid. \n     Such organizations would qualify for three-year periods, with \n     re-qualification procedures. Requirements for assuming \n     financial risk are specified.\n       The subsection, the Secretary would be required to act on \n     applications within 90 days.\n       Subsection (b) provides for terms and conditions of \n     approval, equivalent to those contained in conditions of \n     approval for an On Lok waiver, section 603C of the Social \n     Security Amendments of 1983, as extended by OBRA 1985. The \n     section also defines other entry requirements, and certain \n     responsibilities of the Secretary to assure quality and \n     feasibility of the plan.\n       Subsection (c) defines eligibility for participation by \n     PACE plans.\n       Subsection (d) sets reimbursement to the organization \n     through a capitation basis.\n       Subsection (e) applies Section 302 statutes to plans \n     currently operating under an On Lok waiver.\n       Subsection (f) applies current Social Security Act statutes \n     relating to income and resources of institutionalized spouses \n     to any individual receiving services from an organization \n     operating as a PACE provider.\n       Subsection (g) allows participating plans to also offer \n     services to frail populations other than the elderly, except \n     where the Secretary finds provision of such services may \n     impair the ability of the organization's performance as a \n     SHMO.\n     Section 303: Application of spousal impoverishment rules\n       Applies protections against spousal impoverishment to \n     couples receiving services through PACE organizations.\n     Section 304: Permitting expansion and making permanent SHMO \n         waivers\n       The section lifts limitations on how many SHMOs may be \n     approved by the Secretary, as well as limitations on how many \n     individuals may be enrolled in any such project.\n     Section 305: Repeals; effective date; and application to \n         existing waivers\n       Subsection (a) repeals certain federal statues which are \n     non-conforming to the intent and purpose of this legislation.\n       Subsection (b) requires that the Secretary within nine \n     months of enactment make effective interim final regulations \n     on the provisions of this title.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Software \nExport Equity Act. I am pleased to be joined in this bipartisan effort \nby my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, Senators Max Baucus, \nDon Nickles, John Breaux, as well as Patty Murray, Slade Gorton, Dianne \nFeinstein, and Barbara Boxer. Identical legislation has been introduced \nin the House by Representative Jennifer Dunn and a strong bipartisan \ngroup of her House colleagues.\n  This bill highlights an issue that I have mentioned many times in the \nFinance Committee. Currently, the section of the Internal Revenue Code \noutlining what qualifies for foreign sales corporation [FSC] treatment \nand tax benefits is unclear and has left out software that is exported \noverseas. Our bill would clarify the treatment of software.\n  What is a foreign sales corporation? It is a corporate entity \nestablished by Congress to help facilitate the export of American made \ngoods to foreign markets. The FSC rules allow a corporation a tax \nbenefit on a portion of its earnings generated by the sale or lease of \nexport property. It is consistent with sound U.S. policy to promote \nU.S. exports.\n  When the foreign sales corporation statute was enacted in 1971, the \ncomputer software industry was relatively new. The original FSC statute \nwas drafted with the intent that only U.S. job-creating property \nmanufactured or produced in the United States and sold or leased \noutside the United States qualifies for export benefits. The FSC rules \nare designed to assist U.S. exporters in competing with products made \nin other countries that have more favorable rules for taxing exports.\n  Mr. President, it is in our best interests to encourage the export of \nAmerican goods and services. The United States is currently the world \nleader in software development, employing approximately 2 million \npeople in software development jobs. As this industry continues to \ngrow, much of the expansion of the industry is due to the growth of \nexports. However, as the software industry has grown in response to \nglobal markets, the tax laws have not kept up.\n  Currently, the statute allows films, tapes, records or similar \nreproductions to qualify for FSC benefits. However, because of a narrow \ninterpretation of the FSC rules, software does not generally receive \nthis export incentive.\n  Let me provide an example that I have shared before with my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee. Suppose you have two CD-ROM's--one \ncontaining a musical recording, the other containing dictionary \nsoftware with musical recordings included. The two look the same and \nare very similar except for the software. If the you export a master \nCD-ROM of the musical recording to another country for reproduction, \nthe export qualifies for FSC benefits. However, if you export a master \ncopy of the software CD-ROM with a license to make additional copies, \nyou will be denied FSC benefits. This is simply wrong and unfair. In an \nage where many computer products are multipurpose--with music and \nsoftware--this makes no sense.\n  Now this problem is not beyond repair. The Treasury Department does \nnot believe that it has the authority to issue regulations to correct \nthis problem. However, they support the legislative fix I am \nintroducing today. The FSC statute must be clarified to allow exported \nsoftware with the right to reproduce to receive fair and equitable \ntreatment.\n  Mr. President, this problem hits home in my State of Utah. There are \na number of software manufacturers in Utah that have developed a \nworldwide presence. Watching musical and other intangible items receive \nFSC treatment while highly sophisticated software is left out, is \nsimply discouraging for these sometimes small software companies. This \nlegislation corrects this inequity and reestablishes our commitment to \npromoting American competitiveness.\n  I am please to introduce the Software Export Equity Act today. I urge \nall of my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort and cosponsor \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 387\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Software Export Equity \n     Act''.\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF APPLICATION OF FOREIGN SALES \n                   CORPORATION RULES TO SOFTWARE.\n\n       Subparagraph (B) of section 927(a)(2) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to property excluded from \n     eligibility as FSC export property) is amended by inserting \n     ``, and software, whether or not patented'' after ``for \n     commercial or home use''.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch, \nSenator Baucus, and Senator Breaux in the introduction today of the \nSoftware Export Equity Act, a bill to provide that software exports \nreceive the same tax treatment as other products made in the United \nStates. Our bill will help ensure that the U.S. software industry, the \ncurrent world leader, maintains their competitive edge.\n  The Software Export Equity Act simply clarifies that software \nproduced in the United States for export fully qualifies for foreign \nsales corporation [FSC] export incentives the same as most other U.S. \nproducts. The bill proposes no special or unique benefit for the \nsoftware industry, just equal and fair treatment under existing law.\n  The FSC statute and its predecessor, the domestic international sales \ncorporation statute, were enacted by Congress to help U.S. companies \ncompete abroad. The FSC statute provides a tax exemption of up to 5 \npercent of a company's income attributable to export sales of U.S.-made \nproducts. Only those products manufactured or produced in the United \nStates for export to a foreign market qualify for FSC benefits to \nensure domestic economic growth and job creation.\n  Unfortunately, the fledgling software industry was not specifically \nconsidered by Congress when the FSC statute was enacted, and subsequent \nTreasury Department rules disqualified them for FSC benefits. Indeed, \nTreasury's narrow interpretation allows nearly identical products, \nexported in an identical manner, such as movies and compact disc \nrecordings, to fully qualify for FSC benefits, but not software.\n  Repeated attempts to convince the Treasury Department to modify their \nrules have failed, Mr. President, leaving only the alternative of \namending the law. Fortunately, this issue has broad bipartisan support \nin the House and Senate and was recently included in President \nClinton's fiscal year 1998 budget request.\n  Employing over 2 million people and exporting more than $26 billion \nin software each year, the U.S. software industry is an important and \ngrowing part of our economy. They lead the world in the development of \ninnovative products and cutting-edge technology. In today's competitive \nglobal economy, incentives to encourage firms to develop products here \nfor export abroad are vitally important. The enactment of this \nlegislation will assure that we provide these incentives to all U.S. \nproducts equally.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nNickles, and Mr. Baucus in introducing the Software Export Equity Act. \nThis legislation is extremely important to maintaining the U.S. \nsoftware industry's competitiveness and the growth of high-skilled, \nhigh-paying software industry jobs in the United States. The Software \nExport Equity Act has broad bipartisan support and was included in the \nfiscal year 1998 budget that the President submitted to Congress. I \nurge my colleagues to join with us in support of swift enactment of \nthis legislation.\n  The U.S. software industry is a vital and growing part of the U.S. \neconomy, creating many new high-paying, high technology jobs in the \nUnited States. Much of the expansion of the software industry is due to \nthe growth of export sales. The Software Export Equity Act clarifies \nthe application of the foreign sales corporation [FSC] rules to exports \nof U.S. software.\n  The FSC rules were enacted to address the competitive disadvantages \nfaced by U.S. exporters vis-a-vis exports from other countries that \nhave more favorable tax systems, particularly those that effectively \nexempt export sales from home country tax. The goal of the FSC \nprovisions was to prevent manufacturing and production jobs from moving \nout of the United States. Unfortunately, a narrow IRS interpretation of \nthese rules precludes exports of U.S. software from fully qualifying \nfor the FSC incentive. I am very concerned that this problem could \ncause U.S. software companies to begin examining such options as moving \nhigh-skilled, high-paying software development jobs overseas where \nhighly skilled labor is available at much lower wages. The FSC \nincentive will help offset higher U.S. labor costs by providing \nbenefits on the export of products developed in the United States. \nMoreover, there is no justification to deny U.S. software exports the \nFSC incentive. Virtually every other U.S. exporter fully qualifies for \nthese incentives. I believe it is vital to quickly enact legislation \nthat would clarify these rules to reflect the Congress' intent with \nrespect to software, not only to protect U.S. software development \njobs, but also to preserve ownership of this technology in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator Hatch \nin cosponsoring the Software Export Equity Act. I believe the continued \nvitality of the U.S. software industry is extremely important to the \nU.S. economy. The Software Export Equity Act will not only help us to \nretain high-paying U.S. software development jobs with successful U.S. \nsoftware companies, but also will help smaller U.S. software companies \nto enter the export market by helping to offset the high costs of \nexporting.\n  The Software Export Equity Act ensures that U.S. software exports \nqualify for the benefits of the foreign sales corporation [FSC] rules, \nwhich are very important to maintaining a high level of U.S. exports. \nThe foreign sales corporation rules were enacted to provide an \nincentive for U.S. companies to manufacture their products in the \nUnited States for export overseas, thus retaining U.S. development and \nmanufacturing jobs. It is clearly as important to Congress to retain \nU.S. software development jobs, which are among the highest paying jobs \nin the United States, as it is to retain other manufacturing and \ndevelopment jobs. Nonetheless, the IRS has questioned the application \nof the FSC rules to software because independent software products did \nnot exist when this incentive was originally enacted in 1971. Our tax \nlaws must keep up with changes in technology and recognize that FSC \nrules should apply to software.\n  This legislation is about fairness, but more importantly, this \nlegislation is about jobs and preserving the ownership of technology in \nthe United States. The Department of Commerce estimates that every $1 \nbillion of export trade is worth domestic jobs. Today there are nearly \n600,000 U.S. employees working directly in the software industry, with \nat least another 1.5 million software developers employed in related \nindustries. These are high-paying jobs, with average compensation in \n1992 of $55,000 per employee. The Software Export Equity Act will \nprevent U.S. software companies from moving those high-paying software \ndevelopment jobs overseas, where highly skilled labor is available for \nmuch lower wages. The Software Export Equity Act will also help smaller \nsoftware companies to enter the export market by helping to offset the \nhigh cost of exporting, which was one of the principal purposes for \ncreating the FSC rules. FSC treatment is as important to exports of \nsoftware as it is to exports of other U.S. products that are clearly \ncovered by these rules.\n  Finally, the Software Export Equity Act will protect U.S. ownership \nof technology. If software development jobs were moved outside the \nUnited States, ownership of the technology created would also move \noutside the United States. Today the software industry has revenues of \n$200 billion a year and a growth rate of 13 percent per year. To lose \nU.S. ownership of the future of this industry would mean not only a \ntremendous direct loss to the GDP, but also would mean a loss of the \nspillover benefits that U.S.-developed technology has on other U.S. \nindustries. In summary, the loss of ownership of this technology would \nbe devastating to the growth potential of the U.S. economy.\n  I appreciate the fact that the administration supports our position \nand has recommended FSC treatment for computer software in the budget. \nEnactment of this legislation will make that recommendation reality. I \nurge my colleagues to join Senators Hatch, Breaux, Nickles, and myself \nin support of swift action on the Software Export Equity Act.\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch \ntoday in introducing the Software Export Equality Act. In 1971, \nCongress created foreign service corporations [FSC] in order to \nencourage U.S. exports and increase U.S. competitiveness in the \ninternational marketplace. Under current law, FSC legislation gives \nU.S. manufacturers a tax incentive for exports of domestically produced \ngoods. Today, virtually every U.S. product manufactured for export \nabroad qualifies for FSC benefits. Yet current tax laws continue to \ndiscriminate against one of the America's fastest growing exports: \nsoftware.\n  Due to the IRS's narrow interpretation of FSC rules, the software \nindustry is precluded from qualifying for any FSC benefits despite the \nfact that approximately 85 percent of products sold by U.S. software \ncompanies are developed in the United States and it currently ranks \nseventh in U.S. industry exports. This bill will clarify that computer \nsoftware qualifies as export property and is eligible for FSC benefits. \nContinuing to deny the benefits of FSC rules to the software industry \nis not only unfair, it poses a serious impediment to the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. manufactured software.\n  Software is one of the America's fastest growing industries, with \nrevenues of more than $200 billion and a growth rate of 13 percent per \nyear on average. As the world leader in software development, the \nUnited States is home to more than 8,000 software companies that \nprovide, directly and indirectly, millions of high-paying, high-skilled \nAmerican jobs in many States.\n  Software is a vital and growing part of many State economies, \nincluding my own State of Washington. In Washington State, the software \nindustry accounted for $3.5 billion worth, and 12 percent, of \nWashington State exports and employed over 22,509 people in 1995. \nMicrosoft, the State's largest software producer, alone supported 1.5 \npercent of the State's economy in 1995. But these impressive numbers do \nnot even take into account the significant impact the numerous small \nand middle-sized software companies that make up the majority in \nWashington State have on the State's economy.\n  The worldwide market for software is exploding and global competition \nis quickly on the rise. In this increasingly competitive world economy, \nincentives to encourage firms to develop and export from the United \nStates are more important than ever to job creation and economic \nstability. This bill provides a simpe way to ensure the U.S. software \nindustry remains the world leader in software manufacturing and \nAmerican software jobs are protected.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this very \nimportant legislation and urge its quick passage in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n           By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 388. A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to assist States \nin implementing a program to prevent prisoners from receiving food \nstamps; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                       FOOD STAMP ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat will stop prisoners from getting food stamp benefits. My bill will \nassist States in implementing a program to ensure that prisoners are \nnot counted as members or heads of food stamp households, thus either \nincreasing the households' benefits or allowing an individual to \nillegally receive benefits in the prisoner's name.\n  I was disturbed to read in the newspaper about a draft General \nAccounting Office report showing over $3 million in food stamp benefits \nbeing overpaid to households in which a member has been incarcerated. \nCurrent law prohibits prisoners from receiving food stamp benefits and \nrequires that households notify their local welfare office of any \nchanges in the makeup of the household. I am concerned to see that \nthere is a breakdown in the system, allowing millions of dollars to be \npaid out illegally.\n  Briefings by USDA's Food and Consumer Service and the General \nAccounting Office have confirmed that although a few States are \nperforming computer matches of data on States' food stamp participants \nand verified inmates, most are not. All States should be doing these \ncomputer matches. This bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to \ncollect information from States already doing computer matches to \nprevent prisoners from receiving food stamp benefits, then evaluate, \nsummarize, and disseminate this information to all States not later \nthan 180 days after the bill's enactment. The Secretary must then \nprovide the States with technical assistance to implement a computer \nmatching system.\n  The problem of prisoners illegally receiving Federal benefits is not \nlimited to the Food Stamp Program. Another recently released General \nAccounting Office report shows that the Social Security Administration \nhas made erroneous payments to prisoners who were incarcerated in the \njail system at the time of the study. In response to this study, the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 included \nlanguage authorizing the Commissioner of the Social Security \nAdministration to enter into agreements with institutions to prevent \nthese erroneous payments. We should make a similar effort to prevent \nthese erroneous payments in the Food Stamp program.\n  The Food Stamp Program provides a safety net for millions of people. \nWe cannot allow fraud and abuse to undermine the Food Stamp Program. \nIntegrity is essential to ensure a program that can serve those in \nneed. It is Congress' responsibility to play a role in ending fraud and \nabuse in all federally funded programs. This legislation is an \nimportant step in ending fraud and abuse in the Food Stamp Program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 388\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       SECTION 1. DENIAL OF FOOD STAMPS FOR PRISONERS.\n       Section 11 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2020) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(q) Denial of Food Stamps for Prisoners.--\n       ``(1) Collection and dissemination of information.--Not \n     later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     subsection, the Secretary shall--\n       ``(A) collect information on policies and procedures used \n     by States that conduct computer matches or other systems to \n     prevent prisoners from receiving food stamp benefits; and\n       ``(B) evaluate, summarize, and disseminate to each State \n     the information collected under paragraph (1) that describes \n     the best practices of the States (including information \n     related to verifying prisoners' social security numbers with \n     the Social Security Administration).\n       ``(2) Assistance to states.--The Secretary shall assist \n     States, to the extent practicable, in implementing a system \n     to conduct computer matches or other systems to prevent \n     prisoners from receiving food stamp benefits.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Helms and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 389. A bill to improve congressional deliberation on proposed \nFederal private sector mandates, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                  THE MANDATES INFORMATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mandates \nInformation Act of 1997. This bill in my view furthers the cause of \ncareful deliberation in this, the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. It will force Members of Congress to carefully consider all \naspects of potential legislation containing mandates affecting \nconsumers, workers, and small businesses.\n  I am proud to say that my colleagues and I aided the cause of careful \ndeliberation during the last Congress. We passed the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995. That legislation required the Congressional Budget \nOffice to make two key estimates with respect to any bill reported out \nof committee: First, whether the bill contains intergovernmental \nmandates with an annual cost of $50 million or more; and, second, \nwhether the bill contains private sector mandates with an annual cost \nof $100 million or more. The 1995 act also established a point of order \nagainst bills meeting the $50 million\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\ncost threshold for intergovernmental mandates. Although the point of \norder can be waived by a simple majority vote, it encourages Congress \nto think carefully before imposing new intergovernmental mandates.\n  The 1995 act did not apply its point of order to private sector \nmandates. This was understandable, given the bill's focus on \nintergovernmental mandates. But States and localities are not alone in \nbeing affected by Federal mandates. Consumers, workers, and small \nbusinesses also are affected when the Federal Government passes along \nthe costs of its policies. This is why the Mandates Information Act of \n1997 will apply a point of order to bills meeting the $100 million cost \nthreshold for private sector mandates, while also directing the CBO to \nprepare a ``Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement'' for \nany bill reported out of committee.\n  These reforms are necessary in my view, Mr. President, because the \n1995 act, while effective in its chosen sphere of intergovernmental \nmandates, does not contain the necessary mechanisms to force Congress \nto think seriously about the wisdom of proposed mandates on the private \nsector. This leaves our private sector faced with the same dilemma once \nfaced by our States and localities: Congress does not give full \nconsideration to the costs its mandates impose. Focusing almost \nexclusively on the benefits of unfunded mandates, Congress pays little \nheed to, and sometimes seems unaware of, the burden that unfunded \nmandates impose on the very groups they are supposed to help.\n  Unfunded mandate costs by definition do not show up on Congress' \nbalance ledger. But, as President Clinton's Deputy Treasury Secretary \nLawrence Summers has written, ``[t]here is no sense in which benefits \nbecome `free' just because the government mandates'' them. Congress has \nmerely passed the costs on to someone else.\n  And that ``someone'' is the American people. As economists from \nPrinceton's Alan Krueger to John Holohan, Colin Winterbottom, and \nSheila Zedlewski of the Urban Institute agree, the costs of unfunded \nmandates on the private sector are primarily borne by three groups: \nconsumers, workers, and small businesses.\n  What forms do these costs take? For consumers, mandate costs take the \nform of higher prices for goods and services, as unfunded mandates \ndrive up the cost of labor.\n  For workers, the costs of unfunded mandates often take the form of \nsignificantly lower wages. According to the Heritage Foundation, a \nrange of independent studies indicates that some 88 percent of the cost \nof private sector mandates are shifted to workers in the form of lower \nwages.\n\n  And mandates can cause workers to lose their jobs altogether. Faced \nwith uncontrollable increases in employee costs, our job creators too \noften find that they can no longer afford to retain their full \ncomplement of workers. The Clinton health care mandate, for example, \nwould have resulted in a net loss of between 200,000-500,000 jobs, \naccording to a study conducted by Professor Krueger.\n  Small businesses and their potential employees also suffer. Mandates \ntypically apply only to businesses with at least a certain number of \nemployees. As a result, small businesses have a powerful incentive not \nto hire enough new workers to reach the mandate threshold. As the Wall \nStreet Journal recently noted, ``The point at which a new [mandate] \nkicks in * * * is the point at which the [Chief Financial Officer] asks \n`Why grow?' ''\n  That question is asked by small businesses all over the country, but \nlet me cite one example from my State. Hasselbring/Clark is an office \nequipment supplier in Lansing, MI. Noelle Clark is the firm's treasurer \nand secretary. Mindful of the raft of mandates whose threshold is 50 \nemployees, Ms. Clark reports that lately ``we have hired a few temps to \nstay under 49.'' Thus, unfunded mandates not only eliminate jobs, but \nalso prevent jobs from being created.\n  Much as Members of Congress may wish it were not so, mandates have a \nvery real cost. This does not mean that all mandates are bad. But it \ndoes mean that Congress should think very carefully about the wisdom of \na proposed mandate before imposing it.\n  Such careful thinking, Mr. President, is the goal of the Mandates \nInformation Act of 1997. Just as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n1995 protects State and local governments from hasty decisionmaking \nwith respect to proposed intergovernmental mandates, the Mandates \nInformation Act would protect consumers, workers, and small businesses \nfrom hasty decisionmaking with respect to proposed private sector \nmandates. It would do so, in essence, by extending the reforms of the \n1995 act to private sector mandates.\n  The bill I introduce today would build on the 1995 act's reforms in \ntwo ways. First, to give Congress more complete information about the \nimpact of proposed mandates on the private sector, my bill directs CBO \nto prepare a ``Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement'' \nfor any bill reported out of Committee. This statement would include \nanalyses of the bill's private sector mandates' effects on the \nfollowing: First, consumer prices and [the] actual supply of goods and \nservices in consumer markets; second, worker wages, worker benefits, \nand employment opportunities; and third, the hiring practices, \nexpansion, and profitability of businesses with 100 or fewer employees.\n  But providing Congress with more complete information about the \nimpact of proposed private sector mandates will not guarantee that it \npays any attention to it. This we know from experience. In 1981, \nCongress enacted the State and Local Government Cost Estimate Act, \nsponsored by Senator Sasser. Pursuant to that act, CBO provided \nCongress with estimates of the cost of intergovernmental mandates in \nbills reported out of committee. But Congress routinely ignored this \ninformation. It did so because the 1981 act had no enforcement \nmechanism to force Congress to consider the CBO estimates. As Senator \nSasser himself explained in introducing a follow-up bill in 1993, \n``[t]he problem [with the 1981 act], it has become clear, is that this \nyellow caution light has no red light to back it up.''\n  To supply that ``red light,'' Senator Sasser's Mandate Funding Act of \n1993 contained a point of order. Of course, the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995 likewise contained a point of order, which is why it \nsucceeded where Senator Sasser's 1981 act had failed.\n  The Mandates Information Act of 1997 will provide this red light for \nproposed private sector mandates. It contains a point of order against \nany bill whose private sector mandates exceed the $100 million \nthreshold set by the 1995 act. Like the 1995 act's point of order \nagainst intergovernmental mandates, the 1997 bill's point of order can \nbe waived by a simple majority of Members. Thus it will not stop \nCongress from passing bills it wants to pass.\n  But the point of order will serve a vital purpose. It will ensure \nthat Congress does not ignore the information contained in the \nconsumer, worker, and small business impact statement. It will do so by \nallowing any Member to focus the attention of the entire House or \nSenate on the impact statement for a particular bill.\n  The Mandates Information Act of 1997 will provide Congress with more \ncomplete information about proposed mandates' effects on consumers, \nworkers, and small businesses. It will also ensure that Congress \nactually considers this information before reaching a judgment about \nwhether to impose a new mandate. The result, Mr. President, will be \nfocused, high-quality deliberation on the wisdom of private sector \nmandates.\n  Because of the success of the 1995 act, Congress is now much more \ncareful to consider the interests of State and local governments in \nmaking decisions about unfunded mandates. But Congress must be just as \ncareful to consider the interests of consumers, workers, and small \nbusinesses in making such decisions. This bill will ensure that care, \nhelping produce better legislation; legislation that imposes a lighter \nburden on working Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following sample of \nletters from small business groups supporting the bill be introduced in \nthe Record, along with a list of groups that have expressed their \nsupport for it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\n     Organizations Supporting the Mandates Information Act of 1997\n\n\n                         national organizations\n\n  Chamber of Commerce of the United States; National Association of \nWholesaler-Distributors; National Federation of Independent Businesses; \nNational Retail Federation; Small Business Survival Committee; National \nRestaurant Association; National Association for the Self-Employed.\n\n\n                         michigan organizations\n\n  Associated Underground Contractors, Inc.; Grand Rapids Area Chamber \nof Commerce; Michigan Association of Timbermen; Michigan Chamber of \nCommerce; Michigan Farm Bureau Family of Companies; Michigan NFIB; \nMichigan Retailers Association; Michigan Soft Drink Association; Small \nBusiness Association of Michigan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 1997.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I want to express support for the Mandate Information \n     Act of 1997\n       In 1995 with the passage of the Unfunded Mandates Act, \n     Congress acknowledged the significant problem that federal \n     government mandates have on the operation of states and \n     localities. Government mandates create equally burdensome \n     problems on the private sector and especially small \n     employers. These federal mandates discourage small business \n     start-ups, growth and job creation.\n       Our members have consistently ranked unreasonable \n     government regulation as one of their top concerns. The \n     Mandate Information Act works to address the problem of \n     federal mandates on small businesses by applying the reforms \n     put in place by the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 for state \n     and local government to the private sector. This would \n     require Congress to weigh more carefully the impact of \n     proposed legislation on small businesses and their employees.\n       We commend you on your efforts to reduce the government \n     mandated burdens a small business must shoulder and look \n     forward to working with you to ensure that this positive \n     reform becomes law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: I am pleased to offer the support of \n     the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Federation for your proposed \n     legislation, the Mandates Information Act of 1997.\n       One of the key success stories of the 104th Congress was \n     the adoption of bipartisan unfunded mandates reform requiring \n     Congress to consider the cost and consequences of federal \n     requirements on state and local government. Another important \n     component of this law was the requirement that significant \n     federal mandates on the private sector be measured and made \n     public. Such mandates have an enormous impact on consumers, \n     small businesses and workers in the form of higher prices, \n     fewer jobs, declining good and services and reduced workers \n     benefits. Moreover, these mandates are likely to escalate as \n     scarce budgetary resources will place even greater pressure \n     on utilizing federal regulations as a means of implementing \n     government programs and initiatives.\n       [The Mandates Information Act would provide the next \n     necessary step to promote greater public and congressional \n     accountability regarding the impact of federal mandates.] It \n     builds upon the success of the unfunded mandates law by \n     requiring Congress to have more information on who will be \n     affected and ultimately pay the costs associated with these \n     mandates. It would allow Member of Congress to vote on each \n     mandate--considering not only its benefits but its effect on \n     the private section as well as the economy, jobs and \n     consumers.\n       [It is good government policy for Congress to engage in the \n     practice of legislating with the necessary information \n     concerning the impact of their actions. Policymakers have the \n     responsibility and obligation to make informed decisions and \n     to be accountable for the consequences of those decisions.] \n     Such a proposal would help ensure that when resources are \n     diverted from jobs, wages and families into government rules, \n     the impact are fully considered.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Federation, the world's \n     largest federation of business, chambers of commerce and \n     business organizations representing every size and sector of \n     the nation's economy, looks forward to working with you in \n     seeking adoption of this common sense, good government \n     proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 1997.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the National Retail \n     Federation, the world's largest retail trade association, I \n     am writing to support your legislation, the Mandates \n     Information Act of 1997.\n       Too often Congress passes new mandates on entrepreneurs \n     without understanding the actual cost. Many times, mandates \n     look good on paper, but can have a disastrous effect once \n     implemented. Your legislation will correct that once and for \n     all.\n       The costs associated with mandates, as you well know, are \n     more than direct cash outlays, these costs mean less economic \n     growth, fewer jobs created and higher costs to consumers. \n     Congress' worthy goal of balancing the budget, combined with \n     desires of some to ``deliver more things'' to voters that the \n     government doesn't have to pay for, will put more pressure \n     than ever on Members of Congress to burden business.\n       New mandates automatically won't be stopped, only \n     automatically considered under this bill. That's right in \n     line with Main Street. The Abraham legislation assures \n     retailers and other entrepreneurs that Congress will consider \n     the impact of proposed mandates set forth in the CBO \n     Consumer, Worker and Small Business Impact Statement before \n     they are simply enacted into law.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership against new mandates. \n     We look forward to working with you to pass this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               John J. Motley,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government and Public Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 Michigan Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                    Lansing, MI, January 31, 1997.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Spence: Your proposed ``Mandates Information Act of \n     1997'' is a great idea!\n       As you know, the Michigan Chamber and many other taxpayer \n     groups supported--and voters approved--the Headlee Amendment \n     to the State Constitution in 1978 that required state \n     mandates on local government to be funded by the State. This \n     has caused greater legislative and executive branch \n     evaluation of state program mandates and related costs on \n     local units of government and resulted in funding of any \n     mandates by the state. The Michigan Chamber also supported \n     adoption of unfunded mandates reform during the 104th \n     Congress.\n       It's important that Congress now consider protection for \n     the private sector from new unfunded mandates. Careful \n     consideration of the impact of federal mandates on state and \n     local government should be extended to job providers and \n     consumers.\n       The Michigan Chamber of Commerce and our 6,500 member firms \n     are pleased to support this needed legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jim Barrett,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                      Association of Michigan,\n\n                                    Lansing, MI, January 31, 1997.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The Small Business Association of \n     Michigan (SBAM is pleased with your decision to introduce the \n     ``Mandates Information Act.'' Your bill will help protect \n     small businesses from the financial impact of Congressional \n     mandates.\n       Congressional mandates imposed on the private sector are \n     already driving down worker wages, increasing consumer costs \n     and reducing the availability of goods and services. These \n     mandates could multiply as a result of the effort for a \n     balanced budget. As funding becomes increasingly scarce, \n     advocates of increased government intrusion in the private \n     sector will try to shift program costs to small businesses in \n     the form of new mandates.\n       A key provision of your legislation is the small business \n     impact statement--to inform Congressional members about \n     mandates and their impact on the private sector. The bill \n     will direct the CBO to estimate the impact of a bill's \n     mandates on consumer cost, worker wages, the availability of \n     goods and services and small business job creation.\n       SBAM is Michigan's latest state based small business \n     association representing 8,000 businesses in all of \n     Michigan's 83 counties. We look forward to working with you \n     on this important small business issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Barry S. Cargill,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                             Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Mandates \nInformation Act of 1997. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthis important legislation, and I applaud my distinguished colleague \nfrom Michigan, Mr. Abraham, for his leadership in this effort.\n  The bill we are introducing today continues the work begun in the \n104th Congress with the enactment of the ``Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \nof 1995--the 1995 act--authored by Mr.\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\nKempthorne to ensure that Congress is well advised of the cost unfunded \nmandates would impose on State and local governments. I was a cosponsor \nof the 1995 act, and I believe the time has come for us to expand its \nprovisions to require similar detailed information and accountability \non unfunded mandates affecting the private sector--so we can protect \nconsumers, workers, and small businesses.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I am all too \naware of the disproportionate burden Federal regulations impose on our \nNation's small businesses. A 1995 study found that an average firm with \nless than 20 employees spent approximately $5,500 per employee in 1992 \nto comply with Federal regulations--compared with $3,000 per employee \nby firms with 500 or more employees. The overall cost to the economy is \nbetween 6 and 9 percent of gross domestic product--between $420-670 \nbillion--in 1995 dollars--in regulatory compliance. Before we permit \nthe Federal Government to adopt any new mandate that would add to this \nburden, the Congress needs to be fully informed of the new costs to be \nimposed on the economy so we can make an informed judgment.\n  The reforms proposed in this bill are needed to ensure that the \nCongress gives careful and thoughtful consideration to the impact \nunfunded mandates impose on the private sector. The ability of small \nbusinesses to compete and create new jobs can be hindered by unfunded \nmandates, we need to be aware of the magnitude of any future adverse \neffects. The Committee on Small Business will continue its work to \nensure that the Government's actions here in Washington foster the \ngrowth of small businesses located on Main Street. This bill will help \nto ensure that all Members of Congress are equally informed of the \neffects a bill would have on the customers, employees, and owners of \nAmerica's small businesses, the engine of our Nation's economic growth.\n  The legislation Senator Abraham and I are introducing today will \nensure that the private sector impact of unfunded mandates is addressed \nduring deliberations on legislation imposing those mandates. Consumers, \nworkers, and small businesses will benefit from the reforms to enhance \ncongressional deliberations on unfunded mandates affecting the private \nsector. The Mandates Information Act of 1997 establishes a new \nparliamentary point of order against any bill that will impose private \nsector mandates exceeding a $100 million cost threshold. The measure \ndirects the Congressional Budget Office to estimate the impact of the \nproposed unfunded mandates on consumer costs, worker wages, and the \navailability of goods and services.\n  As with the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, the point of order \nauthorized by the bill would bar the House or Senate from further \naction on a proposed measure unless a majority agrees to move forward \nwith the initiative. By authorizing a point of order triggered by \nprivate sector impacts, the legislation introduced today puts teeth \ninto the law to ensure that Congress addresses the costs that would be \nimposed by the unfunded mandates on small businesses, consumers, and \nworkers. This change requires Members of Congress to go on record as \neither supporting or opposing an unfunded mandate that would add costs \nto the private sector.\n\n  With the aid of a consumer, worker, and small business impact \nstatement, Members of Congress will have the information required to \nmake an informed decision on the merit of imposing a mandate without \nalso providing funding for compliance. The impact statement would be \nprepared by the Congressional Budget Office--which the bill directs to \nestimate the economic impact of a proposed mandate on consumers, wages, \nand the availability of goods and services.\n  All in all, this bill is about good governance. It provides \ninformation to ensure that Congress is fully informed on the impact of \nan unfunded mandate on the economy and the private sector in \nparticular. By tasking the Congressional Budget Office with preparing \nan impact statement, the bill also provides important information to \neducate Congress on the effect of pending legislation. This, in itself, \nis an important step toward ensuring that the needs and concerns of \nsmall businesses, and the workers and customers that depend on small \nbusinesses, are given the attention they deserve by Congress. As with \nthe Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996--or the \nRed-Tape Reduction Act as I prefer to call it--today's bill seeks to \nensure that the Government treats small business fairly. The Mandates \nInformation Act has the support of the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the National Restaurant Association, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Retail Association, the National \nAssociation of Wholesaler-Distributors, and the Small Business Survival \nCommittee--I urge my colleagues to join our efforts to enact this bill \nand enhance our efforts to ensure good governance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Helms):\n  S.J. Res. 19.

Res. 20. A joint resolution to disapprove the certification of \nthe President under section 490(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961 regarding foreign assistance for Mexico during fiscal year 1997; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  S.J. Res. 21. A joint resolution to disapprove the certification of \nthe President under section 490(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961 regarding assistance for Mexico during fiscal year 1997, and to \nprovide for the termination of the withholding of and opposition to \nassistance that results from the disapproval; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n                        DISAPPROVAL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have introduced today three separate \njoint resolutions to disapprove the President's decision to certify \nMexico as fully cooperating in our war on drugs. The first joint \nresolution will eventually be placed on the calendar by way of rule XIV \nof the Standing Rules of the Senate. The second resolution is identical \nto the first joint resolution; however, it will be referred to the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee for their consideration.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the third joint resolution I have just \nintroduced would disapprove the President's certification and instead \ndecertify Mexico but authorize a national interest waiver.\n  Mr. President, I have been joined today by a coauthor of these \nresolutions, Senator Feinstein of California, who will make remarks in \na moment. I will take just a few minutes to visit this subject and then \nyield the floor to Senator Feinstein.\n  First, let me say, Mr. President, that this is a most difficult \nissue, and it has very broad ramifications. Mr. President, I stand here \nas a friend of Mexico and the Mexican people, but I believe the actions \non the part of the administration were a resounding endorsement of the \nstatus quo. Mr. President, the status quo is unacceptable. The status \nquo sees the Government of Mexico under siege by perpetrators of fraud \nand corruption and destabilization. Mr. President, the status quo sees \nmillions of new victims being ravaged by the assault of drugs within \nour community. I suspect that the actions on the part of the \nadministration, of President Clinton, were an effort to be supportive \nof President Zedillo. I can understand that, but I believe this \ndecision to certify without condition, versus to decertify and waive as \nour resolution calls for, misleads both nations. It suggests that \nthings are going along fairly well and we just need to keep doing what \nwe have been doing.\n  The President of Mexico himself said the greatest single threat to \nthe security of his republic are the drug cartels. Mr. President, we \nare losing this war. That is what the status quo represents. We are \nlosing. The people of Mexico are losing through destabilization of \ntheir government at all levels, the American people are losing through \nthe victimization of millions of American citizens, and the democracies \nof the hemisphere are losing because this is a pervasive cloud over our \nfuture as we enter the new century.\n  All the opportunity one can envision about this hemisphere, the fact \nthat 40 percent of our trade occurs in this hemisphere, the abounding \nopportunities that one can easily look at when\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\nyou see what commerce can produce in the uplifting of all of our \npeoples, the single most serious threat to all those opportunities are \nthe drug cartels. It hangs as a cloud, Mr. President. I believe the \nactions on the part of the administration do a disservice to all of our \npeople on both sides of the border. And I hope that we can come at this \nquestion more honestly and admit that we have deep problems here, and \nthat the good will that exists between our peoples is vibrant enough \nand strong enough that it can face an honest problem head on. No one is \nserved by sweeping it under the rug for yet another year. Every day \nthat goes by, we lose a little bit more and we come closer and closer \nto a time when this becomes unresolvable.\n\n  Mr. President, we will hold hearings on these resolutions in the very \nnear term. I compliment my colleague from California for her extended \nwork in this area for a considerable period of time.\n  At this point, I yield the floor to my colleague from California, \nSenator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from \nGeorgia. I am pleased to join with him in this joint resolution, \ndisapproving the certification of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, my disappointment in the administration's decision to \ncertify Mexico's antidrug efforts last week, I think, was known to all. \nI believe that decision was a mistake, and I said so.\n  The decision to certify Mexico in the face of what I consider to be \nan overwhelming lack of cooperation undermines the integrity of the \ncertification process itself, as well as damaging the credibility of \nthe United States in our dealings with other countries with whom we \nseek cooperation.\n  I rise today to join with the Senator from Georgia and a number of my \ncolleagues in introducing this resolution. But I do so with some \nregret. I regret the need for the resolution for two reasons. First, \nMexico is a neighbor, a friend, and an ally of our country. Second, I \nvery much regret the need to disagree with my President on this issue. \nI believe he made what he believes to be the right decision, but I \nrespectfully disagree with him.\n  Our intention is clear: We believe that the evidence overwhelmingly \nsupports decertification of Mexico, and then if the President sees fit, \ninvoking a vital national interest waiver. For that reason, Senator \nCoverdell has introduced a second resolution that allows the President \nto waive the sanctions on grounds of vital national interest after we \nenact our resolution of disapproval.\n  Last week, a bipartisan group of 39 Senators sent a letter to the \nPresident urging that this be his decision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, section 490 of the Foreign Assistance \nAct requires the President to certify that Mexico has cooperated fully \nwith the United States, or taken adequate steps on its own to combat \ndrug trafficking. It's just not tenable to claim that Colombia did not \nmeet that standard, but Mexico did. Let me read one sentence from the \ndecertification of Colombia in 1996. It reads:\n\n       Critical to the U.S. judgment that the Government of \n     Colombia did not fully cooperate on counternarcotics in 1995 \n     is the assessment that corruption remains pervasive, despite \n     the efforts of some dedicated Colombians to root it out.\n\n  That is no different from the situation in Mexico today. There are \ndedicated efforts in Mexico, but the corruption is pervasive.\n  I think the events of last week are an example in point.\n  Just hours before the President's decision on certification of Mexico \nwas to be announced, Mexican officials were touting the arrest of a \nreputed cartel leader, Humberto Garcia Abrego, brother of Juan Garcia \nAbrego, who was expelled from Mexico during last year's certification \nprocess.\n  Then, just a few hours after the decision to certify was announced, \nguess what? Garcia Abrego simply walked away from Mexican custody a \nfree man. The Mexican Attorney General's office claimed responsibility \nfor setting him free. His release was ``inexplicable,'' they said.\n  Mr. President, this is just one example of the kind of cooperation \nthe United States has received. It has tightened up just before \ncertification and then, just after certification, it's business as \nusual.\n  With 70 percent of the cocaine, a quarter of the heroin, 80 percent \nof the marijuana, and 90 percent of the ephedrine used to make \nmethamphetamine entering the United States from our southern border, \nMexico's drug problem is America's drug problem, and the problem is \ngetting worse, not better.\n  Last year at this time, Senator D'Amato and I compiled a list of \nactions we considered necessary for the Mexican Government to take in \norder to show progress on their antidrug efforts. Regrettably, I \nbelieve the evidence shows there has been little or no progress on \nnearly all of the items on this list.\n\n  Some of these failures are due to inability; others are due simply to \na lack of political will.\n  For example, some questions: Has Mexico extradited one Mexican \nnational on outstanding drug charges? The answer is no. I was puzzled \nbecause the Secretary of State, in her statement on certification, made \nthis statement: ``Mexico has set a precedent by extraditing its own \nnationals.'' One might conclude that this includes Mexicans wanted on \ndrug charges. Yet, to the contrary, both the Department of Justice and \nthe DEA tell me that not a single Mexican national has been extradited \nto this country on drug-related charges.\n  If the State Department has information that Mexican nationals are \nbeing extradited on drug-related charges--and there are 52 of them on \nthe extradition list--I ask them now to make that list public. Tell us \nwhich Mexican nationals have been extradited on drug-related charges.\n  Francisco Arellano-Felix of the notorious Tijuana cartel is currently \nin custody in a Mexican prison and wanted on narcotics charges here in \nthe United States. I say to Mexico, why not show good faith and \nextradite him?\n  Mexican authorities tell us that there has been an agreement in \nprinciple on extraditing Mexican nationals, but there has been no \nchange in their actions.\n  Question 2: Has Mexico implemented new laws aimed at curbing the \nrampant laundering of drug money? No.\n  Nearly a year ago, the Mexican Parliament passed criminal money \nlaundering laws. But the new laws are a far cry from the stronger \nlegislative action sought by U.S. officials. The new laws do not even \nrequire banks to report large or suspicious currency transactions. \nPromises to enact such regulations have, so far, gone unfulfilled.\n  To my knowledge, not one money exchange house in Mexico has changed \nits operations.\n  Have Mexican authorities significantly increased their seizure rate \nof cocaine or their arrest of drug traffickers? Let's take a look at \nit. The answer to that clearly is no. Cocaine seizures by Mexico, which \nincreased slightly last year, are barely half of what was seized in \n1993.\n\n  Here are seizures in 1993--46.2 tons. Here they are in 1995--22.2 \ntons. And they are just slightly above that in 1996. Actually, instead \nof 22.2 tons, in 1996 they are 23.5.\n  So that is the record. It has been effectively downhill, and then a \nstraight line, and a small little jog up.\n  Let's take a look at drug-related arrests in Mexico. Drug-related \narrests last year are less than half of what they were in 1992. Here \nare the figures. In 1992, 27,369; down in 1993; down in 1994; and way \ndown in 1995, all the way to 9,700. We don't have 1996 on this chart \nyet, but the 1996 figures are 11,245. That is a startling drop since \n1992.\n  So here is a country being certified as fully cooperative, and drug \nseizures have gone down and drug arrests have gone down in the last 3 \nyears.\n  One has to ask then: What is ``full cooperation\"?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have a comment on the statistics just demonstrated, \nbecause I was reading in the New York Times, and they begin the data in \n1994.\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\n So it shows a slight increase. But the dramatic case that the Senator \nmade is absolutely correct. You have to go back to 1992 and 1993 to see \nwhat really is happening with arrests and seizures of narcotics.\n  I just point out that it is good that the Senator is making the point \nbecause our adversaries like to start measuring statistics in 1994. We \ncan't do that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is correct. I thank him very much for \nthat comment because he is absolutely right. The jog up is so small \nwhen you compare it with the drop which is so steep and pronounced. So \nI thank the Senator very much.\n  It leads me to the conclusion that the situation with Mexico has \nnever been worse. DEA has suspended American agents going into Mexico \nbecause, just last month, Mexico forbade United States drug agents from \ncarrying weapons on the Mexican side of the border.\n  I understand that there may be some agreement again to enable our \nagents to be armed, and then they will go in again. However, it should \nbe pointed out that death threats against our agents are up.\n  I would like to ask that all Members, if they would be willing, to \nsimply read the testimony provided by Thomas Constantine, Administrator \nof the Drug Enforcement Administration, before the House Government \nReform and Oversight Committee, the National Security, International \nAffairs, and Criminal Justice Subcommittee, last week. It was played \nabout three times on C-SPAN over the weekend. I heard it. I also read \nthe remarks. And the remarks are really very, very profound.\n  In this report, Mr. Constantine points out again:\n       Since 1993, 23 major drug-related assassinations have taken \n     place in Mexico. Virtually all of these murders remain \n     unsolved. Many of them have occurred in Tijuana, or have \n     involved victims from Tijuana in the last year. Twelve law \n     enforcement officers, or former officials, have been gunned \n     down in Tijuana, and the vast majority of the 200 murders in \n     that city are believed to have been drug related.\n\n  The Administrator also points out that of the 1,200 firings firings \nof Government officials for corruption made by President Zedillo, no \nsuccessful prosecutions of these individuals have ever taken place. So \nof the 1,200 Government officials fired for corruption, there has not \nbeen a single successful prosecution.\n\n  The arrest last month of Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo brings, I \nthink, the level of drug-influenced corruption in Mexico into some \nglaring relief. It is frightening. But, as I have pointed out, it is \njust the tip of the iceberg.\n  In September, a federal police commander, Ernesto Ibarra, who had \nvowed to take down the Tijuana cartel, was murdered, and some of the \nassailants were his own officers.\n  That should tell us a great deal about the level of corruption.\n  The celebrated army raid of a wedding last month of the sister of \nAmado Carillo-Fuentes, Mexico's most powerful cartel leader, seems to \nbe an elaborate charade. The raid, which was organized by General \nGutierrez, who we now know was on the Carillo-Fuentes payroll and the \ntarget of the raid, was tipped off in advance and either never did come \nto the wedding or escaped. Federal police were found to be protecting \nthe drug traffickers at that wedding. The federal police were \nprotecting drug traffickers. I find that just amazing.\n  As former DEA Administrator Robert Bonner said, ``It would be hard \nfor anyone to say with a straight face that the Mexican Government is \ntaking effective action against the major drug traffickers at this \njuncture.''\n  Yet, they were just certified as so doing.\n  The purpose of section 490 was not to deliver merit badges to nations \nwhose leaders have good intentions. The world is filled with leaders \nwho have good intentions. The act was designed to measure uniformly the \nactions taken by countries to assist the United States in antidrug \nefforts.\n  Colombia was decertified last year and again this year because their \nefforts were ineffectual.\n  How Mexico cannot be held to the same standards I have a hard time \nunderstanding. To certify Mexico in the face of overwhelming evidence \nto the contrary undercuts the certification process.\n  So I ask all of my colleagues to join the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia and myself in voting to disapprove the President's decision on \ncertification of Mexico but to allow him, if he sees fit, to enact a \nnational-interest waiver.\n  Then we should work with the President to devise conditions under \nwhich Mexico would be eligible for recertification.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 1997.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge you to deny \n     certification that Mexico has taken sufficient actions to \n     combat international narcotics trafficking when you report to \n     Congress on the anti-narcotics efforts of major drug \n     producing and drug-transit countries. We believe a reasonable \n     examination of the facts leads to no other decision.\n       Regrettably, we have concluded that there has been \n     insufficient progress, or no progress, on a wide range of key \n     elements of an effective counternarcotics program in Mexico. \n     Some of these failures are due to inability; others are due \n     to a lack of political will. But all have set back the urgent \n     effort to end the plague of drugs on our streets.\n       We want to bring to your attention a number of the most \n     significant examples of Mexico's inability and unwillingness \n     to deal with the drug trafficking problem effectively:\n       Cartels: There has been little or no effective action taken \n     against the major drug cartels. The two most powerful--the \n     Juarez Cartel run by Amado Carillo Fuentes, and the Tijuana \n     Cartel, run by the Arellano Felix brothers--have hardly been \n     touched by Mexican law enforcement. Those who have been \n     arrested, such as Hector Palma, are given light sentences and \n     allowed to continue to conduct business from jail. As DEA \n     Administrator Thomas Constantine says, ``The Mexicans are now \n     the single most powerful trafficking groups''--worse than the \n     Colombian cartels.\n       Money Laundering: Last year, the Mexican parliament passed \n     criminal money laundering laws for the first time, but the \n     new laws are incomplete and have not yet been properly \n     implemented. These laws do not require banks to report large \n     and suspicious currency transactions, or threaten the banks \n     with sanctions if they fail to comply. Promises to enact such \n     regulations--which prosecutors need to identify money-\n     launderers--have so far gone unfulfilled. Mexican officials \n     said that such regulations would be developed by January, \n     but they were not produced.\n       Law Enforcement: While there have been increases in the \n     amounts of heroin and marijuana seized by Mexican \n     authorities, cocaine seizures remain low. Although slightly \n     higher than last year's figures, the 23.6 metric tons seized \n     in 1996 is barely half of what was seized in 1993. A modest \n     increase in drug-related arrests brought the total to 11,245 \n     in 1996--less than half of the 1992 figure.\n       Cooperation with U.S. Law Enforcement: Our own drug \n     enforcement agents report that the situation on the border \n     has never been worse. Last month, the Mexican government \n     forbade U.S. agents to carry weapons on the Mexican side of \n     the border, putting their lives in grave danger. Recent news \n     reports indicate that death threats against U.S. narcotics \n     agents on the border have quadrupled in the past three \n     months. Some U.S. agents believe that all their cooperative \n     efforts are undone almost instantly by the corrupt Mexican \n     agents with whom they work.\n       Extraditions: Mexico also has made very little progress in \n     the area of extraditions. In the past year, they have failed \n     to capture and extradite a single high-ranking member of any \n     of the major drug cartels. There are 52 outstanding U.S. \n     extradition requests for drug dealers, and Mexico has failed \n     to comply with a single one of them. No Mexican national has \n     ever been extradited to the United States on drug charges. In \n     the last year, Mexico has fired two directors of its National \n     Institute to Combat Drugs, one Attorney General, and several \n     high-ranking officials in the federal police for their \n     corrupt involvement with the drug lords. We should expect \n     Mexico to pursue the cartel leaders with the same level of \n     intensity used to expose and punish corruption by government \n     officials.\n       Corruption: Mexico's counternarcotics effort is plagued by \n     corruption in the government and the national police. Among \n     the evidence are the eight Mexican prosecutors and law \n     enforcement officials who have been murdered in Tijuana in \n     recent months. There has been considerable hope that the \n     Mexican armed forces would be able to take a more active role \n     in the counternarcotics effort without the taint of \n     corruption. But the revelation that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez \n     Rebollo, Mexico's top counternarcotics official and a 42-year \n     veteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the \n     Carillo Fuentes cartel, casts grave doubts upon that hope.\n       Recent news reports indicate that U.S. law enforcement \n     officials suspect judges, prosecutors, Transportation \n     Ministry officials, Naval officers, and Governors of \n     corruption and actively facilitating the work of drug \n     traffickers. The National Autonomous University of Mexico \n     estimates that the drug lords spend $500 million each year to \n     bribe Mexican officials at all levels, and many consider that \n     figure to be a gross under-estimation.\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\n       Mr. President, we believe that the evidence is overwhelming \n     and can lead to no decision other than the decertification of \n     Mexico. It would send a strong signal to Mexico and the world \n     that the United States will not tolerate lack of cooperation \n     in the fight against narcotics, even from our close friends \n     and allies. Accordingly, we urge you to establish a clear set \n     of benchmarks by which you will judge if and when to \n     recertify Mexico for counternarcotics cooperation. These \n     benchmarks must include, but not be limited to: effective \n     action to dismantle the major drug cartels and arrest their \n     leaders; full and ongoing implementation of effective money-\n     laundering legislation; compliance with all outstanding \n     extradition requests by the United States; increased \n     interdiction of narcotics and other controlled substances \n     flowing across the border by land and sea routes; improved \n     cooperation with U.S. law enforcement officials including \n     allowing U.S. agents to resume carrying weapons on the \n     Mexican side of the border; and a comprehensive program to \n     identify, weed out, and prosecute corrupt officials at all \n     levels of the Mexican government, police, and military.\n       You may feel, as many of us do, that U.S. interests in \n     Mexico, economic and otherwise, are too extensive to risk the \n     fall-out that would result from decertification. That is why \n     Congress included a vital national interest waiver provision \n     in Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act. But other vital \n     interests are not a valid reason to certify when \n     certification has not been earned. If you feel that our \n     interests warrant it, we urge you to use this waiver. But an \n     honest assessment of Mexico's cooperation on counternarcotics \n     must fall on the side of decertification.\n           Sincerely,\n         Wayne Allard, Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Boxer, John Breaux, \n           Richard Bryan, Max Cleland, Susan M.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nShirley Smith-Pointer who is retiring from the Social Security \nAdministration after 34 years of Federal service.\n  Ms. Smith-Pointer held the positions of claims development clerk, \ndata review technician, and claims representative--the position she \nheld upon retiring.

She \nserved as secretary, usher, and Sunday school teacher for her church. \nShe has also been a member of the National Council of Negro Women and \nserved the Chestnut Street YMCA's Black Achievers' Program.\n  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in recognizing \nShirley Smith-Pointer for 34 years of dedicated service to the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1843-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1843-S1844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE AND THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today's Chicago Sun-Times \ncontained an editorial headlined, ``Loosen reins on CBOT, Merc.'' The \neditorial, talking about the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Chicago \nMercantile Exchange, made the point that:\n  ``Congress must loosen the regulatory reins on the Chicago Board of \nTrade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Otherwise, officials argue \nconvincingly, Chicago will lose business and jobs to the unregulated \nover the counter markets or overseas exchanges.''\n  The Sun-Times had it exactly right. As in so many other areas of \nfinancial policy, the law has not kept up with economic reality. The \nworld has changed. There is a revolution underway in finance, and, if \nthe United States sits back and ignores the new realities of the \nmarketplace, the result will be to seriously damage American financial \nmarketplaces vis-a-vis their global competition, and to increasingly \nwarp and distort the competition between and among various American \nfinancial markets.\n  We must respond; we must respond vigorously; and we must respond now. \nChicago's future and option exchanges\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nare an American treasure; their innovations literally created this \nindustry and are in no small part responsible for American leadership \nin finance. And the creativity of the Chicago exchanges has had a huge \npayoff for the Chicago area. As the Sun-Times editorial pointed out:\n  ``The stakes are high. For example, the exchanges calculate that have \ncreated 151,000 jobs in the Chicago area.''\n  It is imperative, therefore, that we act quickly to reform the \nCommodity Futures Trading Act as quickly as possible, and that we do so \nin a way that enhances the ability of the American futures and options \nindustry to meet both their less regulated competition here in the \nUnited States, and their evermore formidable competition abroad. I \nintend to work for quick enactment of the legislation put forward by \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator \nLugar. I urge my colleagues to join me, and to ensure that a \nprocompetitive, commonsense approach that allows the futures exchanges \nto meet and compete with all comers passes this body before the snow \nmelts in Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the Sun-Times editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                      [From the Chicago Sun-Times]\n\n                       Loosen Reins on CBOT, Merc\n\n       The futures markets have made Chicago a powerful player in \n     world finance. Now that role is threatened by a regulatory \n     system hamstringing the ability of the Chicago exchanges to \n     compete in the rapidly changing global financial marketplace.\n       Congress must loosen the regulatory reins on the Chicago \n     Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. \n     Otherwise, officials argue convincingly, Chicago will lose \n     business and jobs to the unregulated over-the-counter markets \n     or to overseas exchanges. The stakes are high. For example, \n     the exchanges calculate that they have created 151,000 jobs \n     in the Chicago area.\n       Exchange officials want Congress to lift all but a few \n     reasonable restrictions for markets that are used solely by \n     professional traders, money managers, mutual fund operators \n     and the like. Asking for a level playing field is a \n     reasonable request.\n       For example, anyone who sells futures on the Chicago \n     exchanges must make regular reports on all trading activity \n     regardless of size. This costly paper trail could be replaced \n     with an on-call system. Also, anyone who sells futures is \n     fingerprinted, an unwelcome burden on exchange customers. \n     Over-the-counter markets require neither.\n       The futures market is an arcane, volatile world, inhabited \n     mostly by people making their living taking huge risks and \n     big businesses seeking to hedge their risks. It is a \n     dangerous place for amateurs.\n       But market professionals, without looser restrictions, will \n     move business out of Chicago to over-the counter or overseas \n     exchanges as the financial futures marketplace grows. \n     Congress should act on pending legislation to update the \n     rules for the CBOT and the Merc.\n       The futures markets were to a large degree developed by \n     finance pioneers in Chicago. The city--and the nation--can \n     ill afford to see their role in world finance \n     diminished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1843-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1844-S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO J.P. BLEVINS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \ntruly outstanding young man on the realization of his dream. J.P. \nBlevins, son of John P. and Martha Blevins, of Edmonton, KY, has been \nawarded a scholarship to play basketball for the national champion \nUniversity of Kentucky Wildcats.\n  To date, this 17-year-old junior at Metcalfe County High School has \nhad an outstanding basketball career. It all began in kindergarten when \nhe was selected to play with third-graders during gym class. As a \nseventh grader he played point guard for the varsity team in the \ndistrict final. And as a high school freshman he scored his 1,000th \npoint. When he was 5 years old he disciplined himself to dribble with \nboth hands by wearing cutoff jean shorts and then shoving his right \nhand into his right pocket. The result? This season a 26 point scoring \naverage. These achievements were the result of many hours of discipline \nand hard work and--most of all--an intense passion for the game. \nRemarkably, his zeal for basketball did not cause him to neglect his \nstudies; he is a straight A student.\n  Perhaps what is most remarkable of all is that J.P. Blevins has \nremained modest throughout the attention and praise lavished on him. \nThis is especially refreshing and encouraging in an age where many of \nour athletic stars demonstrate a profound disregard for others, an \nappalling arrogance, and gross self-indulgence. In a Courier-Journal \narticle, Blevin's father was quoted as saying: ``I really believe he \nhas continued to stay humble, even though this is the greatest thing \nthat has happened in his life.''\n  In Metcalfe County, and indeed, throughout the State, basketball \noccupies a special place in the lives of Kentuckians. It is not just \nentertainment, but rather a source of pride and glory. The community \nwhich helped to raise Mr. Blevins is justifiably proud of their native \nson. Despite numerous offers from out-of-State universities, some \nhaving sent 4 or 5 letters a day, Blevins has decided there's just no \nplace like home.\n  According to a recent article, each night, as J.P. is falling asleep, \nthe last thing he sees is a blue flag emblazoned with a white ``K'' \nwhich hangs on his bedroom wall. On the white ``K'' is an autograph \nfrom the Wildcats' coach, Rick Pitino. In his scrapbook, according to \nthe Courier-Journal, Blevins wrote ``Pitino's autograph to me is more \nimportant than the President's.''\n  You may recall the University of Kentucky's recent NCAA championship \nvictory. I am sure that this fine young man will help them to secure \nmany further triumphs. Mr. President, I ask that a recent article from \nthe Courier-Journal be included in the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Jan. 25, 1997]\n\n          Big Blue Dream Comes True for Town and Talented Teen\n\n                            (By Mark Woods)\n\n       Edmonton, KY.--The first autograph request came two years \n     ago.\n       J.P. Blevins, then a freshman at Metcalfe County High \n     School, was sitting on the bus after a basketball game at \n     Marion County when his coach, Tim McMurtrey, told him he had \n     left his shoes in the locker room.\n       ``I knew I hadn't, so I wasn't sure what was going on,'' \n     Blevins said.\n       He went into the locker room and found a man and a young \n     boy standing there.\n       The boy was crying. The father explained that his son \n     thought Blevins had already left.\n       ``We're big Kentucky fans,'' the father said. ``And we hear \n     they're going after you. My son is dying for an autograph. \n     Could you sign this?''\n       It would be one thing if Edmonton, a rural town east of \n     Bowling Green a couple miles off the Cumberland Parkway, had \n     produced another kind of prodigy.\n       For instance, suppose John Paul Blevins were a violinist \n     who had been invited to play Carnegie Hall.\n       That would be noteworthy, but, let's be honest, it wouldn't \n     create quite the same fuss as this . . . a point guard who \n     has been asked to play Rupp Arena.\n       This is a boy who at age 5 devised a system for learning to \n     dribble with both hands--wear cutoff jean shorts, shove the \n     right hand in the back pocket, spend all summer in the \n     backyard dribbling with only the left hand.\n       This is a boy who in kindergarten was put with the third-\n     graders in gym class, who as a seventh-grader played point \n     guard for the varsity team in the district final, who as a \n     freshman scored his 1,000th point and who a month ago, as \n     only a junior, heard University of Kentucky coach Rick Pitino \n     saying seven magical words:\n       ``We want you to be a Wildcat.''\n       What does this mean to Edmonton that 17-year-old Blevins \n     has said, yes, he will take a scholarship to play for UK in \n     1998?\n       Put it this way: The blue sign on Randolph Road says \n     Edmonton's population is 1,630; the gym at the high school \n     holds 2,000 and is usually near capacity for games.\n       Put it another way: They say the phone lines in Edmonton \n     could go down during a Kentucky basketball game and nobody \n     would know.\n       ``The phone never rings during UK games,'' said John P. \n     Blevins, Metcalfe County attorney and father of the future \n     Wildcat player. ``Everybody is either watching or listening. \n     The game is on in all the restaurants. It's on in the nursing \n     homes. It's on in all the households.''\n       Put it one more way: No Metcalfe County player has ever \n     been offered a scholarship to play for UK.\n       In the early '60s, Doug Clemmons did get a basketball \n     scholarship. But that was at Eastern Kentucky University. \n     Heidi Coleman playing for Wake Forest.\n       And then there are the local boys who formed the country \n     band ``The Kentucky Headhunters'' and made it in Nashville.\n       But this is different.\n       This about making it at UK.\n       It isn't the Commonwealth's version of the Damon Bailey \n     story. It's even more wonderfully far-fetched.\n       Bailey, who during his junior years of high school made a \n     verbal commitment to play for Indiana University, came from a \n     small town, but he had plenty of help catching the eyes of \n     college coaches. He went to a larger high school. He had \n     media attention.\n       Blevins' school graduates about 11 students each year. \n     Trips to the state tournament are\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\n     once in a lifetime (1985 is the only one) and media coverage \n     is nearly as rare.\n       As you enter the place, you see a banner that seems fitting \n     these days. ``Our school . . . a place where HOPE begins and \n     DREAMS come true.''\n       Although Metcalfe County High has made plenty of other \n     dreams come true--for instance, one of J.P.'s two older \n     brothers, John, is a sophomore at Yale University right now--\n     it will be tough to top what his story means to this town.\n       ``We're all very proud,'' said Harold Chambers, the \n     assistant principal and athletic director. ``I'm sure it \n     won't be repeated in my lifetime.''\n       It wouldn't be right to call this a one stoplight town. \n     There are two of them--both flashing red hanging over one \n     intersection on the corner of a town square that brings to \n     mind make-believe places like Mayberry and Bedford Falls.\n       In the middle of the square sits the courthouse, a two-\n     story white building. One the four streets that surround it \n     are the library, the bank, the funeral home, the post office, \n     an office for the county attorney, one for the judge, Nunn's \n     Drugs, Rexall's Drugs, Red Wing Shoes, Cliff and Judy's \n     Coffee Shop.\n       If it's not a sleepy little town, it certainly was nodding \n     off.\n       ``About the only excitement we had around here in a while \n     is when someone shot my jukebox with a 9mm,'' says Cliff \n     Shew, owner of the coffee shop.\n       There are equal numbers of parking meters and liquor stores \n     in sight Zero. This is a dry county. But if you're looking \n     for a church, Metcalfe County can offer 39 options.\n       The county's 8,963 residents are spread out over rolling \n     land, 200 square miles of it. Most vote Republican. Most \n     farm. Most have never been in Rupp Arena for a Wildcat game.\n       But, if there's any doubt about whether this is UK country, \n     it disappears with a walk around the square.\n\n\n          uk dream comes true for small town and talented teen\n\n       Three doors down from Blevins' office is Murrell's clothing \n     store. A sign in the corner of one window says ``Tuxedo \n     Rental.'' The rest of the window is filled with Wildcat and \n     Metcalfe County Hornets souvenirs.\n       The store has plenty of everyday clothing. Jeans. Dress \n     pants. Sweaters. But the woman at the counter is purchasing \n     the tiny sweatshirt and sweatpants that say. ``I'm a Little \n     Wildcat.''\n       Lourene Hurt, 65, has barely finished ringing up the sale \n     when the phone rings.\n       ``Someone else placing an order (for the sweats),'' she \n     says afterward.\n       Maybe Blevins' commitment has nothing to do with this. but \n     it certainly makes it easier to believe it's possible to go \n     from being a little Wildcat in Edmonton to a real one in \n     Lexington.\n       ``We had a cheerleader up there a few years ago,'' Hurt \n     says. ``But I believe this is a first. . . . We're all real \n     proud.''\n       A couple doors down is the coffee shop. It has pool tables \n     in back. And in front, behind the counter, the shelves are \n     stocked with candy bars, Skoal and shotgun shells.\n       Ask a few of the regulars if they know J.P. Blevins and \n     they look at you like it's a silly question.\n       ``I knew his granddaddy,'' says Bill Cooksey, 77. ``I used \n     to drive him in my cab.''\n       In one corner of the square sits a memorial erected by \n     Edmonton Post No. 154 of the American Legion. It lists the \n     names of the soldiers who lost their lives in our wars: eight \n     in World War I, 17 in World War II, two in Vietnam.\n       The people here say they share in each other's losses.\n       They also say they share in each other's victories.\n       When the big announcement came, said Carol Perkins, one of \n     Blevins' teachers, ``We were all teary-eyed, hugging the \n     coach, hugging J.P. When something good happens to one of us, \n     it happens to all of us.''\n       Straight A's. A face and haircut that look kind of like Ron \n     Howard in the Richie Cunningham days. And a head that \n     everyone insists hasn't swollen one centimeter with the news \n     that he will be going to Kentucky on a basketball \n     scholarship.\n       ``He's not flamboyant about his talents, athletically or \n     academically,'' said Perkins, who had Blevins in her English \n     honors class last semester. ``You might think he would \n     saunter in and say, `Look at me.' But he's not like that at \n     all. He makes a point to blend.''\n       Not always, though. Take that time in seventh grade when \n     after dinner he asked a couple of the older varsity teammates \n     if they could give him a lift home.\n       Sure, they said, get in the back of the truck.\n       They ended up driving around town for 45 minutes, honking \n     the horn and yelling, ``J.P. Blevins, homecoming candidate.''\n       An embarrassed Blevins eventually just lay down in the \n     flatbed.\n       That incident seems to epitomize Blevins' demeanor. He \n     wouldn't mind being the homecoming king, the basketball star, \n     the valedictorian. But he's not going to be the one looking \n     to call too much attention to it.\n       Blevins never went around bragging that he had been invited \n     to three of UI's Midnight Madnesses. He didn't bother telling \n     classmates that he was getting letters from basically every \n     big-time college in the country. Even on the day after he \n     made the verbal commitment to UK he seemed like the same old \n     J.P.\n       ``I have to say that's one of his most admirable traits,'' \n     his father said. ``I really believe he has continued to stay \n     humble . . . even though this is the greatest thing that has \n     happened in his life.\n       ``It was his dream since he was a little boy. And you \n     figure it's OK to let him dream, OK to let him aim high. But \n     no one knew it would become reality.''\n       How did it become a reality?\n       McMurtrey tried to answer that question as he watched over \n     an elementary school gym class patiently handling \n     interruptions such as one group of young girls running over \n     and yelling, ``Mr. Mac, Mr. Mac, those boys are making faces \n     at us.''\n       Later in the afternoon, before practice, Mr. Mac would be \n     driving a city bus.\n       This is life in the small city.\n       Yet, somehow McMurtrey and Edmonton managed to produce this \n     6-foot-2 guard with the 26-point scoring average and the \n     amazing ease with a basketball in his hands.\n       Although McMurtrey has worked with Blevins since \n     kindergarten, he doesn't try to take credit. Nor do Blevin's \n     parents. Nor his two older brothers. All of them point back \n     to the determination of the little boy in the cut-off shorts.\n       That was the start.\n       He wasn't even in kindergarten when his oldest sibling, \n     half-brother David Garmon, came home from college and told \n     him he should work on his left hand.\n       He might be giving a lecture, thinking all the balls were \n     put away, when he would see Blevins playing with one.\n       ``He'd always wind up with a ball in his hands,'' McMurtrey \n     said. ``And even though you weren't happy he had the ball, \n     you couldn't get too mad.''\n       To understand what happened from there, perhaps it is best \n     to take a tour of the Blevins' two-story brick house.\n       His mother pulls out a scapbook-like ``autobiography'' that \n     J.P. had to put together as a class project in eighth grade.\n       On one of the first pages, there is a picture of J.P. \n     taking a jump shot in his ``favorite basketball shoes.'' His \n     first ones. A pair of red and black Air Jordans.\n       There's a team photo from second grade--the year he made \n     the two game-winning free throws.\n       ``We couldn't get his uniform off him afterward,'' she \n     said. ``He slept on it.''\n       There aren't any shots of Blevins wearing an ``I'm a Little \n     Wildcat'' sweatshirt. But in the basement, surrounded by all \n     the basketballs he has won through the years at UK basketball \n     camps, is a photo of him climbing in a tree, wearing a \n     somewhat prophetic T-shirt.\n       ``Hang on Joe, I'm on my way,'' it says.\n       Joe B. Hall, of course, didn't hang on, and Eddie Sutton \n     came and went.\n       But then Pitino arrived in time for young J.P.'s first UK \n     basketball camp. It was there in the summer of 1989 that The \n     Picture was taken.\n       It is on the shelf in the basement. It is in his bedroom. \n     It is in the autobiography. Under the photo, of J.P. at age 9 \n     and a certain basketball coach at age 37, Blevins wrote: \n     ``Pitino's autograph to me more important than president's.''\n       On the last page of that project, it reads: ``Big Blue \n     Dream. I can.''\n       By this time, he already was a starter on the varsity team. \n     He had begun his seventh-grade season on the freshman team, \n     but quickly began seeing more time with the junior varsity \n     team and eventually the varsity.\n       ``We found out that he was one of our best seven, eight \n     players,'' McMurtrey said. ``In the district final, our point \n     guard, a senior, got three fouls. J.P. ended up playing 22 \n     minutes, scoring eight points. He played very, very well. \n     Even at that age, people couldn't take the ball away from \n     him.''\n       ``He'd go out to the court behind our house, stick his \n     right hand in the back pocket and dribble for 30 to 40 \n     minutes, take a break to get a drink of water and then do it \n     all over,'' his father said.\n       When he got to kindergarten, he already was a better \n     ballhandler than children years older. So he was put in a \n     group of third-graders.\n       It was about this time that McMurtrey began to notice the \n     ever-present ball.\n       ``We would have had to do some redecorating if he had gone \n     somewhere else,'' his mother says on the way to the room.\n       On one side of the bed, there is a poster of Rupp Arena and \n     a license plate that says, ``I'm 4 UK.'' Above the headboard \n     is a print of ``the Unforgettables.'' On the wall opposite \n     the foot of the bed is a poster autographed by his favorite \n     player--former UK star Rex Chapman.\n       A UK bean bag chair sits on the floor, not far from a UK \n     championship floor mat. And hanging on the wall next to the \n     bedside reading lamp is the most prized possession: a blue \n     flag with a white K.\n       Inside the K is a fading Rick Pitino signature from the \n     camp he attended at age 9. Blevins points at it and says, \n     ``The last thing I see before going to bed is this flag.''\n       It's not hard to figure out why Blevins bleeds blue. It's a \n     matter of heredity. Dad can recall listening to UK games B.C. \n     (before Cawood). Mom--Martha, a fifth-grade teacher--can \n     debate which UK player had the sweetest jump shot ever (Jack \n     Givens is her pick).\n       Shortly after Christmas, he got the offer from UK.\n       ``He had to wait a couple days to make his decision,'' \n     McMurtrey said. ``But I think his\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\n     mind was made up before the phone was hung up.''\n       Blevins could have waited until his senior season. He could \n     have weighed the options a little more. But why bother? All \n     that practicing--sometimes sneaking into the gym with \n     borrowed keys, once even climbing through a window--was done \n     with one thing in mind:\n       ``To play for Kentucky . . .,'' he said. ``When I put on \n     that blue jersey, I'll know what that means.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1844-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-3\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The President's message is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification as a treaty, I transmit herewith the Agreement Between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of Hong \nKong for the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders signed at Hong Kong on \nDecember 20, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Agreement''). In \naddition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of \nthe Department of State with respect to the Agreement. As a treaty, \nthis Agreement will not require implementing legislation.\n  This Agreement will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation \nbetween the law enforcement communities of the United States and Hong \nKong, and will provide a framework and basic protections for \nextraditions after the reversion of Hong Kong to the sovereignty of the \nPeople's Republic of China on July 1, 1997. Given the absence of an \nextradition treaty with the People's Republic of China, this Treaty \nwould provide the means to continue an extradition relationship with \nHong Kong after reversion and avoid a gap in law enforcement. It will \nthereby make a significant contribution to international law \nenforcement efforts.\n  The provisions in this Agreement follow generally the form and \ncontent of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United \nStates. In addition, the Agreement contains several provisions \nspecially designed in light of the particular status of Hong Kong. The \nAgreement's basic protections for fugitives are also made expressly \napplicable to fugitives surrendered by the two parties before the new \ntreaty enters into force.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Agreement and give its advice and consent to its ratification as a \ntreaty.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, March 3, 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/03/senate-section/article/S1846-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDER FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
