Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 2378 making appropriations for the Treasury \nDepartment, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the \nPresident, and certain independent agencies, for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1998, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. \n2378 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2378) having met, after full and free conference, have agreed \n     to recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 29, 1997.)\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before proceeding with my statement, I \nask unanimous consent that the following staff be allowed floor \nprivileges during the consideration of the conference report on H.R. \n2378. That will be Pat Raymond, Barbara Retzlaff, Tammy Perrin, Lula \nEdwards, and Frank Larkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, my colleague and I, Senator Kohl, are \nbringing before the Senate today the fiscal year 1998 appropriations \nbill of the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, and \nthe Executive Office of the President, and certain independent \nagencies.\n  This bill contains $25.6 billion in mandatory and discretionary \nfunding for fiscal year 1998. Reaching this level of funding has not \nbeen an easy task, and I would like at this time to publicly thank the \nranking member, Senator Kohl, for his cooperation and continued effort \nin supporting this bill. We have tried our best to be supportive of the \nrequests of individual Senators, and I think our bill reflects that.\n  This bill funds 40 percent of all Federal law enforcement. Adequate \nfunding for this activity has been a top priority for both Senator Kohl \nand myself. In addition to providing sufficient funding for law \nenforcement, this bill goes a long way in encouraging the IRS to stay \non track with modernization while at the same time addressing\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\ntheir needs for the year 2000 computer program.\n  Also, this bill provides for a new $195 million antidrug campaign for \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy targeted at our Nation's \nyouth. This is $20 million above what the administration has requested.\n  In addition, this bill provides $10 million for the Drug Free \nCommunities Act, a program which 27 Members of the Senate cosponsored. \nThese funds will be used for the establishment of local counterdrug \nefforts focusing on successful local initiatives.\n  The bill also includes $159 million for the high intensity drug \ntrafficking areas, or HIDTA's, as they are known. This provides funding \nfor the existing HIDTA's, which are in Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New \nYork, the southwest border, Washington/Baltimore, Puerto Rico/Virgin \nIslands, Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia/Camden, Cascade, the gulf \ncoast, Lake County, the Midwest, the Rocky Mountains, San Francisco, \nand Detroit. In addition, funding is provided for the new HIDTA's in \nWest Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, central Florida and Wisconsin.\n  The bill also provides $10 million for the ATF's Gang Resistance \nEducation And Training Program, or GREAT, as it is known, which many of \nmy colleagues also support. This program provides grants to local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  There is also $13 million for an antidrug technology transfer program \ntargeted at State and local law enforcement. This new program aims at \ngetting much-needed counterdrug technology currently used by Federal \nlaw enforcement out to those in the State and local communities in \ntheir efforts to help them in their efforts in fighting the drug war.\n  These are just a few of the items funded in this bill, Mr. President. \nThis bill has taken lots of very, very hard work to stay within the \nbudget agreement and still fund many important programs within the \njurisdiction of the bill. I think this bill takes a strong stand for \nlaw enforcement while at the same time meeting the needs of many non-\nlaw enforcement agencies within the bill.\n  Therefore, I urge my Senate colleagues to support this bill. I \nbelieve it goes a long way in supporting what we all believe is \nimportant, primarily to continue to do what we can to reduce crime in \nthe Nation.\n  Mr. President, this bill is the result of lots of hard work on behalf \nof Members and staff, too. I wish to thank all of them for that effort. \nI believe it deserves our support.\n  I now yield to Senator Kohl, our ranking minority member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this bill which provides funding \nfor the Department of the Treasury, Executive Offices of the President, \nGeneral Services Administration, and related agency programs. We have \ntried to be as critical and constructive as we can be. And I believe we \nhave provided a strong funding bill.\n  Throughout this year we have had to grapple with a number of \ndifficult issues, such as: accusations of IRS staff browsing at \ntaxpayer files; IRS modernization efforts going awry; unidentified \ncentury date change requirements; and the appropriate funding level of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, media campaign.\n  These are issues we will continue to review and examine in 1998. And \nI hope we see some real progress occur as a result of the funding that \nwe have provided.\n  In addition, we continue to be concerned with the level of crime \nthrough out our country. We realize that the money that is available \nthrough illegal drug and gun trafficking is enormous. As long as this \nkind of profit is available by doing illegal things our job will be \nmore difficult in providing the necessary funding and technology \nrequired to deter that.\n  As a result, we have worked vigorously to fund the law enforcement \nagencies' priorities. And I hope that we can continue to work together \nto continue to fully fund much needed crime prevention programs such as \nGREAT, the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, the Drug Free \nPrison Zone demonstration project and others.\n  I have enjoyed reviewing the diverse and complex issues of the \nagencies funded through this bill. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith the subcommittee members and these agencies. Only through a \nconstructive dialog, in a bipartisan fashion can we continue to build \nand maintain the agencies contained in this bill.\n  Finally, I want to say that I have enjoyed working with you, Mr. \nChairman, and with your staff.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                  OIRA\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask the Chairman, is it correct that it \nis Congress' intent that the budget appropriated for the Office of \nManagement and Budget includes sufficient funds for the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, to coordinate and implement \nthe Congressional Review Act?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chairman. It has become evident that OIRA \nhas not been implementing and coordinating the Congressional Review Act \ndespite its organizing statute and President Clinton's Executive order. \nTo make the Congressional Review Act work, Congress and the agencies \nneed OIRA's expertise to coordinate agency input to the General \nAccounting Office on the new rules they promulgate. The General \nAccounting Office has reported to us that they have been frustrated by \nOIRA's refusal to work with them in their role of helping Congress \nunderstand the impact of each major rule.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator.\n  We have several requests for time on both sides of the aisle, Mr. \nPresident. I would be happy to have Senator Kohl yield time to Senator \nWellstone.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield to Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank both my colleagues, Senator Kohl from Wisconsin and Senator \nBen Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado, for their fine work.\n  Let me, first of all, say, Mr. President, I understand this is a \nconference committee report, we will have a vote on it and there are \nmany, many good things in this bill. I understand the good work of all \nSenators. I also want to express my personal gratitude to \nRepresentative Bernie Sanders in the House and Senator Harkin for a \nprovision, with the support of my colleagues, that they now have in \nthis bill which really puts our country on the side of taking some \naction against coerced child labor in other countries. I think it is a \nterribly important provision, and I am very pleased to see this \nprovision in this conference report, Mr. President.\n  So it is with a little bit of regret that I speak against this bill. \nI intend to vote against it, though, again, I want to make it clear why \nbecause there are a lot of good things in the bill.\n  When we had this bill before us in the Senate, I had sent a letter \nout to colleagues saying that I thought it was not appropriate for us \nto take a pay increase, cost-of-living increase, salary increase, \nwhatever you want to call it, which I would raise our salaries to about \n$136,000. I sent a letter to all my colleagues, and then we in the \nSenate voice voted for the proposition that we would delete that pay \nincrease. So the Senate took a position when we voice voted that we are \nnot going to have a recorded vote because there is unanimity, there is \na consensus in the Senate, that this cost-of-living adjustment for \nMembers is not the right thing to do. I regret to say that in the \nconference committee we did not keep this pay increase out of this \nlegislation. So now we are here today with the pay increase.\n  Now, a filibuster is beside the point. There is much in this bill \nthat is very good. It is going to pass. I understand that. But I want \nto go on record as a Senator from Minnesota about this pay increase, \nnot to talk about the process, though I must say I think my colleagues \nhave done a pretty good job of not being recorded for or against this \npay increase.\n  To me, there is something more important. That is why I speak in the \nSenate this morning and why I am going to vote against this conference \nreport. I hope other Senators will as\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\nwell. I put the cost-of-living increase or pay increase for Senators \nand Representatives in the context of the debate that we have had on \nthe floor of the Senate over the last several years. I have traveled in \nthe country and spent a lot of time in poor communities, and I cannot \neven begin to tell you the number of Head Start teachers who tell me \nhow important early Head Start is, how it would make so much difference \nif they could have a chance to work with kids when they are 1 and 2 \nyears of age to give them a head start. We have a pittance of funding \nfor that. We say we do not have any more money for it, and yet we give \nourselves a salary increase.\n  I cannot begin to describe the conversations that I have had with \npeople all across the country about child care, affordable child care, \nwhich by the way is not just a problem for low-income people, but is a \nproblem for middle-income and moderate-income families as well. Again, \nwe have made precious little investment in children for child care but \nwe give ourselves this salary increase.\n\n  I was at the University of Iowa on Monday and there I found a focus \non Pell grants. I can't tell you how many people in the higher \neducation communities say, ``Look, by doing so little by way of \nexpanding Pell grants--yes, you did the tax deductions and tax \ncredits--you are still not dealing with the students most in need.'' \nExpansion of the Pell grant is by far the most effective way to do \nthis. We say we cannot do it, but we give ourselves a salary increase.\n  Mr. President, most poignantly of all, or at least most poignant to \nme, we voted not long ago for some $50 billion in deficit reduction, \nand the two major programs that we targeted were, first, the Food Stamp \nProgram, which is the major safety net program in this country when it \ncomes to nutrition for children; and second, benefits for legal \nimmigrants. Now, we have restored some of the benefits, though, again, \nwe still have eliminated food and nutrition assistance for legal \nimmigrants, and by the year 2002 there will be a 20 percent cut in food \nassistance for children.\n  Over 50 percent of the cuts we have made come from the Food Stamp \nProgram, which is the major food nutrition program in this country and \nis our major safety net program. This is the program that has led to a \nsignificant reduction in malnutrition and hunger among children, and \nyet we said that in the name of sacrifice and in the name of deficit \nreduction and in the name of tightening our belt that we would cut the \nmajor nutrition programs for children in America, and at the same time \nwe are now about to vote for a conference report that gives ourselves a \nsalary increase, putting our salaries over $136,000 a year.\n  I don't think a salary increase is appropriate, Mr. President. I just \ndon't think it is appropriate. That is my own view. I have had a chance \nto come to the floor of the Senate and express that view honestly, \nopenly and directly. I expressed that view in the letter I sent to my \ncolleagues before this ever came out of the Senate. I sent another \nletter to conferees saying, please stick to the Senate position. We had \na unanimous vote in the Senate to stop this pay increase and yet we \nstill now have the increase in this piece of legislation.\n  I just don't see the justice of it, colleagues. I don't see how we \ncan cut basic benefits to the most needy and vulnerable citizens in \nthis country--food and nutrition benefits for children in the name of \nbelt tightening, sacrifice and deficit reduction--and at the same time \ngive ourselves a salary increase, putting our salary over $136,000 a \nyear. I don't think it is appropriate. I don't think it is the right \nthing to do.\n  As good a job as both colleagues have done on this piece of \nlegislation, I will vote against this bill and I hope other colleagues \nwill as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I yield 2 minutes to my friend \nfrom Kansas, Senator Brownback, I commend Senator Wellstone for \npersonally taking the lead on many of our children's issues in the U.S. \nSenate. I have always admired him for that. He knows my background from \na home for orphans as a youngster, and I have always really appreciated \nhis willingness to fight the battles for so many children in Congress \nwho do not have a voice themselves.\n  In this bill there are many dollars, in fact, many tens of thousands \nof dollars, that are going to eventually help youngsters. The GREAT \nProgram is a good example, the Youth Crime Awareness Program is a good \nexample. Just because we fund money through the Federal agencies \ndoesn't mean that some of it has not gone to help reduce gang violence \nor trying to get youngsters away from a life of crime.\n  I point out that I think in the other bills that have come before the \nSenate we have tried to at least keep the baseline steady, in fact, \nincreased funding for many children programs in other areas of the \nnational budget.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is less in the spirit of a question, but I want \nto make it clear to my colleague, because I appreciate what he said, I \nhave no objection to increases for other programs for children in the \nGovernment, and I understand full well some of the important programs \nin this piece of legislation.\n  That is not my quarrel. My quarrel is the proposition that we did not \neliminate the pay increase for ourselves. And I think we should have \nincluded increases for the other programs I spoke about.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Kansas [Mr. \nBrownback].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for \nyielding.\n  I want to express my appreciation and congratulations to the \nconferees on the bill and what they put together. Overall, it is a good \nbill. There is a provision in this that I disagree with, and I will \njoin my colleague from Minnesota in voting and stating my position \nagainst this bill because it does contain the COLA for Members of \nCongress.\n  That amendment was offered by myself and the senior Senator from \nMinnesota and was a bipartisan amendment which prohibited the Congress \nfrom receiving a cost-of-living adjustment in fiscal year 1998. Mr. \nPresident, I strongly believe that Congress should not receive a COLA \nuntil we balance the budget. The Senator from Minnesota and I have \ndifferent reasons for doing this but the same objective, which is to \nobject to the COLA for Members of Congress. I note, as well, that \nMembers of Congress have not received a COLA for several years to date. \nI have been involved in those fights when I was in the House. The \nproblem for me is that I think while we are moving to balance the \nbudget and we are asking everyone to sacrifice in getting that done, \nthat we should not be receiving a COLA during that period of time. \nWhile we have passed legislation to balance the budget, we are not \nquite there yet. But we are close.\n  Mr. President, it has never been my purpose in this debate to cast \naspersions upon any of my colleagues or the institution of the \nCongress. I have great respect for the Senate and the people with whom \nI have the privilege to serve--all of the people in the Senate and all \nthe people in this body. But I continue to believe that we should not \nreceive a COLA while we are still running deficits. We should lead by \nexample and not raise our COLA while we are still getting the \nGovernment's fiscal house in order.\n  Therefore, I oppose this conference report and call on my colleagues \nto do the same. I believe this is the kind of leadership that is \nnecessary to finish the work of balancing the budget and beginning to \npay down our massive public debt. I think our children deserve no less. \nFor that reason, I do oppose overall the conference report. For that \nreason, even though I think it has many, many, very good features and I \ncongratulate my colleagues for putting it together, I cannot support \nthe COLA at this point in time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleagues from Kansas and Minnesota.\n  I point out a couple of things: It has been 5 years in which most of \nthe Members voted down a cost-of-living increase for themselves; also, \nas they both remember when we were here on the floor with this bill a \nmonth or so ago, it was Senator Brownback's\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\namendment and cosponsored by Senator Wellstone and me to delete that \nCOLA increase from the original bill.\n  So I think I have a pretty strong record. In fact, I have never voted \nfor a pay increase in the U.S. Senate. And in fact when we did go to \nconference, as the Senator probably knows, both Senators probably know, \nthere was a vote. It was a tie vote. It was not deleted. But Senator \nKohl and I both voted against a pay raise in conference, if you want to \nuse that phrase, but some people have a disagreement. However, we lost.\n  The question here is, should we sink a $26 billion bill because we \ndidn't get our way in conference or we didn't get our way on the floor? \nI have been torn with this myself, too. It is a difficult decision for \nall of us, but frankly I just think there is so much good in this bill \nthat there are other options. Certainly we can return it to the \nTreasury. If Members do not want it, certainly they can give it to \ncharity as I have done in the past. They can give it to scholarships.\n  From my perspective, Mr. President, this bill is extremely important. \nToday is the date that funding runs out. It seems to me we need to pass \nthe bill even if we don't agree with the various parts of it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I say to the Senator from Colorado he has been a \nleader in this effort on Members of Congress not receiving a COLA, and \ndid put this in the bill that came from the Senate. That was the Senate \nprovision, that there would not be a COLA for Members of Congress. That \nwas the Senate provision. It was the House that put in otherwise.\n  I recognize the work that the Senator has done, and I appreciate that \nvery much. I also recognize the totality of the bill and the excellent \nqualities within it. I just want to note that because it had that \nprovision I could not support it, but by no means question you or other \nMembers of the Senate. Our provision did not have the COLA in it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, I rise today in opposition to the Treasury, \nPostal, and general Government appropriations bill. I do so with \nrespect for the managers of the bill, my good friends Senator Campbell \nof Colorado and Senator Kohl of Wisconsin. They have done a fine job of \nbringing divergent interests together, crafting a bill that takes care \nof essential Government functions. Clearly, there is much that is right \nwith this bill.\n  One thing that is right is funding for the Global Trade and Research \nProgram at the Montana World Trade Center in Missoula, MT. This vital \nprogram is the only world trade center housed in a university. This \nimportant link will allow new global business markets to be identified \nand targeted to create new jobs in Montana.\n  But, Mr. President, I will vote against this bill because it contains \na pay raise for Members of Congress. Look, I'm not against pay raises. \nWho couldn't use a few extra dollars in every paycheck. The question \nis: who needs the raise. Clearly, Montanans do. And I think with this \nbill we are missing the point and sending the wrong message.\n  The message this bill sends is simply ``we are going to protect \nourselves instead of creating an economy that protects average \nfamilies.'' That just doesn't make sense.\n  A vote to raise Members' pay is the wrong priority for Congress. This \nis not the kind of leadership the Congress needs. I believe that we \nwill be as effective as leaders as the level of confidence vested in \nus. Clearly, voting to raise our pay will undermine public confidence \nin Congress. Particularly when we have an economy that isn't protecting \naverage Americans.\n  It is clear that income for the average Montanan is not rising. Just \nMonday, the Census Bureau released consumer income statistics for 1994 \nto 1996. The numbers are startling and, I hope, a call to action for \nthis Congress. Let's look at Montana. Median household income in \nMontana from 1994 to 1996 was $28,838. That's household income, money \nthat an entire family has to spend for the year on bills, groceries, \neducation, health care, and all the other expenses that take a bite out \nof their wallets. Montana's median income for those 3 years is over \n$6,000 lower than the national average and ranks 43d in the Nation.\n  And, compared to our regional neighbors, our median income ranks as \nthe lowest. Now, we have all seen the stock market rise over the last \nfew years. And clearly, a healthy percentage of Americans are making \nsignificant money. But it hasn't trickled down, to borrow a phrase, to \nthe average Montanan.\n  I grew up on a ranch where it was a day's work for a day's pay. \nAmericans work hard. And we in Congress work hard, but let's not lose \nsight of who we work for. We work for the citizens of our States and \nour country. We have a responsibility to protect them and to advance \ntheir ability to get a fair wage for a fair day's work. That should be \nthe job of this Congress, not whether we in this Chamber are getting a \nraise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am sorry to say that I cannot support \nthe legislation before the Senate today. While this bill contains many \ngood provisions, I have never supported any legislation to raise the \npay of Members of Congress, and I will not support this bill.\n  Yes, the Republican Congress has accomplished much this year. We have \npassed legislation which puts us on track toward balancing the Federal \nbudget and providing much-needed tax relief for Americans. We have \nreformed the welfare system, our nation's immigration policies, ensured \nour national security, and many other laudable accomplishments.\n  But there are many tasks the American people expect us to complete \nthat we have yet to accomplish.\n  We still face a $5.4 trillion national debt, which will increase by \nhundreds of millions of dollars for several more years. In fact, \ncurrent predictions are that we will not eliminate annual deficits \nuntil 2001 or 2002, and our national debt will have increased to nearly \n$6 trillion by that time. We have a long way to go before we can claim \nto have ended the fiscal irresponsibility that has saddled our children \nand grandchildren with this staggering debt.\n  We still face the daunting tasks of ensuring the future viability of \nthe Medicare and Social Security systems, improving access to and \naffordability of health care for all Americans, reducing the size and \nintrusiveness of our Federal Government in people's lives, and ensuring \nthe continued economic health of our Nation.\n  Members of Congress already rank in the top 1 percent of wage earners \nin this country. Public service in the Congress should not be a means \nto becoming wealthy, but an opportunity to serve our country.\n  I intend to vote against this legislation. And if it passes, I will \nnot accept a pay raise. I have donated to charity every pay raise \nCongress has approved for itself since I have been in office, and I \nwill do the same with this raise.\n  Mr. President, I find it quite ironic that, at the same time the \nCongress is proposing to raise pay for Members, we are also wasting \nmore millions of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary, wasteful programs.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains the usual earmarks and set-asides \nrequested by Members of Congress for their home States or districts.\n  I am particularly disappointed to note that the conferees retained \nall but one of the provisions to which I had objected in the Senate \nbill. And that one provision that was not retained in the conference \nbill--an earmark of $4 million each for repair work at the Truman and \nJohnson Presidential Libraries--has, instead, been clearly earmarked in \nthe conference report language.\n  I would like to list for my colleagues the Senate bill language, \nretained in this conference agreement, that are earmarks for \nunnecessary or low-priority spending or that are protectionist in \nnature.\n  There is $1.25 million earmarked for the Global Trade and Research \nProgram at the Montana World Trade Center, which the report indicates \nis a one-time set-aside to support research and dissemination of \ninformation on exploration, definition, and measurement of \ncontributions to economic globalization. I should note that the Senate \nhad allocated $2.5 million for this program, and the conferees very \nfrugally cut this earmark in half.\n\n[[Page S10249]]\n\n  Section 107--Prohibition on reorganizing the Aberdeen, SD, office of \nthe IRS until toll-free phone line assistance reaches an 80-percent \nservice level. We all know the difficulties experienced by all \ntaxpayers in getting accurate, timely information from the IRS. But why \nshould the taxpayers in Aberdeen, SD, be guaranteed continued access to \nan area IRS office? What about taxpayers in North Dakota? Or rural \nOhio? And what if it makes sense to save money by closing some IRS \noffices in order to devote more resources to achieving the 80 percent \nservice level for IRS telephone assistance?\n  Section 108--Prohibition on reorganizing the IRS Criminal \nInvestigative Division if the result is a reduction of criminal \ninvestigators in Wisconsin and South Dakota from the 1996 level. Again, \nI question whether the Congress is the right body to decide whether the \nIRS' criminal investigative resources should be concentrated.\n  Section 123--Requirement to establish the port of Kodiak, AK, as a \nport of entry requiring U.S. Customs Service personnel in Anchorage to \nserve that port. Neither the Senate report nor the conference report \noffer any particular rationale for this directive.\n  Earmark of $3 million for the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Area, plus $1.5 million earmarked for methamphetamine \nreduction efforts at the facility. I ask my colleagues, do we know \nwhether the Rocky Mountain area is most needful of this extra money?\n  Sections 507 and 508--Provisions requiring compliance with Buy \nAmerica trade restrictions. I have long sought to remove all \nprotectionist restrictions on free trade, and having made some \nprogress, I guess the conferees wanted to ensure that nothing would \nchange in the global marketplace.\n  Not surprisingly, the conferees also added several provisions from \nthe House bill that are the same type of wasteful spending:\n  Earmark of $10 million for three newly designated High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Areas--one in the three-State area of Kentucky, Tennessee, \nand West Virginia; one in central Florida; and one in Milwaukee, WI \nthat was not included in either bill. We all support heightened efforts \nto combat drug trafficking throughout the United States, but I wonder \nhow the Appropriations Committee determined that these three locations \nwere the highest priority areas for funding for antidrug efforts?\n  Section 410--Earmark of ``such sums as may be necessary'' to repay \ndebts to the U.S. Treasury incurred by the Pennsylvania Avenue \nDevelopment Corporation. How much is ``necessary''? And what sense does \nit make to appropriate Federal tax dollars to repay the Federal \nTreasury?\n  Section 412--Directed sale of the Bakersfield Federal Building at 800 \nTruxton Avenue in Bakersfield, CA, including all land and improvements. \nIt is unclear from the conference agreement or the House report \nlanguage whether the Federal Government wants to dispose of this \nproperty, or if the Congress has unilaterally decided to demand that it \nbe sold.\n  Mr. President, these are just the provisions that are included in the \nbill. The report language of this conference agreement contains \nnumerous other earmarks and set-asides. Let me note just a few:\n  Three Hundred thousand dollars to staff a dedicated commuter lane in \nEl Paso, TX. This was an earmark in the Senate report that is repeated \nin the conference report, for emphasis, I guess.\n  Language ``encouraging'' the Customs Service to provide extended \nhours at the Opa-locka Airport in Florida.\n  Language ``urging'' GSA to consider the needs of the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee and to give the USOC priority in acquiring a Federal building \nin Colorado Springs, just in case the current occupants--the U.S. Air \nForce Space Command--decide to move out.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectionable provisions in \nthis conference agreement be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it is important to note for my colleagues that \nthis conference agreement, like each of the four other conference \nagreements the Senate has approved in the past few days, contains a \nclause in the statement of managers language that specifically endorses \nevery single earmark and set-aside in the underlying reports of the \nHouse and Senate, unless specifically stated otherwise in the \nconference report. Mr. President, the bottom line is that Members of \nCongress can use the language in these reports, which ``urges'' or \n``encourages'' or ``strongly supports'' some action, but which falls \nshort of an earmark or directive, to pressure agencies to act \naccordingly.\n  Mr. President, I will say once again that this practice of wasteful \nspending must stop.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Objectionable Provisions in Conference Agreement on H.R. 2378, the FY \n                1998 Treasury/Postal Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                             Bill LANGUAGE\n\n       $1.25 million earmarked for the Global Trade and Research \n     Program at the World Trade Center, which the report indicates \n     is a one-time set-aside to support research and dissemination \n     of information on exploration, definition, and measurement of \n     contributions to economic globalization.\n       Section 107--Prohibition on reorganizing the Aberdeen, \n     South Dakota, office of the IRS until toll-free phone line \n     assistance reaches an 80 percent service level.\n       Section 108--Prohibition on reorganizing the IRS Criminal \n     Investigative Division if the result is a reduction of \n     criminal investigators in Wisconsin and South Dakota from the \n     1996 level.\n       Section 123--Requirement to establish the port of Kodiak, \n     Alaska, as a port of entry requiring U.S. Customs Service \n     personnel in Anchorage to serve that port.\n       Earmark of $10 million for three newly designated High \n     Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas--in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; in \n     the three State area of Kentucky, Tennessee, and West \n     Virginia; and in central Florida.\n       Earmark of $3 million for the Rocky Mountain High Intensity \n     Drug Trafficking Area, plus $1.5 million earmarked for \n     methamphetamine reduction efforts at the facility.\n       Section 410--Earmark of ``such sums as may be necessary'' \n     to repay debts to the U.S. Treasury incurred by the \n     Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.\n       Section 412--Directed sale of the Bakersfield Federal \n     Building at 800 Truxton Avenue in Bakersfield, California, \n     including all land and improvements.\n       Sections 507 and 508--Provisions requiring compliance with \n     ``Buy America'' trade restrictions.\n\n\n                            REPORT LANGUAGE\n\n       [Note: Conferees explicitly endorse all earmarks and set-\n     asides included in either the House and Senate reports, \n     unless specifically addressed in the conference report \n     statement of managers.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nthe fiscal year 1998 Treasury appropriations conference report. First, \nI would like to thank the chairman of the Senate Treasury \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and my good friend, Senator Campbell. He \nand his staff have been most gracious in working with me on a range of \nissues of concern to North Carolina, including funding in the budget of \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for two new data \nacquisition stations [DAS] for the Cumberland County sheriff's office \nand the Guilford County sheriff's office. These two stations will allow \nlaw enforcement in both western and eastern North Carolina access to \nsophisticated technology to examine bullets and bullet fragments found \nat crime scenes. These DAS stations will be powerful crime-fighting \ntools, and I want to thank the chairman for helping to make this \npossible.\n  I also want to thank the chairman for his inclusion of language I \nrequested to repeal section 1555 of the Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act [FASA]. As many of my colleagues in the Senate know, \nthis language was originally passed in 1994 without any hearings, and \nwithout any debate in Congress.\n  It was intended to give State and local governments access to the \nGeneral Services Administration [GSA] purchasing schedule. GSA sells \neverything from office supplies to cars and law enforcement equipment.\n  The problem is this--if every State and local government purchases \ntheir supplies directly through the Federal Government, thousands of \nsmall businesses who currently provide those supplies will go out of \nbusiness.\n  Section 1555 has not yet been implemented--a temporary moratorium was \nenacted in 1995, and most recently extended until the end of this \nsession of Congress as part of the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 1997.\n  If section 1555 were not repealed, most businesses would no longer be \nable to sell products to their local governments, but would be driven \nout by unfair competition. Perhaps a select few would be included in \nthe General Services Administration's purchasing schedules, but heaven \nhelp the small business man or woman who must come to Washington, DC, \nfor permission every time he or she wants to sell office supplies to \ntheir local city council or county commission. Tragically, this is the \nkind of result that section 1555 would bring about, and it would \ndevastate small businesses across the country.\n  I have heard from numerous small business men and women who regard \nthis provision to be a potential disaster, were it ever to be \nimplemented. Thankfully, it will not be, now that language to repeal \nthis statute has been included in this conference report. Section 1555 \nshould never be implemented, it should be repealed as soon as possible. \nI strongly support the repeal language included in the bill.\n\n\n                        CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISE\n\n  Mr. President, there are two other matters addressed in the Treasury \nappropriations conference report which forces me to oppose the bill, in \nspite of much that I have already described which is good.\n  Most troubling to me is language added to this conference report \nwhich removes a Senate amendment placing a 1-year freeze on \ncongressional pay. I am opposed to a congressional pay increase. I am \ndeeply disappointed that Members of Congress will now receive a 2.3-\npercent cost-of-living adjustment [COLA], and I do not plan on \naccepting this increase when I receive it.\n  In fact, I believe that to accept this pay raise next year would be \nin violation of the 27th amendment to the Constitution. I know that \nChairman Campbell and others joined me in opposition to this pay \nincrease, but due to some procedural shortcuts, a conference was \nconvened late on the evening of September 29--on a day when no votes \nhad been scheduled, and I had already made commitments to be in North \nCarolina--for the sole purpose of attaching this pay increase for \nMembers of Congress.\n  I am also deeply disappointed that an amendment I offered to remove \ncomputer games from all Government computers was not included in the \nconference report. I am pleased, however, that Senator Thompson, \nchairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, has indicated his \ninterest in pursuing this issue in the future. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Thompson to ensure that Government employees are \nnot wasting taxpayers' dollars playing computer games when they should \nbe working.\n  Due to the inclusion of the pay raise for Members of Congress and the \nremoval of my amendment to remove computer games from Government \ncomputers, I regret that I must vote against the Treasury \nappropriations conference report on final passage.\n\n\n                     THE CONGRESSIONAL PAY INCREASE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout one provision within the bill before us today. The fiscal year \n1998 Treasury-Postal Appropriations Act contains a cost-of-living \nadjustment--a pay raise--for Members of Congress. This increase \nrepresents a major change in policy. It has not been the subject of \nhearings. It has not been aired in public. The timing and merit are \nquestionable. In light of these concerns, I intend to vote no on the \npay raise, and no on the bill.\n  Each year I have been in the Senate, we have acted to suspend cost-\nof-living adjustments for Congress. In light of our ongoing efforts to \nbalance the Federal budget and restore people's faith in the process, I \nthink this has been the right course. Simply stated, allowing our own \npay to increase sends the wrong signal at a time when the budget is out \nof balance and real wages are stagnant for many workers.\n  Like it or not, we in Federal office have a responsibility to set an \nexample, to set the tone for responsible dialog about the Federal \nbudget. Accepting a pay raise at this time undermines any credibility \nwe might have on budget issues.\n  In July, Congress passed a historic law that will balance the Federal \nbudget. After years of partisan rancor, bickering, disputes, and \nGovernment shut-downs, we were able to put aside differences and agree \non a compromise that makes sense, and gives the people what they have \nbeen asking for.\n  Now, most of us who worked on this package, and made the tough calls \nover the past few years understandably want to promote the compromise \nand take credit for finishing the job. And I think we should. But \ntaking a pay raise on the heels of passing a balanced budget sends the \nwrong signal. It says to the people, ``we didn't really mean it.''\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, it is very difficult for \nme to vote against the Treasury-Postal bill. In fact, it is rare that \nany of us on the committee opposes one of our own bills. In this case, \nI have to make an exception, even though there are many worthy programs \nand projects funded in this bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will hear my reasons and listen to them. As \nelected leaders, we are held to a different standard. We have a \nresponsibility to set the tone, to earn the respect of our \nconstituents. The public will be watching this vote. To them, it is not \nabout funding the executive branch agencies. Instead, it is about \nwhether we are willing to live up to our own standard of fiscal \nresponsibility in 1997.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my opposition to a \nprovision within the Treasury, General Government, Civil Service \nAppropriations Act.\n  I am the ranking member of the subcommittee which crafted this \nlegislation, and there is much to support in the bill. However, I am \nopposed to the provision in the bill to provide a 2.3-percent cost-of-\nliving-adjustment to Members of Congress.\n  I have heard the arguments on both sides of the issue and I cannot \nagree that it is appropriate for Congress to receive this pay raise. \nWhile we have made progress in balancing the budget, we have not made \nthe kind of progress which justifies this raise. The American public is \nrightly holding us to a higher standard, and until we meet that \nstandard, congressional pay should remain at its current level.\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\n  Earlier this week, we had a vote in the House-Senate conference \ncommittee on whether to keep the pay raise in the bill. I was prepared \nto offer a motion to reject the pay raise, and, indeed, voted against \nthe measure. As this body knows, the House voted to insist on its \nposition, and we could not muster a majority in the Senate to similarly \ninsist on this Chamber's position against the pay raise.\n  Mr. President, this bill before us also includes many provisions and \nimportant programs. If this were an up-or-down vote on the pay raise, I \nwould again oppose the measure. But, this bill is more than that--it \nfunds the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the White \nHouse, and dozens of other Federal agencies.\n  In addition, the bill includes many anticrime programs, including \nthose operated by ``Drug Czar,'' the Treasury Department, and the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. I'm pleased that the \nlegislation includes $3 million for the designation of a high-intensity \ndrug trafficking area for milwaukee, WI. Unfortunately, the drug \nepidemic often crosses State lines, and it is necessary for Wisconsin \nlaw enforcement agencies to coordinate with Federal authorities. If the \ndrug czar concurs with the language in this bill, this money will help \nmy State better combat the growing drug problem.\n  The legislation also includes a $1 million increase in the Youth Gun \nCrime Interdiction Initiative. Milwaukee is one of a small number of \ncities selected last year to participate in the program which uses \nresources from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to \ntrace weapons in an attempt to track the seller. The program saw its \nfirst success in April when Milwaukee Police arrested a grocery store \nsecurity guard and charged him with Federal firearms violations. \nLawrence M. Shikes plead guilty to purchasing guns and reselling them \nto juveniles, gang members, and drug dealers in the Milwaukee area. \nThis is an important program, and one of the reasons that I am voting \nfor the overall bill.\n  Mr. President, while I am voting for this bill, I strongly oppose to \nthe congressional pay raise provision. Because of this conviction, I \nwill not accept any increase in my salary. Since coming to the Senate \nin 1989, I have not accepted any salary increase, and I will return any \nfuture pay increase to the U.S. Treasury to reduce the deficit.\n  Since this is one provision of a larger bill, I will vote in favor of \nthe measure.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time \ncontinue to be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted \nto speak as in morning business for up to about 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10245-5", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10251-S10252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SECTION 110 OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND IMMIGRANT \n                           RESPONSIBILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I want to bring to the Senate's \nattention an issue of great concern, not only to my home State of \nMichigan, but also to many other Northeastern States that border \nCanada. Section 110, a rather small provision of the 1996 Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, has generated \nwaves of controversy here in the United States and in Canada because of \nits unintended negative impact on trade and travel between the two \ncountries.\n  Section 110 requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to \ndevelop an automated entry and exit system to document the entry and \ndeparture of every alien arriving in and leaving the United States. The \nterm ``every alien'' certainly would be interpreted to include both \nCanadians and American permanent residents who cross our land borders \nwith Canada.\n  This interpretation conflicts with the decades-old practice of not \nrequiring Canadians to present a passport, visa, or border crossing \nidentification card at the border. As previously described, this \ninterpretation was not intended by the law's authors. My former \ncolleague, Alan Simpson, who preceded me as chairman of the Senate \nImmigration Subcommittee, and Representative Lamar Smith, who is the \ncurrent chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee, wrote in a \nletter last year to the Canadian Government that they did not intend to \nimpose a new requirement for border crossing cards on Canadians who are \nnot presently required to possess such documents.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     His Excellency Raymond Chretien,\n     Ambassador of Canada,\n     Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ambassador: This is in reply to your letter \n     regarding congressional intent in the implementation of \n     Sections 104 and 110 of the ``Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.'' Ms. Strom and Mr. Day \n     were accurate in their description of our intent regarding \n     those provisions.\n       With regard to Section 104, it was not our intent to impose \n     a new border crossing card requirement on Canadians who do \n     not now need to possess such a card to enter the United \n     States. With regard to Section 110, again, it was not our \n     intent that Canadian citizens who now enter the United States \n     without an I-94 will be required to obtain that form in the \n     future.\n       Of course, any Canadians who elect to possess a border \n     crossing card will be subject to the requirements for an \n     improved card; and any Canadians who are now issued an I-94 \n     form will be subject to the new exit control provisions of \n     the law. But, again, we did not intend to impose a new \n     requirement for border crossing cards or I-94's on Canadians \n     who are not presently required to possess such documents.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Alan K. Simpson,\n       Chairman, Subcommittee on\n                                          Immigration, U.S. Senate\n     Lamar S. Smith,\n       Chairman, Immigrations & Claims,\n                                         House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter \nfrom the Canadian Ambassador to Congressman Smith to which his letter \nresponds be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Lamar S. Smith,\n     Chairman, Immigration and Claims,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I wish to bring to your attention some \n     language of the ``Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996'' which, depending on how it is \n     interpreted, could have significant cost implications for the \n     United States as well as affect the mobility of millions of \n     Canadians.\n       Section 110 of the Act requires the Attorney General to \n     develop an automated entry-exit control system at ports of \n     entry. We understand that this provision was introduced to \n     document the entry and exit and gather information on \n     immigration violations committed by foreign nationals who are \n     entering the United States legally either with a U.S. non-\n     immigrant visa or through the privilege of a visa waiver \n     pursuant to the Visa Waiver Program initiated in 1986. \n     Officials in both the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     and the State Department have brought to our attention that \n     the final language of Section 110 uses the word ``alien'' \n     without any qualification. This could be interpreted as \n     including the millions of Canadian citizens who enter the \n     United States every year and are not issued an I-94 form.\n       My officials have discussed the matter informally with Ms. \n     Cordia Strom, your Chief Counsel, and Mr. Richard Day, her \n     counterpart, in the House immigration Subcommittee. Ms. Strom \n     and Mr. Day confirmed our understanding of the legislative \n     intent as stated above. They indicated that Congress did not \n     intend to require the issuance of documentation and the \n     control of departure for the millions of Canadians who have, \n     since well before 1986, traditionally enjoyed the privilege \n     of a summary inspection. Such interpretation would have a \n     very negative impact on cross border mobility at high volume \n     border crossings such as the Rainbow bridge in Niagara Falls \n     or the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. I would therefore be grateful \n     if you could confirm that Congress did not intend to make \n     Canadians subject to this provision.\n       I am also concerned about an interpretation of Section 104 \n     of the same Act that appeared in ``Interpreter Releases'' in \n     their October 7, 1996 issue. The ``Section-by-Section \n     Summary'' of that publication on Section 104 suggests that \n     all aliens must use a border crossing card with a biometric \n     identifier by September 30, 1999.\n       In their efforts to facilitate mobility in the context of \n     the Border Accord, both Canada and the United States, \n     encourage frequent travellers to consider the benefits of \n     using dedicated inspections lines by enrolling in\n\n[[Page S10252]]\n\n     INSPASS or CANPASS. Enrollment in these programs is \n     voluntary. Making it a mandatory requirement would become a \n     major impediment to cross border mobility for millions of \n     American and Canadian travellers. Our reading of Section 104 \n     of the Act does not lead us to such a conclusion. I would \n     therefore also appreciate your confirmation that it was not \n     Congress's intention to require all Canadians, travelling to \n     the U.S. by September 30, 1999, to hold such a card.\n       Thank you in advance for your cooperation on these matters.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond Chretien,\n                                                       Ambassador.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Unfortunately, the INS appears to maintain, regardless \nof the intention, that the law clearly calls for a record of every \nentry and departure by noncitizens entering or departing the United \nStates. I will be sending a letter to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner \nto ask how the agency interprets section 110, how the agency plans to \nimplement the law, and how we might work together to remedy what I see \nas an enormous problem on the horizon.\n  Bumper-to-bumper traffic is not an unusual occurrence in many parts \nof the country, whether its a morning or afternoon commute or a trip to \na football game. This also occurs every day at already busy border \ncrossing points. But imagine if you will, the traffic nightmare of \nback-up for miles and miles that would result from implementing this \nnew provision at all U.S. border crossings. Under the section 110 \nstatute, every Canadian citizen and American permanent resident must \npresent a visa or proper immigration form to border inspectors. In 1996 \nalone, over 116 million people entered the United States by land from \nCanada. Similarly, over 52 million Canadian residents and United States \npermanent residents entered Canada last year. The new provision would \nrequire a stop on the U.S. side to record the exit of each person in \nevery car. That's more than 140,000 every day; 6,000 every hour; 100 \nevery minute. And that is just when you exit the United States. Those \nperson entering the United States from Canada will also confront a \nsimilar circumstance. These delays will affect American citizens alike.\n  Now imagine the economic impact of such a policy. The free flow of \ngoods and services that are exchanged every day through the United \nStates and Canada has provided both countries with enormous economic \nbenefits. Together, trade and tourism between the two nations is worth \na billion dollars a day for the United States, and Canada is the United \nStates' largest trading partner. The State of Michigan is an important \nbeneficiary of this longstanding close relationship. The Ambassador \nBridge in Detroit is the largest land border crossing point in North \nAmerica. The United States automobile industry conducts $300 million \nworth of trade with Canada every day. Michigan, and Detroit in \nparticular, would be severely impacted by excessive delays that would \nsurely arise if truckers were forced to show a visa or fill out \nimmigration forms at each port of entry. New just-in-time delivery \nmethods have made United States-Canadian border crossings integral \nparts of our automobile assembly lines. A delivery of parts delayed by \nas little as 20 minutes can cause expensive assembly line shutdowns.\n  Tourism is another industry that would surely be affected by the \nimplementation of section 110. Suddenly, people in Windsor, Canada, who \nthought they'd head to Detroit for a Tiger's baseball game or Red \nWing's hockey game think again and stay home--with their money. In \nfact, this provision would force all Canadian residents who visit their \nfamily and friends in America to obtain a visa or obtain other \nimmigration forms. It is for these reasons that we have twice rebuffed \nprevious attempts in the Senate to impose a tax on border crossings.\n  Mr. President, our borders are already crowded. In 1993, nearly 9 \nmillion people traveled over the Ambassador Bridge I referred to \nearlier, 6.4 million traveled through the Detroit-Windsor tunnel, and \napproximately 6.1 million crossed the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron. \nThink what it would mean to load them down with paperwork and fee \npayments. Optimistically, the new controls might take an extra 2 \nminutes per border crosser to fulfill. That is almost 17 hours of delay \nfor every hour's worth of traffic. It's just not practical, and we must \nact to prevent it from happening.\n  As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, I intend to \nhold hearings in both Michigan and Washington to learn more of the \nimpact of section 110. I am certain these proceedings will be useful in \ndetermining how to clarify the act and make the case to my colleagues \nthat we must remedy this situation.\n  The illegal immigration law passed last year focused on those persons \nwho enter our Nation illegally, not those who come here legally to make \na better life for themselves and their families--let alone those who \nvisit family here on a regular basis or help carry out our crucial, \nongoing trade with Canada. I should also note that Canadians have not \nhistorically presented significant illegal immigration problems and \nthat I appreciate very much the unique and close relationship Americans \nand Canadians share. Section 110 will not go into effect until \nSeptember 1998. In the meantime, it is my hope that Congress will take \nthe time to closely consider the problems I have outlined and conform \nthe act to reflect current policy and our special relationship with \nCanada.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence after quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10251-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I wish to advise the Senate that the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration met this morning at 10 o'clock \nfor the purpose of voting in executive session to review the \ninvestigation by that committee into the 1996 Louisiana election. The \ncommittee reviewed the evidence, heard the report of the chairman, then \nvoted unanimously on a resolution to terminate the investigation by the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration into that election.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my remarks before the Rules \nCommittee this morning, the text of the committee motion, and several \nletters, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Statement of Chairman John Warner, Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, Louisiana Contested Election, October 1, 1997\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       This business meeting today is called to brief the \n     Committee on the findings of our preliminary investigation of \n     allegations that fraud, irregularities, or other errors \n     affected the outcome of the 1966 Senate election in \n     Louisiana. Our focus primarily will be on those matters the \n     Committee has investigated since the Committee's vote on July \n     31 to continue the investigation.\n\n\n               history of contest prior to july 31, 1997\n\n       Mr. Jenkins' petition addresses one of the closest Senate \n     contested cases in history: Senator Landrieu's margin was \n     just under 6,000 votes out of 1.7 million cast. Mr. Jenkins' \n     amended petition alleged that ``a pattern of misconduct, \n     irregularities, fraud, and political machine corruption \n     violating state and federal law changed the result of the \n     election . . .'' He also alleged that ``state, parish, and \n     precinct officials inadequately administered the 1996 general \n     election and failed to ensure the sanctity of the electoral \n     process in Louisiana so that the results of the 1996 United \n     States Senate election are in doubt.''\n       On April 10, two outside counsel, Bill Canfield and Robert \n     Bauer, respectively selected by the majority and minority \n     members of this Committee to review the pleadings filed by \n     the parties, reported their assessment of only the following: \n     Jenkins' petition and related evidence, the rebuttal material \n     submitted by Senator Landrieu, and the surrebuttal \n     information presented by Mr. Jenkins. It is important to note \n     that their review did not include any field investigation. \n     These counsel jointly recommended that the allegations of \n     fraud, including vote buying, multiple voting, and fraudulent \n     registration, should be investigated by the Committee. They \n     also recommended that the next phase be conducted under their \n     direction, subject to guidance from the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Member. Counsel further recommended that certain \n     types of evidence be dismissed, such as evidence of \n     mismatched signatures and phantom votes. On April 15, the \n     Committee heard from Mr. Jenkins and counsel for Senator \n     Landrieu concerning the Bauer-Canfield joint recommendations.\n       On April 17, the Committee, voting on partisan lines, \n     adopted much of the Bauer-Canfield recommendation, but \n     directed the Chairman to conduct a preliminary investigation. \n     In doing so, the Committee indicated that it would not ignore \n     potential evidence of fraud, including mismatched signatures \n     and phantom voting. I also announced that I desired that the \n     investigation be conducted by a team of outside counsel with \n     extensive investigative experience.\n       Shortly after the Committee vote on April 17, Senator Ford, \n     on behalf of the minority, expressed his desire to conduct \n     the investigation jointly, and requested that an \n     investigative protocol be developed between counsel for the \n     majority, McGuire Woods Battle & Boothe, and counsel for the \n     minority, Perkins Coie. At the same time, I initiated efforts \n     to secure the assistance of detailees from the FBI. After \n     extensive negotiation and the adoption of a protocol, we were \n     able to secure two detailees from the FBI, and additional \n     personnel from the General Accounting Office, and we \n     negotiated the issuance of subpoenas for election records and \n     documents from Mr. Jenkins and Senator Landrieu.\n       In the meantime, our majority outside counsel from McGuire \n     Woods Battle & Boothe, headed by Richard Cullen and George \n     Terwilliger, began a review of Louisiana's election laws and \n     to what extent these laws and implementing regulations were \n     followed in the November election. This examination revealed \n     that many of the laws and regulations--statutory safeguards \n     designed to protect the integrity of the election system--had \n     not been observed: Fraud could have occurred.\n       The full preliminary field investigation then began in \n     earnest on June 9, when two FBI agents were detailed to the \n     Committee, and arrived in New Orleans to work with assistance \n     from two retired FBI agents hired by the Committee. Outside \n     counsel for majority and minority provided guidance as to the \n     agents' activities.\n       A short twelve working days later, the minority \n     unexpectedly pulled out of the investigation and the FBI \n     terminated the detail of the two agents, despite my request \n     that the detail be continued.\n       During those twelve days, our investigative teams had \n     interviewed a number of witnesses who had submitted taped \n     statements to Petitioner that they participated in or \n     observed vote fraud. As has been well publicized by the \n     minority, these witnesses recanted their testimony, stating \n     that they had been paid and coached by a person hired by the \n     Petitioner to make up their stories of fraudulent voting.\n       The complete picture on these witnesses, however, was \n     complicated by the fact that there were reports of threats \n     associated with the witnesses' initial reports, making it \n     unclear if those who did recant were truthful in the first \n     instance, or truthful in their recantation. It is also clear \n     that many of these witnesses were acquaintances who clearly \n     had the opportunity to discuss their testimony. Moreover, a \n     small number of witnesses, alleging fraudulent voting, stuck \n     to their original testimony and never recanted.\n       Senator Ford and I made separate referrals of the evidence \n     of alleged witness tampering and threats to the Department of \n     Justice. In addition, I made a referral of this information \n     to Doug Moreau, the District Attorney for East Baton Rouge, \n     Louisiana, who had opened his own investigation into \n     allegations of election fraud during 1996.\n       Meanwhile, the Committee had charged detailees from the \n     Government Accounting Office to examine election records for \n     discrepancies between vote totals recorded on election \n     documents and machines. This examination focused specifically \n     on four of the seven categories of ``phantom votes'' alleged \n     by Petitioner.\n       An interim report provided to the Committee on July 9 \n     revealed that the allegations of widespread irregularities in \n     these four categories could not be substantiated. While this \n     review confirmed many of the discrepancies identified by Mr. \n     Jenkins, the GAO detailees concluded that all but 153 of the \n     several thousand ``phantom votes'' were explainable. The \n     problems with Petitioner's analysis resulted from three \n     primary factors: (1) transcription errors in the election \n     records themselves; (2) errors in the compilation of \n     numerical results by Mr. Jenkins; and (3) the fact that Mr. \n     Jenkins did not have available to him all of the election \n     documents which were available to the Committee. In short, \n     many errors identified by Mr. Jenkins could be explained by \n     our review of certain election records.\n       It is important to note, however, that while the \n     irregularities in these four categories were not nearly as \n     widespread as alleged by Mr. Jenkins, there were a number of \n     precincts that did contain errors which might have been the \n     result of fraudulent activities. In addition, there was one \n     instance where 100 votes were erroneously credited to Senator \n     Landrieu.\n       Let me for a minute return to the withdrawal of the \n     minority. When the minority withdrew from this investigation, \n     they focused on two facts. First, a number of witnesses to \n     fraud had recanted their original testimony. Second, the \n     allegations of widespread irregularities in four of seven \n     categories raised by Mr. Jenkins were not significant enough \n     to impact the election.\n       At that time, however, there were other significant areas \n     of potential fraud which had not been examined at all. Mr. \n     Jenkins had submitted hundreds of allegedly mismatched \n     signatures which merited audit. He had alleged that massive \n     numbers of voters had not completed legally required forms, \n     which merited review. He had identified over one thousand \n     voters registered to housing that had been abandoned. \n     Petitioner had made allegations of fraudulent registration \n     that had not been examined even though the Bauer-Canfield \n     report had cited it as worthy of review. And allegations of \n     political machine corruption, including the illegal use of \n     corporate funds, deserved review. Remembering that the \n     investigation had already ascertained that many of the \n     statutory safeguards had been ignored, there was clearly the \n     possibility that fraud could have occurred in these areas. It \n     was our duty to further investigate these significant \n     allegations.\n       On July 31, the Committee affirmed my recommendation to \n     continue the investigation, approved the use of designated \n     funds and authorized me to issue subpoenas.\n\n\n                      actions since july 31, 1997\n\n       Immediately after the Committee's action of July 31, I \n     wrote the Attorney General of the United States to request \n     the reassignment of FBI agents to the Committee: this request \n     was rejected. As an alternative, I then hired three \n     additional retired FBI agents using Committee funds. I also \n     sought renewed assistance from GAO, and after significant \n     delay, they provided personnel to review election records \n     assistance in late-August and accountants to examine \n     financial documents in early September. To date, our \n     investigation has encompassed a review of literally thousands \n     of documents and the interview of hundreds of persons.\n       Subsequent to July 31, I issued 40 subpoenas to \n     individuals, organizations, and companies with knowledge or \n     documents related to the election. Some of these were for \n     personal appearance at hearings, some for documents, and some \n     for both. I would like to thank the United States Marshal's \n     office in New Orleans for their help in serving many of these \n     subpoenas in a timely and professional manner. These 40 \n     subpoenas were in addition to\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\n     the 134 Senator Ford and I agreed to issue in May for \n     election records and documents from the parties.\n       The Committee also held four full days of field hearings in \n     Louisiana and another hearing here in Washington. I will turn \n     to the findings of these hearings in a moment.\n       Our sole focus was to fairly and impartially gather a body \n     of evidence--to determine the presence or absence of fraud or \n     irregularities--upon which the Committee, and ultimately the \n     Senate, could make a reasoned judgment with regard to the \n     petition submitted by Mr. Jenkins.\n\n\n                results: election records and interviews\n\n       Election records, if properly prepared and maintained, are \n     the post-election means to a prompt and reliable assessment \n     that fraud did not penetrate an election. Indeed, with the \n     advent of electronic voting machines, these records are often \n     the only evidence available to demonstrate--corroborate--that \n     an election was conducted properly and that the machines \n     accurately reflect legitimate votes. Without reliable \n     records, investigation of vote fraud allegations must involve \n     time consuming and intrusive examination of the actions of \n     both individual voters and groups involved in the political \n     process.\n       If the legal requirements of the registration and voting \n     process are adhered to and reliable records of the same are \n     created and maintained, allegations of fraud can be \n     expeditiously examined. If widespread fraud occurred, \n     reliable records should readily yield evidence of the vote \n     fraud. However, the absence of such records and effective \n     registration and voting processes creates opportunity for \n     fraud to exist.\n       Thus, candidates, election officials, and voters all share \n     a common interest in electoral procedures that meet the \n     requirements of the law. Anything less challenges the \n     fundamental public interest in reliable and final elections.\n\n          Review of ``suspect'' precincts and voter interviews\n\n       Our GAO detailees have thoroughly examined the election \n     documents in 34 precincts across the state. These precincts \n     were identified by the Committee as ``suspect'' because of a \n     variety of factors: Places where multiple voting was alleged, \n     unusual registration patterns, late closing of machines, etc.\n       This analysis revealed numerous irregularities with these \n     records: names on a poll list but not on a register, and vice \n     versa; poll lists which are supposed to be duplicate have \n     names out of order; and names on poll lists more than once.\n       Had irregularities not existed and had other safeguards not \n     been ignored, our investigation may have been completed \n     sooner. But these irregularities did exist, warranting \n     further examination of a sampling of voters to assess whether \n     this election was tainted by--and affected by--fraud. In \n     certain of these precincts, Committee staff compared \n     signatures on precinct registers with the signatures on \n     registration cards to identify potentially questionable \n     voters.\n       Our investigators have now interviewed voters from a third \n     of the ``suspect'' precincts. With few exceptions, these \n     voters have confirmed the fact that they voted. In the few \n     exceptions of fraud that we have uncovered, there is no \n     evidence of an organized, widespread effort to secure \n     fraudulent votes on behalf of any individual, and certainly \n     no evidence of any effort to secure votes specifically on \n     behalf of Senator Landrieu.\n\n                   Duplicate social security numbers\n\n       We have identified over 1500 voters with the same social \n     security number as another voter, and we have learned that a \n     number of these pairs of voters both voted. However, our \n     investigation has revealed no scheme or effort to cast \n     illegal votes, and more significantly, the evidence we have \n     gathered to date indicates that the majority of these \n     duplicate social security numbers appear to be the result of \n     erroneous entry of social security numbers.\n\n                 Voters registered at abandoned housing\n\n       We have reviewed Petitioner's allegations that over a \n     thousand voters in Orleans Parish were registered at housing \n     that had been abandoned before the election. First, our \n     review of a sample of these voters revealed that none of them \n     had registered before the housing became abandoned. Second, a \n     comparison of registration records and records from the \n     Housing Authority of New Orleans revealed that of 522 voters \n     from four precincts that were reviewed, 41% still lived in \n     housing that Mr. Jenkins alleged was vacant. Third, an \n     additional 45% of these 522 voters had moved to other housing \n     within Orleans parish, and were legally permitted to vote in \n     their old precinct.\n\n Inactive voters required by law to complete address confirmation forms\n\n       Under Louisiana law (18:192), address confirmation \n     postcards are sent to voters every four years. Voters whose \n     postcards are returned because the addresses are apparently \n     invalid, are placed on ``inactive status'', and these voters \n     are required by law to complete an ``Address Confirmation \n     Sheet'' confirming that they still live within the parish, \n     before they are permitted to vote.\n       Petitioner alleged that approximately half of the inactive \n     voters in certain parishes did not fill out the required \n     forms. He also expressed concern that the list of inactive \n     voters is available to the public, and thus could be used to \n     send imposters to the polls.\n       Of 170 precincts reviewed in Orleans Parish, we found \n     approximately one voter per precinct who had not completed \n     the requisite form and no more than seven in any one \n     precinct. Overall, 55% of those required to fill out the form \n     did not do so. In addition, in the 29 ``suspect precincts'' \n     in Orleans Parish, we found that few voters had completed the \n     form as required, but this still only amounted to \n     approximately two voters per precinct. We also attempted to \n     contact voters in the suspect precincts who should have \n     completed these forms. Although many could not be contacted, \n     of the nine we did contact, each of them confirmed that they \n     voted, and several reported that they had completed the form, \n     indicating sloppy record keeping.\n       While it may be argued that these are illegal votes under \n     Louisiana law, it is also clear that these are errors that \n     could have been brought to the attention of the precinct \n     commissioners at the time of the election, and the issue may \n     be waived for failing to raise it at that time. In addition, \n     the disparate nature of these irregularities is far more \n     indicative of negligence than a pattern of fraud.\n\n\n                    Illegal Corporate Contributions\n\n       We have attempted to examine whether local political \n     organizations or gambling-related corporations illegally \n     influenced the election in violating federal and state \n     campaign finance laws. Foremost in this review was an \n     examination of the activities of a group known as the \n     Louisiana Independent Federation of Electors (``LIFE'') and \n     the marketing firm utilized by LIFE, Carl Mullican \n     Communications, and those of several gambling companies.\n       Our review indicates that some federal and state election \n     campaign laws may have been ignored, avoided, and even \n     intentionally violated. There is evidence that gambling money \n     used to pay canvassers, and donations given to local \n     political organizations, may have resulted in illegal \n     donations to federal candidates. However, there is no \n     significant body of evidence that this use of money or other \n     infractions of campaign laws was intended to aid the campaign \n     of Senator Landrieu. Rather, the activities appear to be \n     directed at local initiatives and elections. The absence of \n     significant evidence of an organized effort to directly and \n     illegally assist Senator Landrieu makes it appropriate to let \n     the existing system (i.e., the Federal Election Commission \n     and appropriate state authorities) assess where possible \n     election campaign violations might have occurred.\n\n\n            Vote Buying and Transporting Voters to the Polls\n\n       There is evidence that voters were transported to the polls \n     which is illegal under most circumstances under Louisiana \n     law. However, our investigation has revealed little evidence \n     of fraudulent vote buying, and no evidence of an organized \n     effort to buy thousands of votes so as to impact the Senate \n     election.\n\n\n                      employees forced to campaign\n\n       We did confirm the existence of an organized effort to use \n     city employees in support of election efforts. We did not, \n     however, find any evidence that this was directed toward the \n     benefit of Senator Landrieu. Nor did we find any significant \n     evidence of illegal coercion. Moreover, this type of evidence \n     normally does not support an election contest.\n\n\n                        areas under examination\n\n       Before making my recommendation with regard to Mr. Jenkins' \n     petition, I note that there are two areas of examination that \n     require greater discussion.\n       First, we were unable to conduct a direct examination of \n     possible fraudulent registration by using the State's voter \n     registration computer database. This system, when prepared \n     and operated properly, is a significant safeguard against \n     multiple registrations. In addition to the many voters \n     registered with the same social security number, we learned \n     that there are over 200,000 registrants who have no social \n     security number in the database, making in easier for \n     fraudulent registrations to be submitted without detection.\n       A federal district court has ruled that the Commissioner of \n     Elections may no longer collect social security numbers, \n     raising issues about the propriety of his maintaining those \n     he has collected. This issue caused the Commissioner to \n     refuse to comply voluntarily with a subpoena, and to advise \n     us that he would resist our request in court. This position \n     has been confirmed by the fact that Doug Moreau, the District \n     Attorney for East Baton Rouge, is currently in court \n     litigating the Commissioner's refusal to provide him a copy \n     of the state voter registration computer database (which \n     include social security numbers). Mr. Moreau is seeking these \n     records to assist him in his investigation of possible \n     illegal election activities during the November 1996 \n     elections.\n       Second, under Louisiana law (18:102(1)), a convicted felon \n     may not legally vote until he has completed this sentence, \n     including any period of parole or suspension. These voters \n     are supposed to be taken off the voter database and not be \n     allowed to vote. It was recently reported that there are over \n     100,000 convicted felons that may not have been purged from \n     the voter registration records, possibly leading to illegal \n     votes. The Office of the Commissioner of Elections advised \n     Committee staff last week that only about 2,100 felons \n     remained on the registration records, with the number that \n     voted less than the 2,100. Yesterday, it was reported in \n     Louisiana press that parish registers are finding felons on \n     their registration rolls at a\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\n     number higher than indicated by the Commissioner of \n     Elections.\n       I spoke with the Governor last evening and he assured me--\n     as he also stated in his letter to me which I received on \n     Monday of this week--that he would call for a bipartisan \n     investigation of this issue of felons possibly voting in the \n     election. I also spoke with the East Baton Rouge District \n     Attorney who informed me that he would be examining this \n     issue also.\n       There is no way, at this time, to itemize the amount of \n     time and Committee effort that could be expended in assessing \n     these two areas, although it clearly could be very \n     substantial.\n\n\n                             Recommendation\n\n       While it is not necessary that the evidence gathered during \n     a preliminary investigation prove that the election outcome \n     was the result of fraud or irregularities, that evidence must \n     indicate that further investigation is likely to result in \n     that conclusion before proceeding to a full and lengthy \n     investigation.\n       The facts submitted by Petitioner, and gathered by this \n     Committee to date, do not meet that level of proof. It may be \n     impossible, given the state of observance--or lack thereof--\n     of election laws, and lax record keeping by Louisiana \n     officials, for Petitioner to ever overcome this burden. This \n     observation has been made by the Governor and the Moreau.\n       But the failure of election safeguards and lax record \n     keeping do not suffice to overcome an election. More is \n     required. There must ultimately be proof that the election \n     would have been decided differently, or proof of such a \n     magnitude of fraud, irregularities, or other errors that the \n     true result of the election are unknown.\n       While there were some irregularities in this election, and \n     isolated incidences of fraud, there is insufficient evidence \n     in the aggregate, at this time, to indicate further \n     investigation would result in the degree of evidence \n     necessary to overcome petitioner's burden.\n       Our investigation to date has revealed a failure of \n     safeguards and discrepancies in records. It has revealed \n     possible campaign finance violations, although no indication \n     of such violations on the part of Senator Landrieu. It also \n     has revealed isolated instances of fraudulent or multiple \n     voting and improper or duplicate registration. But it has not \n     revealed an organized, widespread effort to illegally affect \n     the outcome of this election. It has not revealed an \n     organized, widespread effort to buy votes, or to procure \n     multiple votes, or secure fraudulent registrations. It has \n     not revealed such gross irregularities in the election and \n     record keeping process that--by themselves and in the absence \n     of massive fraud--meet the burden, which is always on the \n     plaintiff, to prove that fraud or irregularities affected the \n     outcome of the election. Finally, it has never been alleged, \n     and no evidence has been uncovered, that Senator Landrieu was \n     involved in any fraudulent election activities.\n       I would like to discuss briefly the challenges faced by the \n     Committee in conducting this investigation--and I mean \n     problems beyond the very difficult ones caused by the \n     partisan division on the Committee concerning the conduct of \n     the investigation.\n       The last time the Committee handled an election contest \n     alleging voter fraud was in the Hurley v. Chavez contest in \n     1953-54. In 1954, there were actual paper ballots which could \n     be reviewed, rather than electronic voting machines which \n     print out results you hope are reliable. In 1954, there was \n     no Federal Election Commission and few, if any, prohibitions \n     on how money could be spent on campaigns. In 1954, there was \n     not the communications system which made it easy for \n     candidates, groups, and others to work together, both legally \n     and illegally, by fax, by e-mail, or by cell phone.\n       But in both 1954 and 1997, there were many of the same \n     problems with which this Committee has struggled: the need to \n     balance a voter's right to privacy versus the need for \n     information; the tendency to assume that all elections should \n     be run perfectly even though most of the individuals actually \n     running the precincts are volunteers putting in long hours \n     with limited training; and the difficulty in deciding how and \n     whether to determine if irregularities had an impact on the \n     outcome of the election.\n       All of these have been problems which the Committee has \n     faced and overcome in fulfilling its constitutional duty as \n     ``the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of \n     its own Members...''\n       From the inception of this case, I have viewed the \n     obligation of this Committee to be to fairly and objectively \n     judge all the facts, with the Senate as our client. I submit \n     to this Committee and the Senate a record which I believe is \n     a credible discharge of the Committee's duty to the Senate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Committee on Rules and Administration--Committee Motion, October 1, \n                                  1997\n\n       1. Whereas Louis ``Woody'' Jenkins filed a Petition for \n     Election Contest with the United States Senate on December 5, \n     1996 and an Amended Petition for Election Contest on December \n     17, 1996, and Senator Mary Landrieu filed a Request for \n     Summary Dismissal on January 17, 1997; and Petitioner Jenkins \n     filed Petitioner's Answer to Request for Summary Dismissal on \n     February 7, 1997;\n       2. Whereas the Committee on April 17, 1997 authorized ``the \n     Chairman, in consultation with the ranking minority member, \n     to direct and conduct an Investigation of such scope as \n     deemed necessary by the Chairman, into illegal or improper \n     activities to determine the existence or absence of a body of \n     fact that would justify the Senate in making the \n     determination that fraud, irregularities or other errors, in \n     the aggregate, affected the outcome of the election for \n     United States Senator in the state of Louisiana in 1996'';\n       3. Whereas the Committee on July 31, 1997 authorized ``the \n     Chairman to continue the investigation of the 1996 election \n     for United States Senator from Louisiana authorized by the \n     Committee Motion of April 17, 1997'';\n       4. Whereas during the Committee's continued preliminary \n     investigation, the Committee examined a number of areas of \n     potential fraud, irregularities or other errors which had not \n     been reviewed before July 31, including but not limited to \n     the following allegations:\n       (A) use of funds from gambling interests to influence the \n     Senate election;\n       (B) inaccurate and unreliable election records in certain \n     precincts;\n       (C) apparent discrepancies in voters' signatures;\n       (D) duplicate voter registrations;\n       (E) illegal transportation of voters to the polls;\n       (F) improper and unreported campaign expenditures;\n       (G) voters registered at vacant public housing; and\n       (H) voters failing to submit required address confirmation \n     forms;\n       5. Whereas the preliminary investigation has uncovered \n     evidence that many of the statutory and regulatory safeguards \n     meant to protect the integrity of the registration, voting, \n     and campaign finance processes were violated, ignored, or \n     enforced unevenly by election officials and others;\n       6. Whereas the Chairman has throughout this preliminary \n     investigation conferred with the Governor of Louisiana and \n     the District Attorney for East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and \n     both of these officials have written regarding their concerns \n     about the election procedures, the violations of many \n     election safeguards, and the absence of records corroborating \n     the election results;\n       7. Whereas the Governor of Louisiana wrote to Chairman \n     Warner on September 29, 1997, and concluded that:\n       ``These issues are not about party affiliation. They are \n     not about individual candidates or specific elections, even \n     though this election in question clearly has illustrated some \n     of the problems. The issue is the integrity and sanctity of \n     our election process and its results. I share wholeheartedly \n     with you your basic premise that our foremost duty is to \n     ensure that our elections are conducted fairly and in \n     accordance with law.\n       ``I particularly share your frustration that our system of \n     record keeping precludes adequate standards of accountability \n     and that our lax enforcement substantially lowers public \n     confidence in our elections. Witness to this is the fact that \n     we recently learned that we have thousands of felons still on \n     the voter rolls.\n       ``Regardless of the future course of your investigation \n     with the Rules Committee, Louisiana has a duty and an \n     obligation to fashion a remedy for the many ills which have \n     so amply been illustrated throughout these past months.\n       ``Therefore, I will call for a bipartisan state legislative \n     initiative with hearings focusing on every element of our \n     registration and election process, involving Democrats and \n     Republicans, and all appropriate state and local registrars, \n     elections officials, and enforcement authorities.''\n       8. Whereas the District Attorney for East Baton Rouge wrote \n     to the Governor of Louisiana on September 2, 1997, and \n     concluded that:\n       ``We are currently conducting an investigation into \n     election and voter registration irregularities. During the \n     investigation, we have come across many concerns, including a \n     number which I feel should be brought to your attention. That \n     is because it appears that many of the Louisiana laws which \n     were designed to assure the integrity of voter registration \n     records and voting procedures may not be achieving the goals \n     intended by the Legislature when enacted. The immediacy of \n     the situation is that if the current procedures are not \n     addressed, then the simple passage of time will result in the \n     inability to insure that our laws provide either registration \n     or election result integrity.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``These various practices, among others, create the \n     opportunity for fraud in registration and voting and make it, \n     for all practical purposes, impossible to discover, after the \n     fact, if it occurred.''\n       9. Whereas the breakdowns in Louisiana's electoral system \n     indicate significant institutional problems which create the \n     opportunity for fraud and irregularities to affect the \n     outcome of Louisiana's elections; and\n       10. Whereas, notwithstanding the breakdowns in Louisiana's \n     electoral safeguards, the Committee has not found a \n     cumulative body of evidence of fraud, irregularities, or \n     other errors--after review of a significant number of \n     potential areas of fraud, irregularities, or other errors--to \n     meet the petitioner's burden, as determined by Senate \n     precedent, which burden is: to show not only proof of fraud \n     or irregularities, but also that, upon completion of a full \n     investigation, such fraud or irregularities, in the \n     aggregate, did affect the result of the election or clearly \n     make the true result of the election unknown.\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\n       Now, therefore, the committee hereby states that it finds \n     that the evidence collected to date does not meet the \n     applicable burden to justify further consideration of the \n     amended petition by the Committee, or by the Senate, and the \n     Committee terminates its investigation of the 1996 election \n     for U.S. Senator from Louisiana and directs the Chairman to \n     so inform the Senate;\n       The committee further hereby directs the Chairman to \n     prepare a committee report, with minority or supplemental \n     views as appropriate, which details the actions taken by the \n     Committee, the legal standards applicable to the petition, \n     and the evidence developed during the preliminary \n     investigation;\n       The committee further hereby directs the Chairman to \n     determine whether the evidence obtained during the \n     preliminary investigation indicates that evidence of \n     violations of federal or state election, campaign finance, or \n     other laws or regulations should be referred to the Governor \n     of Louisiana, the Department of Justice, the Federal Election \n     Commission, law enforcement authorities in Louisiana, or \n     other investigative authorities, and to report such \n     determinations to the Committee for further action by the \n     Committee and the Senate, according to Senate Rules; and\n       The committee further hereby authorizes the Chairman to \n     maintain appropriate copies of relevant records for the \n     official Committee files and to return or otherwise forward \n     to the appropriate parties, as determined by the Chairman, \n     all original documents submitted to the Committee in response \n     to subpoenas issued in furtherance of the Committee's \n     investigation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Nineteenth Judicial District, East Baton Rouge Parks, \n           Office of the District Attorney,\n                               Baton Rouge, LA, September 2, 1997.\n     Re: Voter registrations and elections.\n\n     Hon. Murphy J. ``Mike'' Foster,\n     Governor, State of Louisiana,\n     Baton Rouge, LA.\n       Dear Governor Foster: We are currently conducting an \n     investigation into election and voter registration \n     irregularities. During the investigation, we have come across \n     many concerns, including a number which I feel should be \n     brought to your attention. That is because it appears that \n     many of the Louisiana laws which were designed to assure the \n     integrity of voter registration records and voting procedures \n     may not be achieving the goals intended by the Legislature \n     when enacted. The immediacy of the situation is that if the \n     current procedures are not addressed, then the simple passage \n     of time will result in the inability to insure that our laws \n     provide either registration or election result integrity.\n       Though there are too many to be detailed in a letter, I \n     will attempt to highlight some of the problems which we have \n     found.\n       I would like to mention at the outset that the purpose of \n     this letter is to point a finger at problems, not at people, \n     so that they may be identified, discussed, understood, and \n     solved. Blame assessment, if it occurs, will come at its time \n     and in its forum.\n       Our investigation began with a focus on the Election Code, \n     LRS 18:1 et seq, which was enacted to ``. . . regulate the \n     conduct of elections . . .'' It governs all aspects of \n     elections, including officials, voters, registration, voting \n     procedures, results, reporting, and even campaign finance.\n       Recent discoveries have prompted me to write this letter. \n     The first is the finding of duplicate, inaccurate and/or \n     incomplete information in the voter registration computer \n     database. As of approximately one month ago, that database \n     admittedly contained thousands of instance of duplication of \n     social security numbers as well as over 200,000 registered \n     voters who were shown as having no social security number. \n     From our continuing review, this number is much higher today \n     than it was then.\n       There are also a number of persons who are shown on the \n     State Voter Registration Computer System to be registered in \n     the same or in different parishes with the same social \n     security number. Investigation has shown that in some cases, \n     the registration seems to be of the same person who has \n     moved, and in some cases, the registration seems to be of a \n     completely different person. Regardless of which of these \n     scenarios is true for any particular record, to maintain the \n     status quo is to invite fraud.\n       These problems fly in the face of the enactments of the \n     Legislature contained in Louisiana Revised Statute 18:104 and \n     101 which requires that citizens who register to vote provide \n     certain unique information to the Registrar of Voters in \n     order to be properly identified and registered, and that \n     there be no citizen registered in more than one place. Among \n     the statutory requirements is the applicant's social security \n     number. Despite this statutory mandate, the Commissioner of \n     Elections office recently sent a directive to all registrars \n     instructing that the obtaining of a social security number \n     would no longer be required from a voter applicant. The \n     directive was presumably based on a judicial decision \n     rendered in a lawsuit filed by an individual against a \n     Registrar and the Commissioner of Elections. The State of \n     Louisiana was not made a party to the suit. Pursuant to the \n     requirements of LRS 18:64, the Registrar of Voters was \n     represented by an Assistant Attorney General. However, the \n     State as an entity was neither made a party nor represented. \n     Based upon that ruling the Commissioner's office is advising \n     registrars around the state that they are no longer required \n     to follow the mandate of LRS 18:104.\n       Permitting a discussing of the legal issues involved, if \n     the necessary identifying information is not required when a \n     voter is registered, then it is a matter of which you should \n     be aware.\n       The second recent discovery occurred in attempting to match \n     voter signatures from ``Motor Voter'' applications to \n     signatures on the precinct registers which are signed on \n     election day. Though no handwriting analysis has been done, \n     there are a number of obvious discrepancies apparent in many \n     of the records. This, of course, has been one of the concerns \n     raised by the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), and \n     appears to have caused a problem in our election records.\n       Further complicating all of these matters is the lack of \n     administrative rules, which has resulted in inconsistencies \n     among the various offices of the local registrars, not the \n     uniformity envisioned in the law.\n       These various practices, among others, create the \n     opportunity for fraud in registration and voting and make it, \n     for all practical purposes, impossible to discover, after the \n     fact, if it occurred.\n       There are many other problems we have found which cause a \n     great deal of concern, but they will not be detailed here. \n     The purpose of this letter, instead, is to inform you of the \n     existence of some of these problems in our system of \n     registration and elections so that you can take whatever \n     action you think is necessary to correct the problems. I \n     stand ready to assist you in identifying the depth of, and \n     solutions to, these problems.\n       If there are any questions, please feel free to contact me.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                      Doug Moreau,\n     District Attorney.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               State of Louisiana,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                   Baton Rouge, September 3, 1997.\n     Hon. Doug Moreau,\n     District Attorney, 19th Judicial District,\n     Baton Rouge, LA.\n       Dear Mr. Moreau: Thank you for your letter of September 2, \n     1997, about your concern for the integrity of the election \n     process in Louisiana. Your remarks have caused me grave \n     concern as to whether our election laws require extensive \n     legislative review in order to ensure that election results \n     in Louisiana are reliable, and so that the public may have \n     confidence in our election process. The first duty of \n     government is to protect the democratic election process \n     against all risks of fraudulent practices, so that those who \n     are chosen in the election process are indeed the true \n     choices.\n       I am so very concerned about the questions which you have \n     raised that I will forward a copy of your correspondence to \n     Senator Randy Ewing, President of the Senate, and \n     Representative Hunt Downer, Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, recommending that these questions, as to \n     election process integrity, be reviewed by a joint committee \n     of the legislature, with assistance of appropriate legal \n     counsel and the power of subpoena. With such legislative \n     oversight we will be able to ensure that the election results \n     based on the election laws of Louisiana are above any \n     suspicion as to their reliability.\n       I thank you most sincerely for calling these matters to my \n     attention.\n           Sincerely,\n     M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                     Rules and Administration,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1997.\n     Hon. J.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr.,\n     Governor of Louisiana,\n     Baton Rouge, LA.\n       Dear Governor Foster: This letter follows up our telephone \n     conversation earlier today and the important personal meeting \n     we had several weeks ago at the Southern Governors \n     Conference. The Committee on Rules, which I chair, will meet \n     next Wednesday to receive my report on the status of the \n     Committee's preliminary investigation on behalf of the \n     Senate, into allegations that fraud and irregularities \n     affected the outcome of the November 5, 1996 election for \n     U.S. Senate in your state.\n       My report will contain references to Louisiana's election \n     laws, the presence or absence of adequate regulations, and \n     the need for a proven level of enforcement of such laws and \n     regulations. You have expressed to me your concerns related \n     to Louisiana's election process and have told me that you \n     plan to make your own evaluation of this system, in \n     conjunction with members of your state legislature.\n       I particularly commend Doug Moreau, District Attorney for \n     East Baton Rouge whom I have consulted on several occasions. \n     He is continuing to perform investigation into areas which \n     overlap with our own efforts.\n       One area in particular that Mr. Moreau is pursuing is a \n     complete review of the state's voter registration computer \n     database, which we have both discovered contains a \n     significant number of voters with the same social security \n     number or with no social security number at all. We were \n     unable to obtain the complete database because the \n     Commissioner of Elections would not voluntarily comply with a \n     subpoena, as confirmed by the fact that Mr. Moreau is now in \n     court seeking to enforce his subpoena.\n       At such time as the ongoing Senate preliminary \n     investigation ceases--and I will know more details after my \n     full Senate Committee meets next Wednesday--I want to\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\n     offer, in compliance with Senate Rules, the opportunity for \n     Rules Committee staff to brief the appropriate forum you \n     establish for your legislative review.\n       My experience in this case leads me to recommend that--in \n     light of the number of instances where the electoral \n     safeguards, including record keeping, were not followed in \n     the November 1996 elections, from the precinct level right up \n     to the office of the Commissioner of Elections--your review \n     should include an examination of what legislative or \n     regulatory changes and enhanced adherence to present laws are \n     needed to ensure that an official body, be it a body of the \n     U.S. Congress, a court of law, or an appropriate governmental \n     authority in your state, can more readily reach a credible \n     and well documented decision about a statewide election \n     contest.\n       Our foremost duty is to ensure our elections are conducted \n     fairly and in accordance with law. We remain willing to \n     provide you our observations and suggestions, within Senate \n     rules, to assist you in your efforts to protect our electoral \n     process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               State of Louisiana,\n\n\n                                         Executive Department,\n\n                              Baton Rouge, LA, September 29, 1997.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am in receipt of your letter of \n     September 26 in which you informed me of your Rules Committee \n     report to be delivered Wednesday and detailed some of your \n     observations and wisdom gained through years of oversight.\n       So much of your thought process and concerns directly \n     parallel my own. The allegations of fraud and irregularities \n     which may have affected the outcome of the November 1996 U.S. \n     Senate election are serious and disturbing. But, of even \n     greater long term consequence are the suspicions that you and \n     I apparently both share that there are chronic, systemic, and \n     structural problems in the Louisiana election process.\n       These issues are not about party affiliation. They are not \n     about individual candidates or specific elections, even \n     though this election in question clearly has illustrated some \n     of the problems. The issue is the integrity and sanctity of \n     our election process and its results. I share wholeheartedly \n     with you your basic premise that our foremost duty is to \n     ensure that our elections are conducted fairly and in \n     accordance with the law.\n       I particularly share your frustration that our system of \n     record keeping precludes adequate standards of accountability \n     and that our lax enforcement substantially lowers public \n     confidence in our elections. Witness to this is the fact that \n     we recently learned that we have thousands of felons still on \n     the voter rolls.\n       Regardless of the future course of your investigation with \n     the Rules Committee, Louisiana has a duty and an obligation \n     to fashion a remedy for the many ills which have so amply \n     been illustrated throughout these past months.\n       Therefore, I will call for a bipartisan state legislative \n     initiative with hearings focusing on every element of our \n     registration and election process, involving Democrats and \n     Republicans, and all appropriate state and local registrars, \n     elections officials, and enforcement authorities.\n       Nothing in a democracy is more sacred than the integrity of \n     elections. On behalf of the state of Louisiana we offer our \n     deepest appreciation for your efforts in identifying the \n     problem areas in our elections system, and we gratefully \n     accept your offer to have Rules Committee staff provide \n     important information and examples of problems to our state \n     hearings.\n       Again we sincerely appreciate the earnestness of your \n     efforts and hope that your diligence and the ensuing hearings \n     in Louisiana will profoundly impact our elections system for \n     the better.\n       With kinds regards, I am,\n           Sincerely,\n                                        M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr.,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nchairman of the Rules Committee for one of the most difficult tasks \nthat any Member will be called upon to take in the U.S. Senate, and \nthat is to look into the election of another Member of the Senate. It \nimmediately has partisan overtones and can take a very ugly turn.\n  I can say that having sat through many of the hearings, both open and \nclosed hearings, having sat with the chairman and seeing the efforts of \nthis case and seeing the level of detail to which he took personally \ngetting involved in this investigation and trying to ferret out the \nvalidity of the charges that were alleged, I am very proud of Senator \nWarner's work on this investigation. He did it with the skill of the \ntrained lawyer that he is. He did it in a way, really as the Senate's \ncounsel, if you will, and also did it with, I believe, an extraordinary \nair of bipartisanship when, in fact, the partisan wranglings had boiled \nover far beyond what he actually deserved.\n  He did an excellent job. He did a thorough job. He used the resources \nthat he had to the greatest extent that he possibly could. He took lots \nof arrows, in many cases in the back. But he stood tall and kept his \neye on the ball, and that was to find out what happened in Louisiana, \nwhether these charges that were put forward were, in fact, legitimate. \nHe is determined, as well as the other members of the committee, that \nat this point there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that there \nwas a systematic case of fraud in Louisiana, and so the investigation \nmust come to a conclusion.\n  I support the chairman in that decision. I supported him, as did \nevery other member of the Rules Committee, in the decision that he came \nto after this thorough and thoughtful investigation of the information \nthat was presented to him.\n  I just wanted to take the floor today to commend him for a job well \ndone. No doubt he will be criticized by many for ending this \ninvestigation, but I want to stand with him in saying that I think he \nreached the conclusion that was the only conclusion that could be \nreached at this point.\n  Having said that, obviously, just like with any of us, if information \ncomes out subsequent that is a smoking gun or that is really \nproblematic, then that evidence can be brought before the Rules \nCommittee and we can take a look at it. To this point, that has not \noccurred, and I think the chairman has acted judiciously with respect \nto the evidence before him.\n  I wanted to stand and offer my gratitude for his excellent work and \nstate my support for his effort. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, for his honest, \nstraightforward, and direct investigation and statements in closed \nsession and in public today. I think it is evident from his effort, \nwith the vote of 16 to nothing, bipartisan, that we now cease and \ndesist as it relates to the investigation of the Louisiana election, \nand the distinguished Senator Mary Landrieu be seated as a true Senator \nwithout any cloud over her head whatsoever, so she can get about the \nbusiness of full-time representation of Louisiana.\n  I thank the chairman. I thank the members of the committee. I think \nit is now time that we put this behind us and proceed with the business \nof the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nFlorida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10253-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10257-S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1156, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1156) making appropriations for the Government \n     of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable \n     in whole or in part against the revenues of said District, \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Coats modified amendment No. 1249, to provide scholarship \n     assistance for District of Columbia elementary and secondary \n     school students.\n       Graham-Mack-Kennedy amendment No. 1252, to provide relief \n     to certain aliens who would otherwise be subject to removal \n     from the United States.\n       Mack-Graham-Kennedy modified amendment No. 1253 (to \n     amendment No. 1252) in the nature of a substitute.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1253 to Amendment No. 1252\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Florida is \nthe pending business.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator DeWine \nbe added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this amendment was offered last Thursday. We \nstill have not had one Member come to the floor to speak in opposition \nto it. It has received support from both sides of the aisle and is \nsupported by Senator Abraham, the chairman of the authorizing \nsubcommittee. It has received positive editorial support from a wide \narray of newspapers, including the Washington Times and the New York \nTimes. It has also received the endorsement of Empire America. \nYesterday I introduced into the Record a letter of support from Jeanne \nKirkpatrick, Jack Kemp, William Bennett, Lamar Alexander and Steve \nForbes.\n  This is a narrowly targeted amendment which merely ensures that \nCentral Americans receive the due process which they were originally \npromised. It is focused on an identifiable group of people and ensures \ntheir opportunity to apply for suspension of deportation. It is not a \ngrant of immunity.\n  I have not been able to obtain an up-or-down vote on my amendment, so \nI will be moving to table my own amendment. I will oppose the motion to \ntable, and ask for the support of my colleagues in opposing the motion \nto table.\n  So, Mr. President, I therefore move to table amendment No. 1253.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this vote be \ndelayed until 12:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased that after almost a week we \nare on the verge of having an expression of the Senate on this \nimportant issue. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer also be \nadded as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that a statement by the \nPresident, which was released on July 25 of this year, at the time the \nadministration supported the principles of the Immigration Reform \nTransition Act of 1997, also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                                    July 25, 1997.\n\n                         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\n     To the Congress of the United States:\n       I am pleased to submit for your immediate consideration and \n     enactment the ``Immigration Reform Transition Act of 1997,'' \n     which is accompanied by a section-by-section analysis. This \n     legislative proposal is designed to ensure that the complete \n     transition to the new ``cancellation of removal'' (formerly \n     ``suspension of deportation'') provisions of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (IIRIRA; Public Law 104-208) can be accomplished in a fair \n     and equitable manner consistent with our law enforcement \n     needs and foreign policy interests.\n       This legislative proposal would aid the transition to \n     IIRIRA's new cancellation of removal rules and prevent the \n     unfairness of applying those rules to cases pending before \n     April 1, 1997, the effective date of the new rules. It would \n     also recognize the special circumstances of certain Central \n     Americans who entered the United States in the 1980s in \n     response to civil war and political persecution. The \n     Nicaraguan Review Program, under successive Administrations \n     from 1985 to 1995, protected roughly 40,000 Nicaraguans from \n     deportation while their cases were under review. During this \n     time the American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) \n     litigation resulted in a 1990 court settlement, which \n     protected roughly 190,000 Salvadorans and 50,000 Guatemalans. \n     Other Central Americans have been unable to obtain a decision \n     on their asylum applications for many years. Absent this \n     legislative proposal, many of these individuals would be \n     denied protection from deportation under IIRIRA's new \n     cancellation of removal rules. Such a result would unduly \n     harm stable families and communities here in the United \n     States and undermine our strong interests in facilitating the \n     development of peace and democracy in Central America.\n       This legislative proposal would delay the effect of \n     IIRIRA's new provisions so that immigration cases pending \n     before April 1, 1997, will continue to be considered and \n     decided under the old suspension of deportation rules as they \n     existed prior to that date. IIRIRA's new cancellation of \n     removal rules would generally apply to cases commenced on or \n     after April 1, 1997. This proposal dictates no particular \n     outcome of any case. Every application for suspension of \n     deportation or cancellation of removal must still be \n     considered on a case-by-case basis. The proposal simply \n     restores a fair opportunity to those whose cases have long \n     been in the system or have other demonstrable equities.\n       In addition to continuing to apply the old standards to old \n     cases, this legislative proposal would exempt such cases from \n     IIRIRA's annual cap of 4,000 cancellations of removal. It \n     would also exempt from the cap cases of battered spouses and \n     children who otherwise receive such cancellation.\n       The proposal also guarantees that the cancellation of \n     removal proceedings of certain individuals covered by the \n     1990 ABC litigation settlement and certain other Central \n     Americans with long-pending asylum claims will be governed by \n     the pre-IIRIRA substantive standard of 7 years continuous \n     physical presence and extreme hardship. It would further \n     exempt those same individuals from IIRIRA's cap. Finally, \n     individuals affected by the legislation whose time has lapsed \n     for reopening their cases following a removal order would be \n     granted 180 days in which to do so.\n       My Administration is committed to working with the Congress \n     to enact this legislation. If, however, we are unsuccessful \n     in this goal, I am prepared to examine any available \n     administrative options for granting relief to this class of \n     immigrants. These options could include a grant of Deferred \n     Enforced Departure for certain classes of individuals who \n     would qualify for relief from deportation under this \n     legislative proposal. Prompt legislative action on my \n     proposal would ensure a smooth transition to the full \n     implementation of IIRIRA and prevent harsh and avoidable \n     results.\n       I urge the Congress to give this legislative proposal \n     prompt and favorable consideration.\n\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n       The White House, July 24, 1997.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is an extremely important and urgent \nbill, because the continuation of the 1996 law, with what I will \ndescribe as its inadvertent retroactive application to this class of \npeople, is causing great distress and unnecessary instability in \ncommunities that are principally affected. As those who participated in \nthe press conference earlier today underscored, this is a group of \npeople who came here largely at our request. They came here because \ncommunism had taken over their country. They came here because the \nSoviet Union was establishing a satellite state in our own hemisphere. \nThey came here in order to participate in those ultimately successful \nefforts to establish a democratic government in Nicaragua.\n  Now for us to change the rules from those that were in place at the \ntime we extended that invitation, to have the practical effect of \ndenying these people even the opportunity to be heard on their request \nfor a permanent residence in the United States, is outrageous and \ninconsistent with basic American principles.\n  I underscore what Senator Mack and I have said throughout this \ndebate. This is not an amnesty provision. By the passage of this \nlegislation, no one automatically has their status in the United States \naltered. What they do have is the right to use the rules that were in \neffect when they came to this country to apply for permanent legal \nstatus in the United States. I think that is just fair and consistent \nwith the relationships that we want to establish with, particularly, \nour neighbors in this hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, I applaud my colleague for having asked for this \ntabling motion which, obviously, is not a motion in which he is going \nto urge success, but it is our means of getting an expression of \nopinion by the U.S. Senate on this fundamental issue. I urge defeat of \nthe motion to table and then a quick adoption of this amendment. Thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Mack \namendment. I, of course, therefore will oppose the motion to table. \nThis amendment will ensure that fundamental principles of fairness are \nrespected in regard to the cases of some 316,000 immigrants, some of \nthem from Central America.\n  In the immigration bill Congress passed last year, we changed the \ncriteria for suspension of deportation. Certain retroactive changes in \nthat bill, at least as they have been interpreted by the INS, had the \nunintended\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\neffect of applying these new criteria to applications of suspension for \ndeportation which were already in the pipeline when the bill was \npassed.\n  The Mack amendment will ensure that those immigrants whose cases were \nin the pipeline when the 1996 immigration law took effect will have \ntheir cases decided according to the criteria in effect at the time \nthat the law actually passed. It is only fair that we should not change \nthe rules in midstream for these worried immigrants.\n\n  Let me take us back to the 1980's when we granted these 316,000 \nCentral American immigrants temporary protection from deportation. We \nknew at that time the terrible consequences of war--the grinding \npoverty, human rights abuses that had driven these men, women, and, \nyes, children, to our shores.\n  At that time, we told these immigrants that their protection from \ndeportation would be permanent if certain conditions were met--that is \nwhat we told them then--7 years of continuous residency, good behavior, \nproof of extreme hardship awaiting them in their native country. We \nbasically said, ``As long as you can prove that, then this will be \npermanent.''\n  When Congress changed the law in 1996, we clearly did not intend to \nchange the rules for these people who already, at that time, were in \nthe pipeline. We, in essence, had made a commitment to them. We, in \nessence, had made a deal with them, and I don't believe we should go \nback on that deal today.\n  Mr. President, the Mack amendment would keep faith with these \nindividuals. It is not, as my colleagues from Florida have already \npointed out, an automatic grant of amnesty, nor is it an automatic \ngrant of permanent residency. Far from it. It is merely a restoration \nof the original conditions these immigrants have to fulfill if we are \ngoing to allow them to remain in this country.\n  I had the opportunity this morning to participate in a press \nconference concerning this issue. I also had the opportunity a few \nmonths ago to travel to Nicaragua. I had made several visits to \nNicaragua in the 1980's, about a decade ago. For me to go back to \nNicaragua a few months ago was a very pleasant experience, and it was \npleasant because I had seen where Nicaragua was. I had the opportunity \na few months ago to see where Nicaragua is today. Yes, it is still the \nsecond-poorest country in this hemisphere and, yes, there is high \nunemployment and, yes, there are many, many problems. But what we see \nin Nicaragua today is a fledgling democracy. We see a country that is \nbecoming what we envisioned and had hoped for and worked for in the \n1980's, and that is a democracy.\n  Today, for the first time in history, all five Central American \ncountries are democratic; all five are working to bring about the \nreforms that truly are an example of democracy.\n  When I traveled to Nicaragua, I had the opportunity to speak with \nthen President-elect, now President Aleman and talked to him about his \nvision for his country.\n  One of the unintended consequences of the bill we passed in 1996, and \none of the unintended consequences of the deportation of these 316,000 \nimmigrants would be that we would strike a hard blow against democracy \nin Nicaragua and El Salvador and the other Central American countries. \nAnyone who has looked at these countries today understands what an \neconomic impact and political impact it would have if all these \ncitizens, all of these individuals were instantly returned to their \nnative countries.\n  The ability to absorb these individuals simply does not exist. It \ndoes not exist from an economic point of view. Further, this would take \naway a major source, frankly, of income to these countries, a major \nsource of help to the economy, not United States foreign aid, but \nrather the remittances that are sent back by Nicaraguans who are living \nin the United States. Those remittances are a major contribution to the \nNicaraguan economy today. To take that away, I think, would have a very \nsevere and devastating blow to the economy of Nicaragua and the economy \nof the other Central American countries.\n  That is not the principal reason to support the Mack amendment, but \nit is a fact, and it is a fact of life.\n  The central reason to support the Mack amendment is what has been \nstated on this floor by Senator Mack on several occasions, as well as \nSenator Graham, and that simply is this is a matter of equity, it is a \nmatter of fairness, it is a matter of keeping our word, and it is a \nmatter of doing what is right.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Mack amendment and, therefore, \nvote against the motion to table the Mack amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 1249\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we had, I think, a very constructive debate \non the school choice issue, scholarships for D.C. children. \nUnfortunately, while having obtained a majority vote in support of at \nleast a test of a program to provide some educational opportunities to \nD.C. children, we were not able to break a procedural vote of 60 \nnecessary to move forward with this legislation. That limited our \noptions considerably. While Senator Lieberman and I were pleased with \nthe fact that we received more votes than we ever have on this issue, \nwe were still two short of the necessary number to break the promised \nfilibuster on this, and that limits our options.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that is not going away. I have always \nsaid this is not something that will be legislated from the top down in \nCongress but will be a grassroots movement from parents and PTA's and \nadministrators and educators and others throughout America who are \ndemanding better education for their children. Unfortunately, in many \ninstances, they are not finding it in some of their public schools.\n  This is not a condemnation of the public school system. There are \nmany fine public schools across this country. There are dedicated \nteachers, dedicated administrators, schools that are providing \nopportunities for their young people.\n  I am a product of the public schools, as is my wife. Our children are \nproducts of public schools, and we have found schools that have \nprovided a sound education for our children.\n  Unfortunately, there are people in this country who don't have the \noptions that we have had, who don't have the options that those of \nmeans have in terms of where they live, the school systems they choose \nto support, to be a part of and options that, should they find \nthemselves in the situation where they are living that their public \nschools are not providing the education their children need or a school \nthat has such a high incidence of violence and crime and other problems \nthat they don't feel their children are safe there, they don't have the \noption that many of us have of transferring their student to a private \nschool or another school outside the system or moving to an area where \nthey can receive the kind of education they want their children to \nreceive.\n  There is a very interesting story this morning in the Washington \nPost: ``Popularity Grows for Alternatives to Public School. Some \nDistricts Reacting to Threat of Competition.''\n  The whole point we were trying to make yesterday is that we are not \ntrying to undo the public school system. We are trying to provide \noptions and alternatives for parents who are trapped in those public \nschools. But, by the same token, we hope that the competitive pressure \nwill shake them out of their lethargy and cause them to bring about the \nchanges and reforms necessary to make them viable once again.\n  In quoting from the Post, an article by Rene Sanchez, it says:\n\n       In a movement flustering schools across the nation, more \n     parents than ever are choosing alternatives to public \n     education for their children, so much that what once seemed \n     only a fad to many educators is instead starting to resemble \n     a revolution.\n       Charter schools are expanding at breakneck pace. Religious \n     schools are overflowing with new students. Home schooling is \n     attracting unprecedented numbers of parents who only a few \n     years ago would never have dreamed of teaching their own \n     children.\n       Those migrating from public education say the roots of \n     their disenchantment vary. Some parents are frustrated with \n     bureaucracy, others fear student violence. Some want their \n     children to spend more time learning values, others call the \n     one-size-fits-all model of most large public schools an \n     ineffective and impersonal way to learn.\n     \n                                *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\n\n       But today those trends have begun to send a powerful \n     message to public schools, even prompting some of them to \n     acknowledge a threat of competition for the first time.\n\n  Our system is built on competition. We pride ourselves in America as \nproducing the best product at the best price because of competitive \npressures that force us to do better, that force us to make better \nproducts at lower cost, that force us to respond to someone else who is \nattempting to accomplish the same goal and might have found a better \nway to do it. It is that that has made this such a dynamic economy, one \nthat employs so many people gainfully, and one that provides such a \nquality of living for so many Americans. That is the American way.\n  That system works everywhere except where there is a public monopoly, \na State-run government public monopoly. That public monopoly has \nexisted in public schools for far too long in far too many places. \nThere are vigorous private school and parochial school options \navailable in many parts of this country, but they are, sadly, lacking \nin some of the areas where they are needed the most.\n  But more than that, the problem is not lack of alternatives. The \nproblem has been a system which leaves the lowest income and frequently \nthe minority students of this country living in our urban areas with \nonly one choice. And that choice, unfortunately, has been a failed \npublic school. They have been denied opportunities to gain skills to \nenter the workplace. They have been denied opportunities to receive an \neducation that qualifies them to go on to college or university \neducation. They, therefore, are trapped, trapped in a system, a system \nwhich says, ``We will do anything we can to maintain the status quo, \nand yet at the same time we will prevent you from an alternative by \nblocking any attempts to provide scholarships or vouchers or stipends \nor support to assist you in paying the tuition if you choose to move \nfrom a public school.''\n  We had that debate yesterday. It was a very instructive debate. I \nthank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. It is \nbipartisan obviously, Democrat and Republican, one from Connecticut, \none from Indiana, joining forces. I appreciate the support we had from \na few of our Democratic colleagues across the aisle. Unfortunately, we \ndid not get enough to move on with this.\n  But there is a revolution going on in public education. It is a \nhealthy one. It is a healthy one because parents are suddenly rising up \nand saying: We will not accept the platitudes and the promises that \ncome from the public school system when now 15 years after the report \n``A Nation At Risk'', 15 years later, essentially, we see no dramatic \nchanges or no effective changes in many of our public schools. We will \nnot accept any longer the promises of a system which cannot overcome \nits inertia and its bureaucracy, which cannot direct a majority of its \nfunds to educating students but yet eats up a majority of those funds \nor a very substantial portion of those funds in administrative costs.\n  So this issue will be back. It will be back over and over again, and \nit will arise not because two Senators chose to offer an amendment to \nthe D.C. appropriations bill; it will arise because constituents of \nMembers throughout the country will demand in town meetings and in \nletters and in calls to their Congressmen and Senators, will demand \nopportunities and alternatives. No longer will inner-city poor parents, \nwelfare parents and others living at or near the poverty line, allow \ntheir children to be condemned to a lifetime of inability to succeed \nbecause of the failure of the public school system to provide their \nchildren with an education.\n\n  They will demand that their Congressmen and their Senators provide \nopportunities, that their councilmen and their mayors and their school \nsystems either provide a sound education for their children or give \nthem the opportunity to seek that elsewhere. What parent would not do \nthat? What parent in this Senate body would not do that? We all would \nbecause we have that choice. Minority children in many cases do not \nhave that choice.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say just one more thing before I yield \nthe floor. There was another quote in the Washington Post this morning \nin an article covering this particular issue. That quote was a \ndisturbing one. There are boundaries to public discourse. There are \nboundaries that we all try to live by, boundaries of civility and \nhonesty and good taste. When those limits are violated, it undermines \nthis institution and it makes democracy more difficult.\n  I think deep disagreements are possible without bitterness. I have \ndone my best to conduct my debates, including this school choice \ndebate, in that spirit. But today in the Washington Post a quote was \nattributed to the Senator from Massachusetts. The Post has misquoted me \nin the past, and I sincerely hope that they have misquoted the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. That quote reads:\n\n       Kennedy reminded Republicans that ``D.C. is not a test tube \n     for misguided Republican ideological experiments on \n     education. . ..Republicans in Congress should stop acting \n     like plantation masters and start treating the people of D.C. \n     with the respect they deserve.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is not just a racially offensive, irresponsible \ncharge; it is the total inversion of reality. It is the opponents of \nschool choice who want to require, compel, force minority children to \nremain in substandard schools. It is the opponents of school choice who \nwant to confine poor minority children within the four walls of failed \ninstitutions, and sometimes just the four walls because the roofs are \nin disrepair.\n  Despite the infusion of hundreds of millions of dollars into this \nsystem, much of it is wasted irresponsibly in not providing either \nbuildings or education to the children of the District of Columbia.\n  If there is a plantation here, it is a paternalistic plantation of \nthose who somehow justify restricting the choices and options of poor \nchildren as a defense of their civil rights. As Alveda King said in \nroom 207 just off the Senate floor here a week ago: One of the greatest \ncivil rights issues for minority people today and for African-Americans \nis those who deny young black children the opportunity to receive an \neducation. That condemns them, because of their income, because of \nwhere they live geographically, to a failed public school that fails to \neducate their children and condemns them to a lifetime of failure.\n  Let me suggest how we can respect the people of the District. We can \nrespect them to make good choices in the interests of their children. \nWe can respect them enough to give them options other than coercive \nassignment to failed and dangerous schools. We can respect them with \nresources, not with more lip service, platitudes, or promises. We can \nrespect the right of a parent, the knowledge of a parent, the caring of \na parent to make wise decisions for their children without the \npaternalistic attitude that only Congress or only bureaucrats, only the \nState, or only Government knows what is best for our children. This \ncharge that supporters of school choice are plantation masters is \ndeceptive and it is racist and it is hypocritical.\n\n  It is time for all of us, liberals and conservatives, to search our \nconscience. There are Members of this body who voted against \nscholarships for African-American children whose families have not \ndarkened the door of public schools for generations. There are Members \nof the administration and this body, hours after those scholarships \nwere defeated, who attended back-to-school night at Sidwell Friends, a \nschool safe from leaking roofs and commonplace violence and failed \neducation that prevails in so much of the District's public schools.\n  Does not anyone see the irony, does not anyone see the hypocrisy, \ndoes not anyone see the injustice in all of this?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the \nDistrict of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee for including the \nBrownback-Lieberman-Coats D.C. charter school amendment in the \nmanager's amendment. I am also pleased that our amendment has \nbipartisan support. These charter school provisions are critical to \nensure the success of charter schools in the District. Here in the \nNation's Capital, unfortunately, the progress of creating charter \nschools has been slow. Legislation to create charter schools in the \nDistrict was enacted in the last Congress but the District currently \nonly has two charter schools.\n  I, along with the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, \nSenator Lieberman, had the opportunity to visit one of these charter \nschools. The Options Public Charter School, which is just a few blocks \nfrom Capitol Hill, is the perfect example of the innovative approach \ncharter schools bring to public education. It enrolls about 100 of the \nD.C. public schools most at-risk students, grades 5 to 8, and works \nclosely with each student. As a result of this charter school \neducation, the high school graduation rate for the Options Public \nCharter School is 75 percent compared to the approximate 50 percent \ngraduation rate in the D.C. public schools.\n  To make sure the D.C. public charter school system follows the \nsuccess of the Options Public Charter School and continues to grow, I, \nalong with Senator Lieberman and Senator Coats offered an amendment to \nexpand funding for the D.C. public charter schools from $1,235,000 to \n$3,376,000 to ensure that current and future charter schools have \nadequate funding. In fiscal year 1998, the District of Columbia could \nhave as many as 20 new charter schools. The $1.2 million appropriation \nis based on the budget of the two current charter schools. This \namendment would also make sure there is sufficient funding for current \npublic schools which would like to convert to a charter school.\n  Our amendment would also require the D.C. education emergency board \nof trustees to report to Congress on their implementation of policy \nproviding preference to new charter schools for surplus D.C. public \nschool property. It would also establish a revolving fund for D.C. \ncharter schools for funds not spent by May 1, 1997. Under the current \nlegislation, any remaining funds for charter schools must go into the \nD.C. general fund by May 1, 1997. This provision in the amendment would \nsimply make sure that any funds appropriated for the D.C. charter \nschools will only be spent on the D.C. charter schools. In addition, \nthe D.C. education emergency board of trustees would be required to \nreport to Congress on the capital needs of each charter school within \n120 days of enactment and to take all possible steps to provide \nassistance in capital costs for charter schools in the meantime.\n  I am pleased that our amendment is included in the manager's \namendment and has the support of our Democratic colleagues. The charter \nschool application process is underway in the District and new charter \nschools could begin to operate as early as January. Out goal is to make \nthe Nation's Capital a shining city for the world to follow. One of the \nkey elements of achieving this goal is to provide high quality \neducation for the District's children. Charter schools in the District \nwill inject accountability into D.C. public education, more options for \nparents and, most important, high quality education to the District's \nchildren.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1275\n\n   (Purpose: To designate the year 2000 as the Year of the National \n   Bicentennial Celebration for Washington, DC--the Nation's Capital)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concern \nregarding actions last night in Bosnia. NATO forces, of which we \nconstitute the major part, have again seized several Bosnian Serb radio \ntransmitters because they were hostile to the peacekeeping goals of our \nforces.\n  No doubt that was the case. I have no question about that. But I \nsuggest that were we at war and the issue more clear such action would \nbe more than warranted. But we are not, Mr. President. We are trying to \nimplement the Dayton accords, and as such I am concerned this action is \nnot only questionable but may very well be counterproductive.\n  What did the stations do to warrant this action? They said bad things \nabout the SFOR troops and our mission, and they tampered, apparently, \nwith an hour-long program taped by Louise Arbor, head of the \nInternational War Crimes Tribunal.\n  The good news, Mr. President, is that no violence has occurred yet in \nregard to the seizure. But I remind my colleagues that the last time we \ndid this our troops were stoned and we quickly returned the station. \nBut we made the Serbs promise not to interfere with pro-Moslem or pro-\nSFOR messages. Is anyone really surprised, Mr. President, that the \nSerbs did not live up to that promise?\n  First question: Now what? Do we have a plan this time? Do we intend \nto monitor and control all of the media in Bosnia to ensure that only \nmessages that meet our criteria are heard by the people of Bosnia? Is \nthat what the NATO mission has become--one-sided and totally controlled \nby NATO? Will we put NATO media and our intelligence personnel, let's \nbe frank about it, in charge to produce programs that fit our mission? \nAre we shining the light of truth into Serb darkness or are we holding \na censorship flashlight?\n\n  If that is the case, I think you can make a good case that we are \nenforcing the peace and we are aggressively establishing media control, \nthen let's not kid ourselves and continue to call our role even-handed \npeacekeeping.\n  But here is the second question: What will we do if the Serbs react \nviolently to the seizure? General Clark has stated rightly that we will \nuse lethal force to protect our forces. Is this the issue that will \nprecipitate that lethal force? Is this how we would explain loss of \nlife to the parents of an American man or woman in uniform stationed in \nBosnia?\n  Mr. President, we need to hear from the administration on last \nnight's action and they need to outline the plan to get us out of this \ntar baby.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10262-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10262-S10263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ANOTHER TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to a story on the front page of last Thursday's Washington \nPost. This article tells the story of the beating death of a little 4-\nyear-old girl, a little girl by the name of Monica Wheeler in \nWashington, DC. Monica was found dead in the bathroom of a man who was \nan acquaintance of her mother's. The police have ruled her death a \nhomicide. In addition to being severely battered, Monica was suffering \nfrom malnutrition and showed signs of genital bleeding.\n  Now, Mr. President, 3 years ago, one of Monica's siblings, her \nbrother, Andre, then age 2, was also found dead--in the same man's \nbathroom. That earlier death was ruled at that time an accidental \ndrowning, but the police now are reopening that case.\n  Mr. President, it is up to the police and the courts to find out the \ntruth about this particular tragedy. But one thing we know for certain \nis that there are far too many children returned to the care of people \nwho have already abused and battered them, people who should not be \nallowed to take care of children at all. We know this occurs time and \ntime again across this great country of ours.\n  Mr. President, every day in America three children actually die of \nabuse and neglect at the hands of their parents or their caretakers. \nThat is over 1,200 children every year.\n  And almost half of these children are killed after--after--their \ntragic circumstances have already come to the attention of local child \nwelfare agencies.\n  Mr. President, at the end of 1996, over 525,000 children were in \nfoster homes. Over a year's time, it is estimated that over 650,000 \nchildren will spend some time in foster homes. Shockingly, 25 percent \nof the children in the foster care system at any one given point in \ntime will languish in foster care longer than 4 years--25 percent of \nthe kids. Ten percent will be in foster care longer than 7 years.\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\n  This problem has been brewing for many years. It is, at least in \npart, the unintended consequence of a law passed by this Congress in \n1980, a law requiring that reasonable efforts be made to reunify \nfamilies. In practice, this law has resulted in unreasonable efforts, \nunreasonable efforts, Mr. President, being made to reunite families \nthat are really families in name only, families that simply never \nshould be reunited.\n\n  I have been working to change this for almost 3 years now. About 10 \ndays ago, along with Senator Chafee, Senator Craig and Senator \nRockefeller, I introduced a bill that I hope will represent the \nculmination of this effort. The PASS Act--the acronym we have given to \nit stands for the Promotion of Adoption Safety and Support for Abused \nand Neglected Children Act--would make a difference. It would, Mr. \nPresident, save young lives. It would put an end to a tragic policy \nthat has put parents' interests above the health, the safety, and yes, \neven the survival of innocent children.\n  Mr. President, it would help child welfare agencies move faster to \nrescue these children. Every child deserves a better fate than being \nshuttled from foster home to foster home for years on end. That is why, \nMr. President, we are working to pass this important bill.\n  Once this bill is passed, Mr. President, then let's work together on \nthe next step in the continuing battle for our children's right to live \nin safe, stable, permanent and loving homes.\n  Mr. President, the tragedy of this little child who died in \nWashington, DC, a few day ago, this little 4-year-old girl, Monica \nWheeler, should not be repeated. I think we have an obligation in this \nCongress to move as quickly as possible to change a 1980 law that has \ndone a lot of good but that frankly had an unintended consequence. That \nunintended consequence is that children, even after there is evidence \nof abuse, even after there is not just evidence, even after there is \noverwhelming indication of abuse, children are placed back in homes \ntime and time and time again. One of the reasons that occurs is because \nof the 1980 law.\n  We must act, Mr. President, to clarify that law, to clarify the \nreasonable efforts requirement of the law, so that the safety of \nchildren will always be paramount, and that these tragedies will be \neliminated.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks about an \nimportant issue facing our Nation in the information era--the issue of \nlegal protection of data bases. The U.S. Copyright Office recently \nreleased a comprehensive report on the issue of data base protection. I \nwelcome this new information and look forward to both the prompt \nconsideration of the report by Congress and to the introduction of \nmuch-needed legislation that will protect the enormous investments of \ndata base producers, to assure scientists, educators, businesses, and \nother consumers that they will continue to have access to accurate, \nverifiable information.\n  The Copyright Office report provides the requisite legal and \nlegislative analysis that Congress needs in order to act in an \nappropriate and timely manner to respond to the legitimate concerns of \nall parties.\n  It is an important step in the process of addressing recent \ntechnological and legal developments that have left valuable American \ndata bases vulnerable to unauthorized copying and dissemination.\n  The report states that it is expected that all member countries of \nthe European Union will implement the European Union's directive on \ndata bases by January 1, 1998--a fact that underscores the \ninternational implications of this issue for American data base \nproducers. The directive provides a new form of protection for data \nbases to supplement copyright law. The directive extends this new \nprotection only to data base producers located in a European Union \nmember state and will not protect data bases originating in the United \nStates until we adopt our own data base protection legislation.\n  Mr. President, the United States, as the world's leading producer and \nexporter of data bases of all types, needs legal protection abroad far \nmore than any other nation. Unless the United States adopts this \nprotection, the data bases of U.S. companies will be at risk. Smaller \nU.S. firms without global operations will be the most vulnerable. The \nworst-case scenario is that this could potentially force U.S. companies \nto move their operations out of this country and into countries that \noffer data base protection. Such a move poses a serious threat to U.S. \njobs.\n  After studying the report, I believe current U.S. law and precedent \nare insufficient to adequately protect the enormous investment of money \nand effort that typically goes into creating data bases, both print and \nelectronic. This is especially true given the declining copyright \nprotection afforded to data bases after the Supreme Court's 1990 \ndecision in Feist, and the inherent vulnerability of data bases to \npiracy made easy in the new digital environment.\n  America's data base producers employ or represent thousands of \neditors, researchers, and others who gather, verify, update, format, \nand distribute the information contained in their data base products. \nThey also invest billions of dollars in hardware and software to manage \nthese large bodies of information.\n  Mr. President, comprehensive data is indispensable to the successful \noperation of today's American economy, including information about \ncommunications, finance, medicine, law, news, travel, defense, and many \nother topics. As one of America's leading growth industries--one that \ngenerates jobs and supports American families--the information services \nindustry creates a wealth of user-friendly, reliable, and up-to-date \ninformation critical to the lives of American citizens. Congress must \nprovide the legal protection that ensures the future viability of the \ninformation services industry. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10263-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10263-S10264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1253\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have scheduled a \ntabling motion of the Mack amendment, and Senator Mack himself has \nmoved to table the amendment. I thought it would be timely for me to \ncome over and say a little bit about this amendment.\n  Let me make it clear that I intend to vote against tabling the \namendment. I think this amendment should be debated, and I think it is \nimportant to try to outline why. That is the purpose that has brought \nme to the floor today.\n  First of all, we are talking about, in the Mack-Graham-Kennedy \namendment, an amendment that changes the immigration laws of the \ncountry. I remind my colleagues that we are considering the D.C. \nappropriations bill and, therefore, this amendment has nothing to do \nwith the subject matter of that bill.\n  Second, I believe that this is complicated legislation, dealing with \nvery complex, very important, and, quite frankly, very emotional issues \nthat ought to be dealt with by the Immigration Subcommittee, by the \npeople who wrote the law that we just adopted last year, and by people \nwho are experts in this area. I do not believe that an amendment that \nhas the sweeping impact of this amendment should be dealt with as a \nrider to an appropriations bill when, by and large, other than three or \nfour Members of the Senate, nobody has closely examined the pending \namendment.\n  Now, let me outline very briefly what the amendment, in my opinion, \nseeks to do, and let me also say that I am not a member of the \ncommittee that has\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\njurisdiction. My concern about this amendment was generated by the \nchairman of the Immigration Subcommittee in the House, who is my \ncolleague from Texas, who is very concerned about this amendment, and \nwho is very much opposed to it. Basically, what this amendment seeks to \ndo is to change the immigration bill that we wrote just last year. Now, \nour colleague from Florida argues that, well, it doesn't appear that \nmaybe we wanted to do what we did. It is hard for me to judge that and, \nquite frankly, I don't know. But let me outline what the amendment will \ndo and the concerns that I have.\n  First of all, one of the provisions in the immigration bill last year \nwas a provision to try to end the practice of people coming into the \ncountry illegally and then using the system to stay here. I am very \nsensitive to this issue. We had an effort that was undertaken last year \nto cut back on legal immigration. I was a leader in killing that effort \nbecause I want people to have an opportunity to come to America \nlegally. I am not one of these people who believes that America is \nfull. I believe that we have a system for people to come here under \nexisting law--to come to the country legally, to come to work, to build \ntheir dream, and to build the American dream.\n  I am a strong supporter of legal immigration, but I am a strong \nopponent of the illegal immigration of people who come to the country \nillegally and, in doing so, jump in line in front of 7 million people \nwho are waiting to come legally. One of the things we did last year in \nthe immigration bill was set a cap on the number of people who were in \nthe country illegally but who were able to stay here by claiming \nextraordinary hardship if they were returned home. The cap was 4,000 \npeople a year that we would allow to remain in the country under these \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  What the Mack amendment does is waive that cap for a huge number of \npeople, certainly in the range of 300,000, and critics--I can't speak \nfor whether they are right or wrong--who are concerned about it suggest \nperhaps a larger number. I think what this does is produce sort of a \nrolling amnesty. I remind my colleagues that in trying to gain control \nof our ability to have some say about who comes to our country, without \nlimiting legal immigration, we took the extraordinary step of granting \namnesty to people who had violated the law. But part of the deal was \nthat it was a one-time agreement and that we weren't going to continue \nto do it. My concern here is that we are creating a rolling amnesty.\n\n  A second very real problem is that we are talking about people who \ncame to this country, many of them from El Salvador, Guatemala, and \nNicaragua, when there was a war going on. The war in El Salvador was a \nwar where Communist insurgents were trying to overthrow the government \nand deny democracy and capitalism to the people in El Salvador. The war \nin Nicaragua was a war against a Communist dictatorship. What happened \nduring this period is that people came to this country illegally.\n  Now we are hearing the argument that there was a wink and a nod and \nthere was an agreement. But I don't see anywhere in law that that was \nthe case. Now, I can't today make a judgment about whether people who \ncame here from Nicaragua fleeing communism should be granted the \nability to stay. I would have to say that I am more sympathetic to them \nthan I am to people who came here from El Salvador, because they were \nsupporting a Communist insurgency, and now the El Salvadoran Government \nis saying, ``Please keep those people in America, don't let them come \nback to El Salvador.''\n  My point is this. I think we need to look at each one of these cases. \nBut the war in each country from which these people were fleeing is \nover. We were successful in stopping Communist insurgency in El \nSalvador. We won in Nicaragua. Now people who were fleeing a conflict, \nnow that the conflict is over, are saying, ``We don't want to go \nback.'' Well, now, in some circumstances, they should not have to go \nback. But I don't think the Senate is ready today, without the benefit \nof hearings, without the benefit of consideration by the subcommittee \nand full committee, without an extensive debate, to make that \ndetermination. I don't know what we should do in each of these \ncircumstances. If we could narrow the scope, if we could put the focus \non those who came from Nicaragua, if we could find some middle ground, \nI might be willing to do that. But I don't see any effort to find a \nmiddle ground.\n  So this is one of these circumstances where we are trying to change a \nlaw that is just now going into effect--the first real test we have had \nin the new immigration bill--where we set a cap on the number of people \nwho come to the country illegally and we subsequently allow to stay \nhere. The first time we come up with a test based on, obviously, very \nreal human drama--in many cases, strong cases by individual families--\nwe are getting ready to set aside the bill that we so recently adopted \nand grant a rolling amnesty. Apparently, nobody else seems to care, but \nI care. That is why we have the rules of the Senate as we do, so that \none person who cares can be heard, so that there can be a debate.\n  So I intend to vote against tabling. I hope the vote will be 100 to \n0. But it won't change anything. We can vote not to table this \namendment 100 times and it won't change anything, because I don't \nintend to step aside on this issue. Now, we have rules of the Senate. \nThere can be cloture. We can file cloture and we are going to wait the \nseveral days that the Senate rules require it to mature.\n  We can have extensive and thorough debate. This amendment is \namendable. It is amendable with a motion to recommit with instructions. \nIt will be amendable when the second-degree amendment is disposed of. \nIt will be amendable when we vote to name conferees. It will be \namendable when we vote to take up the House bill and insert the Senate \nlanguage. It will be amendable in many different ways. And, until we \nfind a solution, I intend to see that it is amended.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to vote on a motion to table amendment No. 1253 by the Senator \nfrom Florida. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today the Labor Subcommittee of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee held a hearing on a report prepared by \nthe National Cancer Institute regarding the health effects of fallout \nfrom atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950's and 1960's.\n  Today, 35 years after the last atmospheric test, we are just \nbeginning to get a clear picture of the effects of the radioactive \nfallout from these tests.\n  While we should obviously continue to do everything we can to help \nthe victims of these tests, I hope we can also learn something from our \nmistakes in the past.\n  This August, the National Cancer Institute released the results of \nits nationwide study of radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear \ntests conducted at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950's and 1960's.\n  In 1982, Congress directed the Department of Health and Human \nServices to develop methods to estimate radioactive iodine-131 \nexposure, to assess thyroid I-131 doses, and to assess risks for \nthyroid cancer from the exposures.\n  Ninety atmospheric tests were conducted at the test site mainly in \nthe years 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1957.\n  All 48 contiguous States received some degree of exposure to \nradioactive iodine-131 fallout from these atmospheric nuclear bomb \ntests.\n  Everyone in those States was exposed.\n  Let me repeat that--everyone was exposed.\n  People living hundreds of miles to the north and east of the Nevada \nTest Site in Montana, Idaho, Utah, South Dakota, and Colorado were \nexposed.\n  Within these 5 States, 25 counties had particularly high fall-out \nexposure ranging from 12.0 to 9.0 rads.\n  A ``rad'' is a radiation absorbed dose, which is the amount of \nradiation absorbed by the tissues in the body.\n  The tragic conclusion of this study is that children, who lived in \nthese high exposure areas, and who were aged between 3 months and 5 \nyears at the time of the tests were at the greatest risk for iodine-131 \nexposure.\n  Since children's thyroids are so small, their exposure was \ndisproportionately higher than adults.\n  Children who drank contaminated milk--particularly from cows \nmaintained for family use--and which ate pasture vegetation, have an \neven greater exposure.\n  The children in this age group exceeded the average per capita \nthyroid dose by a factor of about 3.7 following the tests because of \ntheir greater milk consumption and their smaller thyroids.\n  After each of the 90 tests, people living in these States were \nexposed to varying levels of iodine-131--for about 2 months following \neach test.\n  This means the air, milk, and other dairy products, eggs and leafy \nvegetables were all contaminated, and that contamination lingered for a \nsignificant period of time after each test.\n  The National Cancer Institute has concluded from the limited data \navailable on people who were exposed, as children, to iodine-131 from \nthe nuclear tests' fallout that this exposure is linked to thyroid \ncancer.\n  NCI estimates between 10,000 to 75,000 people who were exposed as \nchildren may develop fallout-associated thyroid cancer during their \nlifetime.\n  Nearly all were under 15 years of age at the time of exposure, and 75 \npercent were under 5 years of age.\n  NCI is currently working with scientists in Belarus and Ukraine to \nstudy thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986.\n  Thousands of children exposed to the accident's fallout received \nradiation doses to their thyroids.\n  These doses ranged from comparatively small to 10 times higher than \nU.S. residents received from the Nevada tests in the 1950's and 1960's.\n  There was a clear increase in thyroid cancer from the Chernobyl \naccident in this population.\n  The wide range of radioactive fallout exposures to such a large \nnumber of people that resulted in an increase in thyroid cancer will be \nmost helpful in assessing the impact of the Nevada tests on those \nexposed.\n  Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nresearchers are studying the health effects of radioactive iodine \nreleased from the Hanford, WA nuclear weapons plant in the 1940's and \n1950's.\n  The Hanford study results are to be available in 1998.\n  The Institute of Medicine [IOM] is currently also working with the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to review the data from the \nNational Cancer Institute's study to assess the risk to the exposed \nindividuals.\n  The IOM will also develop recommendations for physicians regarding \nhow to treat people who might be at risk of disease because of their I-\n131 exposure.\n  These recommendations should be available within 6 to 9 months.\n  What child growing up in the 1950's and early 1960's was not \nencouraged to drink as much milk as possible to build strong and \nhealthy bodies? In the 1950's and 1960's, health experts advocated each \nyoungster should consume four glasses of milk each day. No one in those \nyears expected young children living hundreds of miles to the north and \neast of the Nevada Test Site drinking their milk were going to face a \npossible increase in thyroid cancer incidence.\n  But that is the consequence being faced by those exposed.\n  In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that some of the \nscientists and engineers associated with atmospheric testing knew, or \nat least suspected, that there were health and safety consequences to \nthe fallout.\n  Some of the Government personnel working on the testing program \nactually sent their families away from the area during and immediately \nafter tests to protect them from the fallout.\n  A story reported yesterday in the New York Times is even worse, the \nAtomic Energy Commission apparently warned the Eastman Kodak Co. and \nother film companies of planned tests, so that the film companies could \ntake steps to protect their film stocks from being damaged.\n  Somehow, the AEC decided it was more important to protect \nphotographic film, than the health and safety of tens of thousands of \ncitizens who were exposed and who, today, we know will suffer thyroid \nand other genetic\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\nproblems as a consequence of that exposure.\n  The last atmospheric test took place 35 years ago, but signs of \natmospheric testing are still present in many areas, including southern \nNevada.\n  Recently, in fact, scientists discovered the presence of radioactive \ncontamination in dust in some attics in Las Vegas.\n  Nevadans have had plenty of experience with the Department of Energy.\n  During the cold war, we were proud to do our patriotic duty, and host \nthe Nevada Test Site, the United States' major continental nuclear \nweapons testing facility.\n  We were all very proud of our participation in what we expected to be \nan exciting new age, we thought we were at the center of a new \ntechnology that would dominate the 21st century.\n  Of course, as these recent studies have shown pretty clearly, we were \nall completely ignorant of the tremendous dangers and costs of the \nnuclear age, and most of the captivating ideas of the 1950's never \ndeveloped. In point of fact, nuclear power is on the decline.\n  Nuclear plants close regularly, due either to serious safety related \nproblems, or dismal economic performance.\n  The legacy of the nuclear age, however, is still with us, the tens of \nthousands metric tons of commercial high-level nuclear waste, and an \nincomprehensible volume of defense related waste generated by the \nproduction of nuclear weapons.\n  Over Nevada's vigorous objections, our State has been targeted as the \nfinal resting place for these dangerous, poisonous wastes.\n  The Department of Energy, and the nuclear power industry, have spent \nmillions of dollars attempting to convince Nevadans that they have \nnothing to fear, that this waste is perfectly safe, and poses no threat \nto our health and safety.\n  Unfortunately, Nevadans have had enough experience with the \nDepartment of Energy and its scientists to hold a certain amount of \nskepticism regarding these claims.\n  The report being reviewed by the committee today is yet another \nconfirmation that the Department has historically cultivated a culture \nwhere concerns for public health and safety are subsumed to the \npressure to reach the agencies ultimate goals, whether it is the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, or the disposal of commercial high-\nlevel nuclear waste.\n  The Yucca Mountain project is no exception.\n  In the 15 years Nevada has fought being designated as the repository \nfor commercial high-level nuclear waste, we have seen repeated \ninstances of the Department ignoring or explaining away scientific \nfindings that do not conform to its repository program.\n  Signs of water percolating through the repository site were \nrepeatedly ignored.\n  Seismic activity in the area, including an earthquake that did \nserious damage to the buildings housing project offices, were \ndismissed.\n  For every objection that has been raised, the Department has been \nquick to assure us that they are meaningless, and that even if there \nwere problems, the engineers can design around them.\n  Recently, several new discoveries have added to the uncertainty about \nthe suitability of Yucca Mountain as a repository site, and called into \nquestion the models and assumptions Yucca Mountain scientists have \nrelied upon for more than a decade.\n  For example, analysis of material removed from the exploratory tunnel \nat Yucca Mountain have shown pockets of unusually high concentrations \nof chlorine 136, a radioactive isotope generated by nuclear \ndetonations.\n  The presence of high levels of chlorine 136 at the proposed \nrepository level is assumed to result from penetration of water from \nthe surface, where it picked up chlorine 136 fallout from atmospheric \ntesting at the NTS 50 years ago.\n  This rapid penetration of water through the welded tuff of Yucca \nMountain contradicts the Department of Energy's assumptions about the \nnature of the geology at the site, and calls into question the validity \nand accuracy of much of the characterization effort.\n  Despite repeated assurances by the Department of Energy and the \nnuclear power industry that the nature and behavior of radioactivity \nand radionuclides are well understood and predictable, and thus nothing \nfor Nevadans to worry about, evidence continues to mount that the \nscientific community actually knows little about this field.\n  Just 1 month ago, scientists studying the Nevada Test Site, an area \nadjacent to Yucca Mountain, discovered that plutonium resulting from \nunderground nuclear testing have migrated underground far faster and \nfurther than previously expected--nearly a mile in less than 30 years.\n  The empirical data collected at the site contradicts the models that \nare being relied on by the Department to evaluate the environmental \nimpacts of underground testing at the Nevada Test Site.\n  The cumulative effect of these, and other, scientific assurances that \nlater prove to be inaccurate, misleading, or even outright dishonest \nhas been to seriously damage the credibility of the Department of \nEnergy and the nuclear industry in Nevada, and elsewhere across the \nNation.\n  Nevadans, and many others, will continue to suffer the consequences \nof our failure to properly understand the nature and effects of \nradioactivity in the past.\n  Despite these historical lessons, however, the proponents of nuclear \nenergy continue to press forward with their misguided efforts to \nbolster the industry at the expense of the health and safety of the \npublic.\n  The most recent incarnation of the industry's avarice is the nuclear \nwaste legislation currently working its way through this Congress. In a \nmisguided attempt to remove waste from reactor sites, where it can be, \naccording to the industry itself, safely stored for the next 100 years, \nthe industry has proposed shipping 80,000 metric tons of its waste on \n16,000 shipments through 43 States to Nevada where it will be stored in \nexactly the same type of storage currently available and, in some \ninstances, currently in use at existing reactor sites. This \nunprecedented shipping campaign will bring shipments of high-level \nnuclear waste within 1 mile of the homes of more than 50 million \nAmericans, creating potential public health and environmental \nconsequences of staggering proportions.\n  The nuclear power industry's attempt to ship its waste to above-\nground storage in Nevada is corporate welfare at its worst. In a \ndesperate attempt to rejuvenate a dying industry, the nuclear power \nindustry is willing to sacrifice the health and safety of millions of \nAmericans to improve its bottom line.\n  Mr. President, there is simply no need to move this dangerous, \npoisonous waste at this time. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the \nindustry itself concedes the storage of the waste at reactor sites is \nsafe. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, an independent \noversight board created by Congress, has said that centralized interim \nstorage is presently not needed.\n  The nuclear power industry's waste legislation has passed the Senate \nand I fear will likely pass the House in the near future. Fortunately, \nPresident Clinton has committed to veto this ill-advised piece of \nlegislation, and we are fortunate to have the votes in the Senate to \nsustain the veto.\n  It is time for the nuclear utilities to give up their efforts to \nestablish interim storage in Nevada and enter into serious negotiations \nwith the Department of Energy regarding support for the continued \nstorage of high-level nuclear waste at reactor sites until an \nobjective, defensible characterization of Yucca Mountain can be \ncompleted.\n  In the 1950's and 1960's, most public policymakers could not \nunderstand the terrible consequences that would result from atmospheric \ntesting. Today, more than 40 years later, every taxpayer is \ncontributing to compensate those downwind victims for the cancer, \ngenetic, and other health effects from the fallout of those tests. It \nwould be inexcusable for us, with what we know today, to create yet \nanother situation where future legislators, our successors, 50, 100, or \neven 150 years from now will need to make similar arrangements for new \ngenerations of victims of the legislation the nuclear power industry is \nasking us to approve in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and if there is any time remaining, \nI yield back the remainder of the time.\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the pleasures and honors I have in \nthis body is to serve as the chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee that funds veterans' programs, housing, as well as \nenvironment, space, science, and emergency management.\n  On the veterans side, we have a very heavy responsibility to the \npeople who, in my State and throughout the country, have been willing \nto put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms, and I think \nthey deserve the best that we can give them. That is why in past years, \nI have been very disappointed and troubled at this administration's \napproach to funding for veterans' medical care. Quite frankly, they \nwere willing to sacrifice these important programs, at least on paper, \nin order to pretend that they were reaching a balanced budget. I think \nthat is just plain wrong.\n  I was also disappointed earlier this spring when the President and \nthe congressional leadership proposed to take $300 million out of \nveterans' medical care as a part of the budget agreement. I said at the \ntime that we would not let that happen.\n  I am pleased to report that last night in a bipartisan, bicameral \nsession, the Senate and House negotiators on both sides, Democrats and \nRepublicans, approved a measure that provides more funding than the \nPresident, more funding than the budget agreement for veterans' medical \ncare. The conference agreement that we hope will soon be signed into \nlaw provides $17 billion next year for medical care for veterans. This \nlevel of funding ensures that we keep our promise of continued care to \nall eligible veterans.\n\n  We will also be able to continue our efforts to improve the VA \nmedical system, which has been under great stress and which we hope is \nmaking progress toward more efficient, more effective, more humane care \nand treatment for our veterans who need care.\n  It is sometimes easy during peace and prosperity to forget \ntemporarily the promises that we as a country have made to those \nveterans who were willing to risk their lives to protect us. I said \nthroughout this budget process I did not intend to let us forget, and I \nhope we will move quickly to send this bill to the President.\n  In addition to the tough battles we fought in the veterans' medical \ncare area and the difficult decisions we made, we had to make some \ntough decisions and take some difficult actions with respect to \nhousing. Over the last several weeks, many elderly residents in public \nhousing complexes in Missouri and I am sure in other States represented \nin this body, have expressed their deep concern about the possibility \nof their housing subsidies being ended.\n  HUD was required by law and did send notices to thousands of senior \ncitizens across the country over the last few months telling them that \ntheir rent subsidies were scheduled to expire this fall. That is \nrequired by law. But for most of the seniors who received the notices, \nit is very frightening because it threatens to tell most of them they \nwill no longer be able to afford their homes and will be forced to \nmove.\n  I visited residences of complexes in St. Louis and Springfield, MO, \nand listened as the residents described their fears about losing their \nrent subsidies. I told them I would do everything in my power to help \nthem stay in their homes.\n  I am pleased to announce once again that last night the House-Senate \nconference agreed to provisions that we crafted, that I crafted to \nprotect elderly housing. During the years I have spent as a member of \nthe Senate Banking Committee and now as chairman of the VA, HUD, and \nIndependent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I made preservation \nof affordable, low-income housing, especially for seniors, for the \nelderly, a top priority and a long-term commitment.\n  Unlike the administration which, for some reason, continues to \nemphasize the possibility of vouchers as a one-size-fits-all approach \nto housing needs of low-income families and the elderly, I believe that \nelderly housing complexes, which are good, safe places, comfortable for \nthe elderly residents, should be maintained. Frankly, it is terrifying \nto seniors who may have lived 10 to 15 to 20 years in the same housing \ncomplex to tell them suddenly they must move: ``Here is a voucher, go \nout and pound the pavement and try to find housing.''\n  Mr. President, if you have visited these complexes, and I am sure you \nhave them in your State as we have them in all of our States, all you \nhave to do is go into one of those complexes and meet with the \nresidents, many of them in walkers, using canes, in wheelchairs and \nthink just a minute of giving those people vouchers and asking them to \ngo out and look for housing. What a ridiculous thought that is. We are \nnot going to force them to go out and look for housing.\n  How many of us who have parents and grandparents or other relatives \nin elderly housing complexes want to see them torn away from their \ncommunities and forced to find new housing? I really believe that \nseniors should be treated differently from young persons eligible for \nsubsidized housing.\n  While the trend in recent years has been to provide vouchers for \nrecipients to use for housing of their choice in a variety of \nneighborhoods, many seniors--most of whom I talked to--prefer to remain \nin senior-only housing complexes. I think it makes sense for them to \nremain in communities where they have grown accustomed to living and \nhave made friends and feel comfortable.\n  As chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee, I included \nlanguage in the HUD-VA bill that was agreed to last night which does \nallow these seniors to remain in their homes, to remain in their \ncomplexes. Specifically, we provided for the renewal of project-based \nsection 8 contracts at a rate affordable to the elderly.\n  Good, affordable elderly housing, more than just an example of a \nsuccessful private-public partnership, is a community of people who \nlive together and care about each other. We cannot afford to lose this \ntype of housing. We cannot afford to lose the type of community this \nhousing represents.\n  Washington sometimes loses sight of people and the importance of \nlocal communities. But I do not plan to let Washington lose sight of \nthese elderly housing communities or the people who live in them now or \nin the future.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a \nstatement on a couple of issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10267-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10267-S10268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GEN. JOHN SHALIKASHVILI\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have very mixed feelings about the \ndecision announced yesterday at the White House. After nearly four \ndecades of exemplary service to his adopted Nation, Gen. John \nShalikashvili will step down as the top soldier of our Nation's \nmilitary forces. We understand that by statute he is required to do so, \nbut it does not make the reality any less of a disappointment.\n  With his 39 years of distinguished service, General Shali, as he has \ncome to be affectionately known, has earned\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\nthe respect and admiration of men and women in uniform, the Nation and \nindeed the whole world. His brand of quiet, steady leadership will be \ngreatly missed.\n  The General Shali story is as unusual as it is remarkable. Born in \nWarsaw, Poland, on June 27, 1936, John Shalikashvili was just 3 years \nold when Hitler's tanks rolled into his homeland. Five years later, \nStalin's troops invaded Poland from the east. His family fled to \nBerlin, Germany, after World War II and then later moved to Peoria, IL, \nwhen John Shalikashvili was 16 years old. He graduated from Peoria High \nSchool in 1954 and received a degree in mechanical engineering from \nBradley University 4 years later.\n  General Shali began his extraordinary military career in an ordinary \nway--as a draftee in 1958.\n  He graduated from officer candidate school a year later and was \ncommissioned a second lieutenant in the Army. During the next 23 years, \nGeneral Shalikashvili served in a variety of command and staff \npositions before becoming a brigadier general in 1982.\n  In addition to serving on the Army staff, Shali served in Germany as \nan assistant division commander in the 1st Armored Division. In 1986, \nhe was promoted to major general, and, from 1987 to 1989, he served as \nCommander of the 9th Infantry Division in Fort Lewis, WA.\n  In 1989, he was promoted to lieutenant general and returned to \nGermany to serve as the deputy commander in chief of the Seventh Army. \nThen, in 1991, he was selected to command Operation Provide Comfort, \nthe relief operation that returned hundreds of thousands of Kurdish \nrefugees to northern Iraq.\n  In 1991, he became the Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff and later served as the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and \nthe commander in chief of the U.S. European Command from June 1992 \nuntil October 1993.\n  On October 25, 1993, Gen. John Shalikashvili completed his rise to \nthe top of the military. President Clinton appointed him to serve as \nthe 13th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In that position, he \nhas served as the principal military adviser to the President, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the National Security Council. During that \ntenure as Chairman, Shali was integral to the United States-led efforts \nto restore democracy in Haiti, enforce sanctions against Iraq, and keep \npeace in Bosnia.\n  His guidance, his commitment, and dedication truly made a difference \nin each of these and more than 40 other missions in which our troops \nparticipated over the last 4 years.\n  In addition to his extraordinary operational successes, the general \nhas also made significant contributions to improving the Department of \nDefense. He was instrumental in adjusting our military forces to post-\ncold-war realities and budget levels, always ensuring that the troops \nreceived the best equipment and training in the world.\n  There is not a single soldier in our military today who has not \nbenefited from the concern General Shali has consistently displayed for \nhis or her well-being. His commitment to improving the quality of life \nfor those serving in the Armed Forces has been second to none, and I am \nsure that they, like the rest of their fellow Americans, salute him.\n  I think his Commander in Chief best expressed the high regard in \nwhich General Shali is held. In his comments at General Shali's \nfarewell ceremony yesterday, President Clinton stated:\n\n       When future students look back upon his time, they will \n     rank John Shali as among the greatest chairmen of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff America ever had.\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, the men and women in \nuniform, and millions of his countrymen, I concur with President \nClinton's assessment and thank General Shali for his 39 years of \nservice to his country. I wish him and his wife, Joan, the very best as \nthey begin a new chapter in their lives in the State of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10267-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10268-S10269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come before the Senate this afternoon \nto talk briefly about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty submitted to \nthe Senate by President Clinton last week. This treaty represents \nanother useful and important step toward reducing the spread of nuclear \nweapons. I stand ready to do all that I can to ensure that the Senate \nconsiders the CTBT in a timely manner and votes to allow the United \nStates to join 145 other signatories of this treaty to put an end to \nnuclear testing.\n  It was on July 16, 1945, at a site called Trinity in the desert near \nAlamogordo, NM, that the United States conducted the first test of an \natomic bomb. In a fraction of a second, the detonation not only \nreleased over the isolated test site an amount of energy equivalent to \nwhat we consume in the entire United States in 30 seconds--it also \nchanged the world. The nuclear age had loudly begun. For decades to \ncome, humanity would be forced to grapple with the consequences borne \nout of what occurred at Trinity.\n  Much has happened since that first test in the New Mexico desert.\n  The United States was quickly joined in the nuclear club by Russia \nand several others. We saw the onset of the cold war and an arms race \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union. As each country strove \nto keep pace with the other, the United States and Russia engaged in a \nbuildup of thousands of nuclear weapons with a destructive power \nunprecedented in human history.\n  The United States would go on to conduct more than 1,000 additional \nnuclear tests; and the Russians more than 700. Several other countries \nwould carry out a total of roughly 300 tests of nuclear weapons.\n  The Russians would test the largest weapon ever designed by mankind--\na monstrous device that, in a split second, produced enough energy to \npower the entire United States for a whole day. At the height of the \ncold war, the United States and the Russians had deployed between them \nroughly 60,000 nuclear weapons.\n  Taken together, these frightening developments would make a four \ndecade old comment by the preeminent scientist of the 20th century, \nAlbert Einstein, even more poignant. Einstein played a large role in \nthe conceptual development of the atom bomb. Moreover, in 1939, in a \nletter he sent to President Roosevelt, Einstein urged the President to \nbegin a nuclear weapons program immediately. Later in life, after \nobserving the early stages of the arms buildup and the development of \never more destructive weapons, Einstein commented, ``I made one great \nmistake in my life, when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt \nrecommending that atom bombs be made.''\n  Fortunately, the outlook has improved markedly since the darkest days \nof the cold war. The United States and Russia have cooperated \nrepeatedly during the past several years to reduce the nuclear threat. \nEach country has ratified the START I Treaty.\n  Following President Clinton's lead, the Senate ratified the START II \nTreaty, and we hope the Russians will follow suit by year's end. If \nSTART II is implemented, each side will reduce its strategic arsenal \ndown to about 3,500 deployed weapons. In addition, once START II enters \ninto force, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin pledged to immediately begin \nnegotiations on START III. Under the terms of the Helsinki agreement, \nSTART III would establish ceilings of as low as 2,000 strategic \nweapons.\n  While much has been done to reduce the threat posed by nuclear \nweapons, much remains to be done. And, President Clinton's submission \nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty represents a useful step in the \nright direction.\n  The CTBT prohibits any test involving a nuclear explosion, regardless \nof the test's purpose, size, or location. On behalf of the United \nStates, the President was the first to sign this treaty last September. \nHe would subsequently be joined by representatives from more than 140 \nother nations.\n  We will soon hear from the usual critics of arms control, voicing \nobjections to the treaty that are as predictable as they are likely. \nThey will say the CTBT is unverifiable. They will say that it will lead \nto the inevitable erosion of our nuclear weapons capability. And, they \nwill be wrong on both counts. Although we will have plenty of time to \nthoroughly address their objections in the days ahead, I will briefly \naddress each of those criticisms.\n  As to the verifiability of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, this is \na\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\nfamiliar refrain uttered by those who oppose arms control agreements in \nany form. The treaty's verification regime includes a comprehensive \ninternational monitoring system composed of hundreds of seismological, \nradionuclide, hydroacoustic, and infrasound sensors spread out all over \nthe globe. This network is backed up by the ability of Members to \nconduct onsite inspections of questionable activities. This combination \nshould be more than sufficient to deter would-be cheaters and, if \ndeterrence fails, catch those who try to violate the treaty's \nrestrictions.\n  As to the concern that CTBT will erode our nuclear capability, I have \n4.5 billion reasons why that will not be the case this year and tens of \nbillions more reasons in subsequent years. Last week, the \nadministration reached an important agreement with our weapons \ndevelopment labs. These labs are staffed by the world's foremost \nnuclear weapons experts. The labs stated that if they are provided with \n$4.5 billion this year and similar amounts in each subsequent year, \nthey will be able to conduct a program that will ensure with a high \nlevel of confidence the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons \nin our stockpile. In short, the cessation of nuclear testing need not \nerode our nuclear capability.\n  The CTBT is an important step down the path toward a safer world. In \nsimple terms, the United States, the country with one of the largest \nand certainly the most sophisticated nuclear weapons arsenals in the \nworld, has the most to gain from freezing the competition in place. \nCountries already possessing nuclear weapons will have a difficult time \nmaking qualitative and quantitative improvements to their existing \narsenals. And as for countries without nuclear weapons, the CTBT will \nplace an additional hurdle in their path if they seek to develop and \ndeploy such weapons.\n  I do not believe we can rest with the submission, and, hopefully, \nratification of this treaty.\n  Many more challenges face us if we are to reduce to acceptable levels \nthe threat posed by nuclear weapons. For example, despite the fact that \nthe cold war ended years ago, the United States and Russia still \nmaintain at least 3,000 strategic nuclear warheads poised and ready to \nlaunch at a moment's notice. As noted by former Senator Sam Nunn, one \nof the most distinguished and insightful defense experts to ever serve \nin this Chamber, while this practice may have been necessary in the \ncold war, ``today it represents a dangerous anachronism.'' Moreover, \ntens of tons of nuclear materials and thousands of nuclear weapons \nremain outside international controls.\n  Tens of thousands of highly trained employees of the Russian nuclear \ncomplex, each armed with the ability to design and build nuclear \nweapons, go unpaid for months at a time. Future security measures must \nbe designed to speak to these concerns as well.\n  While I will be doing all I can to ensure smooth ratification of the \nCTBT in the Senate, I will also be attempting to help design measures \nthat speak to these other security problems. Outside experts such as \nformer Senator Nunn, General Lee Butler, the last Commander in Chief of \nthe now-disbanded Strategic Air Command, and Dr. Bruce Blair, a \nthoughtful arms control expert at the Brookings Institution, have all \nraised these same concerns and begun to design solutions. It is an \nimportant opportunity for the Senate, the Pentagon, and the country to \nbegin to consider them.\n  At Helsinki, the administration acknowledged its awareness of these \nproblems and indicated a commitment to resolve them. Unfortunately, the \nadministration appears to have put the detailed discussion of many of \nthese measures on hold until START II enters force and the START III \nnegotiations begin. I hope the administration would begin exploring \nthese steps today. The only real linkage between START and these other \nmeasures is that they both can enhance our security. There is no reason \nwhy United States action in one arena should be held in abeyance until \nthe Russians act in another.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I look forward to working with the \nadministration and the other supporters of the CTBT in this body to \nensure that the merits of this treaty are fully aired. If that happens, \nI am confident the CTBT will be ratified, and another step will be \ntaken toward turning back the clock that unfortunately began ticking 52 \nyears ago at a place called Trinity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10268-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10269-S10270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have spent several days recently and \nthis week talking about campaign finance. I would like to share some of \nmy thoughts. It is one of those issues that have become so complicated \nand so convoluted that it seems to me it is very difficult for a person \nto really bring it down to the simple basics, particularly if you \nhaven't listened to all of it.\n  Proponents of campaign finance reform bills will have you believe \nthis is the top issue and in the interest of Americans, that everyone \non Main Street is waiting breathlessly for some significant action that \nwould be more important than tax relief or the balanced budget--no. I \nthink that is not so. When I go back to Wyoming nearly every week, \npeople don't come and talk to me about campaign finance. They want to \ndiscuss health care, they want to discuss public lands, they want to \ndiscuss taxes.\n  This is not to say that it is not important, certainly not to say \nthat I am against finance reform, because I think there should be some \nthoughtful changes in terms of campaign financing. I just don't believe \nthat it is a catastrophic issue. I don't believe it is an issue that is \nthe most important thing on our agenda as it sometimes is termed.\n  The steam behind the issue, as a matter of fact, is generally that of \nenforcing the laws that are now on the books. That is what the hearings \nwere about. That is what brought it up. It is not new laws that are \nneeded--enforce the ones that are now there, not merely adding more to \nbe unenforced.\n  I am in favor of campaign finance reform. I have been very involved \nin political systems, as a matter of fact, long before I was ever in \nelective office, because it seemed to me over a period of years that it \nis pretty clear that politics and campaigns are how we govern \nourselves. That is how you and I in our precincts decide the big issues \nin terms of government. So I just think we need to make it the kind of \na process in which people can be involved, the kind of a process in \nwhich the first amendment opportunities to speak are there and are \nextended to everyone--not just limited to the press.\n  On the other hand, we can't overlook the defects we saw in the last \ncampaign cycle. The answer, however, is not to marshal the powers of \nthe Federal Government and increase governmental intervention. We can \nreintroduce principle, we can introduce integrity and serious \ncompliance into this important function of governing ourselves by \nstrengthening and enforcing the reporting and disclosure laws, by \nlimiting the influence of soft money on the national level, by \nrequiring that a majority of the funds in a campaign come from the \ndistrict in which the election takes place, by banning compulsory \ncontributions.\n  I don't think we ought to pass a bill just because we want to go \nthrough the rhetorical process, just because we want to shift the \nattention from not adhering to the law to writing new laws.\n  We are talking about being home, and I hear more than anything else \nin Wyoming, ``Wait a minute, the issue is not new law; the issue is \nenforcing the laws we have.'' I think disclosure is the most important \nof the election issues. In that case, voters can determine where the \nmoney comes from to go to a candidate and make their own judgment as to \nwhether or not that is reasonable. It is a simple way to bring our \nsystem of privately financed campaigns on track by strengthening and \nenforcing existing disclosure laws.\n  Privately financed--I think it is a mistake to move more and more to \nhow the taxpayers finance campaigns. It seems to me that has proven not \nto be useful. Candidates in parties must offer fuller and more timely \ndisclosure of campaign receipts and spending activities. Reports must \nbe prompt and\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\nearly. Now there is a period of time between the last reporting and the \nelection in which donations and contributions are not reported until \nafter the election is over. That is wrong. We ought to change that. \nCandidates' reports are often late and partial and voters are kept from \nknowing what they should know about contributions prior to the time of \nvoting. People need to be better informed. We can do that and we \nshould.\n  Soft money--I am concerned about the increased amount of soft money \nbeing spent on a national level. I say again, I was very involved in my \nparty prior to being elected, and I saw us use money of that kind to do \nthings that I thought were useful, and continue to think are useful--\nparty building, voter identification, voter registration, getting \npeople to vote and participate in government. That is what soft money \nis for.\n  Unfortunately, the receipts for campaigns have increased some 200 \npercent from the 1992 Presidential election to the 1996 cycle. That is \na little scary. That is a lot. This money is not subject to the kind of \ndisclosure requirements and restrictions in the kind of things that so-\ncalled hard money is. Voters have the right to be suspect of this kind \nof dough, it seems to me, since there are really not stringent \naccountability standards. We must develop, I think, a contribution \nlimit on soft money. It doesn't need to be small. It can be healthy, \nbut it should not be unlimited, and it should be for party building.\n\n  We talk sometimes disdainfully about politics. Politics is how we \ngovern ourselves. That is how you and I who live in our precincts are \nable to make an impact. I feel very strongly about that.\n  Fundraising in the district--pretty evident that is the important \nthing. I support the idea of having at least 50 percent of the money \nthat goes into the campaign come from the district from which the \ncandidate runs.\n  Now, I am the first to admit--and that is one of the difficulties \nwith all kinds of election controls and election restrictions--there \nare ways to go around that. In my State there are large companies that \nrun mines, for example, that contribute to campaigns from out-of-state \nheadquarters. They will simply contribute from instate headquarters, \nand it will be the same money. But, nevertheless it is important. I \nthink there is a great shift of money from one place to another outside \nof the eligible voters, simply because of interests that are somewhere \nelse, that go to this campaign. I suggest that at least 50 percent come \nfrom the area in which the candidates come.\n  Compulsory dues being used for campaigns I think is a real mistake. \nLabor unions are the only ones that really are able to do that. I think \nit certainly ought to be voluntary on the part of the member whether or \nnot those dues are used for that purpose. There are some polls recently \nthat say that is greatly supported, 4 to 1, by members of unions. I \nthink that is right. They should not be restricted from using their \nmoney for that purpose if they choose to, but they need to choose.\n  Mr. President, in summary, voting is one of the highest privileges of \nbeing a citizen. Not only is it a privilege, it is an obligation and a \nresponsibility if we are to have a government of the people, by the \npeople and for the people, then the people must participate, must be \ngiven an opportunity to participate.\n  It is ironic to me, it seems to me we are in a time where we have the \ntechnical ability to have more information available to more people \nthan ever in history. Can you imagine what it was like to vote 100 \nyears ago? How much do you think people knew about national elections? \nVery little, I suspect. Now we know anything that happens in the world, \nand we know it in 10 minutes. Yet we seem not to have the kind of \nparticipation that we really ought to have in a citizen government. \nThat is what we ought to be striving to have as we deal with election \nfinance--voters being responsible, voters fulfilling their obligation, \nvoters being knowledgeable, and voters being able to choose.\n  One of the real meaningful ways, of course, is that individuals can \ncontribute to that point of view that they support. We should work hard \nto ensure that campaign system is free of some of its current laws and \nyet open and free and not governed in every detail by some bureau \nsomewhere that decides what you can say in an ad. Those kind of things \nare not useful and, indeed in my opinion, move us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I hope we continue to work on this issue. I hope we do some things. I \nhope we stay away from the convoluted notion that we ought to have \nsomebody in some bureaucracy, somewhere, manage all of the election \nactivities. Here again, these kind of things belong in our communities, \nthey belong in our States, they belong in our towns, they belong in our \nschool boards. That is where they ought to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10269-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10270-S10271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SETTING GOVERNMENT LIMITS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on two bills that \nI have introduced aimed at limiting the size of Government and \nrestricting its growth. One reduces the Federal Government by \nrestricting the ability of Congress to spend money, and the other \nlimits Government by sunsetting the Internal Revenue Code.\n  First, I will discuss the Economic Growth and Debt Burden Reduction \nAct. Although I have only been in Congress a short time, I have reached \nan inescapable conclusion, and that is that Congress is much better at \nexercising fiscal recklessness than fiscal restraint. Accordingly, I \nhave authored legislation that specifically restricts Congress' ability \nto embark on spending sprees by making it illegal to use excess \nGovernment revenues for anything other than debt reduction or tax cuts.\n  Congress has historically been wholly unable to exercise fiscal \nrestraints when given resources in excess of the current demands of the \nGovernment. I believe we need to limit the size of the Government, and \nthis bill forces it to do so.\n  Mr. President, we are going to soon approach a historic opportunity. \nFor the first time since 1969 we are going to balance the budget. It \nwas the last time we actually had revenues and expenditures equivalent. \nNow is the time for us to begin this great national debate as to, once \nyou go into balance and you start moving into surplus, how should those \nsurpluses be spent. In other words, whenever revenues exceed \nexpenditures, what should they be spent upon.\n  We can say go on another spending spree and spend more money, or we \ncan pay the debt down, or we can say we will cut taxes further on an \nAmerican public that is taxed too heavily.\n  The bill that I put forward puts it this way: If revenues are \nprojected to exceed the agreement levels, those excess revenues are \nimmediately captured and reserved for tax cuts. If tax cutting \nlegislation is not enacted, the additional revenues revert to deficit \nor debt reduction. This prevents any unanticipated revenues from being \nplowed back into higher expenditures and higher spending. And it seems \nto me that is what the American public wants us to be. They want us to \npay down this massive $5.4 trillion debt --and we get from deficit into \ndebt, start paying the debt down --and if we can't agree on cutting \ntaxes further, then we can apply that immediately and require that it \ngo toward the debt reduction. So we can reduce the mortgage on America, \nwhich is on our children. They are going to have to reduce the overall \ntax burden in this country today, which is about 38 percent of the \naverage two-wage earner, two-child family--a 38-percent tax rate. That \nis at all levels of government, including Federal, State, and local.\n\n\n                  Sunsetting the Internal Revenue Code\n\n  Mr. President, the other bill I introduced would sunset the Internal \nRevenue Code, except for the section relating to Social Security and \nMedicare. As my colleagues know, last week, the Senate Finance \nCommittee held hearings on the Internal Revenue Service, and during \nthose hearings, the Congress and the American people heard detailed \naccounts of endless cases of the IRS's abuse of power.\n  I believe the IRS needs to be reformed and, more fundamentally, I \nbelieve our Tax Code needs to be changed. The current Tax Code, along \nwith the regulations, consists of more than 10 million words. It is \nimpressive in size and oppressive in operation. It is antigrowth, \nantifamily, and it is not\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\nthe sort of environment that we can put forward economically and hope \nto have the next century be another American century. That is why I \nhave joined with Congressman Paxon on the House side in sponsoring a \nbill that would sunset the current Internal Revenue code by the end of \nthe year 2000.\n  What we hope to do with this is start the great national debate about \nwhat sort of tax system should be in place. Should we go to a flat tax \nor a consumption-based tax, or truly do tax simplification? But let's \nset the timeframe and a goal and work toward it like we have done on \nbalancing the budget, when we said that, in 7 years, we would balance \nthe budget and then we will figure out how we are going to get that. \nThat is what we have done and that is why we are going to get it \nbalanced. Let's do the same on fundamental tax reform. Let's set a time \ncertain in which to accomplish it and let's begin the great national \ndebate.\n  I hope a number of my colleagues will join me in sponsoring this \neffort to sunset this Tax Code and start the next millennium in this \nNation with a taxation system that is pro-family, pro-growth and pro-\nAmerican. We can do that and start this great debate now. I hope my \ncolleagues will join in sponsoring both of those bills.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10270-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10271-S10272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few if any issues before the Senate this \nyear are more important than campaign finance reform.\n  Americans from all walks of life are fed up with the current campaign \nfinancing system and its excessive reliance on unlimited contributions \nthat make conflict of interest a way of life. They are fed up with a \ncampaign process driven by the high cost of television commercials. \nThey are fed up with candidates who spend more time raising money from \nspecial interests instead of serving the public interest.\n  And who can blame them?\n  In recent years, the amount of money spent in Presidential campaigns \nhas doubled every 4 years. Senate and House races now cost millions of \ndollars. Election campaigns have become more and more negative, with \nmisleading TV spots that traffic in half-truths or outright falsehoods. \nAnd corrupting and corroding it all are the massive abusers of the \ncurrent loophole-ridden campaign financing laws.\n  The constant hunt for campaign dollars demeans our electoral process \nand undermines the very foundation of our country. We have the best \npolitical system that money can buy, and it's a disgrace to everything \nour democracy stands for.\n  The time for change is now. We must take elections off the auction \nblock. We must limit campaign spending. We must return the election \nprocess to the people, in which every voter is equal, no matter what \ntheir income, or what job they hold, or where they live.\n  Democrats understand this. Democrats in the Senate are unanimously \ncommitted to campaign finance reform that limits campaign spending. All \n45 Democrats in the U.S. Senate have pledged their support for the \nbipartisan McCain-Feingold bill. President Clinton, too, has clearly \nstated his unequivocal support for this important legislation. He has \ntaken the extraordinary step of announcing his intention to use his \nauthority under the U.S. Constitution to require Congress to meet in \nspecial session if it fails to take up this urgently needed reform.\n  But where are the Republicans?\n  Have they united behind a proposal--any proposal?\n  Are they willing to join with Democrats to clean up the cesspool, and \nlimit the amount of money and the power of money in American elections?\n  Sadly, the answer is ``no.''\n  The Republican prescription for these flagrant abuses is more money \nin politics, not less. They prescribe an even larger overdose of money \nfor elections, in which their friends in big businesses and their \nlobbyists and special interests can write more checks and fatter checks \nto the Republican Party.\n  Their recipe for campaign finance reform is to tilt the balance even \nmore unfairly against American workers. They want to increase the power \nof large corporations, and squash even the limited power that American \nworkers have today. Republicans want to handcuff labor unions in the \nbattle for a living wage, for decent health care for working families, \nand a secure retirement for the elderly. They want to silence union \nsupport for candidates who stand up and speak out on those basic \nissues.\n  In short, Republicans want to impose a gag rule on American workers.\n  The Republican antiworker scheme is a poison pill for campaign \nfinance reform, and the Republicans admit it. The majority leader, \nSenator Lott, told the Washington Times that his amendment would kill \nthe bill because Democrats would mount a filibuster. He said, ``I've \nset it up where they're going to be doing the filibustering.''\n  Columnist Robert Novak agrees. Writing about the Republican amendment \nto impose a gag rule on workers, he says its ``primary purpose in \nCongress is not to win Republican supporters for campaign reform but to \nlose Democratic supporters . . . . Republicans are divided between the \nmany who bash labor to kill reform and the few who appease labor to \nsave reform.''\n  The Lott amendment is a killer amendment, because it unfairly \npunishes working Americans and their unions for participating in the \nelections. The Lott amendment bars unions from collecting dues from any \nworkers--even members who voluntarily join the union and participate in \nsetting its goals--unless those workers sign an authorization form to \nallow part of their union dues to be spent for political purposes.\n  This isn't reform--it's revenge. It's a blatant attempt to punish \nworking Americans for their role in the 1996 elections--and an equally \nblatant attempt to silence working Americans in future elections.\n  Republicans intend this procedure to cripple any union's ability to \nparticipate in elections. They know that imposing such a requirement on \nany organization would have the same result. Yet, they don't propose it \nfor the National Rifle Association or the big tobacco companies or the \nAmerican Farm Bureau or the Chamber of Commerce. They don't ask \ncorporations to get permission slips from their shareholders before the \ncorporation can spend funds for political purposes. The Lott amendment \nshould be called The Rampant Republican Hypocrisy Act of 1997. How \nhypocritical can they get?\n  The real measure of whether Republicans are serious about campaign \nfinance reform is whether they will support honest limits on campaign \nspending.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill that all 45 Senate Democrats support will \nban so-called soft money--the millions of dollars in campaign funds \nthat today are virtually unregulated. This immense loophole in our \ncurrent campaign laws allows contributions worth hundreds of thousands \nof dollars to be made to political parties. The parties then spend the \nmoney to help elect candidates for Federal office. While the amount of \nmoney that an individual voter can give to a candidate is limited to \n$1,000 per campaign, candidates for Federal office can receive millions \nthrough the back door using this soft money loophole.\n  Clearly, any legislation worth the name reform must ban this shameful \npractice.\n  In addition, the McCain-Feingold bill limits the ability of outside \ngroups to run ads supporting specific candidates. This practice has \nbecome another source of soft money for Federal candidates. If you \ndon't have enough money in your own campaign to pay for your ads, then \nget a friendly outside group to support them.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill says that organizations are free to run ads \non genuine issues. That's free speech, and it's protected under the \nConstitution. But if an outside group runs an ad supporting a specific \ncandidate, then the cost of that ad should be counted as part of the \ncandidate's campaign, and should be subject to the Federal election \nlaws.\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\n  The McCain-Feingold bill also increases disclosure requirements for \ncampaigns, so that the public will be able to see much more clearly the \nsources and the amounts of all contributions that any candidates \naccept.\n  It is time for Congress to stop talking about reform and start acting \nto make it happen. This bill is not a perfect bill. All Senators can \nfind some provision in it that they do not like. But the McCain-\nFeingold bill is an honest reform and the best hope to end the most \nflagrant abuses under the current system. I urge Democrats and \nRepublicans alike to support this bill and send it on to President \nClinton, so that we can clean up the current mess and restore the \nvoters' shattered confidence in our democracy.\n  It is time to take our campaigns away from the special interests and \ngive them back to the people. It is time to make our democracy worthy \nof its name.\n  Mr. President, I am not sure whether these have been printed in the \nRecord so I will ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two \neditorials, one from the Washington Post and one from the New York \nTimes, that comment on our Republican leader's amendments and \nparliamentary maneuvering so as to require the first and only vote that \nwill be available to the Members of the Senate to occur on his \nparticular gag rule on American workers.\n  The Washington Post says in the first sentence:\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, having magnanimously \n     allowed campaign finance reform legislation to come to the \n     floor, now proposes to kill it with an amendment affecting \n     the use of labor union dues for political purposes. . . .\n       Everyone understands what kind of vote this is--a vote not \n     on labor law but on campaign finance at one remove.\n\n  They have it right.\n  And the New York Times points out in its editorial:\n\n       Trent Lott, as expected, has come up with a perverse \n     stratagem to kill campaign finance reform this year. . . . \n     Mr. Lott's purpose today is to scuttle the bill by making it \n     unacceptable to Democrats. . . .\n       [Members] should realize that if they let Mr. Lott kill the \n     bill by subterfuge, their criticism of Democratic excesses \n     will be mere opportunism and hollow rhetoric.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of these editorials be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 1, 1997]\n\n                        Leader Lott's Amendment\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, having magnanimously \n     allowed campaign finance reform legislation to come to the \n     floor, now proposes to kill it with an amendment affecting \n     the use of labor union dues for political purposes. He thinks \n     he can summon the votes for the amendment, after which the \n     theory is that the Democrats, who are the principal \n     beneficiaries of labor support, will do the rest of his work \n     for him by halting the underlying bill. The transparency \n     offers him the best of both worlds: The bill will be \n     defeated, but he won't have been the one to have done it.\n       The amendment would require unions to get the written \n     permission of individual members before spending any of their \n     dues for political purposes. The Paycheck Protection Act, its \n     sponsors call it with mock solicitude. ``Our political system \n     depends upon one's freedom to participate without even the \n     slightest degree of compulsion,'' assistant majority leader \n     Don Nickles says. But in fact under labor law such freedom \n     already exists; there is no such compulsion. No worker in \n     this country can be forced to join a union. In some states, \n     workers covered by union contracts who decline to join can be \n     required to pay the equivalent of union dues, but they \n     already have the right, under a 1988 Supreme Court decision, \n     to have the political portion of those dues refunded. The \n     reform bill would codify that decision; the amendment would \n     go beyond it, not necessarily incapacitating the unions but \n     creating an extra hill for them to climb.\n       Question One is whether Mr. Lott is right in thinking he \n     has the votes. Everyone understands what kind of vote this \n     is--a vote not on labor law but on campaign finance at one \n     remove. A number of Republicans have indicated support for \n     the reform legislation--perhaps enough, assuming all 45 \n     Democrats also vote no, to set the Lott amendment aside. Do \n     they vote with their leader or do they vote for reform?\n       Question Two is what happens if Mr. Lott prevails. Once \n     again it is a question of senatorial will Proponents of \n     reform said before the August recess that they were willing \n     to tie up the Senate--prevent it from taking any or most \n     other action--until they got a clear shot at a clean version \n     of the reform bill. You presume they meant not just a chance \n     to talk for a few days, take a test vote on a deflective \n     amendment and quit, rather that they intend to press for a \n     straight up-or-down majority vote on the bill itself. Do they \n     do it at the risk of violating the accommodative code by \n     which the Senate normally lives, or do they cave? What \n     finally matters most to them? That's what the vote on Leader \n     Lott's amendment will begin to tell.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 1, 1997]\n\n                        Trent Lott's Poison Pill\n\n       Trent Lott, as expected, has come up with a perverse \n     strateagem to kill campaign finance reform this year. The \n     Senate majority leader would add a provision to the McCain-\n     Feingold bill requiring unions to get approval from workers \n     before using their dues or fees for political purposes. The \n     idea might deserve consideration another day, but Mr. Lott's \n     purpose today is to scuttle the bill by making it \n     unacceptable to Democrats.\n       After months of disclosures about excesses in both parties, \n     all 45 Senate Democrats have joined 4 Republicans to support \n     the McCain-Feingold legislation, which would prohibit \n     unlimited donations to the parties by wealthy individuals, \n     labor unions and corporations. These contributions were at \n     the heart of the access-buying scandals of the Clinton \n     campaign, and they figure in the influence of money from \n     tobacco and other industries on Capitol Hill. Mr. Lott knows \n     there are nearly enough senators to approve the bill, so he \n     wants a poison pill to repel Democrats and shatter its \n     bipartisan support.\n       Only one additional Republican would be needed to join \n     other Republican backers of reform to block Mr. Lott's plan. \n     But it will not be easy for Republicans to resist his \n     seductive amendment. Even two reformers, Senators John McCain \n     of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, support the principle \n     behind the amendment, though they have said they oppose the \n     amendment itself as a threat to reform at this crucial point. \n     Many other Republicans would like to vote for something that \n     would punish labor for its recent campaign spending, \n     particularly the $35 million that paid for attack ads \n     directed at Republican candidates in 30 Congressional races \n     last year.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill would codify a nine-year-old \n     ruling of the Supreme Court holding that non-union members \n     who pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment are \n     entitled to demand that the fees not be used for political \n     purposes. If Republicans want to vote on a broader provision \n     giving that right to all union members, they should accept \n     the Democratic offer to consider it on another day without \n     the threat of a filibuster. It would only be fair to consider \n     a similar curb requiring corporations, which outspent unions \n     nearly 9 to 1 on politics last year, to get approval from \n     shareholders when making political expenditures.\n       If the four Republican supporters of McCain-Feingold stand \n     firm, only one other Republican will be needed to defeat Mr. \n     Lott's disingenuous amendment. Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New \n     York, no particular champion of campaign reform in the past, \n     is in for a tough re-election fight next year and has always \n     had the backing of at least some labor unions. Senator Jim \n     Jeffords of Vermont, a long-time champion of campaign reform, \n     should see the wisdom of standing up now. Senator Olympia \n     Snowe of Maine, where campaign finance reform has been \n     approved locally, can join with Senator Collins to save the \n     reform legislation.\n       Other senators who have shown independence on this issue in \n     the past, like John Chafee of Rhode Island, should also come \n     to the rescue. Down the road, still more Republicans will be \n     needed to save the bill, because it will take 60 votes to \n     thwart a promised filibuster. For now, they should realize \n     that if they let Mr. Lott kill the bill by subterfuge, their \n     criticism of Democratic excesses will be mere opportunism and \n     hollow rhetoric.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10271-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10272-S10274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for just a few \nmoments about a very special provision that is now before the Senate, \nwhich we will vote on next week, and that is the amendment which has \nbeen proposed by Senator Mack, Senator Graham, and myself, which is \npending on the D.C. appropriations bill. Without this amendment, \nthousands of Central American refugee families who fled death squads \nand persecution in their native lands and found safe haven in the \nUnited States would be forced to return to their countries. Republican \nand Democratic administrations alike promised them repeatedly that they \nwill get their day in court to make their claims to remain in the \nUnited States.\n  Last year's immigration law, however, turned its back on that \ncommitment and treated these families unfairly. This legislation \nreinstates that promise and guarantees these families the day in court \nthey deserve--that's all, just the day in court they deserve to be able \nto make their case, which they were promised at the time they came to \nthe United States, by Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\n That particular guarantee was eliminated in the bill last year. It is \nthe attempt by Senator Mack and Senator Graham and myself to maintain \nthat commitment to these families.\n  Virtually all of these families fled to the United States in the \n1980's from El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Many were targeted \nby death squads and faced persecution at the hands of rogue militias. \nThey came to America to seek safety and freedom for themselves and \ntheir children. The Reagan administration, the Bush administration, and \nthe Clinton administration assured them that they could apply to remain \npermanently in the United States under our immigration laws. They were \npromised that if they have lived here for at least 7 years and are of \ngood moral character, and if a return to Central America would be an \nunusual hardship, they would be allowed to remain. They have to meet \nthose particular requirements and if they don't meet those \nrequirements, then they are unable to remain in the United States. Last \nyear's immigration law violated that commitment.\n  President Clinton has promised to find a fair and reasonable solution \nfor these families, and the administration will use its authority to \nhelp as many of them as possible. But Congress must do its part by \nenacting this corrective legislation.\n  Earlier in the course of today's debate, our colleague from Texas, \nSenator Gramm, talked at some length about this particular amendment \nand about the situation in which these refugees find themselves. I \nwould like to just clarify and respond to some of the comments that \nwere made earlier in the day.\n  The first comment was this legislation reverses our immigration laws \nenacted just last year. The answer is the law was changed on these \nfamilies retroactively, we took steps, gave guarantees, and then took \naction. These families had very little to do with it, and now the law \nwas changed. They played by the rules laid out by President Reagan, \nPresident Bush, and the Clinton administration. They were promised \ntheir day in court. But last year's law went back on that promise. All \nwe are trying to do is to make sure they are given their day in court.\n  Then the comment was made that this should go through the Immigration \nSubcommittee, not on an appropriations bill. Our chairman, Senator \nAbraham, spoke in support of this amendment. He is the chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee, and I am the ranking member. We are in strong \nsupport of this particular proposal, as I believe the members of the \ncommittee are.\n  The further point that was made by Senator Gramm was we need to stop \nillegal immigration, that this is an amnesty. Mr. President, it is an \ninsult to these hard-working refugees, and their families who have \nsuffered so much pain and hardship and who relied in good faith on the \nsolemn promise they were given to call them illegal aliens or call what \nwe are doing an amnesty. Virtually all of these families are already \nknown to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They are not \nillegal aliens working underground. These are families who applied to \ncome to the United States under INS programs, and they are here on a \nvariety of temporary immigration categories. They have acted in accord \nwith what our Government told them to do.\n\n  Not all these families will qualify to remain here under the terms of \nthis amendment. They still must meet certain standards that existed in \nthe law before the law was changed and applied retroactively. The \nImmigration Service estimates that less than half of those who qualify \nto apply to remain in this country will be approved. These families are \nlaw-abiding, tax-paying members of communities in all parts of America. \nIn many, many cases, they have children who were born in this country \nand who are U.S. citizens by birth. They deserve to be treated fairly.\n  I just want to take a few moments to talk about who these people are. \nZulema Balladares came to the United States from Nicaragua in 1986. If \nshe is deported, she will be leaving her husband and four children who \nare lawful, permanent residents here in the United States. The \nBalladares have strong ties to the United States. They own their home, \nand two of their children serve in the U.S. Army, both served in \nBosnia. Their children's ages range from 13 to 21 and have all resided \nin Miami for the past 10 years, the majority of the children's lives.\n  Justina Jiron entered the United States 12 years ago along with other \nfamily members. She has two U.S. citizen children. Her youngest, a \nbaby, has a need for surgery and ongoing medical treatment as a result \nof a birth defect. Thankfully, she has health insurance to cover the \nexpenses. However, unfortunately, if she is deported back to Nicaragua, \nher baby will not be able to obtain the needed medical treatment, \nbecause it is not available there. Since this lack of surgery and care \nis life threatening to the child, the deportation of Ms. Jiron will \nresult in sending a U.S. citizen to death.\n  Enrique Sequeira, now 21 years old, came to the United States from \nNicaragua at the age of 13 in 1988. He has been an outstanding student \nin the United States and has received numerous academic awards. In \naddition to excelling academically, Mr. Sequeira is a member of the \nJunior ROTC and has been involved extensively in community work in \nMiami. He was granted suspension of deportation November 1996, but the \nINS appealed that decision based on the Immigration Reform Law of 1996. \nIf the INS appeal is granted, Mr. Sequeira faces disrupting his bright \nfuture and returning to a country he has not lived in since he was a \nyoung teenager.\n  Leonte Martinez is extensively involved in community service helping \nunderprivileged youths of all nationalities in several church-sponsored \nprograms. He owns his own home and earns $38,000 a year with medical \nbenefits for his entire family. He has been in the United States since \n1986. He is married to a lawful permanent resident, has three children, \ntwo of them U.S. citizens. His mother-in-law, a lawful permanent \nresident, resides with his family. Mr. Martinez was granted suspension \nof deportation in January 1997. According to the immigration judge, his \nwas the best case she had ever heard. Apparently it was not strong \nenough, because INS is appealing in order to be able to deport him.\n  Finally, Roberto Bautista came to the United States 10 years ago from \nEl Salvador. His wife and two children have been in the United States \nfor 12 years. They are a typical upstanding American family. He and his \nwife hold down two jobs, pay their taxes, have no criminal histories, \nhave health insurance, and have never been on public assistance. Their \ndaughter graduated from the University of Miami and is presently \nemployed by a graphic artist for a newspaper. Their son is an honors \nstudent at Georgia Tech, studying engineering, and was awarded the \nSilver Knight award by the Miami Herald for his outstanding volunteer \nservice.\n  These individuals are entitled to have administrative process to make \na judgment as to their ability to remain here in the United States or \nwhether deportation would serve as a particular hardship. That is all \nwe are attempting to do, under the Mack and Graham amendment. We ought \nto have enough respect for individuals and individual rights and \nliberties to treat fairly these families that were subject to \nextraordinary persecution in their own countries during a time of civil \nwar, where many of these individuals were working and supportive of \nU.S. efforts to try to build a better country and democratic \ninstitutions. Because of the fear of terror, the death squads and \nothers that were loose in the land, they came to the United States and \nhave played by the rules. They were given certain assurances that, if \nthey played by the rules, worked hard and supported their families, \nthey would not be summarily dismissed, they would have a judgment that \nwould be made to see whether they had participated in this country and \nmade an important contribution to the life and well-being of this \ncountry.\n\n  I have given you a few examples, and there are scores of other \nexamples, where people are giving back to the United States something \nfor all that has been given to them.\n  I think this is a matter that should be favorably considered.\n  I am very hopeful that we will have the opportunity to vote on this. \nI believe we have overwhelming bipartisan support. I think I see a \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, who is a cosponsor of this measure as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, let me first address the issue the \nSenator from Massachusetts was referring to with respect to deportation \nof immigrants in this country. I am a very strong supporter of the Mack \namendment. I believe people are entitled to due process and the right \nto be heard. Promises were made by many administrations and Congresses. \nThese people were welcomed into this country as a result of the \npolitical strife that was going on in various countries in Latin \nAmerica. I think it would be a true injustice for us to have changed \nthe rules in midstream for many, literally thousands of people who are \nawaiting deportation hearings right now, to deport them in lieu of that \nhearing.\n  So I stand with Senator Mack and Senator Graham from Florida, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Abraham from Michigan in support of the Mack \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10274-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10274-S10277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The subject matter on which I want to spend the \nmajority of my time speaking on is the issue of campaign finance \nreform. As Members have gotten up to discuss the issue, I think one \nmight be led to the impression that those of us who oppose McCain-\nFeingold are not for any changes in campaign finance rules and that we \ndon't see that there are some problems there. I want to make it very \nclear that, as a Senator who is on the Rules Committee, which is the \ncommittee that has the jurisdiction on this subject matter--we have \nbeen bypassed by these floor maneuvers but we do have jurisdiction and \nhave looked into this subject quite extensively--that I don't know of \nanybody on the Rules Committee on either side who does not believe the \ncurrent campaign finance system has some problems with it and there are \nthings that we can do to fix it.\n  We disagree on how to do that. Let me just, if I can, draw the \ndifferences between how one side wants to do it and the other side; \nsort of the big picture, not really talking so much about specifics but \na general philosophy. Then I will get into more specifics.\n  The general philosophy of those of us who oppose the McCain-Feingold \napproach is that we believe that we can fix the campaign finance system \nin this country by making it purely voluntary, so that no one is going \nto be forced to contribute to an election. That is something that you \nwould think is as fundamental as any right that we have in this \ncountry, that you should not be forced by your employer, by your union, \nby your association, or by your family to contribute to anyone the \nresources that you have worked hard to earn. So, one general tenet is \nthat contributing to campaigns must be completely voluntary. I think \nthat is a tenet you would suspect would be universally shared. It is \nnot universally shared. People in support of McCain-Feingold, by and \nlarge--there are some exceptions, but few--do not support the concept \nthat campaign contributions should be voluntary. That is one \ndifference.\n  Second, that we achieve a better campaign system, a better campaign \nand a better campaign financing system, by increasing participation, by \nhaving more voices in the political discourse, not fewer. Those of us \nwho oppose McCain-Feingold strongly hold to that reading of the first \namendment that ensures, guarantees, one of the highest guarantees in \nthe Constitution, the right of speech, political speech, and political \ndiscourse.\n  In this country today, political speech does not mean--it means this, \nwhat I am doing. But it does not only mean standing up on the street \ncorner and sounding off on what you believe in. These days, if you are \nstanding on the street corner sounding off on what you believe in, \nbasically you are labeled some sort of freak. We believe the first \namendment covers organized political speech, that is, people who ban \ntogether, who want to speak on a particular issue and marshal whatever \nresources they have, whether it is resources in manpower to distribute \nfliers that they print at a half a cent apiece, or to buy a radio ad on \na local radio station or to, in fact, hold public meetings and public \ndebates. Whatever medium they want to use, I think is appropriate to be \nprotected by the Congress and by the first amendment.\n  On the other side, you have people who want to limit that activity. \nThey want to limit people's ability to speak in the political arena \nbecause they find certain kinds of speech offensive, like people who \nadvertise in opposition to a Member of Congress or a Senator saying \nthat they voted in such a bad way and don't vote for them, and they do \nit within 60 days of the election; that is bad; somehow people getting \ntogether and expressing their opinion in a public forum is a bad thing \nthat has to be prohibited by the Congress.\n  I don't believe that. I don't like it when someone does it to me, and \nit's been done to me and it will be done to me unless we pass one of \nthese bills that says you can't. By the way, even if we did do that, I \nbelieve the Supreme Court would strike it down in a heartbeat. But I \nbelieve it will be done again.\n  I don't have a problem with it, even though it happens to me, because \nI think people have a right if they don't like what I am doing to speak \nup about it, even if I think the attack is unfair, because I trust the \nAmerican public. I know a lot of people around here on a pretty regular \nbasis don't trust the American public, but I trust the American public \nand the voters of America to sort of figure out all of those things on \ntheir own with the help of all the other information that they are \ngoing to get from networks like C-SPAN2, as we are on today, and other \nindependent sources, that that ad, as nasty as it is, as horrible as it \nis, is not going to change somebody's opinion overnight. People are \nsmart enough to take all that information, realize it is an ad, \ndiscount it to the degree they usually do and filter it into the mix, \nas we do with all speech.\n  But the other side believes that it is dangerous speech. I believe \nthat there is nothing inherently dangerous about speech; there is \nsomething inherently dangerous about limiting speech, because once we \nstart to limit speech, then that takes freedom away from the masses, \nfrom the people and gives that freedom and control to a bunch of people \nin Washington, DC, who think they know what is best for you.\n  You probably hear many Senators talk in those terms when it comes to \na variety of other subjects in Washington, DC. I suggest that this \nattempt to take power away and freedom away from people and centralize \nit in Washington is consistent with what the other side of the aisle \ngenerally wants to do when it comes to every decision in your life. As \na result, we have the huge Government that we have in Washington, DC. \nWe have grown and grown and grown because we have taken more and more \nfreedom away from people, whether it is in the form of freedom to use \nthe money that you have earned by higher and higher taxes, or whether \nit is freedom in the form of regulation on regulation on every aspect \nof business and your life.\n  We have taken that responsibility, we have taken your freedom and \nhave centralized that decisionmaking in Washington, DC. This is another \nattempt to do that. This has the salutary effect, from those who \nbelieve in big government, of stifling your criticism of big \ngovernment. This is a win-win. This allows them to continue to grow \ngovernment without you being able to speak out against it. So they can \nstifle you at the same time they continue what they want to do in the \nfirst place. I think that is very, very, very dangerous to the future \nof this country.\n  Columnist George Will called the filibuster--I don't know whether \nthat is what it is or not, but let's use that\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\nterm--that the filibuster of the McCain-Feingold finance reform is the \nmost important filibuster in the history of America. I don't know if I \nagree with that, but I would say it is certainly one of the most \nimportant because it goes to the heart of our democracy, it goes to the \nheart of the political discourse in this country and how free are we \ngoing to allow this country to be at its most fundamental core, its \ndemocratic core. How free are we going to allow you to be, the average \ncitizen in America?\n  There are those who say, ``Well, you are just too free right now and \nyou have too much power right now. We need to take some of that back \nfor your own good. For your own good we're going to take some power \naway from you so you don't go out and do things that are going to hurt \nyou.''\n  My, my, and believe it or not, you have the national news media just \nalong for the ride. They think this is great. And why not? Because if \nwe limit your speech, the speech of those who are speaking everyday on \nthe network news and in the newspapers and on the radios becomes that \nmuch louder, because the din of your speech has quieted down, and so \ntheir speech becomes much more important to the whole debate. You have \nthe media very much for squelching other input, so they become much \nmore powerful and much more important in the political discourse.\n  I suggest that if Congress were proposing a law to limit the amount \nof speech that newspapers and radios and television reporters can \nspeak, there would be an absolute hue and cry of ``freedom of the \npress''; ``How dare you restrict''; ``It is the most essential element \nof our democracy.'' ``The first amendment''-- ``Oh, I'm sorry, just \nthis part of the first amendment,'' because when it comes to the other \npart of the first amendment, they are all for shutting you up. They \nwant to shut you up, but they don't want to be even in the least \ninfringed upon. That is the hypocrisy that is going on in the national \nmedia today.\n  Let's get down to the bottom line here. What do those of us who would \nlike to see campaign finance reform see as a solution to some of the \nproblems?\n  No. 1, I suggest we make sure the system is voluntary; that there \nshould not be a system where any individual in America is forced to \ncontribute against their will. That is not the law of the land today. \nThere are tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, maybe \nmillions, of workers in this country who are forced to contribute money \nto campaigns in which they do not believe. That should be an \nembarrassment to every single Member of the Senate and should be an \noutrage to every member of our society. When it comes to union dues \nbeing used for political purposes, that is exactly what occurs. So we \nhave a very simple provision that says you can't do that anymore, it \nhas to be voluntary.\n  Poll union members--not the union bosses, union members--and ask them \nwhether they would like the right to be able to give money voluntarily \ninstead of having it taken out of their dues. By overwhelming numbers--\nI just saw a poll in California--by a 4 to 1 margin, union members \nthemselves said they want that choice.\n  Yet--and I always find this really funny because people for McCain-\nFeingold say, ``well, we have to fight the special interests; it's the \nspecial interests that are the problem.'' Then they stand up here and \nfight against a bill that says all contributions should be voluntary. \nWhy? Because the unions and their big money backing them in their \ncampaigns won't allow them to do what's right. This just exposes it for \nwhat it is. This is about power. They just want to make sure that they \ncan keep all the money funneling toward them, and then go about taking \naway power from you. Keep the money flowing on that side and then take \nthe power away from you.\n\n  I don't necessarily think that is the right approach to take. When it \ncomes to union dues being used involuntarily for political campaigns--\nthere is absolutely no excuse for not having the voluntary campaign \nfinance system. That should be at the fundamental core. The only reason \nit is not is because of the special interests supporting the other side \nof the aisle, the special interests that they get up and rail against: \n``Oh, this is horrible; special interest money and, by the way, we're \ngoing to stop campaign finance reform because of the special interest \nmoney we get from involuntary contributions being maced out of the \npeople who work in unions. Maced is actually too kind of a word because \nsome people get maced when they don't go along, because they have no \nchoice. It is not a matter of being maced and losing your job. You just \nhave to go along. You can't even say no.\n  So No. 1, it has to be a voluntary system.\n  No. 2, a goal of a campaign finance system should be to increase \nparticipation by the people who are most affected by the election, and \nthat is your constituents. The goal of the bill that I am going to be \nintroducing is to increase the amount of influence--I use that term \nadvisedly--influence that constituents within the State in which you \nreside, such as my State of Pennsylvania, to influence the election \ndisproportionate from anybody else, whether they be political action \ncommittees or people from California--I like people from California but \nthey are not from Pennsylvania and, frankly, the people from \nPennsylvania should have more of a say who the Senator is from \nPennsylvania than the people from Washington State, Maine or anyplace \nelse.\n  What I have suggested in my bill is we are going to increase the \namount of contributions that can be given by people in Pennsylvania. \nThe proposal that I have is to take the $1,000 limit and increase it to \n$4,000 per individual per election for people who reside in the State \nin which you run. Everybody else is kept at the $1,000 limit. But \npeople in your State are going to have more of an ability to \ncontribute.\n  I know, because I was a challenger twice. I am a rare breed of cat \naround this place. I defeated an incumbent Congressman to get into the \nHouse and defeated an incumbent Senator to get into the Senate. There \nare not very many of us around who have that honor, I guess, or burden, \none of the two. So I know what it is like to be a challenger. I know \nwhat it is like to be the big underdog. I know what it is like to be \noutspent 3 to 1, and I didn't like it.\n  But I will tell you what I didn't like more than anything else. I \ndidn't like the fact that my opponent, who was a sitting Congressman, \nhad the ability to raise money all over the country. Because of being \nin Congress, he had connections. He could raise money from all over the \nplace. He was known, not only all over the country, but all over the \nState. Nobody knew who I was.\n  I remember when I first ran for office, they took a poll 6 months \nbefore the election in 1990, and my name recognition in my district was \n6 percent. I thought that was pretty great; ``Yea, it is 6 percent.'' \nThen my pollster informed me that usually when they put somebody's name \non the ballot, they get about 8 percent, because about 8 percent of the \npeople are afraid to answer that they don't know the person, figuring \nif they were on the survey, they should know the person. So I got below \nwhat Mickey Mouse would get. Nobody knew me.\n  It was hard for me to raise money. I didn't have any money. And it \nwas harder only because I could raise $1,000 at a time. If I was lucky \nenough to find someone who would support me who had any kind of \nresources, all I could get was $1,000. That makes it very, very hard \nfor a challenger. You have to find a lot of people to help you, to get \nat least a bit of seed corn to build a campaign organization.\n  There was a comment from a person who was going to run for the U.S. \nSenate in Pennsylvania next year. She was headed toward running, but \nshe announced abruptly she was not going to run. The reason she gave \nfor not running was that she found it incredibly hard to find so many \npeople to give her $1,000 at a time. She just couldn't find that many \npeople to build up the seed corn necessary to start a campaign. Once \nyou start a campaign, you can broaden out your search, you can get, as \nI have done--I have 35,000 donors, I believe, to my committee. And that \nis a lot of donors. I am very proud of that.\n\n  The average contribution is well under $100. But you have to get to \nthere. And it takes time. It takes some money to start. Unless you are \na millionaire, which I plead guilty of not\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\nbeing, then it is very difficult for the average Joe Citizen to get \nenough resources together to start a campaign when you have to raise it \n$1,000 at a time.\n  When you consider the fact that in a Senate race in Pennsylvania it \nis going to cost about probably $9 or $10 million, someone giving you \n$4,000 hardly warrants notice in the big scheme of things.\n  So to suggest that somehow, you know, this person has inordinate \ninfluence is ridiculous. And you are going to get hundreds of people to \ngive you that kind of money. I guarantee you, within those hundreds of \npeople there will be hundreds of different opinions on probably the \nsame issue. So to suggest you are going to do one for one--it just \ndoesn't work that way.\n  Anybody who believes--this is another fallacy of campaign financing--\nthat Members of Congress get donations to do favors for people, I mean, \nthat is just ridiculous. I mean, it is absolutely absurd. And that is \nwhy I am for limits on contributions, and I am for low limits. I think \n$4,000 is a low limit because I don't want someone to be able to give \n$100,000 or $200,000 or $500,000 because then, whether it occurs or \nnot, the appearance of impropriety is there. With a small donation, \nrelatively small, I am talking in terms of a $10 million campaign, \n$4,000 does not, I think, stick out to say they are buying a more \ndisproportionate interest here.\n  The fact of the matter is, we have low limits. I think we should keep \nthem relatively low, but they should be high enough so people can have \nsome ability to form a little bit of seed corn to start a campaign if \nthey want to run for office. So I believe that raising the limit, oddly \nenough, would help challengers and open-seat candidates more than it \nwill help incumbents.\n  Incumbents can raise money now. They are one of the few who can raise \nmoney now. This is to help challengers. The other thing--follow me on \nthis concept--what I believe has happened over the past 25 years and \nwhy campaign reform has come to be such a ``scandal,'' although I think \nit is a somewhat created scandal in some respects; in many respects it \nis a scandal because people are breaking the laws--is what we did in \n1974. It was well-intentioned. It was to limit the influence of special \ninterests and limit the influence of big donors. Remember, $1,000 was \nset in 1974. If you index that to inflation, it would be over $3,000 \ntoday. That is why we increase it from $1,000 to $4,000. And campaigns \nhave increased by 10 or 20 times as far as expenses since 1974.\n  What we have done--if I can give an example of a heart--you have a \nmain artery that flows into the heart that provides the blood for the \nheart muscle so the heart can pump. What we did in 1974 was we occluded \npartially, we blocked that artery. We said, we are no longer going to \nallow a free flow of resources, blood, into the heart muscle, the \ncandidate; we are going to block it.\n  It was an artificial block. It was artificial in the sense that the \nheart still needed the resources, but you have limited the ability for \ndirect resources to flow into that heart.\n  If you are lucky, what happens if you are a human being and that \nhappens? What happens is, you build up what is called collateral \ncirculation, other circulation to feed the heart, to keep it alive and \ngoing and working.\n  Collateral circulation in politics is called soft money. By limiting \nthe amount that you or anybody can give directly to a candidate, you \nhave not stopped the need for the money to get to the candidate; all \nyou have done is stop the main, most efficient, most disclosed, most \napparent way of feeding that heart muscle, of feeding that candidate.\n  So what has happened is the money still wants to get there because \nthe candidate needs it to run a race, and so what has happened is these \ncollateral sources have been built up. We have built up all these soft \nmoney trees to feed the candidate behind the scenes, undisclosed or \ndisclosed not as efficiently or not as readily as the direct pipeline \nto the heart or to the candidate.\n  So what I want to do is do a little angioplasty. Let us clear out the \nheart artery to allow some more resources and blood to flow so you can \nwatch it. What I propose in my bill is to require monthly reporting--\nnot quarterly, but monthly. Let us have more disclosure. Let us have \nmore prompt disclosure. Let us find out who is giving the money and how \nmuch they are giving.\n  So we have, by doing that, and by raising the limits of people who \nlive in the State, you will reduce the need for this other circulation \nfor this other money to come into the system.\n  I think the best way to cure soft money is not Government to restrict \nit because, you know, we restricted hard money, that money, that direct \npipeline, that main artery going into the campaign, we restricted it, \nand what happened? They figured out another way, constitutionally \nanother way. We try to restrict that, and guess what will happen? They \nwill figure out some other way. I mean, look, the big problem here is \nthat Government is too big, it spends too much, and it regulates too \nmuch. It is involved in everything. We have this huge Government that \npeople want to have some say in how the Government governs. They want \nto have some say in who is elected to make those decisions. And they \nhave every right to do so.\n  What the folks who are for McCain-Feingold say is, ``Well, we don't \nwant you to have that right. We want to limit your right to do that.'' \nI think that is ridiculous. I think that is, frankly, undemocratic, \ncertainly undemocratic, and I will go as far as to say it is un-\nAmerican. We are a country that fought hard, we fought wars, we fought \na Revolutionary War and many others to maintain our freedom. And first \namong them--the first amendment--first among them is the freedom of \nspeech.\n  What this debate is fundamentally about is the freedom of political \ndiscourse, of your right to influence the course of an election, and, \ntherefore, the course of the country. It is your only chance. This is a \nRepublic, not a democracy. We are not all gathered here in the Senate--\nwe do not get all 250 million people in the room and everybody says \n``aye'' and ``no.'' That is not how we do things. You elect me for \nbetter or for worse. You elect a Member of the Senate, two Members in \nthe Senate from each State, and however many House Members you have, \nand those people represent you.\n  If you want to be represented here, you have to work through the \nelectoral process to influence the decision as to what Member of \nCongress is elected and what Senator is elected. That is your outlet. \nWhat the people in this room, many who are for McCain-Feingold, want to \ndo is limit the people's ability to impact that election. When I say \n``people,'' I don't just mean individuals, but associations and others \nwho have every right under the first amendment to be heard.\n\n  So when you hear all this talk about, ``Oh, special interests,'' \nremember one thing, the biggest special interest that is holding up \nthis bill is labor unions who do not want voluntary contributions to be \nthe law of the land. That is No. 1. So anytime you hear ``special \ninterests'' from people who support McCain-Feingold, ask this question: \n``Are you for voluntary contributions for every member of society?'' \nWhen they say, ``No,'' then you say, ``Don't talk to me about special \ninterest because I know what special interest is buying you. So don't \ntalk to me about, `Oh, we need to get rid of special interests when \nyour first vote is to defend it and to exhibit the power.' ''\n  Voluntary contributions, increased participation, particularly from \npeople who are within the boundaries of the district or your State, and \nincreased disclosure. It is much easier for the cardiologist to be able \nto find a problem with the flow of blood to the heart by looking at one \nsource where it is supposed to be. It is much easier to determine where \nthe problem is than looking at all the other different sources that may \nbe feeding that heart.\n  So if we allow the resources to be channeled, and we have disclosure \nof those resources promptly--monthly--then you are going to have a \nsystem that I think everyone will be proud of that will encourage \nparticipation, that will be voluntary, and that will be disclosed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, I want to speak today about the \nindependent counsel law and the political pressure being put on the \nAttorney General to appoint an independent counsel in the campaign \nfundraising investigation.\n  One Member has called on the Attorney General to resign. Some Members \nof the House are threatening impeachment proceedings against the \nAttorney General unless she reaches their conclusion on the appointment \nof an independent counsel.\n  For 18 years I served as either the chairman or ranking Democrat on \nthe subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee with \njurisdiction over the independent counsel law. I have been actively \ninvolved in three reauthorizations of this important statute. And \nhaving experienced and studied the history of this law, I am deeply \ndisturbed by this type of pressure being exerted.\n  Politically motivated attempts to intimidate the Attorney General \nruns directly counter to the fundamental purpose of the independent \ncounsel law and counter to our constitutional system that makes the \nprosecution of crimes the sole responsibility of the executive branch.\n  The independent counsel law was enacted in the aftermath of \nWatergate. The Watergate committee recommended, and the Congress \nagreed, that we need a process by which criminal investigations of our \ntop Government officials should be conducted in an independent manner \nas free as possible from any taint of favoritism or politics.\n  This was necessary, we decided, in order to maintain the public's \nconfidence in one of the basic principles of our democracy, that this \nis a country that follows the rule of law. So we established a process \nwhereby the Attorney General would follow certain established \nprocedures in reviewing allegations of criminal wrongdoing by top \nGovernment officials and decide at certain stages whether to ask a \nspecial Federal court to appoint a person from the private sector to \nbecome a Government employee to take over the investigation and conduct \nit independently from the chain of command at the Department of \nJustice.\n  We wanted the public to have confidence that the investigations into \nalleged criminal conduct by top Government officials were no less \naggressive and no more aggressive than similar investigations of \naverage citizens. We particularly wanted to remove partisanship from \nthe investigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking process.\n  We established the requirement that if the Attorney General receives \nspecific information from a credible source that a crime may have been \ncommitted by certain enumerated top Government officials, the Attorney \nGeneral has to conduct a threshold inquiry lasting no more than 30 days \nto determine if the allegation is frivolous or a potential legal \nproblem. The top officials who trigger this so-called mandatory \nprovision of the act are the President, the Vice President, Cabinet \nSecretaries, Deputy Secretaries of the executive branch departments, \nplus very top White House officials who are paid a salary at least as \nhigh as Cabinet Secretaries or Deputy Secretaries and the chairman and \ntreasurer or other top officials of the President's campaign committee.\n  If, after the threshold inquiry, the Attorney General determines that \nthere is specific information from a credible source that a crime may \nhave been committed by a covered official, the Attorney General must \nthen conduct a preliminary investigation lasting no more than 90 days \nin which she gathers evidence to determine whether further \ninvestigation is warranted. If after the conclusion of the 90-day \nperiod the Attorney General determines that further investigation is \nwarranted with respect to a covered official, then she must seek the \nappointment of an independent counsel from the special court made up of \nthree article III judges appointed for 2-year terms by the Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court.\n  In crafting the independent counsel law, we contemplated a role for \nCongress with respect to the appointment of an independent counsel in a \nspecific case. We included a provision that is tailored to the purposes \nof the statute. The independent counsel law explicitly provides that \nthe appropriate avenue for congressional comment on the appointment of \nan independent counsel is through action of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The law provides that either a majority of the majority party or a \nmajority of the minority party of the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee may request the Attorney General to appoint an independent \ncounsel.\n  Upon receipt of such a letter, the law provides that the Attorney \nGeneral must respond in writing to the authors of the letter explaining \n``whether the Attorney General has begun or will begin a preliminary \ninvestigation'' under the independent counsel law, setting forth ``the \nreasons for the Attorney General's decision regarding such preliminary \ninvestigation as it relates to each of the matters with respect to \nwhich the congressional request is made. If there is such a preliminary \ninvestigation, the report shall include the date on which the \npreliminary investigation began or will begin.''\n  The Attorney General is not obligated to trigger the statute when she \nreceives such a letter. She is not required to initiate a threshold \ninquiry or conduct a preliminary investigation. She is only required to \nrespond within 30 days. That is the process that we provided for in the \nindependent counsel law for Congress to express an opinion in \ntriggering the statute. That is how the procedure works.\n  The Attorney General has the sole discretion to determine if the \nstatute is triggered and if an independent counsel should be appointed. \nThat is a constitutional requisite of the statute, and without that \ndiscretion, the Supreme Court has said that the separation of powers \nprinciple is violated. Congress has the very specific way I indicated \nto express its opinion on the subject to the Attorney General. In the \nlast analysis, as our chief law enforcement officer, it is her decision \nalone to make.\n  While the independent counsel law was designed to make sure that a \ncovered official doesn't get preferential treatment with respect to a \ncriminal investigation, equally important was the concern that the \nofficial not suffer worse treatment or a selective process prosecution \nthat would not be applied to an ordinary citizen. In the din \nsurrounding these calls for the Attorney General to seek the \nappointment of an independent counsel, that very important feature has \nbeen lost.\n  In 1981, our subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the independent \ncounsel law held the first oversight hearings on its implementation. We \nhad a number of knowledgeable witnesses, and we had several years of \nexperience with the statute to review.\n  One of the cases that the subcommittee reviewed at the time was the \ncase of Hamilton Jordan and Tim Kraft, top White House officials in the \nCarter administration, who were accused of using a controlled substance \nat a party in violation of the criminal code. Then Attorney General \nBenjamin Civiletti testified at the time that under ordinary \ncircumstances the Department of Justice, exercising its discretion on \nwhen to prosecute, would not generally prosecute a case such as that \nagainst a regular citizen even though there might have been a \nviolation. But because the law at the time didn't permit the Attorney \nGeneral to consider prosecutorial policies of the Department in \ndeciding whether or not to seek appointment of an independent counsel, \nthe Attorney General felt obligated to seek appointment of independent \ncounsels in those two cases.\n  Here is what then Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti told our \nsubcommittee in 1981 about this decision:\n\n       In normal circumstances, the Department does not \n     investigate or prosecute every possible felony or every \n     possible fact, or circumstance that comes to its attention. \n     Historically, and within the law, it exercises\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\n     discretion. It stays its hand in individual cases, not for \n     the purpose of advancing or threatening personal interests, \n     but for the purpose of doing justice and advancing the common \n     good.\n       This discretion is one of the great prerogatives that \n     devolves upon the Department of Justice and the Executive \n     under the common law. It is enormously important, and it is \n     honored every day in every U.S. attorney's office in \n     tradition and in practice.\n       Any discretionary power, of course, can be abused. And if \n     the Department's investigatorial and prosecutorial discretion \n     should be exercised capriciously or irregularly, it would \n     threaten and not advance the interests that it is designed to \n     serve.\n       For that reason, over the years we have developed \n     guidelines that structure and restrain the exercise of our \n     discretion in individual cases, thereby introducing a measure \n     of principle and regularity into a sensitive and subjective \n     process.\n\n  Attorney General Civiletti went on to say the following:\n\n       In some instances these guidelines take the form of \n     explicitly written standards concerning specific statutes and \n     specific kind of offenses and procedures. In other instances \n     they are unwritten understandings or policies that are \n     followed within the Department.\n       What's the point of the reference to regularity if the \n     purpose of the special prosecutor provisions is to ensure \n     that the high officers in the Government will receive an \n     impartial treatment at the hands of the Department of \n     Justice?\n\n  His answer:\n\n       I am not sure that the statute goes as far as it might to \n     accomplish that objective because the special prosecutor is \n     given the freedom to disregard the standards, the limits, the \n     discretionary judgments that have been entered over the last \n     100 years in the Department of Justice, and set about on his \n     own course, which for each special prosecutor could be \n     entirely different under different standards and promote \n     great misfortune to the subject of the particular \n     investigation.''\n\n  Now, in light of Attorney General Civiletti's testimony, the \nsubcommittee decided to amend the independent counsel law to require--\nand it is a requirement; it is not discretionary--to require that the \nAttorney General follow policies of the Department of Justice relative \nto the question of whether to prosecute a case even where evidence of a \nviolation may exist.\n  We concluded that it was important to not let the independent counsel \nlaw be used as a weapon to punish a top official who would not \notherwise be subject to prosecution if he were a regular citizen. \nSenator Cohen, with whom I cosponsored the 1982 reforms, and I were \nboth clear that the purpose of the independent counsel law is to \nprovide for criminal investigation of a top government official in a \nmanner no better and no worse than anybody else.\n  We are not just talking about the written policies of the Department \nof Justice. Congress specifically rejected that limitation and included \nlanguage in the statute requiring the Attorney General to follow both \nthe written and unwritten policies of the Department of Justice.\n  Section 592(c)1 of the independent law reads as follows:\n\n       In determining under this chapter whether reasonable \n     grounds exist to warrant further investigation, the Attorney \n     General shall comply with the written or other established \n     policies of the Department of Justice with respect to the \n     conduct of criminal investigations.\n\n  So we have an independent counsel statute where the Attorney General \nhas the sole discretion whether to seek appointment of an independent \ncounsel, but she has no discretion whether to apply the Department of \nJustice policies in making that decision. She must do so.\n  Now, what is the Justice Department's policy with respect to what has \nbecome the primary allegation against the President and Vice \nPresident--making fundraising phone calls out of the White House? It is \nalleged by some that the conduct falls under an obscure statute, 18 USC \n607, which makes it unlawful for a person to solicit or receive a \ncontribution, as defined by the Federal Election Campaign Act, in any \nFederal room or building. Here is what the statute says:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive \n     any contribution within the meaning [of the Federal Election \n     Act] in any room or building occupied in the discharge of \n     official duties by any [Federal employee] or in any navy \n     yard, fort or arsenal.\n\n  This statute has several elements, and I would like to discuss the \nkey elements. The first element is whether there are certain \nrequirements with respect to the solicitor of the contribution referred \nto in the statute and with respect to the person being solicited. As \nmany commentators and legal experts have noted, this law was enacted to \nprotect Federal employees from political pressure by their fellow \nworkers and bosses. It was part of the Pendleton Act, which was a major \neffort in reforming the civil service system enacted in the late \n1800's. It is directed at preventing a Federal employee from being \npressured at work to make a political contribution, at preventing a \nsort of ``shake-down'' by a Federal employees' superiors. And it is \nplaced in the part of the United States Code that addresses what \nFederal employees can and cannot do.\n  So, some have argued that either the solicitor is required to be a \nFederal employee or the person being solicited is required to be a \nFederal employee, or both. Some have argued that in order to cover the \nPresident and Vice President or Members of Congress, they would have to \nbe specifically mentioned. That is an ambiguity that the Watergate \nSpecial Prosecution Force wrestled with when it recommended in the \n1970's that Congress amend the statute ``to clarify the question of \nits applicability to elected as well as appointed officials.'' We \ndidn't take them up on their suggestion, by the way, so that question \nhas never been answered specifically in the law.\n\n  The Justice Department's prosecution manual on prosecuting under \nsection 607 apparently tried to answer this question, since it now says \nthat ``The employment status of the parties to the solicitation is \nimmaterial; it is the employment status of the persons who routinely \noccupy the area where the solicitation occurs that determines whether \nsection 607 applies.'' Yet, the discussion of section 607 in the manual \nstill refers to section 607 under the title ``Patronage Crimes.''\n  But following these most recent guidelines by the Justice Department, \nit seems most likely that the statute could apply to private persons as \nwell as Federal employees and to Members of Congress and the President \nand the Vice President as well as appointed officials, whether they are \nthe ones making the solicitation or the ones being solicited. But there \nis still some uncertainty about this.\n  The next element of the statute is clear. It relates to the \nsolicitation or receipt of a campaign contribution. And the question \nhere is where and when does a solicitation occur. Does it occur when \nthe request is made or when the request is received? There is a Supreme \nCourt case on this very issue which concludes that the solicitation \noccurs when and where the solicitation is received. In the 1908 case of \nU.S. versus Thayer, the Supreme Court considered a solicitation \nconducted through the mail. The Court had to decide whether the \nsolicitation occurred at the place the soliciting person mailed the \nletter or where the solicitation was received. The Court held, in an \nopinion written by Justice Holmes, that the solicitation occurred where \nthe employee received the letter, which was his place of work. By \nanalogy, then, with respect to a phone call, the solicitation would \noccur not from where the call is made but where the call is received.\n  The solicitation addressed by this statute has to occur where Federal \nemployees are carrying out their official duties. That is what the \npurpose of the statute is. Section 607 says the solicitation has to \noccur ``in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official \nduties by any person'' mentioned in section 603, which means, by \nFederal employees. We recognize this purpose in the Senate when we \ndescribed this law in our own Senate Ethics Manual. The September 1996 \nSenate Ethics Manual says:\n\n       The criminal prohibition at section 607 was originally \n     intended and was historically construed to prohibit anyone \n     from soliciting contributions from federal clerks or \n     employees while such persons were in a federal building. In \n     interpretations of this provision, the focus of the \n     prohibition has been directed to the location of the \n     individual from whom a contribution was requested, rather \n     than the location from which the solicitation had originated. \n     . . The Department of Justice has noted that the statute was \n     intended to fill a gap in protecting federal employees from \n     assessment by prohibiting all persons from soliciting such \n     employees while they are in a federal building.\n\n  In the 1954 case of United States versus Burleson, the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Tennessee\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\nthrew out a case brought under section 670 because the court determined \nthat the elements of the statute had not been met since Federal \nemployees were solicited at the facility of a Federal contractor, not \non Federal property. That, the court said, was dispositive of the case.\n  The Department of Justice has adopted this approach as part of its \nprosecutorial policy with respect to this statute. As the American Law \nDivision and the Congressional Research Service concluded in its report \non section 607 in March of this year:\n\n       There is no indication from reported cases or Department of \n     Justice material on the statute that there has ever been \n     enforcement of the statute, in the more than 100 years of its \n     existence, in such a manner as to suggest an interpretation \n     of the law as applying to solicitations made by mail or \n     telephone from a federal building to someone not in a federal \n     building.\n\n  Now, that is our own Congressional Research Service saying that the \npolicy of the Department of Justice is to not bring a section 607 case \nunless the person being solicited is located at a Federal workplace.\n  A third element of section 607 which has been the subject of \ndiscussion is the requirement that the solicitation referred to in the \nstatute be a so-called hard money contribution, a contribution covered \nby the Federal Election Campaign Act, and not a soft money \ncontribution, a contribution outside of the legal limits of our Federal \ncampaign laws.\n  Ever since the Attorney General referred to this issue in her letter \nto the Judiciary Committee, commentators and Members have been working \nmightily to show that the Vice President was actually raising hard \nmoney, and thus covered by the statute, and not just soft money, which \nothers have claimed was the case.\n  Now, it is hard to imagine that the Vice President thought he was \nraising hard dollars since the amounts of the solicitation were for far \nmore than the limits for hard money. But even if one could show the \nintent to solicit hard money contributions, it would seem that the \nsecond hurdle to prosecution would be controlling. The Department of \nJustice has simply not prosecuted conduct where the person being \nsolicited is not on Federal property at the time of the solicitation. \nThe issue of whether the solicited money ended up in a hard money or \nsoft money account would not even need to be addressed under the facts \nas we know them.\n\n  Parenthetically, if the hard money/soft money distinction were \ncontrolled, look at what some of us would be seeking to enforce--a \nstatute that makes it a crime for a person to solicit $1 for his or her \ncampaign, but makes it perfectly legal for that same person to solicit \na million dollars or more from that same person for a political party \nwhich is totally committed to his or her election and will not only \nspend the money raised, but might even go into debt for that purpose. \nNow, that is an absurd interpretation that some Members of Congress are \nnot only trying to uphold but, indeed, say is required.\n  Because the Attorney General raised this issue in her letter to \ncongressional leaders about triggering the Independent Counsel Act, she \nshould make clear what the policy of the Department of Justice is with \nrespect to that, as well as the other elements of this possible crime.\n  Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova was straightforward in his \nassessment of how the Department of Justice should handle possible \nprosecution of the President or Vice President under section 607 when \nhe said on a recent television show that no prosecutor in his or her \nright mind would bring a prosecution for those phone calls under this \nstatute with the facts as we know them regarding the President and the \nVice President. Other commentators have made similar arguments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following columns be printed in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks: Articles by Richard Cohen, \nE.J. Dionne, Jr., Philip Heyman, and William Raspberry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we take these elements and apply them to the case of \nthe President or Vice President making phone calls from the White \nHouse, it becomes clear to me that the facts do not fit the statute.\n  Any phone calls they may have made, would have been solicitations \nmade at the place where the person being called was located. We know \nthat from the Supreme Court's decision in U.S. versus Thayer. And we \nknow for section 607 to apply, that location has to be a location where \nFederal employees are performing their official duties.\n  In applying the prosecutorial policy and practice of the Department \nof Justice in this case, with respect to this law, the Attorney \nGeneral, may well and properly find that she would not prosecute a \nnoncovered official under these facts. If so, she is not allowed by law \nto seek the appointment of an independent counsel.\n  Madam President, the pressure being put upon the Attorney General to \nappoint an independent counsel is undermining the basic principle of \nthis law and the nonpartisan spirit which has been so important to its \noperation. The effort to shoehorn the conduct of the President and Vice \nPresident into the prohibitions of an arcane law, never used under \nsimilar circumstances, violates our understanding of the criminal \njustice system--just as it would if cases had been brought against \nSenators who have already made similar calls from their Senate offices.\n  One Senator was reported in the Wall Street Journal several years ago \nas saying he ``figures he spends two hours a day dialing for cash from \nhis Washington home, his car, and his mobile phone;'' he says he can \neven place calls from his Senate office. ``I do it wherever I am,'' the \nSenator is quoted as saying. ``I can use a credit card. * * * As long \nas I pay for the calls, I can make calls wherever I want to call.''\n  Another of our colleagues was reported, when phoning to remind \npotential donors of a fundraiser, to have left a recorded message on an \nanswering machine to call him at his Senate office for more \ninformation.\n  And, a third Senator's signature appeared on a solicitation letter in \nwhich potential contributors were invited to call his Senate office \nwith questions about the fundraising solicitation. Have these Members \nbeen criminally prosecuted for a violation of section 607? No. Should \nthey have been? No. The judgment of the Attorney General not to \nprosecute in these visible cases is further evidence that there has not \nbeen a policy to prosecute under section 607 when a solicitation is \nmade to a person not on Federal property when solicited.\n  When President Reagan was in the White House, he called the \nRepublican Eagles who were meeting in a Government building--the \nauditorium at the Commerce Department. The President called and among \nhis remarks, he said the following:\n\n       I am genuinely sorry I couldn't be there in person with you \n     today. . . . but we have the Eagles down to the White House \n     quite often so I will be seeing you soon. In the meantime I'm \n     sending Secretary Schultz, Secretary Regan and other members \n     of the Cabinet over to keep you abreast of what's going on. \n     In fact you will be seeing more of my Cabinet today than I \n     will. . . . Let me say to you Eagles how important your \n     contributions are to the Republican Party. . . . [T]o keep a \n     lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it. You there \n     today help to keep the light of the Republican Party burning \n     brightly.\n\n  That call was made 15 years ago in September 1982. And here, with \nthis call, the persons being urged on were actually in a Federal \nbuilding--just what section 607 seems to cover. And it's very likely \nthat the contributions referred to were hard money contributions. But \nshould there have been an independent counsel appointed to investigate \nPresident Reagan to determine whether or not he violated section 607? \nNo--it shouldn't have happened then and shouldn't happen now. But where \nwere the threats, where was the orchestrated chorus then?\n  If we don't want our President or Vice President making fundraising \ncalls, then we should pass a law to that effect and make it explicit. \nIf its OK for them to make them from their taxpayer subsidized home or \ncars but not from their offices, then make it clear in the law. I \nquestion whether we really want criminality to hinge on whether the \nPresident makes a fundraising call from the Oval Office or from his \nupstairs office in the family section at the White House or from his \ncar or from the phone booth on the corner? I, for one, would rather the \nPresident or Vice President not make fundraising\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\ncalls, period. That's what we intended when we enacted public financing \nof our Presidential campaigns--but the soft money loophole changed all \nthat. We've got to fix that. We should eliminate the soft money \nloophole--not utilize an ambiguity surrounded by a technicality to push \nthe President or Vice President into an independent counsel \ninvestigation as if it is intended to be some form of punishment. The \nindependent counsel process was never intended to be used this way.\n  Madam President, the Attorney General has a job to do. It has been \ngiven to her by the Constitution and the independent counsel law. She \nis now required to act to the best of her ability to follow the law--to \nconduct a thorough criminal investigation of all of the allegations; to \nfollow the evidence wherever it leads; to follow the requirements of \nthe independent counsel law--and this has too often been forgotten--\nincluding the requirement that she follow Justice Department \ndiscretionary policies about whether to prosecute when deciding whether \nto seek an independent counsel.\n  The political pressure on the Attorney General does a disservice to \nthe Nation which is awaiting an objective and fair review. The \npolitical pressure on the Attorney General undermines the independent \ncounsel law, which is dependent upon an application free from partisan \npressure. If she finds that the criteria for triggering the independent \ncounsel law has been met and that the Justice Department practice has \nbeen to prosecute in a case similar to this, so be it. But if she finds \nthe criteria haven't been met, or if she finds that there has not been \na policy of prosecution under section 607, so be it.\n  If those calling for an independent counsel want the Attorney General \nto follow the letter of the law with respect to section 607 because \nthey think it means a possible criminal investigation and prosecution--\nand I have already shown why I disagree with that position--then they \nalso have to urge the Attorney General to follow the letter of the law \nwith respect to the appointment of an independent counsel. And the \nletter of that law has required, since 1982, that the Attorney General \nfollow the policies and practices of the Department of Justice in \ndetermining whether independent counsel should be appointed. Again, it \nhas not been the policy or practice of the Department of Justice to \nprosecute a solicitation under section 607 if the person being \nsolicited is not on Federal property. If the Attorney General agrees, \nthen she is not permitted to seek an independent counsel under the 1982 \namendment to the independent counsel law.\n  Those urging the independent counsel appointment can't have it both \nways. If they look at the spirit of section 607, or if they look at its \nletter, the Attorney General would be on firm ground should she seek \nnot to appoint an independent counsel.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 21, 1997]\n\n                      Don't Make Gore the Fall Guy\n\n  (By Philip B. Heymann; Philip B. Heymann, a former Deputy Attorney \n General in the Clinton administration, is a professor at Harvard Law \n              School and the Kennedy School of Government)\n\n       Cambridge, MA.--I have publicly supported those who have \n     called for Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an \n     independent counsel to investigate the campaign donations \n     intended for the 1996 Presidential campaign.\n       I have also argued that both the Democratic and Republican \n     parties turned donations intended and used for campaigns, \n     which are strictly regulated, into what looked like \n     unregulated ``soft money,'' not to be used for campaigns, by \n     running it in and out of their national parties.\n       From a prosecutor's point of view, it would be absurd to \n     reject these arguments and instead decide to single out Vice \n     President Al Gore for investigation by an independent \n     counsel. Making phone calls soliciting donations from a \n     Government office rather than some private location is not an \n     adequate basis for prosecution in this case.\n       Most prosecutors won't bring a case if three conditions \n     apply: when there are serious doubts about whether a law \n     technically covers the conduct in question, when the main \n     purpose of the statute was not violated, and when the conduct \n     is not inherently immoral. All three conditions apply to the \n     facts of the Gore allegations.\n       When it comes to whether the law--Section 607 of the \n     Federal Criminal Code--technically applies to Mr. Gore's \n     phone calls, much remains uncertain. It is ``unlawful,'' the \n     section says, ``for any person to solicit or receive any \n     contribution . . . in any [Federal Government] room or \n     building occupied in the discharge of official duties.''\n       Fair enough. But to violate the law, must the person \n     solicited be in a Federal building? In the 100 years since \n     the law was enacted, it has never been applied unless the \n     person solicited was on Federal property.\n       Must the person solicited be a Federal employee? After all, \n     the main purpose of the statute was to protect Federal \n     employees against being dunned by their bosses. In 1979, the \n     Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded \n     that ``compelling arguments can be marshaled on either \n     side of this issue.'' By now, the statute probably also \n     applies to solicitation of non-employees, but the law has \n     never been spelled out.\n       Does the statute cover the President and the Vice \n     President? The wording specifically includes members of \n     Congress and fails to mention the President and the Vice \n     President, but again, the law is unclear. The Justice \n     Department's Office of Legal Counsel has said that there are \n     differences of opinion but that the law probably applies.\n       One thing is certain: the Vice President's actions were not \n     inconsistent with the only plain purpose of this statute. \n     Section 607 was drafted to protect Federal employees from \n     being coerced into giving money. Since Mr. Gore was \n     soliciting campaign money from outside sources, he did not \n     violate the law's main purpose.\n       It is almost impossible to think of a reason that would \n     lead to care whether the Vice President made calls from \n     working quarters in the White House (where they may be \n     forbidden) or the living quarters of the White House (where \n     they are permitted) or from some nearby private location or \n     cellular phone.\n       Of course, in a larger sense, an overriding purpose of many \n     of our campaign finance laws is to prevent the purchase of \n     access and influence. But where Mr. Gore made the phone calls \n     is irrelevant to that purpose. The solicitations are either \n     right or wrong, or either consistent or inconsistent with our \n     statutes, without regard to where they took place.\n       In sum, it is hard to justify calling for prosecution of \n     Mr. Gore. There is no obvious violation of the purpose of the \n     law or claims on our sense of morality. Even if one tries to \n     justify a prosecution on the grounds that the violation was a \n     willful disregard of Section 607, this provides very frail \n     support in a case where so many uncertainties remain about \n     the law's scope.\n       So why are so many people calling for prosecution? First, \n     because it would destroy the Democratic front-runner for \n     President. Political figures of both parties have long urged \n     prosecutions to knock off their current or potential \n     opponents. It remains a very bad idea to bend general \n     standards of prosecution either to reach or to avoid \n     political figures.\n       Second, the Independent Counsel Statute denies the Attorney \n     General the power to exercise even the most obvious of \n     prosecutorial discretion unless she is prepared to say that \n     the Justice Department would, as a matter of policy, never \n     bring a prosecution in these circumstances.\n       But there is a third and final reason. Attorney General \n     Reno has painted herself into a corner. In 1996, access was \n     sold on a scale we haven't seen since 1972. Presidential \n     campaigns solicited money from corporations and unions, which \n     are forbidden to contribute to campaigns. And from \n     individuals, they asked for donations in excess of what they \n     are allowed to give. Hundreds of millions of dollars from \n     these sources was given to the national parties, which then \n     spent it as the Presidential campaigns directed.\n       This strategy to evade campaign finance laws was so \n     transparent that the Justice Department could easily have \n     dismissed the notion that the donations were given to \n     political parties for noncampaign purposes. That conclusion \n     would have meant that the donations were in violation of the \n     law, and required the appointment of an independent \n     prosecutor to investigate.\n       But instead, the Justice Department concluded there were no \n     violations and accepted the parties' claims that they were \n     technically within the law.\n       Now the Attorney General may find that the Vice President's \n     phone calls from the White House technically violate Section \n     607, but still do not warrant appointment of an independent \n     counsel. But it would be hard for the Attorney General to \n     explain this decision credibly. Some will ask, if a \n     technicality can be used to protect the President, isn't a \n     technicality enough to prosecute the Vice President?\n       There is a compelling response to this question. Even if \n     the Vice President's calls violated Section 607, that remains \n     a case that few prosecutors would bring. What does warrant an \n     independent counsel is the thorough evasion of our Federal \n     election laws by dozens of politicians, including both \n     Presidential candidates.\n       I continue to support calls for an independent counsel to \n     investigate solicitation of donations from forbidden \n     contributors. But Mr. Gore should not be made the scapegoat, \n     simply because the Attorney General has not been willing to \n     appoint an independent prosecutor for these allegations. \n     Besides being unfair, that would simply deflect public \n     attention from the real issue.\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 23, 1997]\n\n                   Who Needs an Independent Counsel?\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       If President Clinton had some gumption and, maybe more \n     important, a taste for confrontation, he would call in the \n     press, order up the TV networks and announce he was pardoning \n     both himself and Al Gore for anything relating to campaign \n     fund-raising. He would do that, he would solemnly announce, \n     so that Congress would write a law that makes some sense.\n       The current laws do not. In fact, there is something \n     downright absurd about marshaling the Justice Department and \n     then maybe an independent counsel to look into whether \n     Clinton and Gore actually asked someone somewhere to make a \n     political donation. This, we are told, might be a felony--\n     like, say, armed robbery. As anyone can see, it is actually \n     an absurdity.\n       What do we care--Mr. and Mrs. USA--whether Gore or Clinton \n     was in the business section of the White House when he picked \n     up the phone or upstairs in the private quarters? What do we \n     care whether Gore was in his office or ducked across the \n     street to a pay phone? What do we care whether he used a \n     credit card or called collect? Yet these are some of the very \n     issues involved in this molehill-into-a-mountain scandal.\n       As everyone but congressional Republicans seems to know, \n     the law involved was designed to stop elected federal \n     officials from putting the arm on their own staffs. This was \n     once a routine practice and, indeed, is not unknown to this \n     day. In some jurisdictions, county or municipal workers are \n     expected to make political donations to the reigning \n     organization. Senate Republicans in need of some pointers can \n     ask Al D'Amato how this is done.\n       If Clinton or Gore had done something along those lines, an \n     independent counsel would be justified. Or had either one of \n     them--or anyone within a mile of Clinton--offered a job or a \n     government program in exchange for a contribution, that too \n     would be serious stuff. Then it would not matter if the call \n     was made from the presidential shower or the Situation Room--\n     with a Donald Duck phone or the vaunted red one. A crime \n     would have been committed.\n       But in the absence of any such accusation, the Republicans \n     press ahead anyway--and, in the process, do the White House a \n     favor. The question of who called whom where obscures the \n     uncontested fact that Clinton cheapened the White House with \n     his greed for campaign bucks. The coffees, the sleepovers, \n     the Lincoln Bedroom for the campaign version of frequent \n     flyer miles--all these turned what used to be called The \n     People's House into a bed and breakfast for fat cats.\n       Sooner or later the public--but probably never the press--\n     is going to understand that the Republicans are calling for \n     an independent counsel for what, in essence, may not be a \n     crime and should not be a crime anyway. Back in 1975, that \n     was the conclusion of four Watergate special prosecutors--\n     Archibald Cox, Leon Jaworski, Henry Ruth and Charles Ruff. In \n     a report, they said the law was so confusing and antiquated \n     that Congress ought to change it. Congress, of course, has \n     done nothing of the sort.\n       What's more, if an independent counsel is summoned, the \n     result will be a partisan donnybrook. Attorney General Janet \n     Reno will have to turn the matter over to a three-judge panel \n     headed by the toxically partisan David B. Sentelle. (He \n     supposedly named his daughter Reagan after you-know-who.) He \n     is the same appellate judge whose panel fired Robert Fiske \n     and replaced him with Kenneth Starr, a frank ideologue \n     himself. Starr has since conducted an open-ended \n     investigation of Whitewater, which has so far produced \n     nothing more than questions about his competence. He seems \n     lost in Arkansas.\n       The GOP has a case to make about the way this White House \n     raised money. But for a party whose sole attribute is a \n     belief in less government, it is awfully quick to bring in \n     the government's heaviest guns to swat what is, after all, a \n     mere gnat of an alleged infraction. Once summoned, though, \n     the Lord High Independent Counsel can do pretty much what he \n     or she wants. That would mean, among other things, that Gore \n     would have to spend more and more time in the attic, \n     searching for old records, canceled checks and high school \n     yearbooks. He has already had to hire two criminal lawyers.\n       The whole thing is a study in disproportion, in a madness \n     that, in other places, would entail an examination of the \n     water supply. Campaign financing badly needs reform but, \n     rather than do that, congressional Republicans are trying to \n     lynch Clinton and Gore for what, it appears, is their most \n     serious offense: winning the last election. No independent \n     counsel is going to change that.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 30, 1997]\n\n                             Reno's Burden\n\n                         (By E.J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       The issue of whether Attorney General Janet Reno should \n     recommend an independent counsel to investigate fund-raising \n     by President Clinton and Vice President Gore is hopelessly \n     ensnared in politics, weird legal interpretations and \n     Washington power games.\n       If Reno fails to name a counsel, Republicans are talking \n     about impeaching her. If she names a counsel, she will be \n     seen as bowing to threats and falling into a trap she built \n     for herself. Neither is a good option.\n       Reno should never have declared that Vice President Gore \n     was legally untouchable if he was raising ``soft'' money in \n     those telephone calls from his office, but under suspicion if \n     he raised ``hard'' money.\n       This casuistic distinction between the first kind of money, \n     which goes to general party purposes, and the second kind, \n     which can be spent directly on candidates, was blown away \n     when Bob Woodward of The Post reported that the Democratic \n     National Committee put some of the money Gore raised into \n     ``hard money'' accounts.\n       Reno acknowledged she learned this from The Post, not from \n     her investigators, and was forced to reexamine her position \n     on whether a counsel should be named.\n       But whether the money was ``soft'' or ``hard,'' those phone \n     calls, on their own, don't justify an independent counsel. \n     That's especially true given widespread disagreement over \n     whether the 1883 law they purportedly violated even applies \n     in this case. And as Phil Kuntz reported recently in the Wall \n     Street Journal, Sen. Phil Gramm was quoted in 1995 saying \n     that he placed fund-raising calls, on his credit card, from \n     his Senate office. He later denied explicitly soliciting \n     money. The Justice Department, wrote Kuntz, ``considered and \n     decided against pursuing'' the case.\n       Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has threatened Reno with \n     impeachment, urged the Senate Ethics Committee not to pursue \n     Gramm, according to Kuntz, because so many other senators \n     were probably guilty of the same thing. So Reno can't hang \n     her decision on the phone calls.\n       But, yes, there are broader and much more troubling \n     questions about the ways Democrats ripped apart the campaign \n     law in 1996. So assume Reno seeks an independent counsel. Who \n     picks the counsel? None other than the three-judge panel \n     headed by Judge David Sentelle.\n       Judge Sentelle's panel, you'll recall, dismissed the \n     original Whitewater counsel, Robert Fiske, and appointed \n     Kenneth Starr. Sentelle thought the fact that Reno had picked \n     Fiske raised the appearance of conflict of interest.\n       But appearances didn't seem to bother Judge Sentelle when \n     he lunched with Sens. Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth, both \n     North Carolina Republicans, shortly before he replaced Fiske. \n     The same Sen. Faircloth had accused Fiske of a ``cover-up.'' \n     Five past presidents of the American Bar Association issued a \n     statement saying the meeting was ``unfortunate, to say the \n     least'' and gave rise ``to the appearance of impropriety.''\n       ``Sentelle has polluted the waters,'' said Fred Wertheimer, \n     president of Democracy 21 and a fierce critic of both \n     parties' 1996 fund-raising tactics. ``The notion of the \n     independent counsel is to depoliticize the process, and the \n     Republicans in Congress want to turn it into a political \n     process.''\n       Reno may have good reasons for dragging her feet on the \n     independent counsel. Perhaps she's not happy with the Starr \n     investigation or thinks she appointed too many counsels in \n     Clinton's first term. It's possible she doesn't trust Judge \n     Sentelle and--like many Democrats--has developed doubts about \n     the independent counsel law.\n       If any of this is true, she should come right out and say \n     so. In the current issue of the conservative American \n     Spectator, former Reagan Justice Department official Terry \n     Eastland has it right on this point. ``there would be nothing \n     necessarily wrong if Reno had changed her mind about the \n     [independent counsel] law . . . and tried to reshape her \n     enforcement of it accordingly,'' he writes. ``But this would \n     be vital information, something worth knowing and \n     evaluating.''\n       Similarly, Eastland said in an interview, if Reno doesn't \n     trust the Sentelle panel, ``that's the kind of thing that has \n     to be candidly stated and argued for.''\n       An intriguing alternative to turning to Judge Sentelle \n     comes from Wertheimer and from columnist Al Hunt: Reno should \n     appoint her own counsel within the Justice Department, \n     someone ``of unimpeachable reputation, and give that person \n     the charter to do the job'' of investigating all finance \n     abuses in 1996, Republican as well as Democratic.\n       This idea, at least, would require Reno to say exactly what \n     she's thinking and why. Whatever she does, Reno shouldn't let \n     herself be railroaded by Republicans with obvious partisan \n     motives. But she also has to restore confidence in the way \n     the 1996 finance abuses are being investigated.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 23, 1997]\n\n                       Campaign Finance Overkill\n\n                         (By William Raspberry)\n\n       I make no excuse for President Clinton or Vice President \n     Gore. Indeed, I'm quite prepared to accept that they \n     violated--knowingly violated--federal law with regard to \n     campaign fund-raising.\n       Still, the hearings before Sen. Fred Thompson's \n     Governmental Affairs Committee make me a little uneasy. The \n     prospect of an independent counsel investigation, given the \n     tendency of those things to get out of hand, is positively \n     chilling.\n       If that sounds like partisan irresolution, it gets worse. I \n     don't like the idea of high officials getting away with law \n     violations, and yet I can't imagine what punishment of the \n     alleged violations I would accept as equitable.\n       A bad analogy might demonstrate my dilemma. Say your \n     state--for reasons you don't comprehend and which may not in \n     fact make much sense--has enacted a 28-mph\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\n     speed limit on an unremarkable two-mile strip of interstate \n     highway. What do you do with motorists who come zooming \n     through at, say, 32 mph?\n       You don't want to send the message that anyone can violate \n     the speed laws with impunity; speed kills, and you have to \n     believe that those who enacted the limits did so in the \n     interest of public safety.\n       On the other hand, how many licenses would you snatch, and \n     how many drivers would you send to jail for doing something \n     that (it seemed to you) endangered the public not a whit?\n       Laws ought both to have some purpose and to advance that \n     purpose. The purpose of the fund-raising laws is clear and \n     commendable; to prevent the buying and selling of public \n     office. But how does the law that has Al Gore in such trouble \n     advance that purpose? It forbids solicitation or receipt of \n     contributions in any federal ``room or building occupied in \n     the discharge of official duties.'' Did Gore solicit campaign \n     contributions from his office phone? Sure he did. Clinton, \n     too. Would the republic have been more secure if they had \n     toddled off to the corner drugstore to make the calls? \n     (Waiting until they got home after work would have been no \n     solution; both live in buildings ``occupied in the discharge \n     of official duties.'')\n       People who study these things say the prohibition, part of \n     the civil service reform of a century ago, was designed to \n     keep public officials from pressuring their staffs into \n     making contributions. It did not contemplate telephoned \n     solicitations made to private citizens.\n       But that's not all that bothers me about the \n     investigations. Thompson's hearings are supposed to have some \n     legislative purpose and, in truth, one keeps hearing about \n     the need for campaign finance reform. But one could be \n     forgiven for wondering if the true purpose isn't to bolster \n     Republican Thompson's own presidential prospects and to \n     destroy Democrat Gore's.\n       That is, perhaps, a small point. This isn't: The Supreme \n     Court has said money is speech. If that makes sense (and it \n     does to me), how can it make sense to put arbitrary limits on \n     the amount of speech that's permissible?\n       That's not a trick question; it worries me a lot. It's \n     inconceivable that there should be limits on the amount of \n     time, doorbell-ringing, envelope-stuffing or other forms of \n     political ``speech'' supporters can contribute to candidates \n     of their choice. Why should we countenance limits on money \n     speech?\n       The obvious answer is that we don't like the idea of rich \n     people buying influence over public officials or otherwise \n     subverting the government to their private purposes. (It's \n     easy, though not necessarily fair, to assume that the \n     purposes of the rich are more likely to be against the public \n     interest than are the purposes of, say, organized labor.)\n       Maybe there's no way out of the dilemma. Either we allow \n     free speech in all its forms, or we arbitrarily limit it for \n     people we don't trust. The latest attempt to split the \n     difference--allowing larger amounts of ``speech'' on behalf \n     of political parties and smaller amounts for candidates--has \n     pretty much come a cropper. Soft money/hard money indeed!\n       Public financing of campaigns is the most frequently \n     offered solution. But how do you ensure fairness to lesser-\n     known candidates, and how do you ensure the free speech \n     rights of those who talk with their pocketbooks?\n       We have two things going on at the same time: a serious \n     campaign-finance dilemma and a juicy campaign-finance \n     scandal.\n       Guess which one will get the attention.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday, President Clinton assailed my \nproposal to give more money to schools all across the country and \nrestore authority for directing those funds to parents and teachers and \nschool board members. The debate about the future of our public schools \nis vitally important to the future of this country. A front-page \nWashington Post article today notes: ``. . .more parents than ever are \nchoosing alternatives to public education for their children. . .'' and \nare doing so in such great numbers that the phenomenon is starting to \nresemble a revolution. We should read this as a warning signal that \nparents are beginning to lose faith in their public schools. We must \nact decisively to restore that faith, improve education, and prepare \nour children for their future. More of what we are doing now is not \nenough.\n  On one point, the President and I do agree: We can improve public \neducation. We part company, however, on who can best make decisions to \nimprove our public schools. I believe that parents and teachers and \nlocal school board officials will make the greatest strides in \nimproving education because they are in our homes and classrooms and \nhigh schools with our kids. But with his remarks yesterday, President \nClinton says to parents and teachers: I don't trust you.\n  I find it remarkable that the President believes that restoring \ndecisionmaking authority to parents and teachers and our elected school \nboard members is somehow dangerous. The Gorton education reform \namendment increases the amount of money school districts have to work \nwith, thus, expanding the programs they can target to both \ndisadvantaged and high-achieving students.\n  A recent study found that if Federal education funds for kindergarten \nthrough high school are sent directly to school districts, as the \nGorton education reform amendment proposes, school districts would \nreceive an additional $670 million. Why would they receive more? \nBecause the funds would bypass the Department of Education and State \neducational bureaucracies and save that amount in administrative \napplication and compliance costs. Washington State school districts \nwould receive $12.5 million more to target to their most needy \nstudents; Arkansas schools would receive $7 million in increased \neducation funds; Mississippi would get $9 million to target \ndisadvantaged students and other school programs.\n  President Clinton and opponents of giving parents and teachers a \nlarger role in our children's education presume that local school \ndistricts will act irresponsibly if Federal strings disappear. This \nadds insult to injury. How can the President say with a straight face \nthat programs would be ``abolished'' just because a bureaucrat does not \ndirect them? Those who share the schools and classrooms with our \nchildren every day are not going to squander an opportunity to use an \nincrease in Federal funds to address the problems they see every day.\n  It is also extremely disingenuous to state that my proposal would \nsomehow ``close the Department of Education,'' as President Clinton \nsuggested yesterday. Higher education and dozens of functions relating \nto education in general will remain in the Department--perhaps too many \nsuch functions--but hundreds of bureaucrats who now write rules and \nregulations to inflict on every school in America will go, and their \nsalaries will be used to hire new teachers and provide better education \nin every school in our Nation.\n  Just on Sunday, Madam President, the Columbus Dispatch, in an \neditorial, summarized the dispute in this fashion:\n\n       It's hard to see what the U.S. Department of Education has \n     accomplished in its 20 years of existence to improve this \n     country's system of schooling. The Senate's block grant \n     approach is worth a try.\n\n  The will to change and improve our public school system and restore \nparents' faith in the quality of education it can provide to our kids \nis there. It is at home in our cities and towns and communities. Will \nwe untie parents' and teachers' hands and let them do their jobs? The \nbiggest point I believe today's Washington Post article makes clear is \nthat parents are not turning to the Federal Government to improve their \nkids' education--parents and teachers are coming up with alternative \nsolutions because they want the best possible education for their kids.\n  We must return and restore more freedom, not less, to our local \nschools, so that we can restore the public's faith in public education.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth).

Mr. President, I want to address the campaign finance \nmatter that we have been involved with this year. I would like to start \noff by saying that I think sometimes we give the impression, with all \nof our horror stories about some of the things that have happened in \ncampaign finance over the past few years, both on Capitol Hill and in \nthe Presidential elections in both parties--that we sometimes emphasize \nto the point where we might add to the cynicism of the people of this \ncountry instead of helping placate or correct some of the reasons for \nthat kind of cynicism.\n  I want to add that I think the majority of elected officials here in \nWashington, the majority of the people that run for office, whether \nhigh political office here in Washington, in the Congress, or even \nrunning for the Presidency or Vice Presidency, or the people\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\nback home running for State offices, are by and large some of the \nfinest, most dedicated people we have, and they are dedicated to doing \njust as fine a job as they possibly can. So I think that sometimes we \ntend to overdo the criticism to the point where it adds to the problem \nwe are trying to cure.\n  Having said that, there are problems, and there is no doubt about \nthat. We have to look at the big picture sometimes. I think we get so \nbogged down into nits and gnats of what a particular advantage is this \nway to one party or that way to another party, that we sometimes need \nto stand back and look at the big picture of why some of us feel \ncampaign finance reform is very, very important.\n  Let's drop back to the point where we see how our political system \ndeveloped, why it developed the way it did. You know, we have the \nfinest constitutional system of government in the world. We are the \nenvy of much of the rest of the world for our political system. It \nrepresents all the people more perfectly than any system of government \nthat has been devised. Winston Churchill put it well once when he said \nwe have ``the worst system of government, except for every other system \nof government ever tried.''\n  We do more towards representing the individual and more towards \nmaking sure that every single person has a fair shake in our society \nthan any other government that ever has been, even with the problems \nthat we have. And we have to admit we do have a lot of problems. I see \nthese problems as being mainly ones of danger signs up there to cure \nthese little specks of rot that have crept into our system that could \ndo major harm to our body politic in the future if we do not correct \nthem now.\n  If we have such a great system of constitutional government, how \nabout the people running that Government? The Constitution does not \nprovide for how we are going to staff the Government. And mere words \nwritten on paper--be they the Constitution of the United States, and \nsacred though that it is--that does not guarantee that we will have a \ngood running Government under that constitutional system unless we have \ngood people in there to make that system work. That is the key, and \nthat is fundamental, because that is what our political systems in this \ncountry are. Our political systems are basically the personnel \ndepartments to run that constitutional Government.\n  Those political parties that we have right now that wind up after an \nelection staffing and giving direction to that constitutional system of \ngovernment--those political parties are not provided for in the \nConstitution. We don't find anything in the Constitution that says \nthere will be so many people in the Democratic Party, so many people in \nthe Republican Party, and so on. No. In fact, our political parties \nhave just sort of developed over a period of time under our \nconstitutional system. That is as it should be, I guess. They have \nevolved. They have changed through the years to better reflect the \ninterests of the people of this country.\n  But there is one thing you have to have to make that constitutional \nsystem of Government work. And that is in any democracy to long endure \nwe have to have in Government the confidence of the people--the \nconfidence of the people. Unless you have that, a democracy may not \nlong endure because people will want to experiment with trying the \nother systems of government, or they will want to go up and join \nsplinter groups that reflect more their own little, narrow interests of \nwhat their parochial views are in their local community and where they \nthink the country should go in the future to benefit them personally. \nWe will see more and more of that, if the confidence of our people in \nGovernment goes down.\n  Look across the seas. We see Italy. I don't know how many it is now--\n50-some different Governments since World War II. I think they have \naveraged about one per year, or something like that. They only have a \ngovernment by a coalition of different groups--disparate groups of \npeople getting together and not making a permanent government for a \nlengthy period of time, and making temporary alliances for short-term \nadvantage. That is not the hallmark of America. And to see us setting \nup any possibility of that kind of a situation would play a game of \nroulette for the future of this country.\n  Our country was founded on the basis not that we take this group, set \nit aside, and give it certain advantages. Not that there is a ruling \nclass up here someplace, and they have certain advantages, and we set \none class off against another. Our Government was set up on the basis \nof the importance of each individual--not groups, not special groups, \nbut each single individual; and each individual was a king in this \ncountry, each individual was royalty in this country, if you will. Our \nGovernment was set up not to have a royalty that dictated their ideas, \nand everyone else had to live under that kind of rule. We have our \nconstitutional system here where authority wells up from the people \nthrough their elected officials. It was that confidence in those \nelected officials that let us move ahead and become the kind of Nation \nwe have become. We are a representative form of government. We are not \na perfect town meeting government as we have seen in New England--the \nmost pure form of democratic expression I guess that we have in our \ncountry. We cannot take a referendum on every single vote, in a \nnational referendum--on every single issue--as they can at a town \nmeeting. No. We say we will send people to work full time representing \nus, and we will trust those people. We will trust those people--that is \nthe important word--to make those decisions on our behalf.\n\n  If we start having trust in those people eroded, and we see that \ntrust going downhill, then I see a big danger for our country. Our \nNation was founded on this representative form of government that \nrepresents all the people all the time. And any time we depart from \nthat kind of a feeling in this country of our Government representing \nall the people all the time, we engender less faith in our system, and \nwe set up a potential of a slide downhill in our ability to cope with \nthe future.\n  I don't think the United States of America is ever going to get taken \nover by the likes of Russia, China, and North Korea and Iraq, or \nanybody, or put together by any combination. Our country is going to be \nmilitarily secure, I believe, into the indefinite future as far as we \ncan see because we are cognizant of the fact that we live in an \nuncertain world. We will have to protect ourselves. And we are so far \nahead of anybody else in military technology and power that I don't see \nthat as a hazard for the future of this country at all. But I do see a \ndanger for our country if we have this increasing cynicism, this \ncynicism of our people that seems to be growing, and particularly among \nour young people. If that cynicism grows to the point where our young \npeople in particular feel that politics is just too dirty, ``I do not \nwant to touch it, wash my hands if I shook hands with a politician, I \njust do not want to have anything to do with politics''--if they have \nthat kind of view, then what happens? We will have less support for our \npolitical system; that is, the department of personnel for this \nconstitutional system of Government; less support for those parties. We \nwill have less trust of elected Government officials and our \nrepresentative form of Government. We will have people tending more to \nsplit off into special interest groups instead of supporting mainstream \nparties that have served us well for all of the history of this \ncountry--when we get away from representing all the people all the \ntime, we start down a slope that I think is a danger to the future of \nthis country.\n  One person, one vote, one person, one influence--let's say. We are \ndivided up into so many million little bits of influence in this \ncountry in our system of government, one person, one vote, one \ninfluence--that is what people think about. We tell our kids. ``When \nthey are growing up, when you get to be old enough, you register to \nvote because your vote is every bit as important as the vote of the \nPresident of the United States.'' And we mean it. And it is. That vote \ncounts every bit as much when the tallies come out on election night--\nno matter what the rank of the person, be it some gutter bum who got \nregistered and decided to vote, or be it the wealthiest person in this \ncountry, or be it the President of the United States. All the votes are \nequal in that tally. And it is a vote. It is representing those people \nwho are elected to represent all the people and represent them all the \ntime. And that is the basis on which they are elected.\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\n  That one influence from each person is supposed to be that person's \ninfluence, and influence is the future of this country. That, \nthroughout our history, has given us the confidence to work together.\n  So, when I see a cynical attitude developing toward Government and \npolitics and those in Government instead of confidence in elected \nofficials, we see question marks all the time about whatever is going \non in Government--automatic suspicions, automatic paranoia: ``You \nbetter watch those people in Washington. They are out to get us,'' in a \ncertain way or whatever. That to me is the beginning of a danger \nsignal. It is the beginning of the potential of a slide downhill and \nconfidence in Government that to me can lead to many other problems and \nleave us less able to take care of ourselves as a nation in the future \nthan we have been in the past.\n\n  This is erosion of trust to the point where people want no part of \npolitics. They just didn't want any part of it at all because of what \nthey see. It is something that we don't want to see happen.\n  It is rather peculiar because we see some of this cynicism developing \nand expressing itself in polls. When people are polled, they let their \ncynicism all hang out. It is right there in the polling--repeated \npolling that shows that cynicism has been growing with regard to how \npeople view their Government. And the confidence they have. That is \nreally amazing because we have had rare times in our history when \neconomic times and the general social pattern across the country has \nbeen any better. There the lowest unemployment rate, the lowest \ninflation rate, and Federal employment is coming down. We have a chance \nof balancing our budget. The times are good, and unemployment is low. \nWe have no big foreign threat out there to us physically. You think \npeople would be very, very happy about this whole thing. But instead of \nthat there has been this gnawing, growing, rotten little specks of \ncynicism growing on our body politic that I see as a real danger for \nthe long term.\n  I think we can come back to what I mentioned a little while ago. \nPeople no longer feel confident that their primary interests are our \nprimary concern here in Washington. They feel, ``Why vote? Why get out \nthere and vote? Why participate in a political party?'' Why try an \nexercise that one little bit of influence they have to put together \nwith millions of other little bits of influence which will direct the \nfuture of this country? Why should they try to exercise that little bit \nof influence when they see that the real influence in Washington, the \nreal influence in our political parties, the real influence in \nPresidential elections, in congressional elections, in Senate \nelections, is too often money? It buys access.\n  Why do we think of Roger Tamraz on the Democratic side who is willing \nto put $300,000 into a Presidential race because he wanted to get in \nand try to influence somebody. If he could get to the President, or to \nthe Vice President, or get to somebody, and if he could get them to \nsay, ``I will approve your oil pipeline'' in Southwest Asia, he was \ngoing to make billions out of it. He made no bones about it. He put in \n$300,000, and he said the next time he would put $600,000 in. \nFortunately, it didn't work, to the credit of the people that were in \ncharge--the President, and the other people around there.\n  But I will tell you. It raises a warning signal to us about what can \nhappen.\n  I used that example on the Democratic side. How about on the \nRepublican side? How about when you put out invitations to a group \ncalled ``The Season Ticket Holders'' for $250,000 each. One hundred \npeople can join this thing, and for that you are going to get a \nguaranteed dinner with the chairman of your choice in the Congress. It \nsays it right in there. No problem. You are invited to all the policy \nmatters. You are invited. If you are a businessman and you want to \ncontribute $250,000, or have your corporation give that kind of soft \nmoney--and soft money can be given in any amount--then you are \nguaranteed that you will be able to come in and represent your business \ninterests with the committee chairman of your choice.\n  It is not in the executive branch. It is here where the laws are \nformed--right here in Congress. At the bottom of the invitation, it \nsays ``Benefits Upon Receipt.''\n  We wonder why the people are a little bit suspicious out there about \nwhat is going on.\n  That was out of the hearings we had in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. I could go on and on with a number of other examples. I just \nused those two to make sure that we all understand that this isn't \nsomething that is just one or two or very few people.\n  It is something that has become endemic in Government. It is \nsomething that is pervasive. It is something that is a rot on the body \npolitic. It hasn't ruined it yet. Most of that apple, most of that body \npolitic, most of whatever it is still is in good shape and the people \nare just as dedicated as they have ever been and the public servants \nare just as dedicated as they have ever been. But if we let this \npractice on either side of the aisle grow into the long-term future, we \nare creating a problem for the future of this country. And that we do \nnot need and we do not want and we cannot afford.\n  Trust is down. Suspicions are up. People cynically question those of \nus in office, and we cannot blame them.\n  Now, some other things have caused some problems in this area, too. \nOne is that campaign spending has gone up and up and up and up and up. \nA report from the Federal Election Commission --let's go back about 10 \nyears. Let's go back to 1985 and 1986. That is just over 10 years. At \nthat time, the total, all congressional campaigns--just congressional \nnot including the Presidential campaigns--in the 1985-86 cycle, the \ntotal spending for everything to do with Congress, Senate and the House \nof Representatives, was $472 million. Ten years later it is $790 \nmillion--$790 million just for congressional races, House and Senate.\n  This is interesting. The number of candidates has gone up in that \nperiod. I guess more people are running in primaries and so on that are \nsubject to Federal elections. Back in 1985-86, there were 1,873 people \nwho ran for national office, congressional campaigns. That has gone up \nto 2,605. I guess that should be encouraging to us in that maybe more \npeople are running for office. I wish I knew the quality of those \npeople who are running for public office and whether we are getting the \nbest and brightest out there in the system instead of more people \ndeciding to take a whack at running for Congress. Why not? I do not \nknow how you could judge that. Someone could do a poli-sci, political \nscience doctoral thesis trying to analyze that, as to what is happening \nto the quality of people running for office.\n  When you go from $472 million in 10 years to $790 million, the money \nchase is on. The money chase is on, and 70 percent of it goes to TV. If \nyou are not coming into people's homes via TV, you are not, in effect, \nknocking at the door, as we used to do and greet the people and have a \nhandshake. TV has replaced all that. If you do not come into that \nperson's living room and say hello to them via TV, you are not in the \ncampaign anymore. That requires about 70 percent. So the importance of \nTV has gone up, and that has raised the cost of campaigning \ntremendously.\n  I point these out as a danger to the future as I see it. We had one \ncataclysmic event back a few years ago, and that is what we all know of \nby the general term ``Watergate.'' The revelations of Watergate \nresulted in our saying enough is enough. Congress got to work. It \npassed some legislation, put some limits on, deciding we were going to \nregulate some of these things in the future, not let them run rampant \nlike they were because the whole public psyche in this country had been \njerked up short at that time. I tell you, everybody was disturbed about \nthis, and we couldn't wait every day to hear what the new revelations \nwere.\n  Watergate, for the first time, resulted in the resignation of a \nPresident of the United States, something that, growing up, we thought \nwould have been absolutely impossible.\n  But out of those national concerns came reforms, and the reforms \nserved us well, I believe. They worked. We had testimony yesterday from \nour former colleagues here, Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, and a former \ncolleague here also and later Vice President, Walter Mondale, before \nour Governmental Affairs Committee. They talked about how the reforms \nput in\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\nplace following Watergate, they felt, really worked very well. There \nwere some regulations put on. People had some questions about first \namendment rights and all these different things that are brought up and \ndiscussed in the Chamber now also, but the reforms after Watergate \nseemed to have worked pretty well.\n  But then came a series of court and FEC decisions that undermined it \nand created some loopholes for those Watergate reforms. We started \nseeing the rise of soft money, and it rose and it rose, and then it \nreally went out through the ceiling in the last election. And that was \nby far the biggest change that had occurred.\n  So we are now on a money chase, be it Presidential or be it here in \nthe Congress. I have heard criticism on the floor, as well as in some \nof the press conferences of some of the Members here, being caustically \ncritical of--and some of the press being caustically critical of--the \nPresident going out and fundraising when he says at the same time we \nneed campaign finance reform. Isn't this being hypocritical? I say, no, \nI do not think so at all because we have not really changed the rules. \nAs the President said, he is not interested in unilateral disarmament \nat this point.\n  As I said at our hearing yesterday, if both sides agree that this \nmoney chase should not go on the way it is and we agree to limit both \nsides, then certainly the President should not be out fundraising. If \nwe agree to that, the other side could agree to it also. It would be a \nlittle bit like if I was over in England and I got used to driving on \nthe left side of the road and I liked that, and I came back to this \ncountry and I put in legislation to say, let's have driving on the \nleft-hand side of the highway become the norm in this country and we \nare going to pass a law that permits that to happen, but I say I \nbelieve in this so fervently I am going to go drive on the left-hand \nside of the road even before the law is changed, you know what the \nresult would be. I guess we can say the same thing here. I think the \nPresident is right in going ahead with fundraising as long as the law \nis the way it is and the Republicans are doing exactly the same thing.\n  So I think some of our campaign practices need to be revised, and \nthat is what we are talking about with campaign finance reform.\n  You know what all the current practices are. We see them every day \nright here on Capitol Hill. Some people can't go through more than, \nlet's say, a two-pay period here without receiving an invitation here \nin Washington or someplace to a barbecue, to a coffee, to a reception, \nto a dinner. Are these all situations where you go and you say, I have \nto pay $500 or I have to pay $100 or I have to give $1,000 or I can't \ngo to this thing? No. A number of these things, quite a lot of them, as \na matter of fact, mean just getting acquainted with people and doing \nthe first stroking, if you will, and setting up a situation where you \ncan go back later and ask for some money, and, hopefully, they will see \nfit, once you become acquainted with them, to contribute to your \ncampaign. That is the nature of politics. That is the way it is.\n  But then later on there are some people who creep into this whole \nprocess--even though I think the major part of the process is still \nlegitimate and aboveboard--who do want special access. They are not \nlooking to just support someone whose beliefs they believe in, whose \nstatements of purpose, whose ideas of public office are something that \nthey personally believe in--which would be the best of democracy, if we \ncould guarantee that was the type of support being given to \nindividuals.\n  No; they are people who come in and then want to do what I talked \nabout a little while ago. They want either to buy a ticket to become a \nseason ticket holder and have that guaranteed dinner with the committee \nchairman of their choice or they are a Tamraz who makes no bones about \nit; he wants to get his pipeline approved, and he is willing to give \n$300,000 to get a shot at a few words with the President in hopes he \ncan influence that person to come around to his way of thinking--which \ndid not occur, I repeat.\n  Is that influence imaginary? Buying access; is that imaginary? No, it \nis not. When we had insurance legislation here a couple years ago, it \ncame out in the paper that some of the big contributors and big \nlobbyists were called in--I believe it was on an insurance bill--and \nactually wrote part of that bill on the Hill here. They called in the \nlobbyists who made the huge contributions and let them write their own \nportion of the bill. That was even defended by one of the Members by \nsaying, well, they knew more about it than anybody else. They certainly \ndid, but that did not mean they were going to write it in a way that \nwas for the benefit of all the people all the time. They had bought \ntheir way in with influence, and they were writing it for the benefit \nof some of the people and the benefit of their special interest, you \ncan bet on that, or they would not have been in here doing that.\n\n  We saw recently the results of $50 billion being inserted into a bill \nto benefit the tobacco companies, the biggest contributors. Their chief \nrepresentative, who reportedly in a magazine makes about $50,000 a \nmonth, former Republican National Committee chairman, was the one who \napparently worked his way and got that in. That is what people are \nunhappy about.\n  I have given both Democratic and Republican examples here because I \nwant to point out that this is not something which is just all on one \nside of the aisle.\n  Sometimes the States get out ahead of the Federal Government in these \nUnited States of ours. They get out ahead of us in that they can \noperate, they can act more swiftly to take on a problem as they see it \ndeveloping. Some of the States have seen their political systems be \ncorrupted, or the danger of being corrupted, by political influence at \nthe local level, and they have taken some action.\n  The State of Maine has recently passed legislation, the basic theme \nof which is they are going to try State funding for State races. They \nare saying, we are going to cure this thing; and rather than try to \nwrite more complex laws on top of already complex laws, we are going to \nsay, no, we are not going to do that anymore. We are just going to say, \nin the best interests of the people in getting the government, getting \nour elected officials, to make sure they address the concerns of all \nthe people all the time, once they get through the primary, then let's \nget them some financing here so they do not have to go out on this \nmoney chase and promise everything under the sun to get enough money to \nhave a chance of winning an election.\n  There are 12 other States, as I understand it, that are looking at a \nsimilar program right now. Maybe that is the answer for the future. We \nhave seen court rulings and FEC regulations and rulings create \nloopholes that let people have access to getting around our election \nlaws. Perhaps Federal financing is a way to correct that. I personally \nthink that is something we will come to eventually, whether we like it \nor not. We will be forced into it because it looks as if, unless \nsomething drastic changes in the Chamber here--we may get a bill \nthrough, but it appears that it is going to be watered down enough that \nit may not be the overall comprehensive campaign finance reform that \nsome of us believe, sincerely believe, is necessary if we are going to \ncorrect this problem into the future.\n  I do not rule out the possibility that at some time in the future we \nare going to have Federal financing of Federal campaigns because I \nthink the people of this country may demand that. I am one of the \noriginal cosponsors of a bill here in the Senate, the Kerry-Wellstone \nbill, to take a look at this, to see if we could not work out something \nthat is satisfactory in that particular area.\n  So I think we need to watch this experience of the States as they try \nto take back their State governments and make their State governments \nrepresentative of all the people all the time, not all the people part \nof the time and special interests the rest of the time. We need to \nwatch this very, very closely.\n  Let me address one other area. We haven't had much discussion \nrecently in the Governmental Affairs Committee hearings that we have \nbeen having, we have not had much emphasis on enforcement. There have \nbeen those who said we have all these laws on the books now. They are \nnot working, so why add more laws on top of them and make more laws \nthat won't work either? That is a pretty good argument,\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\nas a matter of fact. But I don't believe that is the way we ought to \ngo. What we should do, we should make a FEC that can enforce the \nlegislation, enforce the laws of the land, enforce the regulations they \nhave put out, and make sure that anyone who violates those regulations \nis brought up short and is penalized and do it immediately, not years \nand years later.\n\n  Instead of that, what have we seen? We have seen, through the years, \nthe budget for the Federal Election Commission either remain about the \nsame or actually be cut, from year to year. Instead of giving better \nenforcement, they are only able to give less enforcement. Maybe the \npeople who have perpetrated those cuts on our system here had that in \nmind. Maybe they did not want to see the FEC be anything more than, \nwhat has been termed in the past, a toothless tiger. I think if we have \nlaws they should be enforced. I think whatever is required to help the \nFEC do that, we should provide the money to do exactly that.\n  This year we have reached even a ridiculous example. They asked for \nan additional $4.6 million over there in addition to their, I think it \nis, $28-point-something million. They asked for an additional $4.6 \nmillion to give them special investigative authority, investigative \ncapability to go out and see what happened in the 1996 election. And \nthe committees up here have not only not approved the additional money \nfor them, they have sent word over there specifying they are not to \nhire more people. They are not to hire more people. That is the word \nthat FEC is operating under from the committees on the Hill right now \nthis very day. They are not to hire more people to look into these \nalleged violations of law that happened in the last election.\n  In other words, we are creating a Nation of political scofflaws out \nthere, if you will. Because they know you are not likely to get caught \nif you do something wrong, because that is just the way the system is. \nIt does not have the capability of picking up all the wrongs in the \nsystem. So you have a chance of getting away with all sorts of misdeeds \nif you want to try it.\n  So, we need a strong FEC. We had one estimate given to us the other \nday by one person who studies these things a lot of the time, that they \nthought the FEC budget should probably be doubled. It should be \nsomewhere around the $50 million mark, instead of hovering around the \n$30 million or under mark. I would vote for that.\n  I think we also need to make some changes in the Federal Election \nCommission, in that I don't believe they are organized on the proper \nbasis. When we say you have six commissioners over there, three will be \nRepublican and three will be Democrat, that sets it up for political \nbickering right off the bat. It is organized for political disunity \ngoing in. It is not organized to get to election fraud and violations \nwithout fear or favor, no matter what the politics of it are, \nRepublican, Democrat, or independent. It is set up with three and \nthree, which just breeds political gridlock. And that is exactly what \nthey have had through the years, in many cases. Much of the time.\n  One of the suggestions that had been made in the past is that we, \ninstead of having the commissioners appointed on a political basis the \nway they are now, we should have the commissioners appointed from \nformer Federal judges: People who would be stable; they have been used \nto giving fair consideration of the law and cases, that has been their \ntraining, that has been their background; and to be appointed for their \nnonpolitics, for their apolitical views, if you will, because they \nwould best be able to judge, then, when a Democratic or Republican \ntransgression occurs, they would best be able to give it the proper \nattention and proper consideration. Rather than just saying I am a \nDemocrat so I better protect my Democratic interests over here no \nmatter what, or I am a Republican so I'll see that we forgive that \nviolation or whatever it is on the Republican side--no. That is not in \nthe best interests of the people of the United States. The best \ninterests of the people of the United States is in having a Federal \nElection Commission that enforces the law without fear or favor, \nwherever the violation occurs. And that means, I think, that we have to \nreorganize at the top level over there.\n\n  Going into our committee investigations this year, we were faced with \na tough choice.\n  Before I leave that, for just a moment let me give a few figures here \non the FEC, what their budget problems have been. For fiscal 1995 they \nhad over 10 percent of their budget rescinded halfway through the \nfiscal year, the largest percentage agency rescission of any Government \nagency. In fiscal 1996 they sought $32 million but they received only \n$26 million, with some of those funds fenced for other particular \npurposes. For fiscal 1997 they had their travel budget limited and \nfenced such that it was difficult to conduct depositions and court \nappearances, including those undertaken in connection with the \nChristian Coalition litigation. In fiscal 1998, being considered right \nnow, they asked both the House and Senate for $29 million, plus an \nadditional $4.9 million--I correct my figure I gave a moment ago at \n$4.8 and $28 million, I guess I said--but they asked both the House and \nSenate for $29 million plus an additional $4.9 million just to deal \nwith cases arising from the 1996 Federal election. The actual budget is \nstill in conference, but they have been told specifically not to hire \nmore staff to look into those problems of the 1996 election.\n  Let me tell you one other thing, and this I think is rather amazing. \nI didn't know this until a few days ago myself. Their total enforcement \ncadre over there is 30 lawyers to oversee all these hundreds and \nhundreds and hundreds of cases filed with the FEC. There are 30 \nlawyers. How many investigators would you think the FEC would have to \ngo out in the field and investigate wrongdoing out there, get the \ninformation, go to boards of elections, bring that information back, \nreally create these cases--how many investigators do we figure the FEC \nhas? Do you know what the answer is right now, as of this day, the 1st \nof October, 1997? They have two, two investigators. And that is up from \nonly one just a short time ago. I guess that is heartening. That is a \n100 percent increase, isn't it? We have gone from one up to two.\n  Two investigators for the FEC. Their lawyers in the enforcement \ndivision go out but they don't do investigations. They will go out and \ndo depositions. They will go out and do a court case someplace that has \nbeen developed here, but their work is basically paperwork handled at \nthe Washington level. So the investigative capacity at the FEC is not \nmuch, two people for the whole agency.\n  I propose we somehow get some little cadre of FBI people who really \nknow something about investigation and assign them, at least for a \nperiod here of a few years, to help out over there, doing real \ninvestigative work trying to clean up the problems of campaign finance \nwhere the laws have been broken. And there have been laws broken in a \nnumber of areas.\n  Where do they need to look? Starting out our hearings this year I \nsuggested we, instead of just going with Republican investigations or \nDemocratic investigations, I proposed that we pick some areas where we \nknow there are difficulties with campaign finance and then we bring \nthose up, one after the other, and have a series of hearings on each \none of these subjects. Let the chips fall where they may, Democrat or \nRepublican, and find out what is wrong with the system, get it out \nthere, get it out in the open. If we need additional law, let's have \nadditional law. If we just need to enforce existing law better, then \nlet's do that, too. But let's find out what the problems are first and \nthen enforce them and make a system that really is run on a tight \nbasis.\n  What are some of these areas I want to look at? One is foreign money. \nThere are all sorts of allegations about money coming in from wherever, \nwhether it was the Chinese or Chinese Government, where it was being \nchanneled, where it was coming through and who it was going to, and did \nit affect elections or did it not affect elections--we had all sorts of \nproblems with foreign money potentially coming into the American \nsystem. We had one on one side looking at whether it is the Democrats \nare where the money is coming and John Huang and Charlie Trie, and did \nthat money come from the Government of China? On the other hand, we had \nthe spectacle of Haley Barbour and the Republican National Committee \ngetting loans of money, $2.1 million out of Hong Kong, funding it\n\n[[Page S10287]]\n\nthrough the National Policy Forum in this country and into the \nRepublican coffers. So we had bipartisan foreign money problems, there \nisn't any doubt about it.\n\n  So we should be looking at that? That is one area. There are other \nareas, though, that we have only touched on briefly in the last few \nhearings that we have had, that I think we also have to look at if we \nare going to really do the right job, looking into campaign finance \nreform or campaign finance violations, No. 1; and things the FEC should \nbe monitoring on a steady basis.\n  How about the second one, third-party transfer? If I have maxed out \nmy contributions that I can give, I say, ``I am maxed out.'' But I turn \nto somebody else and I say, ``OK, look, I'll give you $1,000 and you go \nover there and you give that in your name and that clears it and I'll \njust give you the money.'' That is illegal. We have lots of information \nabout that being done. That whole thing is an area we have really not \neven explored much yet, yet it was violated time after time after time.\n  So, foreign money, do we have to look into that? Of course we do. The \nthird party transfer of funds? Of course we do.\n  Another area was the area of misuse of tax exempt organizations, so-\ncalled 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) organizations, where they have \norganizations given certain tax-exempt status and, for having that \nstatus, they are prohibited from political activity. But in this last \nelection that whole thing ran amok. Organizations were being put \ntogether with that kind of charter and they were deliberately \nchanneling money through. We have example after example of that, and we \nhave not really had a chance to bring those things out yet, either. So \nthat is another area we ought to be looking at.\n  Another area the FEC ought to be following, if we gave them adequate \nresources to do so, is tax-exempt organizations.\n  Then we had the biggest increase of all and that is in the area of \nsoft money, where you can give any amount you want to give, any amount \nyou want to give. If you are a billionaire you can walk in and put $1 \nbillion down if you wanted to. Do you think that might buy some \ninfluence? I think it might buy some, yes. You can put down any amount \nyou want. As I talked about a little while ago, we had the restricted \nmembership of 100, if they would contribute $250,000 to that season \nticket holder group that I mentioned just a moment ago when I was \nlining up one on the Democratic side and one on the Republican side to \ngive some balance to this. The soft money can come in in any amounts \nnow, but it is supposed to be just for party building. It is supposed \nto be used for things like get-out-the-vote drives and general \nadvertising on general views of the Republican Party or the Democratic \nParty. Was that misused? There is no doubt whatsoever about the misuse \nof soft money and the pernicious influence that it had with this last \nelection. The area of influence of soft money has just skyrocketed from \nelection to election since the new FEC ruling just a few years ago.\n  Another area is the straight old quid pro quo. We could add that as a \nfifth. If I give you so much money as a public official, then I want \nyou to pass a certain law for me; and you do it. There are examples of \nquid pro quo also. So, these are all areas that we cannot ignore from \nthe past. There are many of those things, just in those areas that I \nmentioned, that are flat illegal. Soft money is not illegal. It is \nperfectly legal now, but we have to make it illegal with McCain-\nFeingold, which I support fully and I am a cosponsor of. This is \nprobably the most runaway part of campaign financing that we have had \nin recent elections--certainly in this last election.\n  Now, along with soft money, that I make such a fuss about, there is \none other part. If we are going to correct this, there is one other \nthing we have to do, too. We cannot just see the money that was \nformerly going to soft money, to the parties and being misused then, \nbeing put into State races or into congressional races. We can't just \nsee that money then not go into soft money but go over into issue \nadvocacy ads and independent expenditures for the so-called issue \nadvocacy ads that can be put on in a particular campaign in the last \nfew days and influence a campaign, quite apart from the person running \nin that campaign who doesn't even have control of who is coming in and \nputting on TV ads either for or against him or her.\n  So we can't just do away with soft money and hope that will solve the \nproblem, because soft money is probably going to gravitate over to the \narea of issue advocacy or independent expenditures. If we are going to \ncorrect one, we have to correct the other; we have to deal with them \ntogether.\n  So the question is, how do we prevent soft money not only from going \ninto issue advocacy ads or independent expenditures, but also we want \nto make sure that we don't create a loophole here where the soft money \nnow will go by the many, many millions of dollars over to the States, \nwhich it would be legal to do right now, go to the States, and the \nState parties then would use it in particular campaigns within the \nState by putting on independent ads or issue advocacy ads in support of \ncongressional candidates, even those that are not State races, but \nthere is an interest in them. So you see how complex this whole thing \nbecomes.\n  Mr. President, those are a few views on some of the things that I see \nwith regard to campaign finance this year.\n  There are a couple of statements I would like to quote on the floor \ntoday. Will Rogers is looked at as one of our great political \ncommentators, in a humorous way, from years past. He did it in a way \nthat got the attention of the people. He was pretty caustic in his \ncomments sometimes. He made a statement once that might be applicable \ntoday, though. He said:\n\n       Wouldn't it be great if other countries started electing by \n     the ballot instead of by bullet, and us electing by the \n     ballot instead of by bullion?\n\n  I think he was right.\n  Another is a statement by Kin Hubbard, Frank McKinney Hubbard:\n\n       When a fellow says, ``It ain't the money but the principle \n     of the thing,'' it's the money.\n\n  And you can bet on that.\n  Jesse Unruh of California some years ago said:\n\n       Money is the mother's milk of politics.\n\n  And that's sure true. It is as true today as it has ever been before.\n  Let me finish up where I started off today with this. I am afraid by \nour talk here about what is the potential for the future that we talk \nabout this in such terms to make our point on the floor that sometimes \nwe emphasize them to the point that we are about to increase what we \nare trying to prevent, and that is cynicism in this country.\n  By talking about the difficulties of campaign finance and the \ntransgressions against campaign finance law--which should never have \noccurred in the last election on both sides of the aisle, and they have \nto be corrected. I am not trying to say they are not important, but \nthey are. My whole statement today has been along the theme that this \nis a beginning of a rot we have to correct. So I am not trying to \nminimize these things.\n  I hope most of the people of the country realize that most of the \npeople who run for high office do so with very good purpose in mind. \nMost of the people here, I would say, are very talented people. Most of \nthem could probably be making more in business or in some corporate \nposition or outside of public office than they do here. Not all of \nthem, but certainly many people could. We have people running for \noffice who are very fine people.\n  But this is a danger when we see things like what happened in this \nlast election--the potential with foreign money, although all the sums \ntalked about or rumored, whatever came from foreign money is a tiny \nlittle pittance, just a tiny little nothing almost compared to what was \nspent. That $790 million I indicated was spent in the last election \njust in congressional elections. Not even the Presidential election is \nincluded in that.\n  So a few million dollars that may have come from some foreign source \nis a fairly small amount, but it is a danger sign. We have to regulate \nthat. We have to cut it off. We have to make our restrictions \nenforceable if we are not to see that grow into the future, and that is \nthe danger; that is the danger. We have to make sure that with third-\nparty transfer of money, we don't just find rampant disregard of our \nlaws, and then people just saying, ``I know my\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\nlimit is'' so and so ``under the law, I will give you'' this, this, \n``and somebody else, and I will contribute a lot more than my Federal \nlimit was ever supposed to be and I won't get caught anyway.''\n\n  We have to make sure that doesn't occur. We have to make sure the \nmisuse of tax exempts, which ran rampant this last time, as conduits \nfrom people who had special interest money to put in --and they put it \nin by the millions. We have evidence of where that went and how it \nwent. I hope we are able to put that on in the hearings before our \ncampaign finance investigation ends on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  All these areas--whether it is foreign money or third-party money or \ntax-exempt money or soft money or quid pro quo--all these areas must be \nenforced with existing law. Then we can go ahead with bringing soft \nmoney under better regulation than we have ever done in the past. In \nfact, there isn't any regulation on it to speak of now. Then we are \nmaking real progress.\n  I believe the McCain-Feingold bill, which I fully support, is a \nstart. I don't view it as anything more than a start. I don't think \nSenator McCain or Senator Feingold feels it is anything but a start \nright now, but it is a start. It is a start in showing people that, \nyes, we can act here in Washington; yes, when we do see a danger for \nthe future, when we see some rot beginning on this body politic, we can \ncut that out, we can correct it, we have the capability to do it and we \ncan restore confidence.\n  Where we see cynicism and we see disregard for law, we see cynicism \nabout what may be going on with our Government, we can replace that, \nonce again, with real confidence, real faith in letting the people of \nthis country know that we are concerned and are willing to do something \nabout it.\n  That is the reason why I support the McCain-Feingold proposal so \nwholeheartedly. They are important, and I am hoping that we can really \nhave a vote up or down eventually. I know the so-called legislative \ntree has been filled that will try to thwart the passage of this \nlegislation, but I am hoping we will really see a vote possible on this \nlegislation before we finish with it. I guess the schedule is we will \nfinish with it sometime next week.\n  Mr. President, this was a rather lengthy statement. I will \nundoubtedly have more to say about this next week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared remarks be \nprinted in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Campaign Finance Reform\n\n                        (By Senator John Glenn)\n\n       ``Wouldn't it be great if [other countries] started \n     electing by the ballot instead of by bullet, and us electing \n     by the ballot instead of by bullion?''--Will Rogers.\n       ``When a fellow says, `It ain't the money but the principle \n     of the thing,' it's the money,''--Frank McKinney Hubbard \n     (``Kin Hubbard'').\n       ``Money is mother's milk of politics.''--Jesse Unruh.\n       Well, Mr. President, I have often wondered if and when this \n     day would come. I recognize that both the distinguished \n     Majority Leader and the equally distinguished Minority Leader \n     have worked long and hard to get this bill to the floor and I \n     congratulate them on their efforts. I also want to express my \n     appreciation of Senators McCain and Feingold as the authors \n     of this legislation and for their leadership on an issue that \n     truly goes to the heart of American values. Their bipartisan \n     cooperation has pointed us in the right direction and I hope \n     that we can follow their example. We now have an opportunity \n     to restore faith in our American system and renew our \n     commitment to government for all the people, all the time and \n     not some of the people some of the time, special interests \n     buying access too much of the time.\n       One thing is clear to me. Our current system is sick and \n     must be healed. We must work together to find a way to bring \n     that needed reform. Our nation is confronted by many concerns \n     and we have spent much of this year addressing some of those \n     problems through the budget, reconciliation, defense \n     authorization, appropriations bills, and the Chemical and \n     Biological Weapons Treaty. With this debate we turn our \n     attention to a more fundamental question: the role of money \n     in our electoral system. I believe that a simple principle \n     should apply in our democracy. We should encourage the active \n     participation of the greatest possible number of citizens and \n     restrain the undue influence of narrow factions and special \n     interests. Only by insuring that our electoral system is open \n     and fair can the notion of ``consent of the governed'' have \n     true meaning.\n       How we finance our election campaigns is a central feature \n     of how American citizens judge the integrity of our \n     democracy. Many Americans see our current campaign fund \n     raising practices as a form of corruption and because they \n     believe that some interests have an unfair advantage when it \n     comes to governmental decision making. I believe that this \n     contributes to a corrosive cynicism that undermines America. \n     When voters continually witness the political money chase \n     they conclude that our system is for sale, that politicians \n     are bought, and that policy decisions are made to favor the \n     highest bidder.\n       We have all noted the increasing numbers of people who lack \n     confidence in government and do not trust the government to \n     do the right thing. We have witnessed declining voting \n     participation.\n       Some would have us believe that campaign finance reform \n     isn't of any interest to the American public. Some say the \n     public doesn't care, why should we care? I think that's flat \n     wrong. I think the public does care.\n       Let's face it, the public continues to lose faith in their \n     federal government. Recent polls have shown that 70% of \n     Americans want campaign finance reform, but only 30% believe \n     it will happen. And perhaps most disturbing of all, three out \n     of four interviewed do not trust us in Washington to do what \n     is right.\n       Let me read a quote about government leaders from one of \n     those people interviewed: ``I don't expect too much . . . \n     They're all crooked. It's just a degree of crookedness.''\n       That's chilling. And I'm afraid it's a sentiment that is \n     all too common.\n       Campaign finance reform is a perfect example of why the \n     public doesn't trust us.\n       Another recent poll (Center For Responsive Politics, \n     conducted in early April) found that 60 percent of the people \n     polled thought campaign finance reform should be a high \n     priority this year. And, late last year, (Mellman Group, \n     October, 1996) showed that 59 percent supported the concept \n     of public financing of elections to clean up this mess.\n       Yet, despite its desire to see solutions, the public simply \n     hears out of Washington that no one cares about campaign \n     finance reform. The public sees both Democrats and \n     Republicans sling mud at each other over each party's \n     excesses, but they don't hear a real desire to clean up the \n     mud. They hear about attempts to block reform, that reform \n     isn't the ``American way.''\n       Poll after poll shows the public wants campaign finance \n     reform. I think we should listen.\n       At the same time we have seen spending in campaigns rise \n     through the roof. According to the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC) the cost of all Congressional campaigns more \n     than doubled from $354.7 million in 1981-2 to $765.3 million \n     in 1995-96. Major political party efforts at the local, state \n     and national level increased from $254.1 million in 1981-2 to \n     $881 million in 1995-96.\n       Of course most of this money has been used to purchase more \n     and more broadcast time at ever increasing costs to reach \n     more and more voters over an ever longer campaign. One \n     could conclude that the amount of money raised and spent \n     has had a negative effect on voter attitudes and \n     participation.\n\n\n                          watergate and reform\n\n       We all remember the Watergate era that led to the campaign \n     finance rules under which we currently operate. Reform at \n     that time was long overdue. Important improvements were made \n     at that time. Prior to the enactment of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act and its amendments, some campaigns conducted \n     business through slush funds and hush money. Major reforms \n     included the establishment of the Federal Election \n     Commission, requiring reporting of contributions and \n     expenditures by federal candidates, limits on individual \n     contributions, and spending limits and partial public \n     financing of presidential campaigns.\n       Unfortunately, those reforms have been eroded over the \n     years by FEC rulings and Supreme Court decisions such as \n     Buckley v. Valeo--overruling spending limits for \n     Congressional candidates and equating money with free \n     speech--and Colorado Campaign Republican Committee v. FEC--\n     allowing political parties to make independent expenditures.\n\n\n                           the road to reform\n\n       With this debate we continue the long battle to reform our \n     campaign finance system. The former Senator from Oklahoma, \n     Senator Boren first brought the need for reform to the \n     attention of the Senate in 1985. The battle having been \n     joined, it was difficult to get it considered in the 99th \n     Congress. Former Senator Goldwater of Arizona played an \n     important role.\n       In the 100th Congress, the Senate conducted a historical \n     record number of cloture votes. In 1988, we saw a scene right \n     out of Frank Capra's ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' with an \n     all night filibuster and the Sgt. At Arms arresting absent \n     Senators and bringing them to the Senate chamber. I believe \n     that our inability to bring about reform has made things \n     worse.\n\n\n                           current practices\n\n       Let me be clear. I do not believe that raising money for \n     campaigns is corrupt. I do not believe that our government is \n     corrupt because public officials raise money for campaigns. I \n     believe that fund raising and public policy decision making \n     can be kept separate. I believe that those who choose public \n     service have a high calling. This is an honorable\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\n     profession and I have always been proud to serve.\n       However, with the explosion of fund raising and the erosion \n     of our laws, many citizens believe that the credibility of \n     our electoral process has been impugned by the view that \n     special interests have special access and therefore have \n     undue influence.\n       We must reform our system to restore faith in our \n     democracy.\n       We all are witnesses to the perception that money has a \n     growing influence. Political parties and candidates are \n     engaged in an endless pursuit of campaign funds made up of \n     both hard and soft money. Not a day passes without a full \n     schedule of events, receptions, coffees, meetings, dinners, \n     lunches, discussions, and, forums--many ultimately intended \n     to establish the climate to eventually raise money.\n       Soft money, campaign contributions not directly used in \n     behalf of federal candidates and not required to be reported \n     has become the crack cocaine of politics and parties and \n     candidates are addicted.\n       As the ranking member of the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee I have spent all year looking into campaign fund \n     raising. It is clear to me that many contributors believe \n     that they get what they are seeking. They pay for access in \n     the legislative and executive branches, and they get it.\n       We have been examples of contributors who want to appear to \n     have influence by being seen with important officials and to \n     have their pictures taken as a way to impress others. We have \n     also seen contributors who have a special interest or \n     particular project that they want considered. Through their \n     contributions they obtain access.\n       Many contributors do have interests that can be affected by \n     government decisions. No one can underestimate the impact on \n     the American people when headline after headline links \n     governmental action and campaign contributions. The $50 \n     billion tax benefit for tobacco companies in this year's tax \n     bill, inserted in secret and with no debate, only serves to \n     make many citizens believe that the integrity of our \n     electoral process has been compromised by special interests.\n\n\n                             needed reform\n\n       Eventually, Mr. President, I believe that the answer to our \n     concern is to eliminate the role of private money in \n     campaigns. We should allow campaigns to be fairly and equally \n     underwritten by all Americans through a some form of publicly \n     supported financing.\n       That is why I joined with my colleagues Senator Kerry of \n     Massachusetts and Senator Wellstone of Minnesota in \n     cosponsoring a bill, the Clean Money Clean Campaign Act, \n     based upon the Maine plan to limit campaign spending, \n     prohibit special interest contributions, eliminate fund \n     raising efforts, provide equal funding and a level playing \n     field for all candidates and end the loopholes that have \n     wrecked our current system. Through a publicly funded \n     system we can end the current abuse and establish a system \n     that takes us back to our major responsibility, \n     representing the interests of ``all the people, all the \n     time''.\n       I recognize that the time has probably not yet come to move \n     to federal financing, but I believe that the more the \n     American people focus on the current system and its exploding \n     abuses, the more likely it will be that the support will grow \n     for such a change.\n\n\n                            McCain-Feingold\n\n       The bill before us originally contained spending limits for \n     Congressional candidates. In an effort to reach out for a \n     consensus on this issue, those provisions have been \n     eliminated. Nevertheless, we now consider a bill which I \n     believe addresses many important concerns.\n       We must address the question of soft money contributions. \n     We must find a way to require the disclosure of funds used \n     for express advocacy and issue advocacy.\n       I believe we have to take a hard look at the FEC. We must \n     have enforcement of election law--present or future--or we \n     encourage scofflaw parties and candidates. The FEC cannot do \n     an adequate job. Currently the FEC has 30 enforcement \n     attorneys. Mr. President, that is fewer than the number of \n     lawyers currently working on the Governmental Affairs \n     investigation. The FEC has two--count them--two full time \n     investigators. In order to insure better enforcement we must \n     consider that the $28 million FEC budget should be increased \n     and if expected to do an adequate job it should be nearly \n     doubled. Furthermore, while the FEC is being expanded I \n     believe that investigative assistance should be provided \n     by at least a small group of FBI agents.\n\n\n                       summary of fec budget woes\n\n       Fiscal 1995: Had over 10% of budget rescinded half way \n     through the fiscal year, the largest percentage agency \n     rescission of any government agency\n       Fiscal 1996: Sought $32 million but received only $26 \n     million with some funds ``fenced'' for particular purposes.\n       Fiscal 1997: Had travel budget limited and fenced such that \n     it was difficult to conduct depositions and court appearances \n     including those undertaken in connection with the Christian \n     Coalition litigation\n       Fiscal 1998: Asked both the House and Senate for $29 \n     million plus an additional $4.9 million just to deal with \n     cases arising from the 1996 federal election.

Mr. President, Americans have long been urged by our \ndoctors, our teachers, and our parents to eat at least five servings \nevery day of fruits and vegetables. When we follow this good advice, we \nassume that the fruits and vegetables that we are consuming are \nwholesome. Recent reports, however, have raised questions about the \nsafety of imported food products. Our markets are increasingly filled \nwith imported food that may not meet U.S. food safety standards. Thus, \nAmerican consumers seeking a healthy diet face the unappetizing risk of \nunknowingly subjecting themselves to tainted imported food.\n  As the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I am \nconducting an investigation into the safety of food imports. I have \nasked the General Accounting Office to examine whether or not the \nFederal Government adequately protects the American people from tainted \nimported food. We need to know how imports are currently being \ninspected, what resources are being devoted to food safety and whether \nthe highest risks are being given the highest priority in the \ninspection process. We should make certain, Mr. President, that our \nfood safety programs are effectively and efficiently managed to \nsafeguard the public's health.\n  Recent news reports have shown several instances where tainted \nimported food has caused serious illnesses. Food safety programs and \nfood safety problems are not limited to beef and poultry, and it is not \njust food coming from domestic facilities that can cause health \nproblems.\n  Imported fruits and vegetables in increasing numbers are causing \nserious illnesses. In March, over 260 children and teachers from \nMichigan developed hepatitis after eating frozen strawberries that were \nimported from Mexico. Those berries were illegally provided to the \nSchool Lunch Program, which requires food used to be produced in the \nUnited States. Instead, the tainted Mexican berries had been shipped to \nover 1,500 locations across the country, including my home State of \nMaine. In another example, over 2,000 people were infected with \ncyclospora in the last 2 years from eating tainted raspberries from \nGuatemala, making it the largest outbreak of food-borne disease in \nrecent years.\n  Mr. President, I believe Congress must thoroughly examine the safety \nof imported food products. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration \nand the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service \nhave shared responsibility for the regulation and inspection of \nimported food. Agriculture officials are responsible primarily for meat \nand poultry, while the Food and Drug Administration regulates and \ninspects other food products. Standards in enforcement are thus \ndifferent, depending on the type of food. In addition, the significant \nincrease in food imports has resulted in a system where consumers \ncannot be assured of the safety of the food they eat. A New York Times \narticle on September 29 of this year, just this past week, indicates \nthat food imports have doubled since the 1980s, straining the limits of \nour current inspection system.\n  Later this week, President Clinton is expected to announce several \ninitiatives to increase and improve Federal\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\nattention to food safety. I welcome the President's increased interest \nin the safety of imported food products, and when his proposal is \ntransmitted to the Congress, I will closely examine it to determine if \nit is, in fact, an effective and adequate response to this problem.\n  As chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I want \nto make sure that our current programs are being effectively managed \nand that both existing and new resources are efficiently administered \nto promote safe food, especially imported food.\n  Mr. President, the safety of food product imports is literally a \nlife-and-death issue for many Americans, especially our elderly and our \nchildren. Food safety deserves close attention of the administration \nand the Congress, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe months ahead as my subcommittee continues its investigation and \nconducts hearings on this important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10289-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the State of Mississippi is very proud of \nthe induction of Bailey Howell into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n  His college career at Mississippi State University still stands as \nthe most impressive in the school's history.\n  He was second only to Wilt Chamberlain in the 1959 NBA draft, and he \nbecame one of the best professional players ever.\n  Today, he is living in Starkville, MS, where he spends much of his \ntime engaged in church-related activities. He is a wonderful role model \nfor today's star athletes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two articles from the Clarion-Ledger \ndescribing his great career be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Clarion-Ledger, Sept. 29, 1997]\n\n                      Howell to Enter Hall of Fame\n\n                           (By Mike Knobler)\n\n       Mary Lou Howell will never forget what she said to the 6-\n     foot-7 stranger in 1958 at a Baton Rouge church.\n       ``I asked the dumbest question of all, `Do you play \n     basketball?' '' Howell recalls. ``I know he thought, `Oh, \n     this girl is really dumb.' ''\n       ``When I told my father, he said `He won't be interested in \n     you. He's really big-time.' ''\n       Dad, it turns out, was only half right about Bailey Howell, \n     who has been married to Mary Lou for 38 years and tonight \n     becomes the first Mississippi man inducted into the \n     Basketball Hall of Fame.\n       Bailry Howell's brilliant career, at Mississippi State \n     University and with four NBA teams, included enough honors \n     and statistical superlatives to fill most of this newspaper.\n       Thirty-eight years after his final MSU season, Howell still \n     holds numerous school records, including highest career \n     scoring average, most points in a game and most rebounds in a \n     game, season or career.\n       No wonder he was the second player picked in the 1959 NBA \n     draft, behind only Wilt Chamberlain.\n       But talk to Howell and the people who know him and you hear \n     less about the numbers and more about the man behind them, a \n     man dedicated to his family, to his God and to never-ending \n     competition.\n       Former Boston Celtics teammate Satch Sanders tells of \n     Howell's approach to pregame layup drills. Most players \n     jogged through them casually; Howell sprinted fullspeed.\n       ``You had to get out of the way,'' Sanders says. ``We'd \n     say, `Bailey, save something for the game.' His philosophy \n     was: If you ever take it easy going to the basket, there's a \n     strong possibility you'd do that in a game.''\n       Son-in-law Scott Stricklin tells of a two-on-two game he \n     played during his first vacation with the Howell family. It \n     was Stricklin and Howell against the two other sons-in-law.\n       ``The other guys wound up with bruises and knots on their \n     heads,'' Stricklin says. ``He was almost 60 and playing with \n     guys in their 20s, but he was so competitive it was like an \n     NBA championship game.''\n       Howell competes even when he's mowing his lawn. He times \n     himself, always pushing to work faster and more efficiently. \n     ``I'm one-third through,'' he'll shout.\n       That kind of relentless intensity helped make him a \n     dominating center in college and a six-time all-star forward \n     in the NBA.\n       Howell won NBA championships with the Celtics in 1968 and \n     1969 after winning State's first Southeastern Conference \n     championship in 1958. One of Howell's few regrets is that \n     that 24-1 team in 1958 wasn't allowed to try for an NCAA \n     championship. The Bulldogs were chosen for the NCAA \n     Tournament, but Mississippi government leaders barred State \n     from participating because it would have played against \n     racially integrated teams.\n       Decades later, coach Richard Williams paid his respect to \n     Howell by including him in the official traveling party for \n     State's 1995 trip to the NCAA regionals and its 1996 trip to \n     the Final Four.\n\n\n                           very special honor\n\n       Delta State University coach Margaret Wade and player Lusia \n     Harris are the only Mississippians in the Basketball Hall of \n     Fame. Howell joins them tonight. He'll be escorted by friend, \n     teammate and Hall of Famer John Havlicek.\n       ``It's just a very special honor and a thrill,'' Howell \n     says. ``To be recognized alongside those individuals that are \n     in there, it's just really, I really struggle with words to \n     express just how special it is.''\n       Bailey and Mary Lou Howell will be accompanied at tonight's \n     induction ceremony in Springfield, Mass., by their three \n     daughters. One of those daughters, Beth Hansen of Jackson, \n     named one of her sons after her dad. Bailey Hansen will be \n     there tonight, too.\n       Children and family have always been important to Bailey \n     Howell. One time, it carried over onto the basketball court.\n       As most parents do, Bailey and Mary Lou used to spell out \n     things around the house that they didn't want their young \n     daughters to understand. One night as an opponent lined up \n     for a free throw, Bailey turned to a teammate and said, ``If \n     you get this rebound, hit me. I'll be going b-a-c-k-d-double \n     o-r.''\n       During the season, the Howells used to live wherever Bailey \n     played--first Detroit, then Baltimore, then Boston and \n     finally Philadelphia. In the offseason, though, they always \n     returned to Starkville, where Bailey and Mary Lou still live.\n       When Bailey Howell retired in 1971, he thought about going \n     into coaching.\n       ``At 35, at the age where moving my children was really \n     bothering them, I decided that wasn't something I could do,'' \n     he says.\n       But he stayed involved in basketball by working for \n     shoemaker Converse for almost 23 years. And for six of the \n     last seven years, he has served as a role model at the NBA's \n     mandatory rookie orientation camp run by his former teammate \n     Sanders, an NBA vice president.\n       ``He'd talk about staying grounded, thinking in terms of \n     family, religion,'' Sanders says. ``Just homespun good sense. \n     Bailey has always been a highly respected player, but more \n     than that he has always been very grounded. The Hall of Fame \n     as far as I'm concerned will be a better place with Bailey in \n     it.''\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\n                           working for church\n\n       Nowadays, Bailey Howell, 60, puts his dedication to work \n     for the Church of Christ in Starkville. Bailey and Mary Lou \n     spent a month this summer with a church group teaching \n     conversational English in Sopot, Poland, near Gdansk.\n       ``His mind is very God-centered,'' Mary Lou Howell says. \n     ``We go to church and to Mississippi State sporting events.''\n       The Bulldogs have had many talented players since Howell, \n     but those who remember Howell's playing days say his ability, \n     charisma and class set him apart.\n       Lee Baker, then sports editor of the defunct Jackson Daily \n     News, won't forget the night he covered the final game of \n     Howell's junior season at Mississippi State. When Baker \n     arrived home, his wife was in the hospital delivering their \n     son.\n       He went to the hospital, then headed to the newspaper to \n     write.\n       ``We were going to name him John Berrian, after my \n     grandfather,'' Baker says. ``At the end of my column, I \n     announced the arrival of John Bailey Baker. My wife didn't \n     know her son's name until she read it in the paper.''\n\n\n                        baily howell highlights\n\n       Born Jan. 20, 1937, at Middleton, Tenn.\n       Elected Mr. Mississippi State by the student body.\n       Member, Phi Kappa Phi scholastic honorary society.\n       No. 2 scorer in MSU history with 2,030 points.\n       Led NCAA in shooting percentage (56.8) in 1957.\n       Made 10 NBA playoff appearances in 12 seasons.\n       Averaged 18.7 points and 9.9 rebounds for NBA career.\n       Upon retirement, ranked among NBA's top 10 in nine \n     categories, including points, rebounds and games played.\n\n\n                       baily howell's msu records\n\n       Scoring average, career: 27.1 points per game.\n       Point, game: 47 vs. Union, Dec. 4. 1958.\n       Free throws made, career: 682.\n       Free throw attempts, career: 892.\n       Free throws made, season:\n       243 in 1957-58.\n       Free-throw attempts, season: 315 in 1957-58.\n       Rebounds, career: 1,277.\n       Rebound average, career: 17.0 per game.\n       Rebounds, season: 492 in 1958.\n       Rebound average, season: 19.7 per game in 1956-57.\n       Rebounds, game: 34 vs. LSU, Feb. 1, 1957.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Clarion-Ledger, Sept. 30, 1997]\n\n              With Howell in Shrine, Celtics Keep Winning\n\n                             (By Jeff Donn)\n\n       Springfield, Mass.--Baily Howell still shudders at the \n     memory of his first season with the Boston Celtics.\n       Bob Cousy was retired. Bill Russell was no longer the \n     future of basketball. And the Celtics' march of eight \n     straight NBA championships ended in 1967 when Philadelphia \n     finally broke through.\n       ``My first year there we lost, so here comes the kiss of \n     death!'' said Howell, a star at Mississippi State. ``Before I \n     even got to the Celtics, the team was getting old together.''\n       Winning, though, had not gotten old to them. With Howell, \n     player-coach Russell, John Havlicek and Sam Jones, they went \n     on to claim the last two of 10 titles within 11 seasons--\n     something no other team has approached. And they have been \n     reaping honors since, their latest on Monday with the entry \n     of Howell into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n       Others inducted Monday night were three coaches--Pete \n     Carril of Princeton, Don Haskins of Texas-El Paso and Antonio \n     Diaz-Miguel of Spain--as well as 1980s NBA scoring leader \n     Alex English and women's stars Denise Curry and Joan \n     Crawford.\n       Howell, a 6-foot-7, 220-pounder and the forerunner of \n     today's power forward, is the 185th Celtics player and 23rd \n     team entry, including coach Red Auerbach, in the Hall of \n     Fame. No other team approaches those numbers.\n       Howell averaged 18.7 points and 10 rebounds game.\n       ``Today, everything is such big business,'' said Howell, \n     60, who now manages commercial real estate. ``The game is a \n     game people love to watch and love to play at all levels. \n     It's not just how much money somebody makes and how much \n     profit.''\n       Carril's Princeton teams made their name by upending more \n     athletic opponents. On the sidelines was Carril, a rumpled \n     elf with mussed hair who gesticulated like a New York City \n     cabby.\n       Yet Carril, 67, now an assistant coach for the NBA's \n     Sacramento Kings, is the only Division I college coach to win \n     more than 500 games without the help of sports scholarships.\n       Did Princeton's half-court game and low scores ever get \n     tedious?\n       ``The only time I ever heard the word `boring' was from the \n     other side,'' Carril said.\n       Haskins also made a reputation by outplaying better known \n     opponents. His team--then called Texas Western--fielded five \n     black starters to defeat Adolph Rupp's all-white Kentucky \n     stars in the 1966 NCAA championship.\n       With his unorthodox high-release jumper, English was the \n     consummate scorer, hitting for 19,682 points in the 1980s, \n     but unable to make it to the NBA Finals.\n       ``He scored so easy and so often that it looked like he was \n     bored out there,'' Howell said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10290-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10291-S10292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, pursuant to section 303 of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1383), a notice \nof proposed rulemaking was submitted by the Office of Compliance, U.S. \nCongress. The notice publishes proposed amendments to regulations \npreviously adopted by the Board implementing various labor and \nemployment and public access laws to covered employees within the \nlegislative branch.\n  Section 304(b) requires this notice to be printed in the \nCongressional Record, therefore I ask unanimous consent that the notice \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the notice was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \n                     Amendments to Procedural Rules\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n       Summary: The Executive Director of the Office of Compliance \n     is proposing to amend the Procedural Rules of the Office of \n     Compliance to cover the General Accounting Office (``GAO'') \n     and the Library of Congress (``Library'') and their \n     employees. The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (``CAA''), 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1301-1438, applies the rights \n     and protections of eleven labor and employment and public \n     access laws to covered employees and employing offices within \n     the Legislative Branch. Five sections of the CAA, which apply \n     rights and protections of the Employee Polygraph Protection \n     Act of 1988 (``EPPA''), the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (``WARN Act''), the Uniformed Services \n     Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994 (``USERRA''), and the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''), and \n     which prohibit intimidation or reprisal for the exercise of \n     rights under the CAA, become effective with respect to GAO \n     and the Library on December 30, 1997. This Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking (``NPRM'') proposes to extend the coverage of the \n     Procedural Rules to include GAO and the Library and their \n     employees for purposes of proceedings relating to these five \n     sections of the CAA and the general provisions of the rules \n     relating to ex parte communications. These proposed \n     amendments to the Procedural Rules have been approved by the \n     Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after the date of \n     publication of this NPRM in the Congressional Record.\n       Addresses: Submit comments in writing (an original and 10 \n     copies) to the Executive Director, Office of Compliance, Room \n     LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. Those wishing to receive \n     notification of receipt of comments are requested to include \n     a self-addressed, stamped post card. Comments may also be \n     transmitted by facsimile (``FAX'') machine to (202) 426-1913. \n     This is not a toll-free call. Copies of comments submitted by \n     the public will be available for review at the Law Library \n     Reading Room, Room LM-201, Law Library of Congress, James \n     Madison Memorial Building, Washington, D.C., Monday through \n     Friday, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.\n       For further information contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, at (202) 724-9250 (voice), (202) 426-1912 \n     (TTY). This notice will also be made available in large print \n     or braille or on computer disk, upon request to the Office of \n     Compliance.\n\n\n                       SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\n\n              1. Background and Purpose of this Rulemaking\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     the ``Act''), Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  \n     1301-1438, applies the rights and protections of eleven labor \n     and employment and public access laws to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the Legislative Branch. With \n     respect to GAO and the Library, five sections of the CAA will \n     become effective as of December 30, 1997: (a) section 204, \n     applying rights and protections of the Employee Polygraph \n     Protection Act of 1988 (``EPPA''), restricts the use of lie \n     detector tests by employing offices; (b) section 205, \n     applying rights and protections of the Worker Adjustment and \n     Retraining Notification Act (``WARN Act''), assures covered \n     employees of notice before office closings and mass layoffs; \n     (c) section 206, applying rights and protections of the \n     Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994 \n     (``USERRA''), protects job rights of covered employees who \n     serve in the military and other uniformed services; (d) \n     section 215, applying rights and protections of the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''), \n     protects the safety and health of covered employees from \n     hazards in their places of employment; and (e) section 207 \n     forbids intimidation or reprisal against covered employees \n     for exercising rights under other sections of the CAA.\n       The Procedural Rules of the Office of Compliance establish \n     procedures for considering\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\n     matters that involve employing offices and covered employees \n     other than GAO and the Library and their employees. The \n     purpose of this rulemaking is to extend the rules to cover \n     GAO and the Library and their employees for purposes of any \n     proceedings in which GAO or the Library or their employees \n     may be involved as employing offices or covered employees.\n       The Board of Directors has also proposed to extend its \n     substantive regulations implementing sections 204, 205, and \n     215 of the CAA to cover GAO and the Library and their \n     employees. The NPRM was published in the September 9, 1997 \n     issue of the Congressional Record, at 143 Cong. Rec. S9014.\n\n                    2. Record of Earlier Rulemakings\n\n       To avoid duplication of effort, the Executive Director \n     plans to rely generally on the record of earlier rulemakings. \n     The current Procedural Rules of the Office of Compliance were \n     proposed, adopted, and amended in three phases during the \n     past two years. See 141 Cong. Rec. S17012 (daily ed. Nov. 14, \n     1995) (NPRM); 141 Cong. Rec. S19239 (daily ed. Dec. 22, 1995) \n     (final rules); 142 Cong. Rec. H7450 (daily ed. July 11, 1996) \n     (NPRM); 142 Cong. Rec. S10980 (daily ed. Sept. 19, 1996) \n     (final rules); 143 Cong. Rec. S25 (daily ed. Jan. 7, 1997) \n     (NPRM); 143 Cong. Rec. H1879 (daily ed. Apr. 24, 1997) (final \n     rules). A copy of the Procedural Rules of the Office of \n     Compliance is available for inspection at the Law Library \n     Reading Room, at the address and times stated at the \n     beginning of this Notice, and may also be viewed or \n     downloaded from the Office of Compliance's internet Website \n     at http://www.compliance.gov/proful3.html, or http://\nwww.access.gpo.gov/compliance/proful3.html.\n\n                         3. Proposed Amendments\n\n       The Executive Director is presently aware of no reason why \n     the procedural rules to cover GAO and the Library and their \n     employees should be separate or substantively different from \n     the rules already adopted for other employing offices and \n     their employees. The Executive Director therefore proposes in \n     this NPRM to extend the coverage of the rules already adopted \n     to include GAO and the Library and their employees, and to \n     make no other substantive change to the rules. Specifically, \n     the NPRM proposes to amend the definitions established in \n     section 1.02 of the Procedural Rules of the Office of \n     Compliance: (a) by including the employees of GAO and the \n     Library in the definition of ``covered employee,'' (b) by \n     including GAO and the Library in the definition of \n     ``employing office,'' and (c) by adding a new paragraph (q) \n     to section 1.02 specifying that GAO and the Library and their \n     employees are included in these definitions only for the \n     purposes of proceedings involving sections 204, 205, 206, \n     207, or 215 of the CAA or for purposes of the rules regarding \n     ex parte communications. A technical correction is also \n     necessary in the language being amended.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ In section 1.02(b) of the Procedural Rates of the Office \n     of Compliance, reference to the Office of Technology \n     Assessment is being removed, as that office no longer exists.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                         4. Request for Comment\n\n       The Executive Director invites comment on these proposed \n     amendments generally and invites comment specifically on \n     whether there is any reason why the rules for GAO and the \n     Library and their employees should be separate or different \n     from the rules already adopted for other employing offices \n     and their employees.\n       Signed at Washington, DC., on this 30th day of September, \n     1997.\n\n                                              Ricky Silberman,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                             Office of Compliance.\n       Accordingly, the Executive Director of the Office of \n     Compliance hereby proposes the following amendments to the \n     Procedural Rules of the Office of Compliance:\n       It is proposed that section 1.02 of the Procedural Rules of \n     the Office of Compliance be amended by revising paragraphs \n     (b) and (h) and by adding at the end of the section a new \n     paragraph (q) to read as follows:\n     Sec. 1.02 Definitions.\n       ``Except as otherwise specifically provided in these rules, \n     for purposes of this Part:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``(b) Covered employee.

Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to record my \ncomments regarding the conference report on the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill.\n  This legislation will help fund national functions, such as law \nenforcement and delivery of the mail. The law-enforcement provisions \ninclude an important anticrime initiative for Florida, which is \nstrongly supported by public-safety officials. The anticrime provision \nwould fund the establishment of a high intensity drug trafficking area \nin central Florida.\n  I have worked closely with colleagues Senator Connie Mack and \nCongressman John Mica of Florida to include this measure in the \nconference report.\n  In an effort to fight crime and to support law enforcement, I voted \nfor the conference report for the appropriations for the Treasury \nDepartment, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the \nPresident, and certain independent agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1998.\n  This conference report also contains a provision to adjust \ncongressional pay for cost of living. When the Senate considered its \nversion of this appropriations bill, the legislation did not include a \npay adjustment for Members of Congress. The record reflects that I \nsupport the Senate version of this legislation that was submitted to a \nHouse-Senate conference.\n  If I had the opportunity to vote on the proposed adjustment as a \nseparate, stand-alone measure, I would have voted ``no.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10292-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10292-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10292-S10293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 1, 1997, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2203.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe nonrefundable personal credits, the standard deduction, and the \ndeduction for personal exemptions in determining alternative minimum \ntax liability; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             alternative minimum tax liability legislation\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nensure that families are not denied the tax relief we promised them \nunder the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  What we promised under the Taxpayer Relief Act was a child credit to \nhelp families raise their kids and an education credit to help make \nhigher education more affordable. As it turns out, the reality may be \nfar different. What we may be doing is throwing middle-class families \ninto the alternative minimum tax [AMT] simply because they take \nadvantage of the new child and education credits. This will happen \nbecause under current law, individuals pay the greater of their regular \ntax owed minus nonrefundable tax credits or the AMT which cannot be \nreduced by these nonrefundable credits.\n  Under current law, the child credit and the education credit won't be \nallowed under the AMT. As a result, average-sized families with \nchildren are more likely to be thrown into the AMT simply by using \nthese credits. Believe me, this is not the place we want to be sending \nthem.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to one that was \nintroduced last week by Congresswoman Kennelly of Connecticut. By her \ncalculations, in 2002, a full 2 million families will be in the AMT \nbecause of the family credit alone. For illustrative purposes, I will \ngive you just one example of the kinds of people who will get hurt: A \ntwo-parent family with a gross income of $67,700 and three children, \nincluding one in college, would fall into the AMT and lose nearly \n$1,500 of the $2,500 in combined child and education credits that we \npromised them.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is simple. It would allow \ntaxpayers to take the nonrefundable personal credits--the dependent \ncare credit, the child credit, and the education credit under the AMT. \nIt would also make the standard deduction and the personal exemptions \ndeductible under the AMT.\n  As Congresswoman Kennelly has noted, ``The AMT was meant to ensure \nthat sophisticated taxpayers couldn't zero out their taxes. It was \nnever intended that your children would throw you into the AMT.'' We \nneed to deliver on the family tax relief promises we made in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY:\n  S. 1243, A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to enhance \nsafety on two-lane rural highways; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                      the rural highway safety act\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I recently introduced the Highway Safety \nPriority Act which proposed to make safety a primary consideration in \nhighway investments.\n  Traffic accidents are part of a national health epidemic responsible \nfor the loss of 1.2 million preretirement years of life a year; more \nthan is lost to cancer or heart disease. It is the leading cause of \ndeath for Americans between the ages of 15 and 24. Last year, more than \n41,900 Americans died from this epidemic and more than 3 million \nsuffered serious injury. In Nebraska traffic accidents claimed 293 \nlives in 1996 up from 254 the year before. Most tragic, is the fact \nthat this epidemic is almost 100 percent preventable.\n  To address this problem, the Congress must focus resources where they \nwill do the most good. Throughout America there are two lane, two way \nroads which expose drivers to an unacceptably high level of risk. These \nhigh risk ``killer roads'' suffer from poor engineering, poor pavement, \nnarrow shoulders and increasing levels of traffic. Because these roads \nare often in rural areas, feeding into the larger arteries, they are \nfrequently overlooked by State and local roads departments in favor of \nthe larger more modern and inherently safe portions of the National \nHighway System.\n  If we are to be serious about reducing death and accidents on \nAmerica's roads, we need to pay greater attention to the roads which \nfeed into the National Highway System. The Lincoln Journal Star \nreported in May that 70 percent of all Nebraska accidents occur on \nrural roads.\n  Today, I introduce legislation which proposes an aggressive efforts \nto make\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\nkiller roads safer. This legislation, like the Highway Safety Priority \nAct was prepared with significant assistance of Dr. Jerry Donaldson, of \nAdvocates for Highway Safety. Dr. Donaldson is one of the Nation's pre-\neminent highway safety experts.\n  As the Senate prepares to consider the new highway bill, I urge my \ncolleagues to consider and support the Rural Road Safety Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the ordered to be printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1243\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Highway Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RURAL 2-LANE HIGHWAY SAFETY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 162.

A bill \n        to amend title 11, United States Code, to protect certain \n        charitable contributions, and for other purposes; to the \n        Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND CHARITABLE DONATIONS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Religious \nLiberty and Charitable Donations Protection Acts. This bill represents \na giant step forward in protecting the religious freedom of many \nAmericans who tithe. In the House of Representatives, Congressman Ron \nPackard will today introduce a companion measure. I ask consent that \nthe bill be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n\n  As my colleagues may know, bankruptcy judges across the country have \nbeen ordering churches to refund large sums of money when a parishioner \ndeclares bankruptcy. This causes serious hardship to churches and is a \nfrontal assault on religious freedom of worship. After the Supreme \nCourt's recent decision striking the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n[RFRA] down as unconstitutional, I believe that Congress has a \nresponsibility to act now to protect religious freedom. Because I chair \nthe Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts--which has \nprimary jurisdiction over bankruptcy--I have an obligation to respond \nto this renewed threat to religious liberty.\n  Of course, there are other areas where Congress needs to protect \nreligious freedom, and I look forward to assisting Chairman Hatch--who \nis a strong leader in protecting religious liberty--in these efforts.\n  But in the context of tithing and bankruptcy, I feel the time to act \nis now. The Supreme Court just vacated and remanded a case from the \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals which had ruled that RFRA protected \nchurches from bankruptcy lawsuits seeking the return of money given as \na tithe. This is a particular concern to me, since my home State of \nIowa is in the eighth circuit and will be affected by this court case. \nThe pastor of the church involved in this case, Pastor Steven Goold of \nthe Crystal Free Evangelical Church, testified before my subcommittee \nas to the difficulties his church has faced in trying to protect itself \nfrom bankruptcy judges, including the huge legal costs associated with \nfighting the bankruptcy judge's ruling. Pastor Goold supports this \nlegislation, as does Americans United for Separation of Church and \nState. So, the bill has broad support from many diverse sectors of our \nsociety.\n  In addition to preventing Federal judges from ordering churches to \npay refunds of previous tithes, the legislation I'm introducing today \nwill protect postbankruptcy tithing in chapter 13 cases. As currently \ninterpreted, chapter 13, which permits debtors to repay their creditors \nat a discounted rate, also allows debtors to budget a moderate amount \nof money for entertainment expenses. But, several courts have said that \ndebtors can't budget money to tithe to their church. In other words, if \nyou're in chapter 13 bankruptcy, you can budget money for a hamburger \nand a movie, but you can't take that same money and give it to your \nchurch--even if you believe your faith requires that.\n  This is an obvious assault on the freedom of religion. Would our \nfounding fathers have wanted a Federal judge to tell a citizen that \nhe's not allowed to tithe to his church? Obviously not. Such a \nsituation is antithetical to the American tradition of liberty and \nseparation of church from State.\n  As a result of my hearing, I have made several minor changes to \naccommodate various concerns that have been raised about possible \nunintended consequences. I hope that the legislation as now drafted \nwill receive the support of every Member of Congress who is concerned \nabout protecting freedom generally and restoring freedom of religion--\nour first freedom--to its rightful place in American society.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in the amendments made by this Act is intended to \n     limit the applicability of the Religious Freedom Restoration \n     Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2002bb et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Reid and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1247. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to limit the \namount of recoupment from veterans' disability compensation that is \nrequired in the case of veterans who have received special separation \nbenefits from the Department of Defense; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n        THE SPECIAL SEPARATION BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Special \nSeparation Benefits [SSB] Improvement Act of 1997. This legislation \nwould address the unfair provision that double-taxes veterans who \nparticipate in the special separation benefits downsizing program run \nby the Department of Defense [DOD].\n  Since 1991, in an effort by the DOD to downsize the armed services, \ncertain military personnel have been eligible for a special separation \nbenefit [SSB]. However, since the inception of this program recipients \nwho are subsequently determined to have a service-connected disability \nmust offset the full SSB amount paid to that individual through the \nwithholding of disability compensation by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs [VA]. Because of these cost cutting provisions, veterans who \nparticipate in the DOD's downsizing by selecting an SSB lump sum \npayment are forced to pay back the full, pre-tax amount in disability \ncompensation--offsetting money that the disabled veteran would never \nsee. This is a gross injustice to veterans by double taxing their hard \nearned benefits.\n  My bill would ease this double taxation for all members who accept an \nSSB package, and make these alterations retroactive to December 5, \n1991. Thus, service members not able to receive payment concurrently \nsince 1991 will be reimbursed for their lost compensation portion that \nwas taxed. The near-term costs of this bill were estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office to be less than $500,000 through the year \n2000 and about $2 million in 2002 --barely a fraction of a percentage \nof our annual spending on compensation and benefits for former military \npersonnel.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting the \ndouble-taxing of veterans' benefits by the Government.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor \nto the Special Separation Benefits [SSB] Improvement Act of 1997. \nOffered by my colleague on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs--\nSenator Jeffords, this legislation will correct a current injustice \nwhere service connected disabled veterans, who participate in the \nspecial separation benefits program [SSB], are wrongly doubled taxed on \ntheir benefits.\n  In 1991, the Department of Defense [DOD], in an effort to downsize \nthe armed services, established the SSB, which gives military personnel \na lump sum payment to retire. However, for those veterans who are \nsubsequently determined to have a service-connected disability, their \nSSB benefit amount is offset by withholding the veteran's disability \ncompensation from the VA. A veteran only receives the SSB benefits \nafter taxes are withheld. At the same time, disability compensation is \nnot taxed. The injustice is that the veteran must repay with his or her \ndisability compensation the pre-tax amount of the SSB payment--in \neffect double taxing the veteran's benefits.\n  The Special Separation Benefits [SSB] Improvement Act of 1997 eases \nthe double taxation for all members who participated in the SSB program \nretroactively to December 5, 1991. These servicemembers will receive \npayment for their lost compensation portion that was taxed. According \nto the Congress Budget Office [CBO], the near term costs are estimated \nto be less than $500,000 through the year 2000. For this small amount, \nCongress has the opportunity to correct an injustice against our \nveterans who have given so much.\n  I hope that my colleagues can join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10293-5", "month": "10", "year":

Mr. President, I ask that the text of the my remarks \nbefore the First International Conservative Congress be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The text of the remarks follows:\n\n  Remarks by Senator Jon Kyl at the First International Conservative \n                      Congress--September 28, 1997\n\n\n         defining a conservative approach to defending the west\n\n       Thank you for inviting me to address the conference.\n       A conservative and internationalist approach to foreign \n     policy is consistent. For example, during the Cold War Ronald \n     Reagan worked not just to contain communism but to expand \n     democracy. NATO expansion is a contemporary example where \n     conservatives believe the U.S. should remain involved \n     internationally to promote democracy, free markets, and to \n     hedge against a revival of communism. A successful \n     internationalist policy requires that you have firm clear \n     national goals and the means and will to achieve them \n     strategically.\n       The Clinton Administration pursues a foreign policy without \n     clear goals or the will to act decisively and is squandering \n     the national security means left to it by a dozen years of \n     Republican presidency. It emphasizes hope over reality and \n     reliance on arms control agreements like the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) \n     Treaty, and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) over a \n     stronger defense. And political benefit over national \n     security, as in its decisions to cave in to the concerns of \n     some in industry in irresponsibly relaxing export controls on \n     key items like encryption technology and supercomputers.\n       Today's debate is similar to that which took place during \n     the Cold War between those who favored detente and arms \n     treaties and those who believed in a rational, tough policy \n     of peace through strength. During the Cold War, the \n     proponents of detente argued that the U.S. should overlook \n     violations of promises and arms control agreements because of \n     our tense relations with the Soviet Union and China. Today, \n     the supporters of ``engagement'' say we should overlook \n     violations of such treaties because of our improved relations \n     with Russia and China. The result is the same--a muddled, \n     confused foreign policy. But it hasn't stopped the \n     Administration from proposing even more treaties, even as \n     existing treaties are continually violated by all but the \n     U.S.\n\n\n                             proliferation\n\n       I want to focus on how conservatives in the West believe we \n     should deal with the threat posed by the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, which is \n     the key national security challenge facing us today.\n       As with so many other areas, the Clinton Administration's \n     efforts to address this issue have been long on rhetoric and \n     short on action. In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive \n     Order 12938 declaring that the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction and the means of delivering them constitutes \n     ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \n     security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \n     States,'' and that he had, therefore, decided to ``declare \n     a national emergency to deal with that threat.'' The \n     President reaffirmed this Executive Order in 1995 and \n     1996. But since issuing this order, the Administration has \n     primarily focused on concluding arms control agreements \n     and sending diplomatic protest notes to combat this \n     growing threat.\n\n\n                               The Threat\n\n       Rogue nations that are hostile to the United States are the \n     primary proliferation threat, though the Russian arsenal \n     remains the largest potential threat. Iran is of particular \n     concern. Tehran is aggressively pursuing the development of \n     nuclear weapons. On January 19, 1995, the Washington Times \n     reported that Western intelligence agencies believe Iran is \n     using its civilian nuclear power program as a cover for \n     acquiring the technology and expertise to build nuclear \n     weapons. According to the Times, the CIA estimates Iran is \n     about 5-7 years away from building nuclear weapons, but could \n     shorten that timetable if it received foreign assistance.\n       Iran's chemical and biological weapons programs began in \n     the early 1980's and are now capable of producing a variety \n     of highly lethal agents. Iran currently has Scud-B and Scud-C \n     missiles also working to develop the ability to domestically \n     produce longer-range missiles. On September 10, 1997, the \n     Washington Times disclosed that Russia is assisting Iran with \n     the development of two ballistic missiles that could be \n     fielded in as little as three years. One of the missiles will \n     reportedly have sufficient range to allow Tehran to strike \n     targets as far away as Germany. In addition, other rogue \n     states like Iraq, Libya, Syria, and North Korea are also \n     aggressively pursuing ballistic missile and nuclear, \n     biological, and chemical weapons programs.\n\n\n        How Should the West Respond to the Proliferation Threat?\n\n       We need an integrated strategy combining three elements: \n     (1) responsible export controls, (2) firm economic and \n     diplomatic actions to create incentives and disincentives to \n     prevent the spread of missiles and weapons of mass \n     destruction, and, (3) ultimately, robust defenses to deter \n     and respond to attacks.\n       The Clinton Administration has irresponsibly relaxed U.S. \n     export controls on key technologies like encryption, machine \n     tools, and supercomputers. For example, in 1994, the \n     Administration approved the sale of machine tools to China \n     that were intended to be used to produce McDonnell Douglas \n     civilian airliners. Just sic months after the export licenses \n     were approved, the company discovered the machine tools had \n     been diverted to a facility where cruise missiles and fighter \n     aircraft are produced for the Chinese military. In addition, \n     China has purchased 47 supercomputers form the U.S. and one \n     of Russia's premier nuclear weapons facilities has bought \n     four supercomputers from a U.S. firm as well.\n       Multilateral control regimes like the Australia Group, \n     restricting chemical trade, the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime, and the Nuclear Supplier Group can limit the \n     spread of sensitive technology. But as we learned through \n     our experience with COCOM during the Cold War, even the \n     best controls only slow the spread of the technology \n     because determined nations find ways to circumvent the \n     controls or eventually develop the technology themselves. \n     We also must guard against a reliance on arms control \n     agreements like the CWC and the CTBT that are not global \n     or verifiable, and therefore not effective or useful.\n       We should make it unprofitable for countries to supply \n     missiles and weapons of mass destruction technology to rogue \n     regimes. For example, the annual foreign aid bill recently \n     passed by the Senate conditions U.S. aid to Russia on a halt \n     to nuclear and missile cooperation with Iran. Western nations \n     can also impose economic sanctions on supplier countries and \n     companies to provide disincentives for them to continue this \n     dangerous trade. In addition, we should use convert action to \n     raise the costs to countries that are suppliers of this \n     sensitive technology.\n       Ultimately, we need to maintain strong defense capabilities \n     to deter and respond to attacks involving weapons of mass \n     destruction and ballistic missiles. By maintaining a robust, \n     credible nuclear weapons capability, the U.S. can deter rogue \n     nations from using weapons of mass destruction against U.S. \n     forces or our allies. The U.S. should also improve our \n     chemical and biological defenses. As we learned during the \n     recent Senate debate over the Chemical Weapons Convention, \n     the U.S. military's chemical and biological defense programs \n     are underfunded and are inadequate to meet the current and \n     projected threat.\n\n\n                       Ballistic Missile Defense\n\n       The West is nearly defenseless against the expanding \n     missile threat we face. Space-based systems offer a promising \n     long-term solution and should be pursued. Sea-based missile \n     defenses based on the Navy's AEGIS class ships, however, have \n     the potential to provide near-term, flexible, and affordable \n     protection for U.S. forces and our allies abroad. Sea-based \n     systems would allow for ascent phase intercept of missiles \n     armed with chemical or biological warheads.\n       Sea-based systems are more affordable because the U.S. has \n     already invested $50 billion in the AEGIS fleet. Development \n     of a sea-based theater missile defense could be completed in \n     five years and deployment of 650 interceptors on 22 ships \n     could cost as little as $5 billion. This system could then \n     evolve into a national missile defense system, whose \n     development, production, and deployment could be completed in \n     6-10 years for $12-17 billion, according to preliminary CBO \n     estimates.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       There are two points of view on how to address this threat. \n     We can either talk tough, and even in the face of \n     incontrovertible evidence, overlook arms control violations \n     for\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\n     fear of damaging our relations with other nations.

Mr. President, the American Fisheries Act, S. \n1221, was introduced last week by Senators Stevens, Murkowski, Hollings \nand myself. This bill represents another major milestone in our long \nefforts to reserve U.S. fishery resources for bona fide U.S. citizens \nas well as take steps to substantially improve the conservation and \nmanagement of our Nation's fishery resources through a reduction in the \novercapitalization of our fishing fleets. To put the bill in \nperspective, I wish to remind my colleagues of the steps taken in the \npast to establish our fishery conservation zone now called the \nExclusive Economic Zone or EEZ, to support an American preference for \nharvesting and processing fishery resources within that zone, to \neliminate foreign fishing in our EEZ whenever sufficient U.S. capacity \nexisted, and finally to reduce the conservation and management problems \nassociated with excess capacity. The historical basis for such a bill \nis well established in U.S. fishery policy.\n\n\n                             The Open Seas\n\n  For hundreds of years, a basic component of the freedom of the seas \nhad been the freedom of fishing. Nations claimed narrow territorial \nseas where they exercised sovereignty on and above the surface down to \nand including the seabed, subject only to the right of innocent \npassage. Originally, this territorial sea was limited to 3 miles out \nfrom the coastline--that distance being the range which a cannon-ball \ncould be fired from the shore to protect the coastal State's interest. \nOutside of the territorial sea, all nations enjoyed free access to \nfishery resources on the high seas, subject only to limitations imposed \nby international agreements and a general yet unenforceable \nunderstanding to conserve the resource.\n\n\n                Establishing the Exclusive Economic Zone\n\n  This concept was radically changed in 1945 with the issuance of the \nTruman Proclamation which declared that the continental shelf \ncontiguous to U.S. coasts was ``appertaining to the United States, \nsubject to its jurisdiction and control.'' Although the Truman \nProclamation did not carry the force of international law, other \nnations followed suit in extending their jurisdiction beyond 3 nautical \nmiles, some nations went out to 12 miles while others went all the way \nout to 200 miles. Congress contributed to this trend when it passed the \n12 Mile Fishery Jurisdiction Act. In passing the Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act in 1976, Congress established a 200-mile fishery \nconservation zone where the United States would exercise sovereign \nrights over the conservation, harvesting and management of the \nresource. In 1983, President Reagan declared through Proclamation 5030 \nthat the U.S. would exercise broad sovereign rights from the seaward \nlimit of the territorial sea to a distance of 200 miles from the shore, \nthus establishing the Exclusive Economic Zone. The EEZ regime was \nreflected in the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea and although the \nUnited States has not ratified this treaty, we maintain that it is \ngenerally reflective of customary international law applying to the EEZ \namong other things.\n\n\n                      Americanizing the Fisheries\n\n  For more than 200 years, the Federal Government has been looking \nafter our fishermen, starting as early as the Treaty of Paris of 1783 \nwhich secured fishing rights off the coast of New England. However, our \nmanagement of fishery stocks was limited to our narrow territorial sea. \nThis principle worked well until technology became very sophisticated \nin the early 1950's. Harvesting efficiency and capacity greatly \nincreased and the presence of large foreign fishing fleets off our \ncoast threatened the survivability of numerous stocks. In the 1950's, \nas large foreign fishing fleets loomed off our coast, Congress acted to \nprotect the rights of our fishermen with the Fisherman's Protective Act \nof 1954. The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 also affirmed the rights of \nU.S. fishermen to waters off our own coast. In 1964, Congress passed \nthe Prohibition of Fishing in the U.S. Territorial Waters by Foreign-\nFishing Vessels and then in 1972, Congress passed the Prohibition of \nForeign Fishing Vessels Act, again attempting to reserve the right to \nharvest U.S. fishing resources for U.S. fishermen. These laws were all \nprecursors to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to \nwhich the names of Senators Magnuson and Stevens were later added.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The \nMagnuson-Stevens Act established a 200-mile Fishery Conservation Zone \nand further established U.S. management jurisdiction over all fishery \nresources within that zone. As a House cosponsor of the bill, I can \nrecall the great debates of the day as the Magnuson-Stevens Act was \nbeing discussed. Members feared retaliation by other nations because of \nour unilateral extension of authority out to 200 miles, but the fear of \nthe foreign fishing fleets just off our coast was greater. Of special \nsignificance was the concept that U.S. fishermen should have the first \nright to harvest the fishery resources found within our 200-mile limit. \nSpecifically, section 201 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act states ``After \nFebruary 28, 1977, no foreign fishing is authorized within the \nexclusive economic zone * * *'' unless certain conditions are met as \nset forth within the act. Section 2(b)(1) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act \nstated as a purpose: ``to exercise sovereign rights for the purposes of \nexploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing all fish within the \nexclusive economic zone.'' This Americanization provision allowed for \nthe gradual reduction of foreign fishing within U.S. waters as U.S. \ncapacity increased.\n\n\n                  The American Fisheries Promotion Act\n\n  However, the great promise of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act to Americanize the fisheries was slow \nto come to fruition. As many Members may recall, numerous bills were \nintroduced and debated to help the U.S. fleet establish itself in the \nnew fishery conservation zone. In 1979, 60 percent of the edible and \nindustrial fish we used was supplied by foreign companies despite the \nfact that 20 percent of the world's fishery resource was within our own \nzone. Foreign fleets still dominated our fishery conservation zone. As \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and \nthe Environment within the House Committee on Merchant Marine and \nFisheries, I authored the American Fisheries Promotion Act. Popularly \ncoined as the fish and chips bill, the legislation was designed to \npromote development of U.S. fisheries by providing a statutory \nmechanism to phaseout foreign fishing within our fishery conservation \nzone. Unfortunately, the phase out of foreign flag vessels did not \nfully achieve the goal of reserving the full economic benefits of our \nresources to U.S. citizens.\n\n\n                           Reflagging Issues\n\n  Foreign companies were able to circumvent the intent of these laws by \nreflagging. Foreign-controlled companies could reflag their vessels \nunder U.S. documentation laws and gain the same priority access to U.S. \nfishery resources as bona fide U.S. citizens were intended to enjoy. To \ncounter such actions, Congress passed the Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987 \nwhich was designed to stop this practice and prohibit foreign \nownership/control of U.S. fishing vessels. The exact method of ensuring \nthis occurred was by requiring that a majority controlling interest in \nany corporation who owns fishing vessels operating in the U.S. fishery \nwere bona fide U.S. citizens. To protect the financial investments of \nvessels already within the fishery, grandfather provisions were \nincluded in the bill. Unfortunately, interpretation of the grandfather \nprovision has effectively nullified the original intent of that \nlandmark legislation. Although the vessels now carry the American flag, \neffective control of the vessels is under foreign hands. This bill will \nrestore the rights of bona fide United States citizens to have priority \naccess to U.S. fishery resources which are well established under U.S. \nand international law. In essence, we seek to return to a de facto \nstandard as set forth in section 201(d) which establishes that the \ntotal level of foreign fishing shall be the portion of the optimal \nyield which will not be harvested by U.S. vessels.\n\n\n                    Overcapitalization of the Fleet\n\n  A second issue that we deal with in this bill is the issue of \novercapitalization of the fishing fleet. The increasing\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\ndemand for fish products throughout the world has created an incentive \nfor increasing the size and capabilities of the world's fishing fleets. \nTraditionally, the United States has operated under an open access \nsystem of fishery management and increased demand has led to increased \nentry into the fishing industry. It is not disputed that the harvesting \nand processing capacity in the world far exceeds that required to \nefficiently harvest most resources.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Act's first National Standard requires that any \nfishery management plan be consistent with conservation and management \nmeasures to prevent overfishing while achieving optimal yield from the \nfishery. Controlling overfishing has been done in basically four types \nof programs--controlling the when, where, how and how much of fishing. \nFishery managers control the when--establishing seasons in which a \nparticular species may be fished. Fishery managers control the where--\nsetting closed areas where fishermen cannot fish. Fishery managers \ncontrol the how--restricting certain forms of fishing gear. And \nfinally, fishery managers control the how much--setting total allowable \ncatches to limit harvest. However, these methods have not always been \nsuccessful and the collapses of the New England ground fishery and \nBering Sea crab fishery are examples of that. The existence of ``derby \nstyle'' fishery where an excessive number of boats attempt to catch a \nlimited resource in the shortest period of time possibly is one symptom \nof inadequate controls. Such derby style fishing in overcapitalized \nfisheries has led to a range of serious conservation, management, \nbycatch and safety problems in our fisheries. It is time to establish \nsome form of control of fishing capacity, particularly if the capacity \nis under the control of foreign fishing companies. This bill will \nestablish such control by reducing capacity with a preference for \nAmerican companies--as Congress has long intended.\n  Mr. President, there are some areas of this bill which I will want to \naddress further. For instance, the menhaden and tuna industries use \nlarge vessels to harvest their catch, primarily through purse seining. \nThese fisheries operate outside of our Exclusive Economic Zone and are \nnot subject to management by our traditional Regional Council system \nnor have they experienced the problems associated with \novercapitalization. I will seek to ensure there are no unintended \nconsequences of this bill on their industry. Mr. President, I think \nthis bill continues the work that was started in 1976 and I look \nforward to a healthy and open debate on these very important \nissues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10299-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10300-S10301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CLARIFYING TREATMENT OF INVESTMENT ADVISERS UNDER ERISA\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on Friday, September 26, 1997, I \nintroduced legislation which amends title I of the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act of 1974 [ERISA] to permit investment advisers \nregistered with State securities regulators to continue to serve as \ninvestment managers to ERISA plans. At the end of last Congress, the \nInvestment Supervision Coordination Act, landmark bipartisan \nlegislation that adopted a new approach for regulating investment \nadvisers, was passed and signed into law. Under this legislation, \nbeginning July 8, 1997, States are assigned primary responsibility for \nregulating smaller investment advisers and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission is assigned primary responsibility for regulating larger \ninvestment advisers. Prior to the passage of the legislation, the issue \narose that smaller investment advisers registered only with the \nStates--and prohibited from registering with the SEC--would no longer \nmeet the definition of investment manager under ERISA because the \ncurrent Federal law definition only recognized advisers registered with \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. As a temporary measure, a 2-\nyear sunset provision was included in the securities reform legislation \nextending the qualification of State registered investment advisers as \ninvestment managers under ERISA for 2 years. The purpose of this \nprovision was to address the problem on an immediate basis while \nconcurrently giving the congressional committees with jurisdiction over \nERISA matters the opportunity to review and act on the issue. We have \nreviewed this issue and have developed the legislation that I am \nintroducing today to permanently correct this problem.\n  Without this legislation, State licensed investment advisers who, \nbecause of the securities reform legislation, no longer are permitted \nto register with the Securities and Exchange Commission will be unable \nto continue to be qualified to serve as investment managers to pension \nand welfare plans covered by ERISA. Without this legislation, the \npractices of thousands of small investment advisers, investment \nadvisory firms and their supervision of client 401(k) and certain other \npension plans will be seriously disrupted after October 10, 1998.\n  For business reasons, it is necessary for an investment adviser \nseeking to advise and manage assets of employee benefit plans subject \nto ERISA to meet ERISA's definition of investment manager. It is also \nimportant, for business reasons, to eliminate the uncertainty about the \nstatus of small investment advisers as investment managers under ERISA. \nThis uncertainty makes it difficult for such advisers to acquire new \nERISA plan clients and may well cause the loss of existing clients.\n  Arthus Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nhas written a letter expressing the need for this legislation and his \nsupport for this effort to correct this problem. I ask that a copy of \nChairman Levitt's letter be inserted in the Record.\n  It is my understanding that this bill is supported by the Department \nof Labor. In addition, this bill is supported by the Institute of \nCertified Financial Planners, the National Association of Personal \nFinancial Advisors, the International Association for Financial \nPlanning, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and \nthe North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. Mr. \nPresident, the sooner that Congress responds in a positive fashion to \ncorrect this problem, the better for small advisers and the capital \nmanagement marketplace.\n  The letter follows:\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1997.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Jeffords: I am writing to urge that the \n     Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources consider \n     enacting legislation to amend the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') in a small but terribly \n     important way. Unless the Congress acts quickly, thousands of \n     small investment adviser firms, and their employees, risk \n     having their businesses and their livelihoods inadvertently \n     disrupted by changes to federal securities laws that were \n     enacted during the last Congress.\n       At the very end of its last session, Congress passed the \n     Investment Advisers Supervision Coordination Act. This was \n     landmark bipartisan legislation that replaced an overlapping \n     and duplicative state and federal regulatory scheme with a \n     new approach that divided responsibility for investment \n     adviser supervision: states were assigned primary \n     responsibility for regulating smaller investment advisers, \n     and the Securities and Exchange Commission was assigned \n     primarily responsibility for regulating larger investment \n     advisers. We supported this approach.\n       Under the Coordination Act takes effect in the next few \n     months, most of the nation's 23,500 investment adviser \n     firms--regardless of their size--will continue to be \n     registered with the SEC, as they have for many decades. Once \n     the Act becomes effective, however, we estimate that as many \n     as 16,000 firms will be required to withdraw their federal \n     registration. Indeed, this requirement is crucial if the \n     Act's overall intent of reducing overlapping and duplicative \n     regulation is to be realized. But the withdrawal of federal \n     registration is also what causes the problem for these firms \n     under ERISA.\n       As a practical business matter, it is a virtual necessity \n     for a professional money manager (such as an investment \n     adviser) seeking to serve employee benefit plans subject to \n     ERISA to meet ERISA's definition of ``investment manager.'' \n     The term is defined in ERISA to include only investment \n     advisers registered with the SEC, and certain banks and \n     insurance companies. Once the Coordination Act becomes \n     effective, large advisers registered with the SEC will of \n     course continue to meet the definition. But small advisory \n     firms will not be able to meet the definition of investment \n     manager because they will be registered with the states \n     rather than with the SEC. Thus they may well be precluded \n     from providing advisory services to employee benefit plans \n     subject to ERISA, even if they have been doing so \n     successfully for many years.\n       The sponsors of the Coordination Act were aware that the \n     interplay between the Act and ERISA could have substantial \n     detrimental consequences for small advisers, and thus\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\n     added an amendment to ERISA during the House-Senate \n     Conference on the Act. The ERISA amendment provided that \n     investment advisers registered with a state can serve as \n     ``investment managers'' for two years, or through October 12, \n     1998. My staff has been told that this ``sunset'' provision \n     was included in the ERISA amendment so that the appropriate \n     congressional committees with jurisdiction over ERISA could \n     have a reasonable amount of time to review the amendment \n     before deciding whether to make it permanent. Apart from that \n     important procedural issue, I am not aware of any other \n     considerations that would suggest the need for the ERISA \n     amendment to expire in two years.\n       I believe that the Congress should move as quickly as \n     possible to enact legislation that eliminates the sunset \n     provision, and permanently enables properly registered state \n     investment advisers to continue their service as investment \n     managers under ERISA. There is no reason to wait until 1998 \n     to do so. In fact, many small investment advisers believe \n     that the ongoing uncertainty about their status as \n     ``investment managers'' under ERISA is making it difficult \n     for them to acquire new ERISA plan clients, and may even \n     cause them to lose existing clients. Some advisers think the \n     harm they could suffer, even before the expiration of the \n     sunset provision next year, could be irreparable, and it is \n     easy to see why.\n       It is only through the swift action of your Committee that \n     these unintended and unnecessary consequences for thousands \n     of successful small businesses can be avoided. If you or your \n     staff would like additional information about this matter, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me at 942-0100, or Barry P. \n     Barbash, Director of the Division of Investment Management, \n     or Robert E. Plaze, an Associate Director in the Division, at \n     942-0720.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arthur Levitt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10300-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FEDERAL JUDICIARY PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join as a cosponsor of \nthe Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1997, S. 1189.\n  This legislation would provide greater protection to Federal judges, \nlaw enforcement officers, and their families. Specifically, our \nlegislation would: Increase the maximum prison term for forcible \nassaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation, or interference with a \nFederal judge or law enforcement officer from 3 years imprisonment to 8 \nyears; increase the maximum prison term for use of a deadly weapon or \ninfliction of bodily injury against a Federal judge or law enforcement \nofficer from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years; and increase the \nmaximum prison term for threatening murder or kidnaping of a member of \nthe immediate family of a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from \n5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the support of the Department \nof Justice, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission, and the U.S. Marshals Service.\n  It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs \nthis legislation to protect the hard-working men and women who serve in \nour Federal judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. But, \nunfortunately, we are seeing more violence and threats of violence \nagainst officials of our Federal Government.\n  Earlier this year, for example, a courtroom in Urbana, IL, was \nfirebombed, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This follows the \nhorrible tragedy of the bombing of the Federal office building in \nOklahoma City 2 years ago. More recently in my home State, a Vermont \nborder patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously wounded by Carl \nDrega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire law enforcement \nofficers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that day, Drega shot and \nkilled two State troopers and a local judge in New Hampshire. \nApparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the judge who \nhad ruled against him in a land dispute.\n  There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking \nthe law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge or \nlaw enforcement officer. Still, the U.S. Marshals Service is concerned \nwith more and more threats of harm to our judges and law enforcement \nofficers.\n  The extreme rhetoric that some are using to attack the judiciary only \nfeeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the Republican leaders in \nthe House of Representatives was recently quoted as saying: ``The \njudges need to be intimidated,'' and if they do not behave, ``we're \ngoing to go after them in a big way.'' I know that House Republican \nWhip Tom Delay was not intending to encourage violence against any \nFederal official, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade \nFederal judges in the eyes of the public.\n  Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate \nand violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve \nwithin it with the respect that is essential to its preserving its \npublic standing.\n  We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people \nand countries around the world that are struggling for freedom. It is \nthe independence of our third, coequal branch of Government that gives \nit the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that \nhas for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and \nserved as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, \nthose more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the \nmoment.\n  We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the \nFederal judiciary and law enforcement in this country who do a \ntremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the \nhard-working public servants that make up the Federal Government, who \nare too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that \nit takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal \njudiciary and other law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that \nthese are people with children and parents and cousins and friends. \nThey deserve our respect and our protection.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Judiciary Protection Act \nof 1997 and look forward to its swift enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10301-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT FOR \n                            FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT.

Given this recent \nprogress, the news of the FUSRAP program's transfer out of DOE has, \nquite understandably, caused a great deal of distress in the St. Louis \ncommunity. While I am not questioning the corps' ability to handle the \nFUSRAP project, concern has been expressed that further delays will be \ncaused by the transfer and undo much of the recent progress.\n  With site recommendations already made, feasibility studies \nconcluded, and contracts let, it is encouraging that the corps will \nhonor the preliminary groundwork laid by the St. Louis community. The \nplan designed by the community further illustrates their ability to \ncontinue to administer the program from St. Louis. Further, I was \npleased to learn that the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites \nfalling within the purview of FUSRAP shall be managed and executed by \nthe St. Louis area Civil Works District of the Corps of Engineers, \nensuring that the local community will continue to be very involved in \ndesigning cleanup plans at the FUSRAP site and effectively maintain \ncommunity input in the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10301-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10301-S10302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FLORIDA SHERIFFS YOUTH RANCHES\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nrecognize a program that for the past 40 years has served over 30,000 \ntroubled boys, girls, and their families. This program has assisted \nthese troubled youth by providing an opportunity to learn to resolve \nconflicts and learn proper values as they work toward a lawful, \nproductive, and secure future. I speak specifically of the Florida \nSheriffs Youth Ranches, which have been in continuous operation since \nOctober 2, 1957.\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\n  The first of these ranches was established on the banks of Florida's \nhistoric Suwannee River under the direction of the Florida Sheriffs \nAssociation.\n  For four decades, this ranch and the many others established in its \nwake have provided a home for neglected, troubled, and abused boys and \ngirls. They offer in-home counseling and parent effectiveness training \nto hundreds of families throughout Florida each year. The programs for \nyouth include residential care, camping, foster care, adoption, after-\ncare, and individual and family counseling.\n  Through these youth ranches, the Florida Sheriffs Association and our \nState's individual sheriffs, deputies, and office staffs have made a \nvital contribution in the fight against juvenile delinquency and the \nbreakdown of the American family.\n  Mr. President, the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches are a shining \nexample of law enforcement working with communities to help troubled \nyouth and their families. I offer my sincerest congratulations and \nthanks for their four decades of service to the people of Florida, and \nwish all of the individuals involved the best of luck for the next 40 \nyears and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10301-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GERMAN-AMERICAN DAY\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

Through their participation in American society, German-\nAmericans have demonstrated their loyalty to their new homeland and \ntheir strong support of our Nation's democratic principles.\n  The German-American Friendship Garden in Washington, DC stands as a \nsymbol of the positive and cooperative relations between the United \nStates and the Federal Republic of Germany. I urge every American to \nacknowledge and honor the contributions to our Nation made by German-\nAmericans, and to celebrate October 6 as German-American Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10302-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \njoin my colleagues in recognizing September 15 through October 15 as \nHispanic Heritage Month. It is important that we reflect on the great \ncontributions that Hispanic-Americans have made to our Nation.\n  Hispanic-Americans embrace the American society and culture, while at \nthe same time perpetuating a unique cultural heritage of their own. In \nso doing, they are contributing to our Nation's diversity--a quality \nAmericans take great and justifiable pride in maintaining.\n  As one of the fastest growing segments of our society, Hispanic-\nAmericans are an increasingly vital part of our economy. Hispanic-owned \nfirms contribute significantly to our economic growth, and their ranks \nare increasing every day. In my own State of Georgia, which once served \nas the boundary between Spanish and English America, the number of \nHispanic-owned businesses has risen 184.9 percent over the past 10 \nyears.\n  But the contributions of Hispanic-Americans go well beyond the \neconomic arena. Their strong commitment to family, community, and \ncountry sets an example for all our people. For example, many have \ndemonstrated their commitment to our Nation through dedicated military \nservice. And Hispanic culture continues to enrich American art, music, \nand literature.\n  Hispanic Heritage Month seeks to increase national awareness and \nunderstanding of and respect for Hispanics and their tradition of \nachievement in this country. Across the Nation, events are taking place \nwhich demonstrate our rich Hispanic heritage. Through these \nfestivities, every American will be given the chance to experience \nHispanic culture. I urge every citizen to do so. You will be educating \nyourself and giving the Hispanic-American community in your area the \nrecognition it deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10302-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10302-S10303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE IN COMMEMORATION OF 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNIFORMED SERVICES \n               UNIVERSITY OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES [USUHS]\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences [USUHS] as it \ncelebrates 25 years of service to our country. It was on September 21, \n1972 that Public Law 92-426 established USUHS to provide a corps of \nuniformed medical officers who would provide continuity and leadership \nfor uniformed medicine in the United States. For 25 years, USUHS had \nremained our Nation's only military medical school, ensuring top-\nquality medical care to the men and women of our armed services. This \ninstitution has consistently produced first-rate career medical \nofficers who excel in meeting the needs of military medicine and \nmilitary readiness.\n  USUHS provides a unique curriculum that contributes greatly to our \nmilitary preparedness by providing knowledge that is vastly different \nfrom that taught in civilian medical schools. In fact, the American \nMedical Association [AMA] has recognized that training in military \nmedicine mandates special course work and instruction not necessary in \nthe civilian sector, and calls the existence of USUHS vital to the \ncontinued strength, morale and operational readiness of the military \nservices. This specialized training includes trauma, mass casualties, \ncombat surgery, medical logistics, nuclear medicine, tropical \ninfectious diseases, and medical responses to terrorism.\n  Following 18 graduations at the University, the total of USUHS School \nof Medicine [SOM] graduates is 2,470; the 2,276 active duty USUHS \nphysicians represent 17 percent of the current physician force in the \nmilitary medical system. Over the years, the university's graduates \nhave consistently demonstrated a high level of performance during their \nvarious deployments in combat areas and in support missions, including \nDesert Storm and Somalia. This performance based upon their extensive \nmilitary training has been validated by three Surgeons General, the \nAmerican Medical Association and the Military Coalition, the Retired \nOfficers Association, the National Association for Uniformed Services, \nand the American Legion, among others.\n  It is also important to underscore the long-term commitment made by \nUSUHS graduates to our armed services. Although USUHS graduates are \nrequired to serve 7 years of active duty beyond the time they devote to \ninternships and residencies, the average time served is actually 18.5 \nyears. Indeed, 85 percent of those graduates who have completed their \ninitial service obligations and could leave active duty for the private \nsector remain on active duty in the Armed Forces where they often hold \nsignificant leadership and operational positions. For example, four \nUSUHS-SOM graduates currently work directly for the President of the \nUnited States in medical support positions. That so many USUHS \ngraduates have made a career of military medicine provides the \ncontinuity that is so critical to our military medical services.\n  In addition to its original mandate, USUHS has further expanded its \nmission to meet the changing needs of the armed services. Additional \nprograms provided by USUHS include the Graduate School of Nursing, \nrecently granted full accreditation by the National League for Nursing, \nwhich prepares advanced practice nurses to deliver primary care and \nservices to all eligible beneficiaries; the Graduate Medical Education \nPrograms, established in 1986 to provide DOD-wide consultation on \ninternships, residency, and fellowship training for physicians; the \nGraduate Education Program which has provided 444 students with \ngraduate degrees in the basic medical sciences; and the Continuing \nEducation for Health Professionals Program which facilitates the \ncontinued professional growth of health care professionals in the \nuniformed services and reduces DOD travel and other expenses by \nbringing medical training directly to the health care professional.\n  For 25 years, this institution has consistently produced first-rate \ncareer\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\nmedical officers who excel in meeting the needs of military medicine \nand military readiness. USUHS is a cost effective means of providing \nthese uniquely trained physicians and deserves significant recognition \nof its accomplishments over its 25-year history in providing top-\nquality medical care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10302-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JONATHAN CAMERON BOSTER\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jonathan \nCameron Boster, a fallen firefighter who gave his life in service to \nhis community. While nearly 100 fire service personnel nationwide \nsacrifice their lives every year, Jon's death is even more poignant \nbecause he was just 19 years old.\n  At 10 p.m. on April 8, 1996, Grant County Fire District 5 was \nresponding to a structure fire in Moses Lake, WA. The water tanker Jon \nwas driving rolled off a curved rural road, killing him and injuring \none other firefighter. Jon's comrades could not turn back because of \ntheir commitment to the community. They did what Jon would have done; \nthey fought the fire.\n  Jon was a fun-loving young man with bright eyes and a charming smile. \nA Montana State all-star basketball player in high school, Jon also \nplayed football and ran track. He enjoyed water and snow skiing, \nfishing and hunting. Jon delighted in his niece and nephew and his \ngreatest joy was playing with them.\n  His driving desire, however, was firefighting and his world revolved \naround his ambition. He was a resident firefighter and E.M.S. provider \nand a State-certified first responder and defibrillator technician. He \nplanned to attend the Washington State Fire Academy.\n  Each October, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation holds a \nmemorial in tribute to the firefighters who died the previous year. On \nOctober 5, 1997, Jon will be honored and a plaque listing his name and \nthe names of each fallen firefighter will be unveiled and dedicated.\n  Every fallen firefighter is a hero, and each death a loss to an \nentire community. While Jon's death is sorrowful, we can take comfort \nin knowing that Jon gave his life in pursuit of his goal, racing not \njust to a fire, but toward a dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10303-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GEN. A.M. ``BUDDY'' STROUD\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, November 8th will be a significant \nand emotional day for the more than 13,000 members of the Louisiana \nNational Guard. That day will mark the conclusion of the extraordinary \nand distinguished military career of their beloved adjutant general, \nMaj. Gen. Ansel ``Buddy'' Stroud.\n  For 17 years, ``Buddy'' Stroud has provided strong and innovative \nleadership as Louisiana's top guardsman. In fact, anyone familiar with \nthe Louisiana National Guard can attest that today's Louisiana National \nGuard is better trained, better equipped, and better prepared to defend \nour Nation than ever before. And much of that high degree of training \nand preparedness is due to the visionary and determined leadership that \nGeneral Stroud has always provided.\n  Under General Stroud's able command, the Louisiana National Guard has \nalways enjoyed widespread popular support in my State and has often \nmade the difference in times of crisis and natural disaster in our \nState. In 1992, when Hurricane Andrew pounded the South Louisiana coast \nand inflicted heavy damage on a number of communities from New Orleans \nto Lafayette, General Stroud and his men were on the scene almost \nimmediately. I suspect that without his leadership--and without the \ndedicated, hardworking guardsmen under his command--Louisiana's \nrecovery from Andrew would have been much more painful and prolonged.\n  The Louisiana military personnel under General Stroud's command also \ndistinguished themselves in another endeavor. During 1990-91, more than \n6,400 men and women were activated for duty in Desert Shield/Desert \nStorm in the Persian Gulf. In all, 2,000 Louisiana Guardsmen saw duty \nin the Persian Gulf war. Our Nation and the people of Kuwait owe these \nmen and women--and thousands of other guardsmen from other states--our \nsincere gratitude for their service in this noble cause.\n  Earlier this year, when the rapidly rising Mississippi River \nthreatened to overwhelm our State penitentiary at Angola, General \nStroud's guardsmen helped save the day by shoring up the levees. \nBecause of the Guard's immediate response to this potential disaster, a \ncostly evacuation of thousands of prisoners was averted.\n  Under General Stroud's leadership, the Guard has not only been \npresent in times of natural disaster. Buddy Stroud has given thousands \nof Louisiana high school dropouts a second chance by creating a \nbootcamp-style program that instills discipline and guides these former \ndropouts toward the achievement of their high school diploma. Another \nprogram created under General Stroud's leadership, the Louisiana \nNational Guard's Youth Challenge Program, was recently honored as the \nbest overall youth challenge program in the United States.\n  Buddy Stroud was born on April 5, 1927 in Shreveport, LA. After his \nhigh school graduation, he attended college at Baylor and Texas A and \ngraduated with his B.S. degree from the University of the State of New \nYork. His long and distinguished military career began with his \nenlistment in the Army in 1944. Three years later, in 1947, he began a \nhalf century of service in the Louisiana National Guard, which \nculminated in 1981 with his promotion to the rank of major general.\n\n  General Stroud served his Nation in a number of other capacities. He \nis former president of the National Guard Association of the United \nStates and has served on that organization's executive council for the \nlast 4 years. He has also served as president of the Adjutants General \nAssociation of the United States.\n  Among General Stroud's professional achievements is a 1977 study \nwhich he directed for the Department of the Army on full-time training \nand administration for the Army Guard and the Army Reserve. The study, \nknown as the Stroud Study, was accepted by the Army as a guideline for \nrequirements of the National Guard and Army Reserve for full-time \nmanning programs and was the basis for launching the AGR program. Most \nrecently, General Stroud's unique contributions were recognized by the \npeople of Louisiana when the State legislature directed that the \nLouisiana Military History and Weapons Museum should now bear his name.\n  While he will no longer serve the Guard in a full-time capacity, I \nknow that retirement will not diminish ``Buddy'' Stroud's dedication to \nthe Louisiana National Guard. In fact, I am certain that, even in \nretirement, he will find a way to continue making a significant \ncontribution.\n  For many years, it has been my honor and privilege count ``Buddy'' \nStroud as a friend. I could begin to count the number of times we \nworked together on behalf of the Louisiana National Guard, and because \nof our joint endeavors, I will always have fond memories of the \nimportant work that we did--together--for the Louisiana National Guard \nand the people of Louisiana. Most of all, however, I will always value \nBuddy's friendship.\n  Mr. President, Buddy Stroud is a truly extraordinary American. I know \nI speak for all Louisianians and all Americans when I salute him for \nhis more than half century of distinguished service to his country and \nhis State and wish him only the best in his well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10303-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10303-S10304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This is my first report for fiscal year 1998.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough September 26, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1998 concurrent resolution on the Budget (H. Con. \nRes. 84), show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $295.4 billion in budget authority and by $144.4 billion \nin outlays. Current level is $1.6 billion below the revenue floor in \n1998 and $2.6 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1998-\n2002. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating \nthe maximum deficit amount is $30.6 billion, $142.7 billion below the \nmaximum deficit amount for 1998 of $173.3 billion.\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 1997.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nBanking Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1179, \nand further that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1179) to amend the National Flood Insurance Act \n     of 1968 to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to support the passage of \nthe National Flood Insurance Reauthorization Act of 1997 (S. 1179). \nThis legislation, which I introduced on September 16, 1997, provides \nfor a simple and straightforward 5-year extension of the National Flood \nInsurance Program [NFIP] until September 30, 2002. This legislation \nwill place this important program on a steady and secure foundation so \nthat it continues to provide protection to flood insurance \npolicyholders and the Federal taxpayers. I thank my friend and \ncolleague Senator Paul Sarbanes for cosponsoring this measure.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], enables over 3.7 million \nAmerican families to insure their homes and possessions. In my home \nState of New York, 85,000 families participate in the NFIP. The NFIP \nallows these families, on Long Island and along the Great Lakes and the \nState's many rivers, to purchase insurance coverage to protect their \nhomes in the event of a catastrophic flood.\n  The NFIP employs a comprehensive approach to alleviating the risks \nposed by catastrophic floods. Floodplain communities participate in \nFEMA's community rating system and are offered incentives to adopt and \nenforce\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nmeasures to reduce the risk of flood damage and improve flood \nprevention building criteria. To avoid the danger of repetitive losses, \nthe program provides stringent building standards designed to reduce \nthe risk of future damage. These flood protection standards must be met \nbefore any structure which suffers substantial damage may be rebuilt. \nIn addition, persons who receive disaster assistance and fail to \nsubsequently purchase flood insurance are barred from receiving future \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, the NFIP plays a critical role in reducing the costs \nof Federal disaster relief. Current NFIP policyholders pay \napproximately $1.3 billion annually into the NFIP fund. Without this \npremium income, the Federal Government would likely pay spiraling costs \nin disaster relief. The NFIP has the added benefits of improving State \nand community planning and Federal support for locally driven disaster \nprevention and mitigation activities.\n  Reauthorizing the NFIP is an important step forward in reaffirming \nthe commitment of the Federal Government to help American families \nprotect their homes and to protect the Federal taxpayer from the risks \nof catastrophic floods. Clearly, we must do more. Lenders and private \ninsurers who participate in the NFIP must do more to ensure compliance. \nStates and local communities must improve their disaster planning, \nprevention, and response activities. FEMA must redouble its efforts to \nincrease participation in the program to improve the safety and \nsoundness of the NFIP fund. Also, the Federal Government must do more \nto prevent and mitigate against the losses which will inevitably occur \nfrom future floods.\n  Mr. President, I note that this bill has the full support of the \nadministration. I wish to thank the members of the Banking Committee \nfor their bipartisan support of this important measure and I urge our \ncolleagues in the House to support its swift enactment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1179) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1179\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Flood Insurance \n     Reauthorization Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 1319 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 \n     (42 U.S.C. 4026) is amended by striking ``September 30, \n     1997'' and inserting ``September 30, 2002''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/01/senate-section/article/S10305-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1997\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.
