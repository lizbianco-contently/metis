As we pledge allegiance to our God and the flag of our \ncountry, may it not be a mere salute to custom or tradition, but a \nsincere desire to know and to follow Thy will. We need not ask for Thy \npresence, because You are always near. Instead we pray that we might \nhave receptive hearts and minds, in tune with Thy will, so that we may \nlisten to Your voice. The weight of responsibility is heavy. The Holy \nScripture speaking of government says, ``There is no authority except \nthat which God has established. The authorities that exist have been \nestablished by God * * * for the authorities are God's servants who \ngive their full time to governing.'' We give thanks for men and women \nwho are willing, able, and committed to government service. Give our \nleaders the continued strength, integrity, courage, and wisdom not only \nto govern, make laws and policies, and direct our Government, but also \nto lead the American people in right living and patriotism. Give us the \nwisdom and conscience to know what is right, and the strength to do \nwhat is right, that we may truly pray ``God bless America.''\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1935-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF THE ASSISTANT MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

CHARLES H. RICHMOND, GUEST CHAPLAIN\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the guest Chaplain, Dr. Charles \nRichmond from Edmond, OK, for a beautiful prayer. I also thank him for \nhis service to our country as national chaplain of the American Legion, \nbut also for his lifetime of dedication and service to God and country \nin his capacity as a leader.\n  He has given his time to the American Legion, first serving as \nchaplain of the Oklahoma American Legion Boys State for the past 5 \nyears and, more recently, becoming the national chaplain of the \nAmerican Legion in September 1996.\n  Dr. Richmond is an ordained Southern Baptist minister. He has touched \nthe lives of the members of many churches throughout Oklahoma and \nacross our country. Although now retired, he continues to be active in \nmany church and religious activities.\n  Dr. Richmond has been an educator. He has also served as a public \nschoolteacher, a coach, a counselor, and a principal. In addition, he \nserved as dean of men and later dean of student affairs at the \nUniversity of Central Oklahoma for over a quarter of a century.\n  Dr. Richmond began his lifelong dedication to God and our country as \na young man. In 1942, he entered World War II, the youngest person ever \nto enter the Chaplain Service. Only 30 days after entering the Army, he \nwas sent overseas to Asia, where he devoted 2\\1/2\\ years to serving \nUnited States troops during the China, Burma, and India campaign. In \n1950, he was reactivated with the Oklahoma National Guard and served in \nKorea and Japan. While in Japan, he led the building of a Christian \nchurch which spawned 22 churches and missions over the next 10 years. \nDr. Richmond later served 20 years as division chaplain of the Oklahoma \nNational Guard.\n  Dr. Richmond has served the community of Edmond as president of the \nEdmond, OK, club of Rotary International. In March 1996, he was chosen \nto serve as the Oklahoma State Senate chaplain.\n  Today, I am honored to recognize Dr. Charles Richmond, a great \nAmerican and Oklahoman, as guest Chaplain in the U.S. Senate.\n  Dr. Richmond, again, I thank you for an outstanding prayer, words of \nencouragement--one that I hope all of us will certainly pay attention \nto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1935-4", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, this morning, I attended a press \nconference with Representative Charles Canady from Florida, as well as \nSenator Hatch and Congressman Hyde, the chairmen of the respective \nbodies' Judiciary Committees, to introduce the House bill, which is \ncompanion to the bill I introduced last month, on the issue of partial-\nbirth abortions.\n  At that press conference, Senator Hatch and Chairman Hyde announced a \njoint House-Senate Judiciary Committee, calling witnesses before the \njoint committee hearing to talk about previous testimony given by those \norganizations to Congress in light of the disclosure of Ron \nFitzsimmons, who heads an organization of abortion clinics, that he \n``lied through his teeth,'' and others, likewise, I will add--this is \nme speaking, not him--lied through their teeth in telling Congress and \nthe American public the situations in which the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure was used and the number of times that procedure was used.\n  I said at that press conference, and I will say to my colleagues in \nthe Senate today, as I did last year when we debated this bill, I am \nhopeful that as a result of the new information having been brought to \nlight, not just with Mr. Fitzsimmons but, frankly, over the past year \nor so, with this new information that has been brought to light not \njust by him, but by newspaper reports, magazine reports from the \nmainstream media, that we will have Members of the Senate on both \nsides--I ask everyone to relook at this issue and base your decisions \non the facts as we now know them, not the misinformation or \ndisinformation given out by organizations like the National Abortion \nRights Action League or Planned Parenthood or others who deliberately \nlied to the American public, misled the American public on a variety of \nissues.\n  First, they came to the Congress and said--in fact, look at Members \nof Congress on the House side, going to the well, saying this was true \nbecause these organizations said it was true, that the procedure was \ndone under anesthesia and the anesthesia killed the baby.\n  We had an anesthesiologist come forward and say, ``Wait a minute, we \nhave women now who won't get anesthesia to deliver children,'' which is \nnormal in this country, of course, ``because they are afraid they are \ngoing to kill their baby,'' and so they had to back off. ``Well, we \ndidn't really mean that.'' Well, of course they meant it. They \ntestified to it.\n\n  Then the next great lie was that this was a procedure done, you know, \nwith only a few hundred a year, only with women whose health was in \ndanger or whose children were fatally deformed, and, as a result of \nthat, we need to have this option available. ``There's only a few \nhundred a year.''\n  In fact, you know, tap into NARAL's home page. You will find the \ninformation still there. At least it was a couple days ago until some \npeople found it. Now they may have pulled it. But they still say there \nare only a couple hundred being performed and only in the third \ntrimester. That was their argument all along. It is a lie. That is what \nMr. Fitzsimmons says--he lied through his teeth.\n  How would he know? He is the president of an organization of abortion \nclinics. He called up the doctors of the clinics, and the doctors said, \n``No. We perform this fairly routinely,'' not just on third trimester \nbabies--and some are--but the vast majority--95 percent is my guess, or \neven more--are on healthy mothers with healthy babies in the fifth and \nsixth months of pregnancy. Those are the facts.\n  If Members of this body will look at those facts and vote based on \nthe facts as we know them--this procedure, which involves taking a \nbaby, late term, fifth, sixth, in rare cases seventh, eighth, maybe \neven ninth month, but in rare cases in that situation, taking this \nbaby, delivering the baby feet first, delivering the entire baby except \nfor the head, then taking a pair of scissors and puncturing the base of \nthe skull, sticking a suction tube in there and suctioning the brains \nout, killing the baby and then delivering this now dead baby.\n  If the Members of the U.S. Senate know, as we do know now, that that \nhappens, not a few hundred times--in my opinion, a few hundred times is \npretty horrible--now several thousand times, at least according to Mr. \nFitzsimmons, 3,000 to 5,000--given the industry track record on what \nthey report, probably multiples of that, but at least that many--\nwhether we are going to condone healthy moms, healthy babies, some of \nthem viable, being allowed to have this abortion done in this just most \ngruesome manner.\n  So I ask the Members of the Senate to not just fall into your camp \nthat you are comfortable with, you know, if you are pro-choice, ``I've \ngot to be pro-choice.'' This is not pro-life, not pro-choice, certainly \nnot Democrat or Republican. There were Democrats at the press \nconference. Democrats have been some of the most vocal supporters of \nthis bill. This is an issue of who we are as a country and who this \nbody is as a Senate.\n  We have a life-of-the-mother exception. I know Members continue to \nget up and say, ``Well, we need to do this to protect the life of the \nmother.'' There is a life-of-the-mother exception. It is clear. It is \nsolid. No one who reads it would say it is anything but a life-of-the-\nmother exception.\n  So, if this procedure needs to be done to save the life of the \nmother, which I have not found anybody who says it is necessary, but if \nit is, you can do it. But after that, this procedure must be made \nillegal, given the facts as we now know them.\n  So I am asking Members, new Members who have not voted on this issue, \nand Members who have voted the other way in particular, to take a look \nat this information.\n  Let me challenge folks here in the other gallery, in the news media, \nto start doing your homework. This information was readily available. \nAll you had to do was report it. All you had to do was look. All you \nhad to do is ask. I know you folks love to believe people who agree \nwith you, and you take that as gospel. Well, do your work. Investigate. \nFind out the truth.\n  The American public just does not want to hear what your friends in \nthese organizations say is the truth. They want to know the real truth. \nIt is your job to tell them. We tried to tell them. We were here giving \nyou the facts. You just decided not to report them. Tell the truth. Let \nthe American public know what is really going on out there. When they \ncontinue, as they will, to lie on television, these organizations, to \ntry to hide their dirty secrets, call\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\nthem on it. Quit pandering to the other side. You owe it to the \ncountry. We are talking about lives of innocent babies here. You owe it \nto your profession. We owe it to the country. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for up \nto 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I certainly appreciate what the Senator from Pennsylvania was just \nstating on this very critical issue on partial-birth abortions. It is a \nsad situation that has occurred in this country. I am hoping that this \nbody and this Nation and this Government can respond to this situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1936-4", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1937-S1939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AN UNLIMITED AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the era of big Government is over. May \nit rest in peace. In its place a new era is about to unfold. An \nunlimited America with a smaller Federal Government, economic \nopportunity for all, and a renewed culture.\n  An unlimited America was the vision for the Nation set forth by our \nFounding Fathers. It is the vision enshrined in those two great \ncharters of freedom: our Declaration of Independence and our \nConstitution. Many of America's most intractable problems stem from the \nfact that we've strayed from that vision--and lost direction. But I \nhave no doubt that if we can recapture the Founders's vision of limited \nGovernment, personal responsibility, and economic opportunity that \nAmerica's greatest days will be yet to come.\n  The Founding Fathers of our Nation believed in the people. They \ncreated a new nation based on the radical notion that the people could \nbe free and trusted--that the nation would be great if you trusted the \npeople to be good. Before the birth of America, individual rights only \nexisted so far as the grace of the dictator or monarch allowed. They \nwere believed to have a divine right to rule, because it was thought \nthat the people could not be trusted to rule themselves.\n  Our Founders believed that the people had the right to govern \nthemselves--and that government derives its power from the consent of \nthe governed. But this right also imposed a requirement on ``We the \nPeople'': We must be a moral and just people. John Adams put it this \nway, ``Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. \nIt is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.''\n  Yet, today, we have placed the Government in the role that was \nreserved for citizenship. We have gone from ``We the People'' to They \nthe Bureaucracy.\n  In our recent efforts to create a more perfect union we have relied \ntoo much on the Government and too little on ourselves. We have \nforgotten that self-government demands the habits and virtues required \nfor such a government. ``Republican government,'' James Madison noted, \n``presupposes the existence of these qualities in a higher degree than \nany other form.'' Yet at some point we decided that goodness for the \nNation simply came from the greatness of government. But the greatness \nof our Nation can never be measured by the size of our GDP or even the \nstrength of our armies. National greatness rises from personal \ngoodness.\n  And that is the starting point for ending the era of big Government \nand beginning the era of an unlimited America. Our mission is to re-\nlimit the Federal Government; to release economic opportunity for all \nour citizens; and to renew our families and our culture. In my view \nthese principles are not divisible--if any one is missing, the old era \nwill not give way to the new and America will not return to the \nstraight path--the only path which leads to national greatness.\n\n\n                         Relimiting Government\n\n  Fifteen years ago, President Reagan spoke before the British \nParliament and made a prediction that shook the world. We were \nwitnessing, he declared, ``a great revolutionary crisis--a crisis where \nthe demands of the economic order are colliding with those of the \npolitical order.'' The Soviet Union, which seemed at the height of its \npower, was running ``against the tide of history by denying freedom and \nhuman dignity to its citizens.'' Despite all its tanks and missiles, \nthe Soviet Union would soon be swept aside by the ``march of freedom \nand democracy''--leaving--``Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of \nhistory.''\n  Many of Reagan's listeners thought he was dreaming. But Ronald Reagan \nhad faith in freedom. He knew that communism, though militarily \npowerful, was ideologically dead. He knew what our founders knew: that \nin a truly legitimate government, power does not come out of the barrel \nof a gun, but only from the consent of the people. In a few years the \nBerlin Wall came tumbling down and the Evil Empire crumbled with a \nsuddenness that astonished supporters of freedom and rocked the world's \nremaining tyrants.\n\n  Today big Government is facing the same internal crisis as the Soviet \nempire was in 1982. Big Government is institutionally strong, but \nstructurally weak. It is backed by armies of special interests that \nferociously protect their budgets and intimidate anyone who challenges \ntheir subsidies, but it has been abandoned by the American people.\n  Our mission is to implement big Government's replacement--to unite \nthe principles of economic freedom and the cause of cultural renewal to \nforge a new governing consensus that will lead America into the 21st \nCentury. Conservatives sometimes forget that limiting government is not \nan end in itself, but a means to a better society.\n  We must remember that our Federal Government has helped America \nachieve many great things in this century. Along with our allies, we \ndefeated two potentially mortal threats to freedom: fascism in World \nWar II and communism in the cold war. Government built the Interstate \nHighway System that helped create our modern economy. It established \nSocial Security and Medicare systems which have sharply reduced poverty \nin old age, and enabled senior citizens to live longer and in better \nhealth. Through student loans and the GI bill, it offered educational \nopportunity to those who might have otherwise been denied. And it \nenforced civil rights laws in the 1960's when it was clear that State \ngovernments could not protect the civil and political liberties of all \nAmericans.\n  But today, America's problems are different. And they require a \ndifferent response by government.\n  Unlike 50 years ago, our most difficult problems cannot be solved by \nthe benevolent hand of a powerful, centralized bureaucracy. We can \nstill have an effective Government, without a big Government that takes \naway our freedoms and degrades our values.\n\n\n                Unleashing America's Economic Potential\n\n  As I stated, our mission is to implement the replacement of big \nGovernment--to unite the principles of economic freedom and cultural \nrenewal to forge a new governing consensus that will lead America into \nthe 21st century.\n  The principles of economic freedom are the very same principles that \nwill bring forward a renewed culture and a society of limited \ngovernment. Faith, family, and freedom: these are the values that make \nboth our national economy and our national character strong. When \ngovernment undermines these values, it hurts our families and our \neconomy. Today, big Government is holding back our economy and \npreventing our people from reaching their full potential.\n  Perhaps, the most obvious evidence is the fiscal bankruptcy of the \nFederal Government. Today, we are more than $5.3 trillion in debt--a \ncrushing burden that amounts to over $20,000 for every man woman and \nchild. We are broke. And the budget deficits of today are minor \ncompared with the fiscal disaster that will confront us in the early \n21st century when Social Security and Medicare are unable to pay their \nbills.\n  But huge deficits and skyrocketing debt are just one problem.\n  Americans currently labor under a tax code so complicated that even \ntax lawyers and accountants can't understand it. We tax personal income \ntwo and three times before a citizen can see a return on his work or \ninvestment. Our people must work until May 8 just to pay their taxes to \nthe Government before they can earn a penny to support their families.\n  Our Tax Code is one of the greatest remnants of an over-intrusive big \nGovernment. It is perhaps the single greatest obstacle to greater \nindividual freedom and prosperity. Ronald Reagan\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\nmade enormous progress during his presidency, scaling the top rate from \n70 percent down to 28 percent. But since then, taxes have gone up--\nunder both Republican and Democrat presidents\n  The power to levy and collect taxes was meant to fund a \nconstitutional Government, not to become a political device in and of \nitself. Today, our central Government discourages certain behavior and \nrewards others based purely on the whims of those who control the tax \nmonster.\n  And as long as the current tax system exists, we will have not met \nthe challenge of replacing big Government and America's potential will \nnever be fully reached.\n  In other examples of big Government, we have over 340 Federal \n``economic development'' programs which redistribute capital from \nproductive citizens to bureaucratically-favored entities. Our \nregulatory state imposes hidden taxes on our families, our businesses \nand our dreams without truly measuring the consequences and weighing \nthe alternatives. And our political class has become satisfied with \nexpanding our economy at a lethargical pace. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs \nare being denied capital for their innovative ideas, parents are \nspending more time at work and less at home, and the American dream is \nslipping away from more and more families.\n  Many of these barriers are leftover from the great experiment with \nbig Government that is entrenched in our system. Defenders of this \nsystem may be winning the battle, but they cannot win this war of \nideas. The economic future of our country is inextricably tied to our \npeople.\n  This is why I am optimistic that we will break the bonds that are \nstifling the innovation and creativity of our people. As this new wave \nof information technology grows into each household and every new \nchild's mind, the system that relied on Government experts to guide our \neconomy will be washed away in a tide of entrepreneurial capitalism \nthat will make the industrial revolution pale by comparison. Legions of \nentrepreneurs with innovative ideas, exciting energy and new talents \nwill bring forth the inevitable implosion of today's redistributive and \nelitist economic policy. And our job as people who love freedom is to \ndo everything we can to help advance this process.\n\n\n                     Renewing the American Culture\n\n  We must also not forget that a nation must be full of good people \nbefore it can be a great nation. George Washington, in his First \nInaugural, said that there is ``no truth more thoroughly established \nthan that there exists in the economy and course of nature, an \nindissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and \nadvantage.'' As a result, he predicted that ``the foundation of our \nnational policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of \nprivate morality.''\n  If this is true--and I believe it is--then certainly the best \npredictor of future greatness is current goodness.\n  Where are we today on the goodness of the Nation? If we were to \nmeasure gross domestic piety in America we would ideally view the \nnature of each persons heart. Seeing as we cannot measure another's \nsoul, we are left to measure actions and extrapolate from it goodness.\n  The number of crimes committed does tell us something about the soul \nof the nation. So does the number of abandoned households, the divorce \nrate, the rate of teenage suicide and abortion. If these are \nextraordinarily high, can anyone disagree that the goodness of the \nNation has declined and its long-term success is in jeopardy?\n  But let me make a bold statement here. America is in ascent again. \nWhile I have just spoken about the many terrible and vexing problems of \nour Nation, this Nation has always shown an ability to deal with its \nproblems once it focuses on what those problems are.\n  I believe today we are focused on the problems of America. We are \nseeing the limits of Government and the needs of the hearts of our \npeople. Many of our citizens are realizing that in their individual \nactions--each and every day touching, loving, encouraging, and caring \nfor their fellow man and woman--that they have the power to continue \nAmerica as a great Nation.\n\n\n                       A New Governing Consensus\n\n  Men and women all across this Nation like Pastor Reid are mending \nAmerica's social fabric by reviving the families, civic organizations, \nand faith-based institutions that teach character and nurture the soul. \nThey may not all think of themselves as conservatives, but they embody \nthe conservative way of thinking. And they are rediscovering the \nprinciples of limited self-government, personal responsibility, and \nentrepreneurial capitalism that the founders envisioned for America.\n  The restoration of America's civil society has replaced the fight \nagainst communism as our central need and our central focus. This need \nunites libertarians with their emphasis on a free society with cultural \nconservatives with their emphasis on faith, family, and responsibility \nwith pro-growth Americans who want to free up the genius of the \nAmerican people through entrepreneurial capitalism. This vision, a \nvision of freedom, responsibility, and growth can form the core of a \nnew conservative governing consensus.\n  Our cause should be unified, not fractured. Americans of all sorts \nshould work together to restore this common vision of a limited \ngovernment so we can open markets, free up individual creativity, and \nabove all else, renew the American culture. Indeed, the sum of these \ngoals is essential to the whole of our destiny as a nation.\n  This isn't a utopian fantasy or wishful thinking. Americans and our \nGovernment have practiced these principles before, and we will do so \nagain. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited America in the 1830's, he \ndiscovered the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most \nprosperous, and most charitable country on Earth. It was a country of \nlimited national Government, and active citizen participation in local \ngovernment. Every community had newspapers describing how citizens \nformed voluntary associations to solve problems instead of expecting \nthem to be solved by politicians.\n  The industrial revolution of the late 19th century and the early 20th \ncentury was a time of rapidly growing entrepreneurial capitalism and \ngreat personal achievement. It was no coincidence that this period also \nsaw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, \nYMCA's and YWCA's, hundreds of private colleges and universities, and \ncountless other organizations that strengthened character and addressed \nthe problems of their communities.\n  This explosion of community organizations and faith-based \ninstitutions coincided with an economic, cultural and moral reawakening \nthat touched America in many ways. As the great scholar James Q. Wilson \nhas written, crime went down in the second half of the 19th century \neven though this was a period of rapid industrialization and \nurbanization. The rate of abortions fell in half during this period. \nAgain, government did not create this development, people did.\n  Today there are signs that America is entering another great revival \nof civic, voluntary activity. In the tradition of Jews, Mormons, and \nother religious groups with strong charitable traditions, conservative \nEvangelicals and Catholics run schools for low-income children. They \noperate maternity homes that give unwed mothers the love and support \nthey need to choose life. They go into our cities' meanest streets and \nprisons to rescue gang members, drug dealers, and prostitutes from \nlives of violence, addiction, and desperation. Name a social ill \nafflicting our cities--poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, \nillegitimacy--and you will find a self-selected, religiously affiliated \nprogram attacking the problem with prayer and sweat and a small army of \nvolunteers.\n  Some scholars say that America is entering a fourth great awakening, \na revival of religious faith and fervor. In the American political \ntradition, freedom and religious revival have always gone together. The \nfirst great awakening helped inspire the American Revolution, and \nreligious faith was at the center of the anti-slavery and civil rights \nmovements. And as the call for freedom grows with this revival, we will \nhave the chance to restore an unlimited America where Government will \nfocus on self-limitation, people will focus on self-governing, and our \nsociety will grow and prosper both economically and culturally creating \nan era of an unlimited America.\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\n  I have no illusions about the problems we face. Ours is the work of \ngenerations. But today the American people have a choice to make. We \ncan either continue along the path of administrative, bureaucratic \nGovernment and follow the tired mediocrity of big Government, or we can \nbegin the long and difficult task of rebuilding an America that knows \nno limits.\n  To follow this path we must do two things:\n  First: The creed of America is to be found in the Declaration of \nIndependence, which Jefferson called ``an expression of the American \nmind.'' We must renew our commitment to these principles, return to our \nConstitution and reassert ourselves as a free, self-governing people.\n  Second: America has always had within itself a deep source of \nregeneration. It gains nourishment from its many, varied roots; its \nhistory, its religious faith, its free market and its immigrant \nheritage. And what holds us all together is America's love of liberty, \ndeep in the hearts and minds of the American people. We must renew what \nWashington called ``the sacred fire of liberty'' and set it ablaze \nacross the land.\n  These are not easy tasks. Yet I remain an optimist for these are \npowerful forces on the move in our society. I don't know about you, but \nI have every confidence that Americans will choose the right path for \nthemselves, and for future generations that have yet to enjoy the \nblessings of freedom. And as we do, we will establish the era of an \nunlimited America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on several occasions during the last few \ndays some of the proponents of the balanced budget amendment here in \nthe Senate have taken to the floor and to the airwaves, and other ways \nto criticize those Senators who have seen fit to follow the dictates of \ntheir own conscience and oppose the balanced budget amendment which was \ndefeated in the Senate by a single vote last evening.\n  In the main, these attacks seem to have been directed especially at \nthose Members who may have indicated support for a balanced budget \namendment during a campaign, but found it impossible to support the \nparticular amendment which was put before the Senate for a vote.\n  I should say parenthetically at this point that I voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment in 1982. I had not thought much about it at \nthat time. I had not studied it. But following my vote for that \namendment on that occasion I decided to study the matter and to \nconsider it seriously, and consider the impact upon the Constitution. \nAnd I changed my vote from 1982 to 1986. In 1986 I voted against a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, and I have been against \nit ever since, and I always will be against it because I have given it \nthorough consideration and thought. And I have come up with a \nconclusion that I am very comfortable with.\n  So there are those who may have indicated support for a balanced \nbudget amendment during the campaign but found it impossible to support \nthe particular amendment, as I say, which was put before the Senate for \na vote on yesterday.\n  I rise today to again congratulate those Members, who, after careful \nstudy of the specifics of this particular amendment, had the \nintelligence and the courage and the vision to discern the amendment's \nobvious flaws, and the courage to follow the dictates of their own \nconsciences.\n  More and more the trend today in political life in America is to \nblindly endorse proposals, simply because they are popular or because \nthey fit neatly into a set of ideological preconditions endorsed by one \npolitical party, or the other. The specifics, the details, the actual \nimpact of many of these political ``no-brainers,'' if you will, is \nglossed over in favor of the attraction of simplicity and ideological \npurity. Just as we have ``dumbed down'' our textbooks, the last decade \nhas made a ``dumbing down'' of our politics as well. I often think that \nwe insult the American people with the obvious demagoguery which spews \nforth from Washington in the form of pandering and very-very-tired, old \ncliches.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that law and legislating is \nabout the examination of details. We don't legislate one-liners, or \ncampaign slogans. Here, in this body and in the other body, we put the \nforce of the law behind details that impact mightily upon the daily \nlives of our people. That is a solemn responsibility. And it is more \nimportant than political popularity, or winning the next election or \nmarching lockstep to the orders of one political party, or another.\n  Especially in the case of amending the Constitution, that \nresponsibility weighs more heavily. For in that instance we are \ncontemplating changes in our basic, fundamental organic law--changes \nthat, when once implanted in that revered document, can only be removed \nat great difficulty, and which will impact, quite possibly, upon \ngenerations of Americans who, yet unborn, must trust us to guard their \nbirthright as Americans.\n  Once the Constitution is amended, it takes quite a while to repeal \nthat amendment, as we saw in the case of the 18th amendment--the \nprohibition amendment--which became a part of the Constitution in \nJanuary 1919, and it was not removed from the Constitution until \nDecember 1933. In other words, it was in the Constitution for 15 years \nbefore it could be repealed. So we have to be very, very careful when \nit comes to amending the Constitution. It is most unlike passing a law, \nor amending a law, which can be repealed within the same calendar year \nhere in the Congress.\n  The suggestion has been made on this floor that to change one's mind \nand to go against a statement made in a campaign is somehow a \ndisservice to this country. Well, I differ, and I differ strongly. What \nI think I am hearing on the floor of this Senate is nothing more than \nan effort to use an individual Member's vote against a popular, but \nfatally flawed proposal, to cut politically against that Member, and \nfurther to use the Senate floor for the crass political purpose of \nmeddling in the politics of several of the sovereign States.\n  A campaign pledge is one thing, but may I remind all of those who \nworship at the altar of campaign pledges that there is another pledge \nthat each of us makes as we stand before this body and before we assume \nthe office of United States Senator. That pledge is a solemn oath taken \nwith one hand on the Bible and ending in the words ``so help me God.''\n  Now, that is a pledge that will trump all of the campaign pledges. \nForget about the campaign pledges. Those who make pledges in campaigns, \nif it is their first campaign for the Senate, they have not been in the \nSenate and they have not heard the debate on a given matter. They \nhaven't listened to their colleagues in the Senate. Oh, they have been \nMembers of the House, as I was a Member of the House at one time. But \nonce they enter this body, they are a Member of the United States \nSenate, the only forum of the States that exists in this great \nGovernment of ours. It is a different body. They then represent a \ndifferent constituency--usually. And so it is quite a different thing.\n  It is our oath of office that is overriding. In it we swear before \nthe Creator to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates against all enemies foreign and domestic.''\n  A Member of this body having so sworn to uphold that sacred trust is \nthen obligated to do his best to adhere to it according to his best \nintellectual efforts and the dictates of their own conscience. One does \nnot surrender his or her independence upon becoming a United States \nSenator. One does not swear allegiance to a political party when he \ntakes that oath of allegiance to the Constitution. That Member is then \nanswerable to God and, under law, to his own constituents. They know \nabout Senators' votes. We don't have to trumpet the votes for the \nbenefit of the constituents of another Senator. Constituents of \nSenators know about the votes of their Senators, and a Senator is \nanswerable, not to any political\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nparty or person, not to any colleague, not to any organization, but \nanswerable only to his own constituents, to his own conscience, and to \nhis own God. He is answerable to his own constituents--the people who \ntrusted his judgment enough to send him here in the first place.\n  The suggestions which have been made on this floor about the dubious \nhonesty of some Members are more than regrettable. They represent the \nkind of judgmental rigidity that really has no place in a body such as \nthis.\n  Let me also say at this point that the threats to run down that last \nremaining vote so badly desired by the proponents of this amendment by \ntinkering with language are empty fulminations because this proposal is \nfatally flawed. It is flawed in a way that cannot be mended because its \nenactment would forever shift the artful balance of powers crafted by \nthe framers. That is where it is fatally flawed. No language fix can \ncure the terminal illness of the attempt to write fiscal policy and \npolitical ideology into a national charter intended to serve as a \nguideline for generations. This Senator, for one, will never be a party \nto grafting this pock-marked monstrosity, largely aimed at adding a \nstar to the crown of one party's political agenda, to the body of our \norganic law. Now, I realize that several Democrats voted for this \namendment. But I don't attempt to be the judge of their vote. Their \nconstituents have that responsibility.\n  The eagerness to tinker belies the obvious insincerity behind the \neffort, and the remarks on this floor over the past several days should \nbe enough to convince us all that what is really wanted by some in this \nbody is not the amendment itself, but an issue with which to whip its \nopponents. This is simple politics, my colleagues. And it is politics \nat its most unappealing and destructive level.\n  It is easy to do the obvious thing. It is easy to do the popular \nthing. What it is not easy to do is to have the courage of one's \nconvictions and to stand up for those convictions. So I say again, \nthank God for Members such as those who have been so roundly chastised \nin recent days. Throughout our history, men of courage have made the \ndifference. Cloned sheep who cower at the suggestion of independent \nthought and action were not what the framers of the Constitution had in \nmind when they created ``the greatest deliberative body'' in the \nhistory of the world. They had in mind men of courage. Andrew Jackson \nsaid, ``One man with courage makes a majority.'' John F. Kennedy wrote \na Pulitzer prize-winning book about those Senators who had the courage, \non matters of principle, to follow their own convictions. If the advice \nof some of those who have taken to the floor in recent days had been \nfollowed, the pages of that book would be blank and this Senate and \nthis country of ours would never have endured.\n  Let me close, Mr. President, with the words of Senator William Pitt \nFessenden of Maine, from a eulogy delivered upon the death of Senator \nFoot of Vermont in 1866, just 2 years before Senator Fessenden's vote \nto acquit Andrew Johnson brought about the fulfillment of Fessenden's \nown political prophecy.\n\n       When, Mr. President, a man becomes a member of this body, \n     he cannot even dream of the ordeal to which he cannot fail to \n     be exposed;\n       of how much courage he must possess to resist the \n     temptations which daily beset him;\n       of that sensitive shrinking from undeserved censure which \n     he must learn to control;\n       of the ever-recurring contest between a natural desire for \n     public approbation and a sense of public duty;\n       of the load of injustice he must be content to bear, even \n     from those who should be his friends;\n       the imputations of his motives;\n       the sneers and the sarcasms of ignorance and malice;\n       all the manifold injuries which partisan or private \n     malignity, disappointed of its objects, may shower upon his \n     unprotected head.\n       All this, Mr. President, if he would retain his integrity, \n     he must learn to bear unmoved, and walk steadily onward in \n     the path of duty, sustained only by the reflection that time \n     may do him justice, or if not, that after all his individual \n     hopes and aspirations, and even his name among men, should be \n     of little account to him when weighed in the balance against \n     the welfare of a people of whose destiny he is a constituted \n     guardian and defender.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, am I to be recognized for 15 minutes in \nmorning business under a previous order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Without objection, the Senator from North \nDakota is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I enjoyed listening to my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd.\n  Edmund Burke said something similar to the words used by Senator Byrd \nwhen he closed, and I do not know them exactly, but he was talking \nabout what a representative in a representative government owes to his \nor her constituency. And Edmund Burke said something like: Your \nrepresentative owes you not only his industry but also his judgment, \nand he betrays rather than serves if he always sacrifices it to your \nopinion.\n  I do not know if that is an exact statement, but it is close to the \nexpression of Mr. Burke and I think describes the requirement of \nsomeone serving in public office in this country to do what they think \nis right--not to be a weather vane to analyze what is the prevailing \nwind on Tuesday or Thursday, but to do what they think is right. That \nis especially important when we are talking about altering the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  I thank him for reciting this jewel by a great Irish statesman, \nEdmund Burke, who I believe lost the next election after he had made \nthat statement. He may have foreseen that, but nevertheless he made the \nstatement. It still lives, and it is a very appropriate guiding \ncharter, in my judgment, for those of us in this Chamber today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1939-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1940-S1942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     U.S. MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because we will \nbe taking up an issue dealing with the confirmation of a nominee for \nU.S. Trade Ambassador. In conjunction with that will be an issue raised \nby the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] on a matter relating \nto the negotiation of international trade agreements and whether in \nthose negotiations, agreements can be reached that effectively change \nU.S. law. I intend to support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. I think he is absolutely correct, and I hope to be able \nto come and speak to that point when he offers his amendment.\n  As we begin talking about the nomination of the U.S. Trade \nAmbassador, I want to take a moment to mention something that occurred \nabout 2 weeks ago which passed almost unnoticed in this town, and it \nrelates to the issue of trade. It relates to the kind of trade \nambassador we have and relates to the kind of trade policies we employ.\n  A couple of weeks ago, we learned that in this last year the \nmerchandise trade deficit experienced by the United States of America \nwas $188 billion--a $188 billion trade deficit. This makes 21 \nconsecutive years of U.S. merchandise trade deficits, with a cumulative \ntotal of nearly $2 trillion.\n  We have spent a lot of time in recent days with books stacked on \nbooks 8 feet high in this Chamber showing fiscal policy and budgets. \nPerhaps we should have a chair or a table that stacks piles and piles \nof trade agreements and trade deficits one on top of another to show \nwhat we owe others in the world from an accumulation of nearly $2 \ntrillion in trade deficits.\n  That is the other deficit, the deficit no one wants to talk about, \nthe deficit no one wants to address. And yet, it is a deficit that \npredicts a weakness and a continual weakening in America's \nmanufacturing base. That which we used to produce at home is now all \ntoo often produced abroad. That which was manufactured here is \nmanufactured somewhere else. Good jobs that paid well with good \nbenefits here are now offshore. And that is what this deficit spells.\n  No country in history that I am aware of has long remained a strong, \ndominant world power without retaining its core manufacturing base, for \neconomic health in any country is not what you consume but, rather, \nwhat\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\nyou produce. What you produce is measured by the strength and the \nbreadth and the dimensions of your manufacturing base. This trade \ndeficit is injuring our country. No one seems to care much about it or \nbe willing to do much about it.\n  Six countries comprise more than 90 percent of our current trade \ndeficit: Japan, nearly 30 percent of the deficit; China, 24 percent of \nthe deficit; Canada and Mexico, which represents NAFTA, the NAFTA trade \nagreement, that is 24 percent of the deficit; Germany and Taiwan \ntogether, about 16 percent of the deficit.\n  NAFTA was one the most recent trade debates we have had in this \nChamber. We were told that if we have a free trade relationship with \nMexico and Canada, our two nearest neighbors, we would have new vistas \nof economic opportunity and create hundreds of thousands of new \nAmerican jobs. Well, NAFTA was passed--not with my vote, but NAFTA was \npassed. The NAFTA bill was enacted, it is now law, and now we are \nchoking in trade debt with our two neighbors.\n  The architects of NAFTA knew what they were doing. They constructed a \nkind of economic cow that feeds in the United States and is milked by \nboth neighbors. No one that I know of can credibly come around to this \nChamber who had advertised the virtues of NAFTA and now do anything but \nbe embarrassed with what has happened. What has happened is injuring \nthis country. Giant trade deficits with Canada and Mexico are hurting \nthis country.\n  Mexico now sends more automobiles to the United States than the \nUnited States exports to all the rest of the world. Let me say that \nagain because I think it is important. Mexico now ships more \nautomobiles into the United States of America than the United States of \nAmerica exports to all of the rest of the world.\n  We were told: Well, NAFTA, that's just a little old thing so that \nsome of those low-skilled jobs can go down south. They could do some of \nthose low-skilled jobs at lower labor costs down south. So, what are \nthe largest imports into the United States from Mexico today? The \nproduct of low-skilled jobs? No. Electronics, automobile parts, \nautomobiles. Exactly the opposite of what was predicted.\n  My point is that we must be concerned about this, we must be vigilant \nabout it, and we must try to do something about it. We must have the \nsame energy in this Chamber on this issue as there has been exhibited \non the issue of fiscal policy, the budget deficits that result from \nfiscal policy that is out of balance.\n  There is merit, enormous merit in requiring that we march toward a \nbalanced budget in the fiscal policy in this country because you cannot \nkeep saddling your children and grandchildren with consumption that you \nnow have and saying, well, we are going to consume, but you pay the \nbills. That is not fair, it is not right, and it is not healthy for \nthis country's economy.\n  There is something else that is fundamentally unhealthy about this \ncountry's economy, and that is our trade relationships that result in \nthis enormous trade deficit that we have, a merchandise trade deficit \nof $188 billion. I could spend hours talking about the specifics, and I \ncannot and I will not because I do not have the time. Let me just \nmention one item, and I will bet not many people understand.\n  For example: Let's talk about T-bone steak that is shipped from the \nUnited States to Japan, just to demonstrate the low expectations we \nhave of those with whom we trade. Some while ago there was a \nnegotiation on beef from America to Japan, and at the end of the \nnegotiation there was a day of feasting, people believing that those \nwho engaged in these negotiations had just won a gold medal at the \nOlympics. Enormous success, we were told. They crowed about the \nsuccessful negotiation on beef.\n  Well, where are we now some years later? We are getting more beef \ninto Japan. That is true. So they all say that is enormously \nsuccessful. Guess what. There is a 50 percent tariff on American beef \nbeing sent to Japan. Does anybody under any set of circumstances \nbelieve that is success, that we now are able to get beef into Japan \nwith a 50 percent tariff, and therefore we ought to say, ``Hosanna''?\n  That is not fair trade. That is not free trade. That is not open \ntrade. It is not fair for this country. It is not fair for our beef \nproducers. And I can go through line after line and example after \nexample. T-bones to Tokyo. They ought to go there without a 50-percent \ntariff on them to be fair to our producers. We purchase much of what \nthey export to us. They ought to purchase what we export to them \nwithout impediment.\n\n  I do not want to go on. I would like to talk about trade in some more \ndetail, with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and Senator \nHollings and others. I would say, for myself, and I expect I could say \non their behalf, we do not complain about this as people who believe \nthat we ought to put walls around our country.\n  I believe in expanded trade. I believe in expanded opportunity. But I \ndarned sure believe in retaining a manufacturing base in this country, \ninsisting that trade around the world be fair trade. Nobody in this \ncountry working in a manufacturing plant ought to have to compete with \na 14-year-old working 14 hours a day making 14 cents an hour. Nobody \nunder any condition ought to be expected to or ought to have to compete \nwith that, and it happens every day in every way under our trade \nagreements.\n  I am just saying the other deficit, nearly $2 trillion at this point, \nwith this year's trade deficit being one of the largest in history, \nthat deficit we ought to care about and ought to do something about.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky--we are going to vote on her. She is tough. She \nhas confronted a number of other countries on trade relationships in a \nsignificant way. I appreciate that. But she is only as tough as the \nadministration will allow her to be in demanding fair trade. The last \nseveral administrations, the last four administrations, in fact, have \nbeen disappointments to me on trade, including this one. They have done \nbetter than previous administrations, but not good enough. It is not \ngood enough for this country.\n  It used to be, we could handle international competition with one \nhand tied behind our backs because we were the biggest, the best, the \nmost. That is not true anymore. We face shrewd, tough, international \ncompetitors and it is time we understand that trade relationships must \nbe fair and must be balanced, and must care about this country's \nproductive sector as well.\n  I am not going to speak at length about the amendment offered by \nSenator Hollings. I do intend to support it when he offers it. I hope \nto be able to come down and speak about it. But I did want to say a few \nwords, just as a precursor to a discussion we will have about the \nconfirmation of another trade ambassador.\n  We have had trade ambassadors. We have confirmed them. We have heard \nthe talk about straightening out some of our trade relationships. But \nyear after year, the merchandise trade deficit continues to grow with \nalmost no notice and almost no one seeming to care about its impact on \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I expect to come back later in the day when we debate \nthese issues. With that I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Ohio yield to me for just 1 minute?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from North \nDakota. The fact is, it is hard for me to understand the argument when \nthe American economy is the best it has been, in the opinion of any \nexpert, in a long, long time. Our unemployment is low, our trade \ncontinues to grow, our economy continues to grow. It is a direct result \nof free trade. How can we make the argument, which will be done later \non, that somehow we should be reraising barriers that are protectionist \nand isolationist when it flies in the face of what every outside expert \nsays has been the main engine of growth of the American economy, and a \nthat is free trade?\n  What Ms. Barshefsky has just done, in the negotiation of the telecom \nagreement, is a signal, an important and remarkable advance to the \neffort of free trade in allowing American companies and corporations \ninto foreign markets so we can hire more\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\nAmericans and continue to have this remarkable growth in our economy \nand a bright future for Americans. The debate will be drawn, time after \ntime, and has been, between protectionism, between the desire to raise \nthose protectionist barriers, to go back to the good old days of Smoot-\nHawley or whether we are going to move forward with free trade and \nreduce barriers.\n\n  I believe the American people and those people who are engaged in \nbusiness, those who are in the business of doing business, will \nstrongly support the position that the administration holds of free \ntrade and reduction of barriers for competition.\n  I yield back to my colleague from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the period of \nmorning business be extended until the hour of 1:30 and I be permitted \nto speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I am wondering whether I \ncould reserve 8 minutes of that time, between now and 1:30, as part of \nthe unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if my friend from Ohio will yield me just 1 \nminute of that time now while the Senator from North Dakota is on the \nfloor, to react to his comments?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will be more than happy to do that.\n  Let me just state the topic I want to talk about is going to take \nawhile. So I will be more than happy to yield. If you go on too long, I \nwill simply come back later on. That will be fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I just ask if the Senator will yield 1 minute, and then I \nwill yield the floor and come back for the remainder of my 8 minutes. \nBut while Senator Dorgan is on the floor, I just wanted to comment for \na few seconds. I just wanted to compliment Senator Dorgan for his \ncomments. His speech is a free trade speech. We all have to listen \ncarefully to what he said. That 50-percent tariff on American beef \ngoing to Tokyo--it is absurd that we tolerate it.\n  In NAFTA, we permit, for 25 years, Mexico making it a crime to sell \nan American used car in Mexico. That is part of NAFTA. NAFTA, for 10 \nyears, restricts American-assembled automobiles from going into Mexico. \nSo, what the Senator from North Dakota is pleading with us to do, is to \ninsist that we have as much access for our manufactured goods and our \nagricultural products to other countries as they do to our country. I \ncommend him on his remarks and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Ohio yield 30 seconds to me?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will be more than happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not engage the remarks of the Senator except to \nsay we should reserve the decision on this point. One can drive down a \nstreet and see a Cadillac in front of an expensive house, and if you do \nnot understand the debt that will be used to repossess the house and \nthe Cadillac, you don't understand the financial position there. The \nsame with our country. The fact is, our abiding trade deficits are \nundermining our country's long-term economic future and we had better \nnot decide to ignore them. We had better confront them on behalf of \nAmerican producers and on behalf of this country's interests. This is a \ndebate we must have soon.\n  I appreciate very much the indulgence of the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1940-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DISASTERS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me start by expressing on this floor, \nas I did this past Monday, my sympathy for the families who have lost \nloved ones in the last week due to tornadoes, due to flooding and other \nnatural disasters. This has been a very, very tough week. In my home \nState of Ohio, we are experiencing a flood of once in the last 30 or 40 \nyears magnitude--we have not experienced anything like this since the \n1960's. Not only is my home State of Ohio experiencing this, but, of \ncourse, Kentucky and Indiana is as well. Vice President Gore is, as I \nspeak, in Ohio, having the opportunity to view firsthand the damage. We \nappreciate his visit. We welcome it.\n\n  We also appreciate the prompt action by President Clinton in \ndesignating 14 Ohio counties, to make them eligible for disaster \nassistance. Governor Voinovich has now made an additional request to \nthe President to add two additional counties, Hamilton County, \nCincinnati, as well as Clermont County. Both these counties have been \nhit exceedingly hard by the flooding. In fact, we have yet to see the \nhigh-water mark, which should not occur for a few more hours in \nCincinnati and Clermont County, the Richland area--that part of our \nState.\n  We really have an area in Ohio from Monroe County, up river, all the \nway down to Hamilton County. What we have seen is what we always see \nduring tragedies such as this. We see Americans responding. And, in the \nmidst of the tragedy, the suffering, what we see is neighbors helping \nneighbors and people out there just making a difference. We have Red \nCross volunteers. We have emergency department volunteers. We have fire \ndepartment volunteers. The National Guard is actively involved. But \nmost of all, we have people who are just volunteers, who are just out \nthere making a difference, who do not necessarily belong to any group \nexcept they are Ohioans or Kentuckians or Hoosiers from Indiana, and \nthey are out there making a difference in their local communities. So \nlet me pay tribute to them.\n\n  The work that we have at hand is going to continue. Once the \nspotlight of CNN and the network news goes off Ohio, Kentucky, and \nIndiana and goes off the river communities, the work is going to have \nto continue. We will have to be hanging in there and doing what we can.\n  I appreciate the prompt response of FEMA and the Federal officials \nwho were in Ohio yesterday, traveling with Lt. Gov. Nancy Hollister. I \nappreciate their prompt response and prompt recommendations to the \nPresident. I look forward to working with them, as well as working with \nthe local communities, in the weeks and, frankly, months ahead.\n  We are seeing not only a tremendous amount of damage, in the millions \nof dollars, to homes, trailers, people having to be relocated, but we \nare also seeing an immense damage to the infrastructure of the southern \npart of the State of Ohio. I don't think any of us know what this is \ngoing to amount to. We won't know until the river goes back and things \nbegin to get back to normal before we can assess the full damage. When \nyou look at some of the counties in southern Ohio, there is not a one \nof them that has the capacity to respond, as far as dollars are \nconcerned. This is something that cannot be budgeted. We, of course, \nwill be looking forward to working with FEMA and other agencies to get \nassistance in there to those counties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1942-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1942-S1943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I had intended to come to the floor today \nand talk about Haiti, a long way from Ohio. I have had the opportunity \nto visit Haiti three times in the last 18 months. I have had the \nopportunity to meet with our Ambassador, to meet with President Preval \nin Haiti, to meet with our members of the Armed Forces that we still \nhave in Haiti, doing an absolutely fantastic job. One of the nice \nthings about having the opportunity to travel to other countries and to \nsee what is going on is the opportunity to see U.S. troops and to see \nthe tremendous job that they do. It is just one more inspiring thing a \nMember of Congress can do.\n  As I said, I intended to come to the floor today and talk about what \nI think is important in regard to Haiti. We have invested $2 billion. \nWe have risked U.S. servicemen's lives. We still have United States \nservice men and women in Haiti. Haiti is our neighbor. What happens in \nHaiti will impact us. Haiti is not of strategic importance to the \nUnited States, but Haiti, because of geography, because of historical \nties, will continue to have an impact on the United States.\n  If we want to search for examples to prove this theory, we don't have \nto think back too far in recent history when we had thousands of \nHaitian boat\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\npeople coming across the sea, and we were faced with the horrible \ndecision of what we do with them--people who were seeking freedom, \npeople who were seeking the opportunity to simply provide food for \ntheir families, and we had to deal with that.\n  So Haiti, because of its geography, is very important to the United \nStates, will continue to be important, and I intend to come to the \nfloor sometime within the next week to detail what I found on the trips \nI have made to Haiti and some of the specific recommendations I have. \nBut because of the constraints of time, and I know there are other \nMembers who have expressed a desire to speak, I will, Mr. President, \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, while my friend from Ohio is here, I thank him for \nyielding before. I appreciate that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1942-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1943-S1945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             USE OF FBI BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION SUMMARIES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments this afternoon \nto set the record straight on an important point concerning the use of \nFBI background investigations in the consideration of the executive \nbranch nominees by the Senate.\n  A number of inaccurate comments have been made about the handling of \nFBI files in connection with the pending nomination of Tony Lake to be \nDirector of Central Intelligence. Some Senators are calling for access \nto the complete files which the FBI used to prepare the summaries that \nwere provided to the White House and the Congress. The Senators cite \nformer Senator Tower's nomination to be Secretary of Defense as a \nprecedent for requesting those so-called complete files.\n  For example, a February 17, 1997, letter to the majority leader, \nsigned by 16 Senators, only three of whom were Members of the Senate at \nthe time the Tower nomination was considered, and none of whom were \nthen members of the Armed Services Committee, states the following:\n\n       As you know, when former U.S. Senator John Tower was \n     nominated for Secretary of Defense, his complete FBI file was \n     placed in a secure room of the Capitol for Members of the \n     Senate to read and evaluate. Given the clear precedent and \n     the critical nature of the position of Director of Central \n     Intelligence, this is the procedure which we believe should \n     be followed in the case of Mr. Lake.\n\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that neither the Armed Services Committee \nnor the full Senate ever had access to the raw investigative files used \nby the FBI to compile its summary of the background investigation of \nSenator Tower. The Armed Services Committee and all Senators had access \nonly to the FBI summary of its investigation of Senator Tower to be \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I understand that the summary of the FBI's background investigation \nof Tony Lake has already been provided to the chairman and vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, just as the summary of the \nFBI's background investigation of Senator Tower was provided in the \nArmed Services Committee in 1989.\n  A little background is useful here on the process of FBI background \ninvestigations of executive branch nominees. Prior to the submission of \na nomination to the Senate, the FBI conducts a background investigation \nof the nominee for the purpose of providing the President with \ninformation about the suitability of a prospective nominee. The report \nof the investigation is submitted to the counsel to the President who \nis responsible for preparing appropriate advice to the President.\n  The FBI background material provided to the Armed Services Committee \nin connection with nominations includes only the FBI summary of its \ninterviews. If the committee determines that additional information is \nnecessary, a request for this information is made of the White House. \nIf necessary, the FBI investigates further, and additional summaries \nare provided to the committee. The underlying investigative materials \nare not submitted to the committee, and they never have been. I repeat \nthat. The underlying investigative materials, the so-called raw \ninvestigative materials, are not submitted to the Armed Services \nCommittee and they never have been, including in the case of Senator \nTower when his nomination was before us to be Secretary of Defense.\n  The standard practice before the Armed Services Committee has been \nthat the summary of the FBI investigation is read only by the chairman \nand the ranking minority member of the committee or their Senator-\ndesignee from the members of the committee. These summaries can be \nextraordinarily personal and confidential, and, for that reason, the \nexecutive branch is not allowed staff access generally to those FBI \nsummaries.\n  A February 10, 1989, letter from President Bush's White House \ncounsel, Boyden Gray, to the Senate majority leader described the \n``terms and conditions under which summaries of FBI background \ninvestigations on Presidential nominees have been made available to \nSenators since 1981.'' This is what then-White House counsel Boyden \nGray said to the Senate majority leader.\n\n       The FBI summary is hand-carried by an attorney in this \n     office to the Senator who reviews the file with the White \n     House attorney. When the Senator has finished reading the \n     summary, it is hand-carried back to the White House.\n\n  That same practice was followed throughout the Bush administration \nand the first term of the Clinton administration.\n  Access to FBI summaries was expanded for the committee's \nconsideration of the nomination of former Senator Tower to be Secretary \nof Defense in 1989. For the committee's consideration of that \nnomination, Senator Nunn and Senator Warner, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee at that time, felt that it was important that \nall Senators on the committee have access to the FBI summary of its \nbackground investigation of Senator Tower and that a limited number of \ncommittee staff also have access to those summaries to prepare the \ncommittee report on the nomination.\n  After lengthy discussions and negotiations with President Bush's \ncounsel, Boyden Gray, Senators Nunn and Warner and Mr. Gray reached a \nwritten agreement on the terms of access to the FBI summary of its \ninvestigation of Senator Tower, which allowed all members of the Armed \nServices Committee and a very limited number of committee staff to have \naccess to the nine chapters of the FBI summary. The summary was put in \nroom S407 here in the Capitol, along with summaries of the summary \nwhich were prepared by the committee staff, to make it easier for the \nmembers of the committee to review those summaries.\n  Mr. President, the agreement between Senator Nunn, Senator Warner, \nand Mr. Gray makes it very clear that what the Armed Services Committee \nhad access to was--and here I am quoting from the access agreement--\n``the Federal Bureau of Investigation's summary of its background \ninvestigation of Senator John Tower.''\n  And the agreement here between Senators Nunn and Warner and Mr. Gray \nwent on to inventory the material which was provided to the committee \nas follows:\n\n       The FBI summary consists of the following parts:\n\n  This is the inventory agreed upon relative to Senator Tower's \nnomination.\n\n       The FBI summary consists of the following parts: (1) \n     summary memorandum (undated [but which was, in fact, dated \n     December 13, 1988]); (2) summary memorandum (December 23, \n     1988); (3) summary memorandum [which was also] (undated [in \n     this agreement but which was January 6, 1989]); (4) summary \n     memorandum (January 13, 1989); (5) summary memorandum \n     (undated [but which was, in fact, January 25, 1989]); (6) \n     summary memorandum [dated] (February 8, 1989); and (7) \n     summary of the ongoing investigation not yet completed by the \n     FBI.\n\n  Now what that quote is from is the agreement between Senators Nunn \nand Warner and Boyden Gray, the then-White House counsel.\n  Mr. President, I wonder how much time I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes that the Senator's time has \nexpired.\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. If there is nobody else seeking recognition, I ask \nunanimous consent to have 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  So then I observe, Mr. President, that the quote which I just shared \nwith this body is from the agreement, and every single item on that \ninventory is a summary document.\n  Two additional FBI summaries were added to the seven listed in the \noriginal agreement before the Senate finally voted on the Tower \nnomination a month later. These FBI summaries, which were eventually \nplaced in S-407 for review by all Senators, were the only FBI materials \nreceived by the Armed Services Committee.\n  As Senator Nunn stated on the Senate floor when he opened the debate \non the Tower nomination--and this probably is the most succinct place \nwhere Senator Nunn stated this on the Senate floor--\n\n       What we have in S-407 is the summary of interviews the FBI \n     conducted. They prepare the summary. We do not see nor do we \n     have the underlying interviews.\n\n  That is stated about as succinctly and directly as you can by the \nthen-chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  So, in short, the committee did not have access to any raw \ninvestigative files or interview transcripts, nor did the Senate. What \nwe had were the nine chapters of the FBI summary of its investigation.\n\n  Following the committee's action on the Tower nomination, Senators \nMitchell and Dole reached an agreement with the Bush administration \nthat all Senators would have access to the same FBI summary of the \nbackground investigation of Senator Tower that was made available to \nthe members of the Armed Services Committee. In other words, after the \nArmed Services Committee voted, then the agreement between Senators \nMitchell and Dole was that the full Senate would have access to those \nsame summaries that the committee Senators had access to.\n  So the fact is, Mr. President, that in considering the nomination of \nSenator Tower to be Secretary of Defense, the Armed Services \nCommittee--and eventually all Senators--had access to the FBI summary \nof its background investigation of Senator Tower, no more and no less. \nWe did not have access to any of the raw investigative material that \nthe FBI used to prepare those summaries.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has had the nomination of Tony Lake to be \nDirector of Central Intelligence for 2 months. And some Senators have \nquestions about Mr. Lake's suitability for the position. Those \nquestions should be raised with the nominee in the hearing next week so \nthat he can respond, and Senators can then reach their own judgments \nabout his suitability for this important position.\n  But we should not act on any misunderstanding as to what the \nprecedents are relative to raw investigatory materials. And in dealing \nwith the Lake nomination, which I am glad to see is now scheduled for a \nhearing, I think it is important that Senators realize that the \nprecedents here relative to executive nominees are such that we do not \nhave access to those materials because they contain so much rumor, so \nmuch inaccurate information that we rely on the FBI to go through all \nthat raw material and give us the summary reports that then we rely on, \nand then if we need or desire additional information, we make that \nrequest of the FBI and of the Justice Department.\n  There is a larger issue at stake here also, Mr. President, and that \nis the growing intrusiveness of the nomination and confirmation \nprocess. Make no mistake about it: if the executive branch agrees to \nprovide raw FBI files to the Intelligence Committee, a new precedent \nwill be set for future nominations to executive branch positions. The \nFBI summaries contain the most personal, private, and sensitive details \nof an individual's life. Some of these details have no bearing on an \nindividual's suitability for office.\n  As Mr. Gray stated in his February 14, 1989, letter to the Armed \nServices Committee, even the material included in the summary of an FBI \nbackground investigation is so sensitive that their disclosure could \njeopardize ``the privacy interests of [the nominee] and others, the \nconfidentiality of FBI sources, the FBI's ability to conduct background \ninvestigations, and our ability to recruit qualified candidates for \npositions of governmental service.''\n  It is already difficult to convince talented people to serve in \ngovernment. If people realize that every rumor or allegation that the \nFBI dredges up or that every off-hand comment or statement that someone \nsays about a nominee in an interview is subject to being read by 100 \nSenators and selected staff--and possible leaks to the media--it will \nbe even harder to get the kind of people all of us want to serve in \nconfirmed positions in the executive branch.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the February 10, 1989, \nletter from Mr. Gray to the Senate majority leader, the February 14, \n1989, agreement on the terms of access to the FBI summary of its \ninvestigation of Senator Tower, and the February 14, 1989, letter from \nMr. Gray transmitting that agreement to Senator Nunn, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1989.\n     Hon. George J. Mitchell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As a follow-up to our meeting of \n     January 27, 1989, I am sending you a precise description of \n     the terms and conditions under which summaries of FBI \n     background investigations on Presidential nominees have been \n     made available to Senators since 1981. That description is \n     set forth below.\n       At the request of the White House, the FBI conducts a full-\n     field investigation of a candidate for Presidential \n     nomination. A summary of the results of this investigation is \n     reviewed by the Counsel to the President prior to a final \n     Presidential decision to nominate the individual in question. \n     Once the nomination is forwarded to the Senate, that summary \n     is made available for review by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member of the Committee considering the nomination \n     (and the Majority and Minority Leaders if they desire). With \n     the approval of the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, \n     other Senators on the Committee are given an opportunity to \n     review the summary.\n       The FBI summary is hand-carried by an attorney in this \n     office to the Senator who reviews the file with the White \n     House attorney. When the Senator has finished reading the \n     summary, it is hand-carried back to the White House. (Within \n     the White House, access to the FBI summary is limited to \n     members of the White House Counsel's office, the Chief of \n     Staff, and the President.)\n       In the event the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of \n     the Committee believe there are issues that have not been \n     adequately addressed in the FBI summary, the Counsel to the \n     President may request the FBI to conduct further \n     investigation. The summary of that additional investigation \n     is provided to the White House counsel who then makes it \n     available to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member on the \n     same terms and conditions as the original FBI summary.\n       The procedures outlined above are necessary to protect the \n     FBI's investigatory process as well as the privacy interests \n     of the nominee and the other individuals who agree to be \n     interviewed by the FBI. Since the FBI relies on the \n     willingness of people to provide information in a \n     confidential manner, access to this information is limited. \n     For the same reasons, members of this office and Senators \n     have historically refused to comment publicly on the contents \n     of the FBI summary.\n       As we discussed, this practice enables the Senate to \n     utilize information prepared by the FBI for the White House \n     in the execution of its Constitutional advice and consent \n     responsibilities. Further, it is my understanding (as \n     evidenced in the enclosed letter from former Deputy Counsel \n     to the President Richard A. Hauser, Section IV of the \n     enclosed old ``Presidential Appointee's Handbook'' (which has \n     been used since at least 1986) and Appendix A of the revised \n     ``Presidential Appointee's Handbook'') that this practice was \n     consistently followed by Senate Committees in their \n     consideration of Presidential nominees between 1981 through \n     mid 1986.* Accordingly, with your concurrence, it is my \n     intention to continue this practice throughout the Bush \n     Administration.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     *The one exception to this rule was the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, which was subject to a separate agreement because \n     judgeships are lifetime appointments.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   C.

Sam Nunn,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: With respect to our conversation last \n     Friday regarding access by the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) \n     summary of its background investigation of Senator Tower in \n     connection with his nomination as Secretary of Defense, I am \n     gratified that we have now reached an understanding on the \n     way in which we will proceed.\n       I believe the fact that all of the Committee's subsequent \n     deliberations involving the FBI summary on Senator Tower's \n     nomination will occur during Executive Session only, that \n     this nomination has significant national security \n     implications, and the unique nature of the allegations \n     concerning Senator Tower warrant a one-time-only exception to \n     the procedures governing access to FBI background \n     investigations by Committee members.\n       The documents we will provide are extremely sensitive. \n     Their disclosure could jeopardize the privacy interests of \n     Senator Tower and others, the confidentiality of FBI sources, \n     the FBI's ability to conduct background investigations, and \n     our ability to recruit qualified candidates for positions of \n     governmental service. Therefore, I am pleased that we have \n     agreed on ground rules for Committee access that suit our \n     purposes and yours. The enclosed Terms of Access sets forth \n     the procedures for access, custody, storage, and return to \n     the Executive branch of the FBI background summary. With this \n     understanding, we are prepared to deliver copies of these \n     documents to your Committee immediately.\n       I believe that this understanding will make it possible for \n     the Committee to proceed expeditiously on this nomination \n     once the FBI has completed its investigation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   C. Boyden Gray,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1943-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1945-S1970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nWAIVING CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE TRADE ACT RELATING TO THE APPOINTMENT \n                    OF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

The Chair announces there are 3 hours equally \ndivided on the amendment by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. Mr. President, I ask \nthat the distinguished senior Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] \nbe added also as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the amendment that has just been read is \nso simple, so fundamental. I am hearkening to our new Members of the \nU.S. Senate, just in January, a few weeks ago, ``I hereby pledge to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.''\n  This is constitutional language, that no international agreement that \nwould, in effect, amend or repeal statutory law can be implemented \nuntil approved by the Congress. Under the Constitution, article 1, \nsection 8, it is the duty of the Congress to regulate foreign \ncommerce--not the executive branch; not the executive branch.\n  Obviously, to really change the law you would have to have three \nreadings in the House and three readings in the Senate and signed by \nthe President. The fact that this amendment, which I tried to make as \nclearcut and as principled as it possibly could be, where there would \nbe no confusion, has been so vigorously opposed by the White House and \ncertain ones in Congress that there is no doubt in my mind that with \nrespect to foreign trade, with respect to global competition, we are in \nthe hands of the Philistines, we are in the hands of the \nmultinationals. Rather than the Congress controlling the multinationals \nand international trade, the multinationals, by this initiative, are \ncontrolling the Congress.\n  What is the initiative? Well, they could not find any language to \namend my amendment. They could not find anybody to really object to it. \nWhat they did do, then, was to say, well, we will get some letters \nwritten--incidentally, by people who had nothing to do with this \nparticular part of the telecommunications bill--and the comments were \nthat Mr. Archer of the\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nWays and Means Committee over on the House side then sends a letter on \nthe one hand, saying that he would blue slip this particular \nappointment of Barshefsky in that the Hollings amendment would involve \nrevenues.\n  You know that is not going to happen. I think they made some bad \nmistakes over on that side. I think they have sort of redeemed \nthemselves from the contract. They certainly have redeemed themselves \nfrom three budgets. In 1995, they said the President was \ninconsequential and that they had three budgets, and whether you agreed \nor not, that is what they were going to do. Now they say, Mr. \nPresident, ``Please give us a second budget.'' They do not even give \none, much less three. But I do not think they would revert back to \nnonsensical conduct and try to act like an appointment to be confirmed \nby the U.S. Senate wherein it had a rider that the law be obeyed, the \nConstitution be supported and defended. ``Protect and defend'' is the \noath we take, and that involves revenues. But be that as it may, Mr. \nPresident, that is exactly what they have done. And more recently, they \nhave come by--and I have been vitally interested--and one of the \nambassadors in the United States Trade Representative's office was to \nbe appointed ambassador in charge of trade there at Geneva--we have \nwritten letters and made calls to the White House--Ms. Rita Hayes. Now \nwe have calls in, indirectly, that that can't be had or done. I think \nit was about to be approved--``unless Hollings gives up his \namendment.''\n\n  So they have tried every shenanigan in the world, which tells me--and \nshould tell this Congress--that the executive branch is going to make \nits agreements, come hell or high water, and they could care less. Not \na treaty, but just executive agreements. The media and everybody is \nsupposed to go along and say, well, I think the Senator is right, but \nwe have to go ahead with this appointment. They are changing the law. \nThey admire the three readings in the House and the three readings in \nthe House with respect to Ms. Barshefsky. She does not previously \nqualify having registered British Steel and foreign competitors. They \npassed that waiver out, and it no doubt will be adopted here in the \nU.S. Senate, but to just say ``provided further, that if she enters \ninto an agreement that would amend or change statutory law, that before \nit be implemented, it first must be approved by Congress.'' Just as \nsimple as that.\n  So let's get right to the ``meat of the coconut,'' as they say, \nbecause this has been going on for 2 years. This isn't any last \nminute--one of the letters from one Senator said this is a last-minute \nattempt. Oh, no, this isn't last minute. We had hearings on foreign \nownership of telecommunications. We have had testimony of the different \nentities. Mr. Reed Hunt, the Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission, who was at one time conspiring for this particular \napproach--I don't know where he is now, but I am checking him. I quote \nMr. Hunt:\n\n       I am concerned about the prospects of foreign monopolies \n     being able to buy into our markets while they are still \n     monopolizing their home markets. And as global media \n     developments occur, as the Congressmen mentioned earlier, we \n     must be attentive to the fact that if a foreign company is a \n     monopolist in its own country, it has a prospect of using \n     that monopoly to leverage unfair competition into this \n     country. I am concerned about that.\n\n  That is in May 1995, almost 2 years ago.\n  Mr. President, we also have the statement of the FBI and the DEA, who \nwrote, also, in May 1995:\n\n       Even with the foreign corporation as privately held, we \n     believe that a foreign-based company could be susceptible to \n     the influence and directives of its own government. There are \n     numerous examples of foreign companies being used and \n     directed by their governments to carry out, or assist in \n     carrying out, government intelligence efforts against the \n     United States Government and all major corporations.\n\n  That is a letter to the Honorable John D. Dingell, on May 24 1995, by \nthe Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Judge Louis J. \nFreeh, and the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nThomas A. Constantine.\n  Mr. President, the law that we are talking about, and the two \nsections--section 310(a) of the statutory law of communications--``The \nstation license required under this act shall not be granted to or held \nby any foreign government or the representative thereof.'' Section \n310(b) limits any owning or controlling interest to 25 percent.\n  Now, I understand somebody is going to say the special trade \nrepresentative never testified. We had numerous meetings. You have to \nknow how the executive branch works. We haven't had any hearings from \nthem once they got the agreement here in February, just last month--any \nhearings on the agreement, or anything else of that kind. They just \ngave away 100 percent in violation of 310(a). They didn't just do the \n25 percent in 310(b). They go in, as naive as get out, I can tell you \nthat. I want to build a bridge back to the old-fashioned Yankee trader. \nCome in and say, look, we have the largest and the richest market; what \ncan you come up with? Let's see what you propose and we will work with \nit. Instead, like goody-goody two shoes, this touchy-feely crowd that \nwe have up here in Washington says, ``We will give you 100 percent and \nlet's see what you come up with.'' Nippon Telephone & Telegraph says, \n``Thank you for the 100 percent, bug off, you get nothing from us.'' \nAnd you go down the list. No country gave us any kind of 50-percent \nownership. Our best of allies and friends in international trade, \nCanada and Mexico, in NAFTA, said, ``No, you can't get a 50-percent.'' \nUnder 50 percent. So you can see what a spurious approach they used, in \nviolation of the law.\n\n  So I talked to Ambassador Kantor at that particular time, back in \n1995, and Senator Byrd wrote a letter on April 3, 1995. And, again, \nAmbassador Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, came forward \nwith his letter and acknowledged the law. I think that is the important \npart, because in his letter back to Senator Byrd on April 24, 1995--I \nam trying to congeal it so everybody understands it--I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter from Michael Kantor, dated April 24, 1995, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 3, 1995.\n     Ambassador Mickey Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ambassador: The Senate will soon take up S. 652, \n     the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n     1995, to promote competition in the telecommunications \n     industry. I am writing to solicit your views on the revision \n     of foreign ownership provisions, specifically the revision of \n     Section 310(b) of the 1934 Communications Act.\n       As you may know, the Commerce Committee's reported bill \n     would allow the FCC to waive current statutory limits on \n     foreign investment in U.S. telecommunications services if the \n     FCC finds that there are ``equivalent market opportunities'' \n     for U.S. companies and citizens in the foreign country where \n     the investor or corporation is situated.\n       I would like to have your assessment of the impact of this \n     provision for both enhancing the prospects of U.S. \n     penetration of foreign markets, and for foreign investment in \n     American telecommunications companies and systems.\n       Specifically, what impacts and advantages can we anticipate \n     will result from enactment of this provision on the ongoing \n     negotiations in Geneva on Telecommunications which has been \n     established under the GATT, to be incorporated into the \n     General Agreement on Trade in Services?\n       Second, which markets in Asia and Europe are now closed to \n     U.S. telecommunications services in such a way that action on \n     the basis of the concept of Reciprocity in the Senate bill is \n     likely? What timeframes for such action, if any, would you \n     contemplate?\n       Third, what has been the position of nations whose markets \n     are closed to U.S. telecommunications services in the way of \n     justifying their lack of access, and what likely reactions \n     can we anticipate from those nations as a result of this \n     legislative provisions?\n       What role do you think can be most usefully played by your \n     office in effectively implementing the provision that has \n     been recommended?\n       Lastly, in analyzing the legislation reported from the \n     Senate Commerce Committee, do you have any suggestions as to \n     how the provision might be strengthened to better serve the \n     goal of opening foreign markets to U.S. telecommunications \n     services and products?\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will just read one line:\n\n       By amending the legislation as we suggest, the Congress \n     would provide effective market opening authority for both \n     multilateral and bilateral negotiations on basic \n     telecommunications services.\n\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\n\n  I emphasize the phrase ``by amending the legislation as we suggest,'' \nbecause you got the U.S. Trade Representative Barshefsky, she says, \n``You don't have to amend it now. I got agreement. Take it and like it \nor else.'' But that isn't what the U.S. Trade Representative said in \n1995. We heard about this. So on April 25, we wrote a letter--the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Trent Lott, the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Daniel K. Inouye, and myself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter to the President on April \n25, 1996, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our concern \n     with the current negotiations governing trade in \n     telecommunications services. The United States has an open \n     and competitive market for telecommunications services. U.S. \n     companies are the most innovative in the world. Current \n     negotiations should not result in an agreement that \n     unilaterally opens the United States market while barriers, \n     both formal and informal, continue to keep U.S. companies out \n     of foreign markets.\n       We are deeply concerned about the effects of any trade \n     agreement, including a review by a dispute settlement panel \n     of the World Trade Organization (WTO), on the independence \n     and integrity of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). \n     Congress did not make any changes to the foreign ownership \n     limitations of the Communications Act when it enacted the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104).\n       We believe strongly that the public interest test contained \n     in the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, must be \n     retained and that current practices governing foreign \n     investment not be altered. Any change in current U.S. law and \n     FCC practices as a result of any trade agreement should be \n     done only with the approval of the Congress in accordance \n     with our Constitutional obligation to regulate foreign \n     commerce.\n       With kindest regards,\n           Sincerely,\n     Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Trent Lott,\n     Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we cite thereon the independence and \nintegrity of the Federal Communications Commission. ``Congress did not \nmake any changes to the foreign ownership limitations of the \nCommunications Act when it enacted the Telecommunications Act of \n1996.''\n  What really occurred was, on the Senate side, we said, fine, we will \ngo along on a majority percentage of ownership by a foreign entity if \nthere is reciprocity. If there is an equal opportunity for U.S. \ncompanies to own and control, we will let them own and control, under \ncertain circumstances, with, of course, Judge Freeh's and Mr. \nConstantine's inhibitions, and we had the same concerns. We would study \nthem and go over them very closely. We had reciprocity with the \nsnapback provision. I authored it. We put it in the bill after hearings \nand said, look, if the country changes its mind or comes under improper \ncontrol and they kick us out, snap back, kick them out. Fair is fair. \nWe thought that very reasonable to move an agreement on the \ninternational telecommunications. But the representatives of the White \nHouse, in particular the Special Trade Representative, now called U.S. \nTrade Representative, started dealing with Mr. Oxley on the House \nside. And we were in the conference.\n\n  So all during 1996 in that particular conference, we worked around \nand we worked around. Finally, in December, I talked to our friend \nMickey Kantor, the Ambassador. I said, ``Mickey, we can't get together \non this one. There is not going to be any change. Whatever agreement \nyou make will just have to come back. Maybe that is the way. If you \nwant some change in the law, then come on back to Congress.''\n  We have debated it already now for 3 years. We would be glad to get \ntogether on it. But with all the facets of the upgrading and the \nrevision of the 1934 telecommunications act and considering all the \nvarious decisions made over a 60-year period, we couldn't agree.\n  So Ambassador Kantor said, fine, that is what they would do. However, \nin the early part of the year when we came back--again negotiating all \nduring 1996--to the Congress just a couple of months ago, we kept \nhearing again that we were somehow going to be ignored and that they \nwere making offers over there.\n  Mr. President, on February 4, 1997--again Senators Robert Byrd, Byron \nDorgan, Daniel Inouye, and Fritz Hollings--the four of us joined in a \nletter to the White House saying that the USTR should not commit the \nUnited States to a trade agreement that limits the scope of the public \ninterest test administered by the FCC, and any changes to current U.S. \nlaw should be done only with the approval of the Congress.\n  So it was clear in January and February, long before they made the \nagreement, that we were watching closely as best we could. I met on \nJanuary 17 with Ambassador Barshefksy. I want it clearly understood \nthat at that particular time we meant exactly what we said. I cautioned \nher. It was on January 17. I had already met. That is why we sent that \nFebruary letter. When I met with Ambassador Barshefksy, it was crystal \nclear to this Senator. I have been up here 30 years. I am the senior \njunior Senator. And my friend Strom says, ``You had better get used to \nit.'' But I dealt with these trade representatives way back into the \n1950's, 40 years ago. I have handled clients as a practicing lawyer, \nwhen the individual continues to not answer the question and is sort of \nhugging up to you and says, ``I want to work with you, I want to work \nwith you, I want to work with you.'' I said to Ambassador Barshefksy, \n``Madam, I do not want you to work with me. I want you to work with \nthat statute. Don't go over and say you did not know anything about it \nbecause we have been in the debate, and you are going to have many \nMembers really turned off on this one, and we will have to take \naction.'' But it was quite apparent to me with that ``I want to work \nwith you'' stuff that she had no idea of working with us in good faith. \nOf course, now we know.\n  As reported in the Journal of Commerce on February 19, 1997:\n\n       The United States decision to end its statutory \n     restrictions on foreign investment in this sector was crucial \n     to carrying along a global deal in which the rest of the \n     world has made varying levels of commitment to similarly open \n     their markets.\n\n  So, to end the statutory restrictions, we have not extended the \nstatutory restrictions. Nothing has been happening. There has not been \nthree readings in the House nor three in the Senate. We haven't even \ndebated it here this year. But they already have the trade press \nquoting exactly what the public official of the U.S. Government is \nsaying. Here we are all in the uproar. We have the special committees, \nthe independent prosecutors, ``Get them, get them, foreign influence on \npolicy. We can't have anybody give us a contribution and influence \npolicy.'' And over here, while we are not looking, a public official of \nthe U.S. Government is giving it away in violation of section 310(a) \nand 310(b) of the communications act. So, yes, I talked to Members. I \nsaid, ``I just want to make it crystal clear that either we are going \nto go to conference''--like our lawyer friend Sullivan, who said, ``I \nam not a potted plant''--``or else we will let the executive pass its \nown little laws, and we can go on home and forget about trying to \nwork up here to set some valid policy.''\n\n  So thereby is the amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is interesting. I must report to you that even \nwhile Ms. Barshefsky couldn't get it, I read that the Canadian official \nreported in the Wall Street Journal--and, I quote again, prior to the \namendment--``We think that when you look at the overall package, our \noffer is every bit as good as the American offer.'' However, Canada \n``has serious reservations about the United States proposal because it \nwon't be backed by U.S. legislation.'' At least the trade negotiator \nfrom Canada got my message. I never have talked to that individual. But \nI can tell you now, we could not get through. We couldn't get through \nat all.\n  You have to understand along this line, Mr. President, because you \nare from the hinterlands where people think straight, that you can tell \nwhy this crowd up here operates in the beltway and miasma totally of \ntheir own dreams. And when we as Senators go\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\nhome--Oneita Mills, which just a couple of months ago closed down, was \njust not a complicated operation making T-shirts. But I got there some \n35 years ago when I was Governor--and I am proud of it--in a little \ncountry town of Andrews, SC, and I got 487 employees, and Washington \nsays, ``Don't worry about it. What we need is retraining, retraining, \nretraining.'' The former Secretary of Labor, my friend Bobby Wright, \nthat is all he thinks: Skills, skills, skills, retrain. We have skills \ncoming out of our ears. We manufacture automobiles. They didn't go to \nDetroit. We never made one. But we have the skills, and we put in there \na technical training system. I put it in. In 1961, we broke ground up \nthere in Greenville on a garbage dump. I guess EPA would catch me now. \nBut that is where the school is. And I broke ground for 16 others. We \ngot the skills.\n  But back to Oneita, they said, ``Retrain, retrain; get another job; \nwe don't have enough skills. You don't understand the problem. We up \nhere in Washington understand the problem.'' Nonsense. Assume that they \nretrain as computer operators; tomorrow morning you have 487 computer \noperators. The average age at Oneita was 47 years of age. Are you going \nto hire the 47-year-old computer operator or the 20- or 21-year-old? \nYou are not going to assume the retirement costs and the health costs \nof the 47-year-old. They are out.\n  Yes, I see it when I look at that GE plant that I brought in from \nBrazil. In the competition they said, if you want to sell those \ntransformers to us, you are going to have to move your plant. So when I \nbrought one to South Carolina, they closed the plant down and GE is \ngone, moved offshore.\n  Malaysia, Baxter Medical. I brought that one in, but we are still \ngiving tax incentives to invest overseas, so they closed down last year \nand they have gone to Malaysia. Saturday before last, Sara Lee in \nHartsville, with 187 jobs, gone to Mexico.\n  We lost, in the year 1995, 10,000 textile jobs in South Carolina, and \nI think an equal amount this past year. I am trying to get the figure. \nWhen they talk about educate, educate, educate, educate here at the \nWhite House, they better buy a few books and read them themselves. They \nbetter get hold of ``Looking at the Sun,'' by James Fallows, or \n``Blindside'' by Eammon Fingelton or ``The Future of Capitalism,'' by \nLes Thurow, or our friend Bill Greider, ``One World, Ready or Not,'' \nand, of course, the most recent book by Robert Kuttner ``Everything For \nSale.'' You begin to sober up and understand what the head of Motorola, \nin Malaysia said as quoted by Mr. Greider that the people of America \nhave no idea in the Lord's world what is happening to them.\n  What we are doing is making the exception the rule. And what is the \nexception? The exception is free trade, free trade, free trade. Adam \nSmith, market forces, market forces. After World War II, that was a \nvalid contention. We had the dominant auto industry. We wanted to \nfoster capitalism in the emerging Third World. We were looking for \nfreedom and democracy to be spread into Europe and into the Pacific \nrim. So we taxed ourselves by billions for the Marshall Plan and \nthereupon coaxed our industries to invest overseas. And invest they \nhave.\n  But if you want to see the sheep dog gobbling up the entire flock, \nyou ought to watch these multinationals that we created. The nationals \nwent over. They resisted it at first. They could not speak the \nlanguage. The air flights were not good. They did not get good food on \nthem or anything else of that kind. But gradually they learned that in \nmanufacturing, 30 percent of volume is in labor cost--payroll. And you \ncan save as much as 20 percent in a typical manufacturing entity by \nmoving to a low-wage country. So it is that an entity, a manufacturing \ncompany that has $500 million in sales can keep its sales force, its \nexecutive office back here at the home headquarters but move its \nproduction, its manufacture to a low-wage country and make itself $100 \nmillion, or it can stay here, continue to work its own people and go \nbroke.\n  That is what is going on. How do you get that through the news pages \nso they understand it?\n  So the nationals gradually became over the 50-year period since World \nWar II, multinationals, and then the national banks, Chase Manhattan \nand Citicorp, as of 1973, made a majority of their profit outside the \nUnited States. So you have got the multinational corporations and the \nmultinational banks. And thereupon you have them making their money and \ncoming back in with the consultants and the takeover of all the think \ntanks and everything else.\n  I can bring you right up to date. They just established a chair at \nthe Brookings Institute on free trade, and do you know who is financing \nit? Toyota. Toyota. So Brookings comes and says, this is great about \nfree trade. Oh, sure, those multinationals, they joined up with the \nforeign countries. The foreign countries want to dump everything. The \nmultinationals want to manufacture and dump everything back here.\n  Then, of course, the retailers. The retailers, we proved here in many \na debate, do not lower their price. They make a bigger profit. So every \ntime we bring up a reciprocal trade measure or try to get customs \nagents, which are needed because there is over $5 billion in \ntransshipments in violation of our agreements, whenever we try to get \nthat, the retailers are up here pigeonholing every Senator.\n  So you have the multinationals, the multinational banks, the \nconsultants, the campuses, the think tanks, and then read ``Agents of \nInfluence,'' by Pat Choate, and that was back 7 years ago when Japan, \none country, had a $113 million retainer of--I don't know how many law \nfirms or whatever it was around here--representatives. I got up at that \ntime the total salaries of all the House Members, 435, and all the \nSenators, 100. Of the 535, we were only paying to have represented the \npeople of America some $71 million. Japan was better represented in \nWashington at $113 million.\n  Read the book and you will see how these U.S. Trade Representatives, \nafter putting in time here, went to represent the other side. That is \nwhy we have the waiver. Senator Dole said you cannot represent a \nforeign entity and then come in here and represent us. But, of course, \nthe Finance Committee is in a fix, and there we are. There we are, in \nthe hands of all the lawyers around here. There are 60,000 lawyers \nregistered to practice in the District of Columbia. That is more \nlawyers than the entire country of Japan. And they come around here and \nthey hate lawyers, they hate lawyers. They are all billable hours. Get \nyourself charged on an ethics charge and try to find one for less than \n$400 an hour. They have never been in the courtroom. They never tried a \ncase. They come around here. They ought to all go to work for O.J. Fix \nthat jury. Fix that Congress. That is what we have on us, and you \ncannot get a word for anybody to represent the reality of this global \ncompetition.\n  There are two schools--two schools of international trade. One, of \ncourse, is Adam Smith, the market forces, fostered by David Ricardo, \ncomparative advantage, comparative advantage. But the other school, \nFriedrich List, which is almost top secret in this body: The strength \nand the wealth of a nation is measured not by what it can consume but \nby what it can produce. And that is the global competition. None of \nthem have gone down the road of Adam Smith. They have all gone down the \nroad of mixed economies, and that is what built the United States of \nAmerica. That is what built this great economic giant, the U.S.A.\n  The earliest day after we had won our own freedom, the Brits \ncorresponded back to our forefathers and they said, now, as a fledgling \nlittle colony here, you have gotten your freedom. You trade back with \nus what you produce best and we in Great Britain will trade back what \nwe produce best--free trade, free trade, free trade. Alexander Hamilton \nwrote a book that there is one copy of under lock and key over here at \nthe Library of Congress. I will not read the booklet. We have had a \ncopy of it in my file. But in the line, Hamilton told the Brits, Bug \noff. We are not going to remain your colony. We are not going to ship \nour natural resources, our timber, our coal, our iron, our wheat, our \nfarm stuffs, and you ship back the finished products. We are going to \nmake ourselves economically strong. And the second bill that ever \npassed this U.S. Congress in its history--the first had to do with the \nseal of the United States--but on July\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\n4, 1789, the second bill to pass this Congress was a tariff bill of 50 \npercent on 60 different articles. We started with protectionism, \nprotectionism, protectionism.\n\n  Later, when we were going to build a transcontinental railroad, they \ntold President Lincoln we could get the steel from England. He said, \nNo, we are going to build our own steel mills. And when we are \nfinished, we will not only have the transcontinental railroad, but we \nwill have an industrial steel capacity.\n  Again, in the darkest days of the Depression, when people were in \nfood lines, Franklin Roosevelt, with his Economic Recovery Act, put \nin--what?--put in subsidies for America's agriculture, payments to the \nfarmers that continue today, and protective quotas. And therein is the \nwonderful success story of America's agriculture.\n  So, we say, ``Preserve, protect, and defend.'' We have the Army to \nprotect us from enemies without, the FBI to protect us from enemies \nwithin, we have Social Security to protect us from the ravages of old \nage, Medicare to protect us from ill-health--we can go right down the \nfunctions of Government. When it comes down to a competitive trade \npolicy, we are in the hands of the Philistines, the multinationals. \nThey are pulling our strings. They want fast track. They do not want \nany debate. They want to just pass the bills and, if you don't do it, \nwe will make the agreement anyway and bag it. Bug off. That is what \nthey are telling us. So we put in our amendment.\n  I have had long experience in this field. I testified during the \n1950's. I came up here and testified before the old International Trade \nCommission, and Tom Dewey represented the Japanese. He chased me around \nthe room for a couple of days, and he said, ``Governor, what do you \nexpect the Third World emerging countries to make? Let them make the \nshoes and the clothing, the textiles. And we, in turn, in the United \nStates, we will make the computers and the airplanes.''\n  Now, they do not realize it--yes, they are making the shoes: 89 \npercent of the shoes on the floor of this Congress are imported; two-\nthirds of the clothing in this Chamber is imported. They are making the \nshoes and the clothing, the textiles, but they are also making the \ncameras, the watches, the electronics, the machine tools. You can go \nright on down the list. And the computers and the airplanes--all of it.\n  Wake up, America. The majority of that Boeing 777 is made offshore, a \ngood bit of it in China, the People's Republic of China. There are some \nof them who want to say Communist China, we are going to get a \nCommunist China airplane to ride around in. That is how far we have \ncome, but they do not want to admit to it.\n  So, there we are. What we have is a situation of the typical promises \nthey make. I am prepared to get into those promises, Mr. President, \nbut, perhaps, I see my distinguished colleagues have been very patient \nwith me. I guess they would be glad to be heard at this time, so I \nyield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, under the unanimous-consent agreement, an \nhour has been provided for the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee for debate on the resolution. I will yield myself \nsuch time as I may take from that hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for \nCharlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. Her nomination was \nfavorably reported by a unanimous vote of the Finance Committee on \nThursday, January 30, 1997. It is evident that the nomination of \nAmbassador Barshefsky has wide bipartisan support in the Senate. This \nis not surprising when one looks at the impressive record she has \ncompiled as a trade negotiator at the Office of U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, first as Deputy USTR and then as acting USTR.\n  During her nearly 4 years at USTR, Ambassador Barshefsky has \nsucceeded in negotiating an impressive list of multilateral and \nbilateral trade agreements aimed at opening foreign markets to U.S. \nexports. She has also distinguished herself as a vigorous advocate and \ndefender of U.S. trade interests. For example, most recently, \nAmbassador Barshefsky concluded an important agreement on insurance \nwith the Japanese--a matter I was actively involved in on behalf of the \nUnited States insurance industry. If this agreement is fully \nimplemented by the Japanese Government, it should result in substantial \nnew opportunities for United States insurance providers.\n  Similarly, at the World Trade Organization Ministerial in Singapore \nlast December, Ambassador Barshefsky was successful in pushing other \nnations to conclude a landmark agreement to eliminate tariffs on \ninformation technology products. Once put into effect, this Information \nTechnologies Agreement will result in billions of dollars in savings to \nU.S. companies and consumers.\n  However, Ambassador Barshefsky has also shown that she can reject bad \nagreements. She refused to enter into an agreement on trade in \nfinancial services that could have left U.S. financial service \nproviders in a worse position than before. Similarly, during the \nnegotiations on telecommunications services last spring, she had the \nresolve to walk away from the table when other countries had presented \npatently insufficient offers to open their telecommunications markets.\n  Her hard-nosed stand in the telecommunications talks forced countries \nto make substantial improvements in their offers, and the result was a \nhistoric agreement reached on February 15 to liberalize trade in basic \ntelecommunications services.\n  The Agreement on Trade in Basic Telecommunications Services will save \nconsumers hundreds of billions of dollars and will allow our \ntelecommunications industry to compete in foreign markets that were \npreviously closed to them.\n  Given these accomplishments and her demonstrated toughness and \nresolve on behalf of U.S. interests, I think there is no question but \nthat Ambassador Barshefsky is extraordinarily well qualified for the \nposition as U.S. Trade Representative. Indeed, her achievements, \nnegotiating skills and professionalism remind me of another able woman \nUSTR, Carla Hills.\n  We enter a time when we greatly need as U.S. Trade Representative \nsomeone with the qualifications that Ambassador Barshefsky brings to \nthe position. The next USTR will be called upon to manage a number of \ndifficult trade issues, including the increasingly complicated trade \nrelationship with China.\n  Specifically with respect to China, we face a ballooning trade \ndeficit and increasing tensions on trade matters with that country. \nMoreover, we will soon enter again into the annual debate over whether \nChina should continue to enjoy normal trade relations with the United \nStates, at a time when congressional views on this question will be \ninfluenced by China's action during the reversion of Hong Kong to the \nPeople's Republic this July.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky will also be responsible for negotiating with \nChina to ensure that it enters the World Trade Organization on \ncommercially viable terms, which provide for meaningful market access \nand a commitment from the Chinese to observe the basic rules of the \nWTO.\n  In addition, Ambassador Barshefsky will be the administration's point \nperson with respect to the difficult issue of renewal of fast-track \nnegotiating authority. She will also carry the responsibility to ensure \nthat the trade liberalization initiatives through the Free Trade Area \nof the Americas, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, and the \nTrans-Atlantic Marketplace proceed according to schedule.\n  These are all important issues, and I am most confident that they \nwill be handled appropriately working with someone like Charlene \nBarshefsky.\n  I would like to comment on the issue of the Ambassador's work for the \nGovernment of Canada and the Province of Quebec while practicing law in \nthe private sector.\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\n  Questions have arisen whether this work may fall within the terms of \nsection 141(b)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended in 1995 by the \nLobbying Disclosure Act.\n  That provision prohibits the President from appointing any person to \nserve as Deputy USTR or U.S. Trade Representative who has directly \nrepresented, aided, or advised a foreign government or foreign \npolitical party in a trade dispute or trade negotiation with the United \nStates. In my opinion, the vagueness of this new law and the fact that \nthere was no debate or legislative history on the provision when it was \nadded to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, make it difficult to determine \nwhether it covers or even should cover Ambassador Barshefsky's work in \nthe private sector.\n  In order to resolve this matter, the President formally requested \nCongress to enact legislation waiving the law in this instance. Senator \nMoynihan and I agreed that under these circumstances, a waiver was \nwarranted and, therefore, we jointly introduced Senate Joint Resolution \n5 to waive the prohibition.\n  For those who may have questions or concerns about this waiver, I \nwant to point out that Congress has previously passed legislation to \nwaive a statutory requirement on who may serve in a particular \nGovernment position with respect to a specific nominee. For example, in \n1989, Congress passed a waiver of the law requiring that only a \ncivilian may be appointed head of NASA, so that Rear Adm. Richard \nHarrison Truly could be appointed NASA Administrator. In 1991, \nCongress, once again, passed a waiver of the law requiring that only a \ncivilian may be appointed head of the Federal Aviation Administration \nso that Maj. Gen. Jerry Ralph Curry could be appointed FAA \nAdministrator.\n  I would also like to say specifically with respect to Ambassador \nBarshefsky that as Deputy USTR, she has been exempt from the \nprohibition in the Lobbying Disclosure Act. She has been forthcoming in \nproviding information to the Committee on Finance about the nature of \nher work while in private practice.\n  Moreover, in response to a question from me at her nomination \nhearing, the Ambassador stated that she had never lobbied the U.S. \nGovernment on behalf of a foreign government or a foreign political \nparty.\n  So under these circumstances, and in the interest of moving her \nnomination as expeditiously as possible, the entire Senate Committee on \nFinance agreed that a waiver was appropriate in this case and voted \nunanimously for the joint resolution. Therefore, I hope that all \nMembers of the Senate will also agree that the waiver is in the best \ninterest of confirming this nominee who clearly enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport and has already demonstrated that she is eminently qualified to \nserve in that position.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise, as is so frequently and \npleasantly my lot in this Congress, to support entirely the major \nstatement made by the chairman of the Committee on Finance, our revered \nBill Roth of Delaware.\n  As he stated just now, this proposal for a waiver, a very technical \nmatter, a prudent matter, comes to the floor of the Senate as a \nunanimous action of the Committee on Finance. Just last week, we had a \nrevenue measure which also came to the Senate with the unanimous \nagreement of the Finance Committee and was duly enacted and is now, in \nfact, law. The President signed that measure.\n  We are acting today at the request of the administration, which has a \nvery proper principled concern that if there is any question about the \napplication of this statute, then let that question be resolved by a \nwaiver, which is what we are doing.\n  In the specific instance, Mr. President, as an attorney in practice \nhere in Washington, Ambassador Barshefsky provided legal advice to the \nGovernment of Quebec on softwood lumber countervailing measures--I do \nnot fully claim to understand that--and to the Government of Canada \nitself.\n  As the chairman has observed and noted--was she seeking to influence \nactions here in the Congress? She gave legal advice. I cannot but doubt \nthat there are any number of solicitors in Ottawa who provide advice to \nAmerican firms on trade matters between the United States and Canada. \nWe, after all, have enjoyed a free trade agreement for nearly a decade \nand more and have been the closest economic partners for a century and \nmore.\n  The capacities that Ambassador Barshefsky brings to this job are \nformidable to the point of being dazzling. She is a master of the \nsubject and has a capacity for advocacy of the American position and \nAmerican interests that is surely unequaled in our time. The chairman \nreferred to one of her predecessors, Carla Hills, who was equally \ndistinguished in this manner.\n  There has not been a more dramatic example of American diplomacy--\nbecause we are talking about relations between nations--at its finest. \nWhen the much-announced, much-proclaimed agreement on \ntelecommunications last year found the other nations unwilling to make \nthe kind of reciprocal agreements that we required which were in our \ninterest and where there were times when negotiators from any country, \nincluding our own, would settle for less than what might be appropriate \nin order to get an agreement, Ambassador Barshefsky did no such thing. \nCharlene Barshefsky did no such thing. She walked out of the \nconference, only to come back in the recent weeks with a triumphant \ntelecommunications agreement of the very highest importance to this \ncountry.\n  She did it because she is a firm representative of the U.S. interests \nand can be someone of just a little hard edge when that seems \nimportant. Her arrival in a place like Singapore is front page news. I \nhope she would not mind that on certain Asian missions she is referred \nto as the ``Dragon Lady,'' although she has disarming, personable \nqualities. She is a tough negotiator.\n  I make this point simply because there is one overriding issue upon \nus right now--as a trading nation, as the world's largest trading \nnation, and the sponsor of the World Trade Organization--and that is, \nas the chairman indicated, the terms on which the People's Republic of \nChina will be granted admission to the World Trade Organization, the \nterms which are going to make it be the real test of that organization. \nAnd it will be decisive to its future.\n  It started well. It took a long time to get going. As the chairman \nknows, in the Dumbarton Oaks agreements that were reached with the \nUnited Kingdom at the end of World War II, we contemplated there would \nbe three major international institutions: The International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, which we know as the World Bank; the \nInternational Monetary Fund; and the International Trade Organization--\nthree international organizations, the latter to advance the reciprocal \ntrade programs that had begun in 1934 under Cordell Hull and the \nadministration of President Roosevelt after the calamity of the Smoot-\nHawley tariff of 1930.\n  The World Bank was duly established. The International Monetary Fund \nwas duly established. The International Trade Organization fell afoul, \ncame to grief, if you will, in the Senate Finance Committee. And so it \nwas a matter of some institutional satisfaction to the committee in the \n103d Congress to report out the legislation in which we joined, as had \nbeen negotiated, the Uruguay Round, the World Trade Organization to \nsucceed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which had a much \nmore limited, although indispensable, role in the period that followed \nour rejection of the ITO. And now we have the World Trade Organization.\n  The terms on which you enter this agreement and have membership in \nthis organization require an economy and economic practices very much \ndisparate, very much at a distance, if that is the correct term, from \nthose practices and that economy which we observe in the People's \nRepublic of China.\n\n  The terms on which entry can be negotiated are going to be complex \nand crucial. And we need a negotiator who can say no. The one thing \nBeijing needs to understand is that they will be across the table, or \nat a round table, in Geneva with a negotiator who can say ``No, \nperiod.'' Other than that, I think prospects for a successful, perhaps \nstaged, entry are good. It certainly\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\nshould not be dismissed. But it must be understood we are not going to \nreach agreement for agreement's sake, and to that end we have confirmed \nin the U.S. Senate the appointment of a U.S. Trade Representative who \ncan say, no--will do, has done.\n  So, Mr. President, I have the great honor to join with our chairman \nin this unanimous action of the Committee on Finance in reporting to \nthe floor this proposal for a waiver just to be on the safe side of the \nlegal question that might arise--and will not when we are finished \ntoday--and also, of course, the nomination of the Ambassador which will \nfollow in executive session.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa is on the floor. Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes from the time \non our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, would you please notify me when I have \nused 14 minutes, because I want 1 minute on the Hollings issue as well.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of Ms. \nCharlene Barshefsky as United States Trade Representative. Ms. \nBarshefsky has served as acting USTR since April 1996. So we are all \nfamiliar with her work. I have personally worked with her and her staff \non several issues in the past year. And I had the opportunity to watch \nher in Singapore, at the WTO ministerial, negotiate the Information \nTechnology Agreement. Based on her job performance and her \ninternational reputation as a strong advocate for U.S. interests, I am \nprepared to support her nomination today.\n  Mr. President, the next 4 years will be crucial for U.S. trade \npolicy. We are beginning our fourth year under the North American Free-\nTrade Agreement and third year under the World Trade Organization. The \nU.S. Trade Representative must closely monitor the implementation of \nthese agreements to ensure they are working to open markets to American \nexports.\n\n\n                        Fast-Track Negotiations\n\n  The USTR will also serve as President Clinton's point person in \nseveral key negotiations. First, she will have to negotiate with \nCongress on fast track authority. As you know, Mr. President, fast \ntrack means that Congress grants to the administration its authority to \nnegotiate trade agreements. Once an agreement is reached, it must be \nratified by Congress within a specified period of time and is not \nsubject to amendment.\n  Fast track is necessary because Congress, alone, has the \nconstitutional authority to enter into trade agreements. But as a \npractical matter, other nations are reluctant to negotiate agreements \nwith the President, that may later be modified by Congress. So I do \nbelieve it's necessary that Congress grant fast track authority to the \nPresident.\n  But fast track is a significant delegation of power. So its crucial \nthat Congress carefully tailor this delegation in order to accomplish \nits goals. And it's important that the President, in carrying out this \ndelegation, negotiate within the parameters of the authority granted to \nhim.\n  Herein lies the problem. Congress and the President often have \ndifferent ideas of what should be included in trade agreements. This \nadministration has made it clear that they want the authority to \nnegotiate on labor and environmental issues under the fast track \nprocess. But most of us Republicans don't believe that these issues \nshould be part of trade agreements.\n  So Congress has not given the President fast track authority since \n1994. And our foreign trading partners now doubt the desire of the \nUnited States to lead on trade issues. We are being left by the \nwayside. For example, after 3 years of NAFTA we are beginning to see \nvery positive results. Through the third quarter of 1996, for instance, \nexports to Mexico just from my State of Iowa are up over 34 percent. \nThe three NAFTA nations are now the world's largest trading bloc. And \nit's time to begin looking at expanding this free trade area to other \nnations in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n  But this cannot happen without fast track. So I implore Ms. \nBarshefsky to negotiate with Congress in good faith to achieve fast \ntrack. Let's put aside our partisan differences. And let's remember \nthat trade is the focus of these agreements. The United States cannot \ncontinue to insist on addressing other issues within the context of \ntrade agreements.\n  Issues such as environmental and labor standards are very important. \nBut there are avenues other than trade agreements that ought to be \npursued to influence the behavior of other countries. And the expansion \nof trade, itself, with another country can be an effective inroad for \nmaking change.\n  So let trade agreements stand on their own. They are difficult enough \nto negotiate without taking on the weight of these other issues. I'll \nhave more to say on fast track as negotiations progress with the \nadministration.\n\n\n                       China's Entry Into the WTO\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that Ms. Barshefsky does not have to spend all \nof her time negotiating with Congress. She also faces very critical \nnegotiations on admitting China as a member of the World Trade \nOrganization. These negotiations could affect the U.S. trade balance \nfor decades. I am reminded of Japan's entry into the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade in the 1950's. It seems that we are still paying \nfor lowering the standards to let Japan into the GATT.\n  In the area of agriculture trade, which is very important to my \nState, these negotiations may determine whether China becomes our \nlargest export market or our biggest competitor. The stakes are \nextremely high for American farmers.\n  That's why I'm concerned that some members of the Clinton \nadministration want to let China into the WTO at any cost. So I took \nthe liberty of asking both Secretary of State Albright and Ambassador \nBarshefsky about the terms of China's entry. I want to quote from their \nanswers in order to get their opinions on the public record.\n  Secretary Albright said,\n\n       We have requested that China make significant commitments \n     to liberalize its agricultural trading regime, including \n     reforming its state trading system, making substantial tariff \n     cuts, eliminating unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary \n     measures, and binding its subsidy levels.\n\n  She also stated:\n\n       If China is to join the WTO, we will need to have a \n     commercially acceptable protocol package of commitments by \n     China to open its markets in-hand before we will agree to \n     China's accession. That means real market access for U.S. \n     goods and services, including agriculture.\n\n  Then I asked Ms. Barshefsky to comment on Secretary Albright's \nstatements. She said,\n\n       I fully agree with the two above statements. China's WTO \n     accession can only occur on commercially meaningful terms. \n     And, just as you quote Secretary Albright, that means market \n     access for our goods, services and agriculture to the fastest \n     growing economy in the world.\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased with the way that both Ambassador \nBarshefsky and Secretary of State Albright responded to my questions. I \nhope this will continue to be the policy of their agencies.\n  I understand that it is very important to integrate China into these \nmultilateral organizations. I have always believed that we can \nencourage change in China more effectively if we engage them \neconomically. But we cannot sacrifice the interests of American workers \nand farmers by allowing China to subsidy their industries while keeping \ntheir markets closed.\n  So I will continue to monitor very closely the ongoing negotiations \nwith China. And I encourage Ms. Barshefsky to continue to take a hard \nline on this issue. I'm reminded of a meeting that I had with Ms. \nBarshefsky in Singapore when we were attending the WTO ministerial \nmeeting. Since it was reported in the local press, I don't think I'm \nbreaching any confidences by repeating it here in the Senate.\n  There was a meeting of the Quad nations, which is the United States, \nCanada, Japan, and the European Union, concerning China's entry into \nthe WTO. The local Singapore newspaper reported that Minister Leon \nBrittan of the European Union argued that bringing China into the WTO \nwas so important that conditions of entry should be relaxed. The \nJapanese minister disagreed very strongly with this position. And \napparently Ms. Barshefsky concurred with the Japanese minister.\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\n  I repeat this incident just to point out that there are different \nviews on this issue. Many nations will seek to treat China with ``kids \ngloves.'' So it is crucial that the United States play a leadership \nrole in assuring that our interests are protected.\n\n\n                            NAFTA Expansion\n\n  A third area of negotiations that could be significant in the next 4 \nyears is the expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nPresident Clinton promised back in 1992 that Chile would become a part \nof the NAFTA. But the lack of fast track authority has undermined this \npromise. Now, Chile has moved ahead and signed a free trade agreement \nwith Canada. And they have also become an associate member of Mercosur.\n\n  This is a good example of what happens when Washington fails to lead. \nThe rest of the world moves on without us. And the consequences are \nvery real in terms of U.S. jobs and standard of living.\n  Let's just take Chile, for example. Chile has the potential to become \na very important market for United States agricultural exports. Over \nthe last 10 years, the Chilean economy has grown at an average rate of \n6.5 percent and real per capita income is up 50 percent. And since \n1984, poultry consumption has risen 60 percent, pork consumption over \n45 percent and beef consumption over 30 percent.\n  The United States currently supplies most of the feed grain Chile \nuses to support their livestock production. But this market could be \nput in jeopardy. Chile is increasingly turning to neighboring countries \nwith whom they have preferential trade agreements to supply \nagricultural products. So the United States' failure to lead on trade \nhas a real impact in terms of lost markets and lost opportunities.\n  I also ask the President and Ms. Barshefsky to begin taking a hard \nlook at other nations in the Western Hemisphere for NAFTA expansion. \nBrazil and Argentina have already moved ahead and formed their own \ncustoms union, the Mercosur, with Paraguay and Uruguay. And the \neconomies of the Caribbean nations have been hard hit by the increased \ntrade between Mexico and the United States So they would like to enjoy \nNAFTA status.\n  This administration needs to articulate its vision of how free trade \nshould proceed in the Americas. Soon. Or it will be the United States \nwho is left out in the cold.\n\n\n                              Agriculture\n\n  One last issue I would like to discuss, Mr. President, is \nagriculture. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton \nmentioned that the United States is now exporting more goods and \nservices than at any other time in its history. I am glad he did that, \nbecause those of us in Washington need to articulate the benefits of \nfree trade. I was disappointed, however, that the President failed to \nacknowledge the contribution of agriculture, which is the ``shining \nstar'' of our trade balance.\n  As most sectors continue to run trade deficits, our farmers continue \nto produce food that the entire world wants to buy; 1996 was another \nrecord year for agricultural exports, totaling over $60 billion. This \nresulted in a trade surplus in agriculture goods of $26.8 billion. \nWhich is the largest surplus of any sector. Since our total trade in \nmerchandise suffered a $187.6 billion deficit in 1996, agriculture is \ntruly a shining star.\n\n  But that isn't to say we can't do better. The Uruguay Round \nagreement, ratified by Congress in 1994, was really the first step in \nopening up global trade for agriculture. That agreement not only \nlowered tariffs and quotas for ag products. It also addressed nontrade \nbarriers, such as unjustified health and safety concerns.\n  The agreement's sanitary and phytosanitary provisions mandate the use \nof sound science when setting health and safety standards for imports. \nNo longer is protectionist government policy or politics supposed to \ndecide whether a certain product is allowed into a country. Sound, \nscientific standards must be used.\n  Not surprisingly, these provisions are the subject of several current \ndisputes. The European Union's ban on U.S. beef and their failure to \ncertify our meat packing plants for export are just two examples. And \nthere are many more. The Clinton administration must vigorously enforce \nthese important provisions with our trading partners. We can't continue \nto allow other nations to breach their trade agreements in order to \nkeep out our agricultural goods.\n  The stakes have never been higher. Our farmers have become more \ndependent on world markets for their income. The revolutionary farm \nprogram enacted last year begins to lessen the Government's role in \nagriculture. The result is that, according to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, up to 31 percent of all farm income will come from foreign \nmarkets by the end of the decade. I don't know too many farmers who can \nafford to give up 31 percent of their income.\n  Beyond our current disputes, the next round of agricultural \nnegotiations at the WTO are set to begin in 1999. Ms. Barshefsky will \nbe a key player in these negotiations. That is why I was concerned \nabout recent staffing decisions at the U.S. Trade Representative's \noffice.\n  On the morning of Ms. Barshefsky's confirmation hearing at the \nFinance Committee, the Journal of Commerce ran a very disturbing \narticle. The article pointed out that the top two agriculture staffers \nat USTR had been replaced with a political appointee with no \nagriculture experience.\n  I had a telephone conversation and an exchange of letters between Ms. \nBarshefsky. She is convinced that these decisions will make her office \nmore responsive and effective on ag issues. So I am willing to defer to \nher judgment and her right to hire her own staff. I will, however, be \noverseeing her performance on these issues.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I have discussed several issues that I believe \nPresident Clinton and his nominee for USTR, Charlene Barshefsky, must \nlead on in the next 4 years. The last 2 years were a disappointment for \nthose of us who believe in the benefits of international trade. The \nlikes of Pat Buchanan and the AFL-CIO called the shots on trade for the \n1996 Presidential candidates. The focus was on lost jobs and companies \nmoving offshore.\n  The press ignored the multitude of stable, high-paying jobs that \ntrade has created in this country. And they ignored the benefits of \nfree trade to the consumers of this country. Let's not forget that \ntariffs are simply a tax imposed on goods that consumers buy.\n  The President and Ms. Barshefsky must use their positions as leaders \nto articulate the benefits of free trade. Tell the American people how \nworkers and farmers benefit from free trade policies. Tell them how \nmuch consumers save on their groceries and clothing bills because of \nfree trade. Articulate your vision for expanding economic opportunity \nin this country by selling our products overseas. Leadership is sorely \nneeded.\n  President Clinton, I believe you have chosen the right person in \nCharlene Barshefsky. But you will ultimately be measured by your \nwillingness or failure to lead the American people toward a brighter \nfuture in a global economy.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to say a brief word on the Hollings \namendment. It seems to me that Senator Hollings is really concerned \nwith a fundamental question that we all must answer. That is, what is \nthe relationship between Congress and the President in making trade \npolicy. In other words, does the President have the authority to enter \ninto international agreements, that change U.S. law, without \ncongressional consent?\n  Despite the debate that you will hear today, the answer to this \nquestion is relatively simple. Under our Constitution, the President \nonly has the authority that Congress has granted to him. During the \nfast track debate, which I hope we'll have this year, Congress will \ndefine the limits of the Presidential authority on trade matters.\n  But let's be clear about one thing. The President does not have the \nauthority to change U.S. statutory law without congressional action. \nThat is why Congress had to approve implementing legislation after the \nPresident signed the NAFTA agreement and the Uruguay round agreement in \nrecent years. The President did not have the authority to unilaterally \nconsent to these significant changes in U.S. law.\n  That is why I believe this amendment is unnecessary. But I also think \nit could be dangerous. The amendment\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\nis drafted so broadly that it could subject an agreement to \ncongressional approval every time it affects a minor regulation or \nadministrative practice. In my opinion, this would result in very few \ntrade agreements being consummated. Our trading partners would never \nhave the assurance they were negotiating an agreement that would be \nrecognized by Congress.\n  Look at just what we have accomplished in the last few months, \nnegotiating the Informational Technology Agreement and the \nTelecommunications Agreement. These landmark agreements will result in \nthousands of high-paying jobs being created in the United States. I \ndon't believe these agreements would have been possible given the \nchilling effect of the Hollings amendment.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Hollings amendment and \nthen vote to confirm Charlene Barshefsky. It's time to focus on moving \nthis country ahead by negotiating new agreements and opening new \nmarkets to U.S. exports.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my very distinguished colleague \nfrom New York. Not only the residents, citizens, and voters of the \nState of New York, but the rest of us in the country are very fortunate \nto have in the U.S. Senate the Senator from New York. He has added so \nmuch to our understanding of historical issues, cultural issues, and \ninstitutional memory. I just want to thank the Senator very much for \nall he has done for us.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support strongly the nomination of \nCharlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. Why is that? Although \nthe Senator from South Carolina raises very important issues--and I \nunderline that; they are extremely important--I think we can't wait. We \nhave very important trade issues facing us at the moment. We have a \nsuperb candidate in Charlene Barshefsky, who is awaiting confirmation. \nI believe we have no alternative, no choice, but to do the right thing. \nAnd the right thing is to get on with it, let her get on with the job, \nand let's confirm her as our USTR. At the appropriate time, at a later \nmoment, we will take up the issues raised by the Senator from South \nCarolina, and they are very important issues indeed.\n  I might remind everyone that our international trade is growing \ndramatically. When Congress created the position of USTR just over 20 \nyears ago, imports and exports, together, made up only about one-eighth \nof the U.S. economy. Today, international trade makes up nearly a full \nthird of our economy. That is a dramatic increase, from one-eighth to \none-third, in just over 20 years. Last year, exports of goods and \nservices reached a total of $835 billion, and in agriculture, which is \nthe largest industry in my State of Montana, we saw exports hit $60 \nbillion last year.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say, too, Madam President, that the people \nunderstand this. Last year they came from all over Montana to a trade \nconference I hosted on how we can establish better trade relationships \nwith and engage more deeply with China. People came from all over our \nState. I was amazed at the success of that conference. The Chinese \nAmbassador was there, and also, I might add, we invited our U.S. \nAmbassador to China, the Honorable Jim Sasser--he very much wanted to \ncome but was unable because of a last moment conflict.\n  I might also remind us that American imports also hit a record of \nabout $949 billion last year. We imported more than we exported. That \nmay not be so good. But the point is that we as Americans are competing \nmore than ever before against foreign competition, whether it is in \nheavy industry, high technology, or agricultural services. It all \nunderlines the importance of trade in general and also the importance \nof being sure that we have a top-notch trade negotiator to make sure it \nis all fair. And we certainly have that in Charlene Barshefsky.\n  What has she done? For my State of Montana, I'll mention one thing in \nparticular. She and her predecessor, Mickey Kantor, worked vigorously \nto enforce agreement with Canada to restrict the deluge of grain coming \ndown to the United States as near as 1993 and 1994. Wheat ordinarily \nreceived in the United States was about 1.35 million metric tons of \nCanadian grain. In those 2 years it rose to about 2.4 million metric \ntons. It depressed prices in the American markets and violated, \nfrankly, a tentative, implicit agreement with the Canadians.\n  I must say I was very impressed with the vigor and enthusiasm with \nwhich Charlene Barshefsky helped negotiate that agreement. Because of \nher work, Montana farmers got some confidence that trade would be fair.\n  Second, exports of beef. This is the first time in American history--\nin 1996--when we exported more beef than we imported. A lot of beef \nproducers in the United States are concerned and have the impression \nthat we import more than we export. That has been true in the past.\n  I might say that about 5 years ago we imported about 2 million pounds \nof beef and we exported only about 75,000 pounds, in that magnitude. \nBut in the last 5 years it has reversed, and for the first time, in \n1996, we exported more. We exported more beef than we imported because, \nagain, of the vigorous efforts of our trade negotiators in opening up \nforeign markets for American products.\n  I am sure other folks from around the country understand and have \nsimilar stories that they can pass on to us.\n  She has done a terrific job. And we need someone of her caliber on \nthe job full time, as we enter a new era in tackling very difficult new \nissues.\n  I might remind us that for most of the 1980's and 1990's, trade \npolicy revolved around three major areas: in the Uruguay round of GATT, \nNAFTA, and our market access problems with Japan. These areas still \nremain on our agenda. We have to monitor the WTO. We have to monitor \nthe NAFTA closely. And our trade imbalance with Japan remains our \nlargest bilateral deficit yet, although it is being surpassed by that \nof China.\n  It is only fair to say that after a great deal of hard work from \nCharlene Barshefsky and the USTR staff that our performance with Japan \nhas improved markedly. Counting goods and services, exports are up from \n$75 billion to over $100 billion last year; quite an improvement.\n  As important as these issues are, we now must look ahead to two new \nstrategic challenges in trade. First is whether to negotiate new trade \nagreements, and, if so, what should they be? For example, the \nadministration has pledged to work toward a hemispheric trade agreement \nand also to pursue market access in Asia through the Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation Forum, and through bilateral agreements.\n  These are broad, long-term, important goals. Much about them remains \nto be decided. But the administration will soon ask for fast-track \nauthority to make any serious steps forward, and it is clear that \nAmericans have a right to expect greater market access from these \ncountries.\n  I look forward, as we all do in the Senate, to hearing from the \nadministration as to what specific agreement it envisions and how these \nagreements will address contentious issues like treatment of trade-\nrelated labor and environmental issues. When that is available, in \nprinciple, I believe the Congress should grant fast-track authority. \nAnd I will work with Ambassador Barshefsky and the administration as to \nwhat the terms are, of how broad the scope is, so that we have in the \nCongress a very good mutual agreement and partnership with the \nadministration as we work together to develop these trade agreements.\n\n  The second is the integration of formerly Communist countries into \nthe world trade system. China, Russia, Ukraine, Vietnam, and other \npost-Communist nations make up about a third of the world's population. \nThey are large producers of manufactured products, primarily \ncommodities, and agricultural goods. All hope to enter the WTO, the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  Their reform efforts are commendable but remain incomplete. Most of \nthese countries retain pervasive subsidies, poorly developed price \nsystems, and close links between government and business which make \nthem particularly challenging candidates for WTO membership. Weak \naccession protocols could make market access very difficult for years \nto come and could also\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\npromote dumping in a wide range of areas.\n  China is the largest of these countries and the most immediate \ncandidate for WTO membership--not to mention that it is the world's \nlargest country and the fastest growing large economy. So its WTO \naccess will have enormous consequences in its own right, and it will \nvery likely serve as a model for others.\n  I will have more to say on this subject at a later date. But the USTR \nand Congress must be very careful and very rigorous. China and other \nWTO applicants must meet international standards not only on \ntraditional tariff and quota issues but also on national treatment, \ntrading rights, transparency, subsidies, and safeguards against import \nsurges, and many other issues. On our side of the table, we must be \nwilling to address the question of permanent MFN status for these \ncountries if we are to gain the full benefit of their WTO membership.\n  These are difficult and complex issues, but I am confident that \nAmbassador Barshefsky is the right person to take them on. I can think \nof none better. She is terrific. She is intelligent, tough, capable, \nand she has proven herself one of the best public servants America has, \nand we need her on the job.\n  I support the nomination and I support the waiver to make it \npossible. And while the Senator from South Carolina has an amendment \nwhich raises a very serious and very important issue, that is one which \nwe should bring through the normal committee process. It should not \nstop the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky. We need a tough negotiator. \nWe have her right before us. We need her now in Geneva. During this \nweek WTO is attempting to negotiate terms with China. We need her there \nto negotiate for us.\n  I warmly endorse her nomination. I hope my colleagues will do the \nsame.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished manager \nof this bill.\n  Madam President, I wish to express my wholehearted support for \nAmbassador Barshefsky. In my dealings with her over the years, I have \nfound her to be a skilled and certainly an expert trade negotiator, who \nhas worked tirelessly on behalf of U.S. interests. I have no doubt as \nto her integrity and her commitment to this job. And I believe that \nview is shared by every single member of the Finance Committee, all of \nwhom have worked closely with her. Thus, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport her nomination with a strong show of support in the upcoming \nvote.\n  Before we vote on the nomination, Madam President, we must first vote \non the amendment to Senate Joint Resolution 5 offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. The \namendment requires that any trade agreement that in effect amends U.S. \nlaw must be approved by Congress.\n  I must say that this amendment puzzles me. Trade agreements to which \nthe United States is a party and the call for changes to U.S. law, have \nno force of law whatsoever until implementing legislation is passed by \nCongress. Congress always has the final say.\n  The USTR takes pains to ensure that Congress is involved in every \nstep along the way in these trade negotiations. As a member of the \nFinance Committee, I can personally testify to the fact that the USTR \nprovides regular and, indeed, frequent--indeed, in abundance, a \nplethora of--briefings on all of the international discussions.\n  During 1995 and then again in 1996, the USTR provided literally \nhundreds of briefings to Members and more than a dozen committees on \nongoing trade issues and responded to approximately 200 congressional \nrequests for information every month. That is what was going on in the \nUSTR's office. The Finance Committee staff is briefed exhaustively, as \nare the staff involved with several other committees. Any Member who \nhas an interest in a particular issue can request personal briefings. \nThat has been the process, not only during this administration but \nduring prior administrations. It is the right process. Trade, \nobviously, is not solely the privilege of the executive branch but a \nresponsibility conferred by the Constitution on the Congress.\n  Do Congress and the administration always agree? Of course not. \nIndeed, if the disagreement is strong enough, the administration runs \nthe risk of Congress flatly rejecting the arguments in question. Thus, \nin this process is the built-in enforcement mechanism that constantly \nkeeps individuals in touch.\n  So the amendment that is being proposed puzzles me. It does seem to \nreiterate current process but there are two words that give me pause. \nThe words ``in effect.'' What exactly does ``in effect amend or repeal \nstatutory law of the U.S.'' mean? Is it a reference to regulations? \nRegulations are issued under statutory authority. Is it a reference to \nthe administration officials changing the law by themselves? But the \nConstitution does not allow that. Only Congress can change U.S. law.\n  So it seems that the amendment may be aimed at the recently concluded \ntelecommunications agreement and at certain provisions of that \nagreement. As I have outlined, the process of negotiating trade \nagreements takes into account the individual views of Members of \nCongress. The end results of trade agreements may include certain \nprovisions that some of us do not like. I can clearly remember Senator \nDanforth of Missouri was not too pleased with the final provisions of \nthe Uruguay Round on subsidies. He did not like it. Yet, he worked with \nthe administration on the implementing legislation and at the end of \nthe day chose to give the agreement his support.\n  Disagreement with provisions of final trade agreements is going to \nhappen. Clearly, with 435 Members of the House and 100 Members of the \nSenate, there are going to be disagreements with the administration. To \nminimize these, we individually or in groups make sure the \nadministration is aware of our views. We go to the STR during the \nnegotiating sessions and say this is what I am concerned with. This is \nwhat we are concerned with in my part of the country. And at the end of \nthe day the agreement may or may not be satisfactory. If we feel \nstrongly enough that it is not satisfactory, we are free to express our \nviews, that is, vote against the proposal, vote against the treaty.\n  So my conclusion, Madam President, is twofold. First, it simply is \nnot clear what this amendment would do if it is enacted. Any \nlegislation with an unclear meaning simply, in my judgment, is not wise \nlegislation to enact.\n  Second, if the amendment is to express displeasure with a particular \nprovision of, say, the telecommunications agreement, we already have in \nplace a system that takes into account such views. I might also note \nthat I understand from the leadership of the Finance Committee if this \namendment, the Hollings amendment, is adopted, it would cause the House \nto reject consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 5, thus placing the \nBarshefsky nomination in jeopardy.\n  So this is a grave matter, Madam President. It is in the very clear \ninterest of the United States to put in place as soon as possible a \nstrong and effective special trade representative. In other words, Ms. \nBarshefsky. She needs to be on the job. We have a lot of trade \ndiscussions and disputes that are ongoing. Charlene Barshefsky is an \nabsolutely superb advocate and we need to get her confirmed. So for \nthese reasons, I am supporting the nomination and the waiver bill and \ncannot support the proposed amendment. So I urge my colleagues to \nreject the Hollings amendmentand to vote for the waiver and for the \nnomination of Charlene Barshefsky.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, a member of the Committee on Finance, who is one of those who \nvoted unanimously to report this nomination to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President, and I thank the Senator from \nNew York.\n  I urge the Senate to move expeditiously to confirm Ambassador\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\nCharlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. She is the right \nperson at the right time for the very difficult task she will be \nundertaking.\n  I also urge the immediate passage of Senate Joint Resolution 5, \nwithout amendment, to extend the waiver for the position which \nAmbassador Barshefsky currently holds as Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. This waiver as granted under Senate Joint Resolution 5 \napplies only to Ambassador Barshefsky. It does not change the \nunderlying law, nor does it create a precedent for future waivers. This \nwaiver deserves to pass without amendment. The merits of the issue \nwhich are being raised by my friend and colleague from South Carolina \ndeserve to be heard, but I would submit that this is not the forum for \nthe resolution of those questions. There will be other more appropriate \ntimes which will not entail endangering the expeditious confirmation of \nAmbassador Barshefsky to her important post.\n  As Senator Moynihan has just stated, when Ambassador Barshefsky's \nnomination was presented to the Finance Committee, her record was \ncarefully examined. The result of that examination was a unanimous vote \nby the committee in favor of her confirmation. Ambassador Barshefsky \nwas referred to at the confirmation hearing as one of the most \nqualified, seasoned trade negotiators ever to be offered for this \nposition. As Deputy and Acting U.S. Trade Representative, she has been \nan outstanding advocate of the trade interests of the United States of \nAmerica. She has proven herself to be a brilliant negotiator. The \nFinance Committee and, I hope soon, the Senate as a whole will \nrecognize these qualities. Ambassador Barshefsky has demonstrated a \nconsistent focus on opening global markets, opening those markets \nthrough bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that increase \nexport opportunities for U.S. businesses and creates jobs for U.S. \nworkers. She has played an instrumental role in solving trade disputes \nwith Japan, China, and numerous other nations on behalf of the United \nStates.\n\n  Madam President, I was recently in Florida with a group of \nrepresentatives of important agricultural interests who were looking \nforward to going to China with Ambassador Barshefsky to open markets \nfor American agriculture in that tremendous nation of population. That \nis an example of the aggressive pursuit of opportunities for American \nindustry and agriculture that has hallmarked Ambassador Barshefsky's \nperformance in her current positions and will do likewise when she is \nconfirmed as the U.S. Trade Representative.\n  It is a pleasure to give this outstanding nominee my unqualified \nendorsement. I have no question that Ambassador Barshefsky will be an \noutstanding representative and leader at the U.S. Trade Representative \noffice. I urge my colleagues to join in voting to confirm her \nnomination today. We need a timely decision. We have already paid a \ncost for the delay that has occurred to date. The U.S. trade position \nis weakened when it does not have a confirmed U.S. Trade Representative \nrepresenting our interests. We need to transfer that weakness into the \nstrength of steel that will come when Charlene Barshefsky represents \nthe United States as our Ambassador, as the U.S. Trade Representative.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Delaware for yielding me some \ntime.\n  Madam President, today we must decide to vote in favor of a waiver to \nallow a very competent and worthy candidate to be the new U.S. Trade \nRepresentative or to vote to uphold current law. I have decided to \nuphold current law. It must be made clear that I do not doubt the \ncompetency and ability of Ambassador Barshefsky to faithfully serve as \nthe next U.S. Trade Representative. She has done a tremendous job as \nthe Deputy USTR and has proven herself to be a competent public \nservant.\n  The law we are asked to waive is not some arcane law that has been on \nthe books for decades which may have served us well in the past but is \na law that was passed only 2 years ago. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of \n1995 was a very important piece of legislation that opened the doors to \nthe public to see who is attempting to influence our elected officials. \nSection 21 of the act specifically states that no person who has \nrepresented a foreign entity may be appointed as a U.S. Trade \nRepresentative or the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord section 21 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act and from the United \nStates Code section 2171(b).\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995\n\n     SEC. 21.

Madam President, while I regret that I have to vote \nagainst Ambassador Barshefsky's worthy nomination, I believe as \nlawmakers we must not only strive to enact the best laws but also to \nobey not only the letter of the law but also the spirit of the law. Why \ndo we pass laws if the first time they become problematic, we decide to \ngrant a waiver. In the last couple of months, I have heard too many \npoliticians say that it was out of necessity that they bend the law or \nignore the spirit of the law or assume that it may not be illegal, and \nthen promise it will not happen again. My solution to this dilemma is \nto follow the law or repeal it.\n  While in the other body, I voted for the Lobbying Disclosure Act and \nhave consistently promised my constituents that I will work hard to \nenact congressional reform. In this vein, I cannot turn my back on them \nor on the law that I fought hard to enact. I understand why many will \nvote for this waiver because Ambassador Barshefsky would make a \ntremendous USTR, but I must regretfully vote no and only hope that this \nwaiver granting procedure doesn't start a bad precedent for the future. \nIn conclusion, I am voting\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\nagainst the Hollings amendment and the waiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may use on \nthe hour for the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, on January 30, 1997, the Committee on \nFinance unanimously reported without amendment Senate Joint Resolution \n5, the waiver resolution for Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky's \nappointment to serve as U.S. Trade Representative. As I said earlier, I \nstrongly support Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination. Therefore, in \norder to expedite the appointment of this nominee, it is my considered \nopinion as chairman of the Finance Committee, that the waiver should \nremain clean and should not be amended.\n  Now, Senator Hollings has introduced an amendment to the waiver. This \namendment would require congressional approval of any trade agreement \nthat ``in effect'' amends or repeals U.S. statutory law.\n  While I am convinced that as a general matter the Senate should not \nadd amendments to the waiver, I have a number of concerns specifically \nabout Senator Hollings' amendment, which lead me to oppose the \namendment most strongly and to urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  My primary concern is that passage of the Hollings amendment will \nseriously jeopardize Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination. I have a \nletter from Chairman Archer of the House Ways and Means Committee \nstating that the House would view the Hollings provision as a revenue \nmeasure that, under the origination clause of the Constitution, must \noriginate in the House of Representatives. As such, Chairman Archer \ninforms me that he will invoke the constitutional prerogative of the \nHouse to refuse to consider the waiver resolution for Ambassador \nBarshefsky if the Hollings amendment is added.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Chairman Archer's letter be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROTH. I want to emphasize one point to those that support the \nBarshefsky nomination. Regardless of whether one supports the Hollings \namendment on the merits, the House will blue slip it. This means that \nnot only will the House kill the Hollings amendment, but the Barshefsky \nwaiver along with it.\n  This fact alone is ample reason to vote against the Hollings \namendment.\n  In addition to this procedural concern, I also have substantive \nproblems with the Hollings amendment. I admit this amendment may have \nsome superficial appeal. Nonetheless, it is completely unnecessary \nbecause it is based on a false assumption, implying a problem that \nsimply does not exist. The amendment gives the erroneous impression \nthat the President is currently able to implement international trade \nagreements calling for changes in U.S. statutory law without the \npassage of implementing legislation by Congress. That is simply not \ntrue. If a trade agreement requires changes in U.S. statutory law, \nCongress must enact the legislation to implement those changes. \nCongress must pass that legislation in order for the agreement to have \nfull force and effect with respect to the United States.\n  A good example is the OECD Shipbuilding Subsidies Agreement, a trade \nagreement that was negotiated in 1994. Congress has been unable to pass \nlegislation to implement the changes in U.S. law called for under that \nagreement. As a result, the agreement has no force and effect with \nrespect to the United States. Absent congressional passage of \nimplementing legislation, there is nothing the President can do to \nimplement the agreement on his own.\n  Now, what if Congress and the President have a legitimate \ndisagreement about whether a particular trade agreement calls for a \nchange in U.S. law? My understanding is that this issue is the basis of \nSenator Hollings' concern--that the President can act to supersede laws \npassed by Congress.\n  First of all, this is not a situation where trade agreements are \nsomehow deemed to be treaties, with the full force of law, but which, \nunlike a treaty, the President is able to implement without \nCongressional approval. Trade agreements are executive agreements. And \nthe simple fact is that if there is an inconsistency between an \nexecutive agreement and a statute, the statute prevails. In other \nwords, a law passed by Congress remains on the books in full force and \neffect and cannot somehow be trumped by an executive agreement or any \nother action by the President.\n  In my opinion, the language in the Hollings amendment requiring that \nCongress approve any trade agreement that ``would in effect amend or \nrepeal'' U.S. statutory law also suffers from several other defects.\n  It is vague, subjective, leaves undefined what ``in effect'' means, \nand does not specify who determines whether a law is effectively \nchanged by a trade agreement.\n  Trade agreements cannot effectively change or repeal U.S. law. An \nagreement may call for actual changes in U.S. statutory law, in which \ncase, as I have already explained, Congress must pass implementing \nlegislation in order for it to have force and effect with respect to \nthe United States. Or an agreement does not call for such changes, in \nwhich case it can be implemented without congressional action. Indeed, \nthe language in the Hollings provision is so vague and ill-defined, \nthat it could require congressional approval of any and every trade \nagreement the President negotiates, even those not calling for actual \nchanges in U.S. statutory law. This could immobilize our ability to \nnegotiate trade agreements, even on relatively minor issues, as \nCongress would be required to approve tens, if not hundreds of such \nagreements.\n  All of these agreements would also be fully amendable. The result \nwould be to shackle our capacity to conduct any trade policy.\n  Because the language in the amendment is so vague, I also fear that \nit could call into question the legal status of previous agreements \nthat have not been fully implemented, including the recently concluded \nInformation Technologies Agreement. This landmark agreement was \ncompleted pursuant to authority provided to the President by Congress \nunder the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, and currently needs no further \ncongressional action in order to be fully implemented. However, that \nsituation could change under the Hollings amendment, which would \nseriously jeopardize this historic agreement to provide a market \nopening for U.S. companies worth $500 billion a year.\n  The amendment appears to be driven, in part, by Senator Hollings' \nconcerns about the telecommunications agreement recently negotiated at \nthe World Trade Organization.\n  My understanding is that Senator Hollings believes the commitments \nthe administration makes in the telecommunications agreement will \nchange current U.S. telecommunications law without Congress having the \nopportunity to pass implementing legislation.\n  I would like to point out that others disagree with Senator Hollings' \nview that this agreement will change current U.S. law. Senator McCain, \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, Senator Burns, along with Congressman Oxley, vice-chair \nof the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, wrote a letter to the \nPresident expressing their view that no implementing legislation is \nnecessary.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter also be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ROTH. In conclusion, Madam President, we must keep focused on the \ntask at hand--fulfilling the Senate's constitutional prerogative with \nrespect to Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination. We should not be bogging \nthis nomination down with extraneous and controversial matters, such as \nthe Hollings amendment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting to table the Hollings amendment, which will be made at the \nappropriate time.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                U.S. House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 1997.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr., Chairman,\n     Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth: I am writing in reference to \n     legislation that would waive the application of section \n     141(b)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by the Lobby \n     Disclosure Act, with respect to the nomination of Ambassador \n     Charlene Barshefsky as United States Trade Representative. As \n     you know, I fully support Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination \n     and urge the Senate to pass quickly legislation permitting \n     her confirmation so that the House may then consider it \n     promptly.\n       At the same time, I am concerned that the legislation \n     passed by the Senate may include provisions that contravene \n     the origination clause of the U.S. Constitution, which \n     provides that revenue measures must originate in the House. \n     Specifically, I understand that the Senate may be asked to \n     consider particular provisions, such as one suggested by \n     Senator Hollings, which would change the manner in which \n     Congress considers trade agreements and legislation having a \n     direct effect on customs revenues. Although I strongly \n     support Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination, I would have no \n     choice but to insist on the House's Constitutional \n     prerogatives and to seek the return to the Senate of any \n     legislation including such a provision.\n       I look forward to working with you on this matter.\n           With best personal regards,\n                                                      Bill Archer,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 1997.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write regarding inaccuracies in \n     correspondence you reportedly have received from a few of our \n     colleagues regarding the World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     telecommunications talks and restrictions on international \n     investment.\n       As you are aware, officials of the United States Trade \n     Representative (USTR) are hard at work negotiating a market-\n     opening agreement in the WTO Group on Basic \n     Telecommunications (GBT). Questions have been raised \n     concerning the Administration's authority to negotiate an \n     agreement lowering barriers to international investment.\n       It has been stated that USTR sought amendments to the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 to clarify legal limits on \n     foreign investment in U.S. telecommunications firms. This is \n     incorrect. As the authors of the Senate and House foreign \n     ownership provisions, we wish to state for the record that we \n     were acting on our own initiative and that no Administration \n     official requested that we legislate in this area. Any \n     discussions we had with the Administration on these issues \n     came at our request.\n       We firmly believe that the Administration possesses the \n     authority to negotiate an agreement without implementing \n     legislation. Indeed, the correct legal interpretation of the \n     relevant statute is that private foreign firms are free to \n     invest in American firms without restriction unless ``the \n     [Federal Communications] Commission finds that the public \n     interest will be served by the refusal or revocation'' of a \n     telecommunications license. To allege that implementing \n     legislation is necessary is to misinterpret the law. Indeed, \n     it is the very prevalence of such misreadings that caused us \n     to attempt to reform the ownership rules.\n       We wish to state our support for USTR's negotiators. We \n     appreciate their work to promote free trade in goods and \n     services. We believe that a freer flow of capital is a \n     logical extension of this policy. Artificial limits on \n     international investment only harm U.S. firms by denying them \n     access to foreign capital and foreign markets.\n       Thank you for your consideration on these thoughts.\n           Yours truly,\n     John McCain,\n       Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n     Transportation.\n     Michael G. Oxley,\n       Vice Chairman, House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, \n     Trade and Consumer Protection.\n     Conrad Burns,\n       Chairman, Senate Subcommittee on Communications.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I rise simply to endorse, with fullest \nconviction, the statement of the chairman in this matter, and to \nemphasize, if I may be allowed, that executive agreements can never \noverride statute. If they do, they are null and void, and the courts \nwill so hold.\n  For us even to suggest that that might be possible would be to \nintroduce into our governmental administrative arrangements matters of \nambiguity and doubt and uncertainty that would have the capacity to \nincapacitate what has turned out to be an extraordinarily successful \nprocedure in world trade.\n  It has taken us 60 years--63 from the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act \nof 1934--to reach a point where we are the world's largest trading \nnation and leading the way in these matters in the world and hugely \nrespected for that and known to have the capacity to negotiate when the \nCongress gives that authority to the President. The subsequent \nnegotiations are executive agreements. If any part of them should, by \ninadvertence or intention, be contrary to present statutory law, they \nare null and void. That proposition must never be put into question as \nI fear this matter before us might do.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Madam President, it is difficult to really determine the position of \nour distinguished leadership on the Finance Committee. In one breath, \nthey say it is unnecessary and, in the next breath, they say it is \ngoing to really ruin $500 billion in trade. Then they come back and say \nthe statutory law pertains and talk at length about how they have \nworked over the years with Ambassador-designate Barshefsky.\n  In fact, the point was just made by my distinguished colleague from \nNew York, since 1934, they have been working. I have been on the \nCommunications Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee for 30 years, and \nI watched it develop over that 30-year period. When we had a majority \non our side of the aisle, I introduced the formative legislation to \nrevise that 1934 Communications Act with the initiative that would \nallow the trade representative to negotiate an international \ntelecommunications agreement.\n  I am totally familiar, during the past 3 to 4 years, with what they \nare talking about because this is a Senator who has been working with \nthe White House and with the trade representative, be it Ambassador \nKantor or now Ambassador Barshefsky.\n  It was Ambassador Kantor who said the law needed amending. I already \nhad that letter printed in the Record. Now they say there is no law to \nbe amended. Heavens above. In fact, the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, comes in here and says it is totally \nunnecessary. He said, ``Actually, my provision, which is \nconstitutional''--that is all it does, is cite a fundamental of the \nConstitution that you have in order to amend or repeal a statute. It is \nnot a regulation, as the Senator from Rhode Island tried to read into \nit.\n  It is very simple, very clear, not vague, not vague at all. It is the \nconstitutional provision of three readings in the House, three readings \nin the Senate, and signed by the President.\n  When they say it is unnecessary, just look at the letters just \ninserted in the Record. I refer to the letter of the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, the Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, and \nCongressman Oxley on the House side, and they say:\n\n       We firmly believe that the administration possesses the \n     authority to negotiate an agreement without implementing \n     legislation.\n\n  Now, heavens above, we know Ambassador Kantor thought so and asked \nthat it be changed. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord section 310(a) and section 310(b) of the Communications Act of \n1934.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 310. [47 U.S.C. 310] LIMITATION ON HOLDING AND TRANSFER \n                   OF LICENSES.\n\n       (a) The station license required under this Act shall not \n     be granted to or held by any foreign government or the \n     representative thereof.\n       (b) No broadcast or common carrier or aeronautical en route \n     or aeronautical fixed radio station license shall be granted \n     to or held by--\n       (1) any alien or the representative of any alien;\n       (2) any corporation organized under the laws of any foreign \n     government;\n       (3) any corporation of which more than one-fifth of the \n     capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens or their \n     representatives or by a foreign government or representative \n     thereof or by any corporation organized under the laws of a \n     foreign country;\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n\n       (4) any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by \n     any other corporation of which more than one-fourth of the \n     capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens, their \n     representatives, or by a foreign government or representative \n     thereof, or by any corporation organized under the laws of a \n     foreign country, if the Commission finds that the public \n     interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such \n     license.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let's just read 310(a):\n\n       The station license required under this Act shall not be \n     granted to or held by any foreign government or the \n     representative thereof. . .\n\n  And in section (b) starting off:\n\n       No broadcast or common carrier license--\n\n  And I jump down to four:\n\n       . . . any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by \n     any other corporation of which more than one-fourth of the \n     capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens, their \n     representatives, or by a foreign government, or \n     representative thereof, or by any corporation organized under \n     the laws of a foreign country.\n\n  It is just as plain as can be and very simple, totally disregarded by \nMs. Barshefsky. We kept telling her, we wrote the White House letters, \nwe admonished, ``Wait a minute, your predecessor came before us, \ntestified, asked that it be changed,'' and then we see in the letter by \nthese three gentlemen the phrase ``as authors of the Senate and House \nforeign ownership provisions.'' False. Mr. Oxley, yes, at the request \nof the administration. On the House side, it put in there the 100-\npercent ownership which could be negotiated away. That was never agreed \nto.\n  I authored the reciprocity provision with the snapback condition on \nthe Senate side. So I have to correct the distinguished chairman of my \ncommittee and the chairman of our subcommittee, Senators McCain and \nBurns. As the authors, this is very misleading to the particular body \nhere and the other Senators reading that. And then reading further, \n``No administration official requested that we legislate in this \narea.'' These gentlemen were not intimate to the negotiations or \nmembers of the conference committee that actually did the work.\n  Let me refer to, on August 4, 1995, the Congressional Record. Page \n8451 is the page. I am quoting Mr. Bliley, the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee on the House side and the chief negotiator for the House \nmembership. I quote:\n\n       Additionally, we have addressed the issue of foreign \n     ownership or equity interest in domestic telecommunications \n     companies. The new language reflects the hard work of Messrs. \n     Dingell and Oxley, who sponsored the proposal in committee, \n     the administration and myself. I must observe, Mr. Chairman, \n     that the foreign ownership issue is the only matter on which \n     the administration offered specific language to the Commerce \n     Committee. And I believe this administration's concerns have \n     been largely resolved.\n\n  Madam President, there it is. We made the official Record. The \nadministration, after they did not get their desired result on the \nSenate side, went to work on the House side. And they did request, \nwhere they say no request after requesting us. We talked to them back \nin 1995 several times. We knew exactly what they had in mind. We tried \nto comply. But we did not change the law.\n  Now we have leading Senators, the chairman of our full committee and \nthe chairman of our subcommittee, saying that the administration \npossesses the authority to give away 100 percent in violation of \nsections 310(a) and 310(b). That is why it is necessary. To be told now \non the Senate floor that the Constitution, that we all take an oath to \nsupport and protect--it has a chilling effect that is out of the whole \ncloth. To come now and say it is vague is out of the whole cloth. You \ncannot make language any more categorical. I did not say \n``regulation,'' like they tried to read and make for confusion. It is \njust as plain as can be.\n  I have talked with many of the Members, and asked if they wanted it \nchanged in any way. And they said they did not see how you could vote \nagainst it. Well, the way they vote against it is to come up and now \nargue the capabilities of what I was going to hear again.\n  Heavens above. When we had Ambassador Carla Hills, who is now gone in \nrepresentation I guess, we had to put the provision in law. I am glad \nto see the Senator from Colorado on the floor saying that he did not \nagree with that waiver. That was the Dole waiver that we are talking \nabout. The Hollings waiver, which is on the appropriations bill, that \nis in relation to the special trade or U.S. Trade Representative, that \nyou shall not engage in the representing of foreign interests in trade \nfor a 5-year period, which applies of course to our distinguished \nfriend, Mickey Kantor.\n  But when we had Carla hills, every one of these negotiators--the \nFinance Committee leadership comes with again the ``Dragon Lady, Dragon \nLady,'' ``Oh, man, tough, tough, tough.'' He did say, the Senator from \nNew York, that Ms. Barshefsky was formidable to the point of being \ndazzling. Well, I will agree. She has been dazzling. And this Senator \nhas not. That is exactly the point I am trying to make.\n  I met with Ms. Barshefsky, and she did have a dazzling approach of \n``I want to work with you. I want to work with you. I want to work with \nyou.'' As I have stated earlier, ``Madam, I want you to work with the \nlaw, not me. Just adhere to this law.''\n  We have had this in dispute. We have had this in discussion. We have \nhad this in negotiation with Members and Senate leadership in the \nCongress, leadership in the White House. And the law is the law. It has \nnot been changed.\n  And they go there and can justify further that the distinguished \nnegotiator is so tough she just walked away on the telecommunications \nnegotiations.\n  Well, that is not what the Wall Street Journal stated on May 20 of \nlast year. And I quote:\n\n       U.S. negotiators did pull back from a telecom deal at the \n     11th hour, but not because Clintonites were queasy about \n     inking another market opening pact in an election year. \n     Administration trade officials would have been delighted to \n     trumpet a telecom deal to counter mounting U.S. skepticism \n     about the WTO's accomplishments, but they walked away from \n     the table after industry executives and leading Republican \n     and Democratic Senators balked.\n\n  Madam President, that is exactly what happened on the telecom deal.\n  And they mention the capacity deal out there in Singapore. One would \nsay how she worked so hard. Well, she gave away the store, without \ntalking to the capacity manufacturers, specifically she gave away 4,000 \njobs in the Carolina's.\n  The Japanese make these capacities, but when she did away with the \n9.6-percent tariff, you have the weakness of the yen combined with the \ntariff phased out. The existence of Kaymet in Greenville, SC, I \nremember that. And I asked the officials there, and they were never \ncontacted. Just at the last minute they agreed to it. Fine, you can get \nwhen you give away the store in capacities, when you give away your \nbroadcast entities.\n  Under this agreement--I want to make it crystal clear--Nippon \nTelephone & Telegraph can come in here and buy CBS, ABC, NBC.\n  I talked earlier with one Senator. He was talking about the \nopportunity that Castro seems to do business with the Canadians. He \ncould get the Canadians to come in and buy a station down in Miami and \nreally turn the particular Senator from Florida into an upset \ncondition. He is wanting to get into China and we have to move in a \nhurry. I have a good eye here today, but the Senator from Florida wants \nto be able to have any foreign entity come in, Castro or otherwise, \nQadhafi, the whole kit and caboodle of the rascals around the world or \nany foreign country. They delight now in coming in and buying these \nthat we have been trying to protect.\n  That is why the Members would not agree. They held fast. I am \nspeaking on behalf of the majority of the U.S. Senate, 95 votes, if you \nplease. We approved that. And that was in discussion up until the last \nminute, and they would not yield. So there it is. They do so well on \nthese other agreements.\n  Let us see, Madam President, how they have done on this particular \none.\n  If you believe the U.S. Trade Representative, world commerce would \ncome to an end unless we continue to negotiate these one-sided \nagreements. But the truth of the matter here is Ambassador Barshefsky, \nin announcing the successful conclusion of this telecom negotiations \nstated--and I quote:\n\n       This agreement represents a change of profound importance.\n\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\n\n  U.S. companies now have access to nearly 100 percent of 20 \ntelecommunications markets. Now, unfortunately, Madam President, \nnothing has changed. Nothing has changed at all. Once again, the trade \nrepresentative has obtained inadequate concessions.\n  A review of those agreements--not these laudatory press releases--\nreveals that the market openings are limited, at best, or nonexistent, \nat worst.\n  While the United States has agreed to permit complete foreign \nownership of our broadcast properties and U.S. telecommunications \nproviders, our major trading partners have severely restricted our \naccess to their most well-established and entrenched companies. USTR \nclaims that Australia, Italy, Japan, France, New Zealand, and Spain \nhave all agreed to permit ownership or control of all \ntelecommunications providers. Yet, you take a closer look and you see \nthere are severe foreign ownership restrictions still remaining in \nplace for Vodafone and Telstra in Australia, with Stet in Italy, KDD \nand Nippon Telephone and Telegraph in Japan--you cannot own any of it--\nTelecom NZ in New Zealand, Telefonica in Spain, France Telecom in \nFrance that prevents U.S. providers from owning the controlling \ninterests or no interest at all in these telecommunication giants.\n  U.S. companies have access so long as they are not interested in \ngetting into the best and most sophisticated and competitive companies. \nThey could come in and buy AT, not just the companies like GTE, or \nwhatever. They can come in and buy the broadcast properties, which is \nmost disturbing to this particular Senator.\n  Now, going further, Madam President, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, \nIndia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Canada permit no foreign control \nfor facility-based providers. The fastest growing and most important \nmarkets in the world are closed tight as a drum. Take the Korean \nmarket. Foreign individual shareholding in Korea Telegram is limited to \n3 percent--3 percent. We gave away our most powerful negotiating tools, \njust for 3 percent. When you give away 100 percent, there is no more \nnegotiations, you are through. Ask Senator Dole--been there, done that. \nIt is over with. You got no more negotiating authority or any \nnegotiating tools.\n  Or take Canada. The Canadians provide for no foreign control of \nfacility-based providers--none. Yet, under this agreement, Bell Canada \ncan purchase any United States-based provider it wishes. What a \nwonderful agreement. What a wonderful agreement they are all bragging \nabout.\n  The other developing markets also include severe restrictions. Brazil \nhas liberalized ownership restrictions only with regard to seller, \nsatellite, and nonpublic services. Mexico has retained ownership \nrestrictions on all types of services except seller. Poland retains \nforeign ownership restrictions for wireless, international, and long \ndistance. So the total liberalization of the U.S. marketplace, what \nincentive was that liberalization? What incentive do these countries \nhave to liberalize their particular markets any further? None whatever. \nNone whatever. We have given away the store.\n  I told you in the very beginning about clothing, and they keep \nexporting the jobs faster than we can possibly create them --300,000. \nWe were going to create 200,000, but we have exported already, lost \n300,000 jobs in textiles alone. And we can go further.\n  The FCC recently issued an international notice of proposed \nrulemaking. This particular rulemaking would force foreign providers to \nlower their prices. However, many of the enforcement mechanisms \ncontained in this particular rulemaking are violations of the MFN, most \nfavored nation provisions. Different benchmarks based on the gross \ndomestic product, denying access to providers from countries who refuse \nto meet the benchmarks, and granting waivers to those who restructure \nmore quickly are all integral parts of these benchmark policies, but \nillegal and likely to be challenged, no doubt in the WTO.\n  So the agreement on telecom can have perverse effects on the price \nsystem they are trying to tell us about now, telling the competing \ncountries we have a question there with respect to ownership and MCI, \nand with respect to Sprint, so they stay quiet. You do not find them \nall coming in here. And they are being told, ``Hush now, at the FCC we \nwill help you with the access places in these international long-\ndistance calls, and we are going to get something done.'' They will \nnever get it done. Watch this MFN provision and watch the World Trade \nOrganization.\n\n  These are the kind of promises that continually come up when we have \none of these agreements. Just remember, Madam President, the promises \nthey made with NAFTA. You have to realize, we must learn from \nexperience. As George Santayana said, those who disregard the lessons \nof history are doomed to repeat them. We should see the history of this \nwonderful U.S. trade agreement that they had with NAFTA. At that \nparticular time, they said if we fail to pass NAFTA, one, Mexico would \nface economic collapse; two, immigration would increase; three, drugs \nwould flow freely; four, 200,000 new jobs would not be created; five, \nthe U.S. exports surplus would disappear; six, Asian investors would \nmove into Mexico to take advantage of the growing markets. That is why \nthey said we had to approve NAFTA.\n  We have approved NAFTA, and this is exactly what happened--exactly \nwhat happened. Mexico is in economic collapse; immigration has \nincreased; the drugs flow freely down there; 200,000 jobs have not been \ncreated; the U.S. exports surplus has disappeared. We had a $5 billion \nsurplus. It is now a $16 billion deficit. The Asian investors who were \ngoing to be prevented from moving in are moving in like gangbusters and \ndumping back here under NAFTA free trade arrangements into the United \nStates.\n  I could go on further. I see some here who want to talk, but I will \ncomplete this thought now, because we had the classic case for free \ntrade with an emerging country, and the Secretary of Treasury, in \nparticular, the Deputy Secretary of Treasury, Lawrence Summers, said, \nthis is really it, we really are getting free trade now. And everybody \nis going to get, I think they said, about $1700 for everybody, and we \nwere going to have everybody better off.\n  Well, Lawrence Summers, he is the one that sold this thing to the \nHouse memberships and the Senators. Since that time, he has now \nappeared on Thursday, January 16, in the Congress, and I quote from the \nWall Street Journal of that particular date. ``By many measures, most \nMexicans are worse off than they were before the financial crisis,'' \nDeputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers conceded.\n  The Members do not have a sense of history, understanding, or \nappreciation. What happened is that a million Mexicans have lost their \njobs since NAFTA has passed. Wages have fallen by a third. Mexico's \nexternal debt reached $150 billion, higher than that during the debt \ncrisis back in 1982. The bold visionary man of the year, Carlos \nSalinas--that is right, in December, after we voted in November, they \nmade him the man of the year. Now he is living in exile in Ireland and \nyou cannot catch him. He is the man of the year.\n  This is the kind of nonsense that we have to put up with. If we want \nto go through the same act, same scene, dragon lady, tough, and \neverything else, it makes a sorry agreement, sells out the store. And \nwe call that progress, and we have to create jobs, and education, \neducation, education is the solution. Well, Madam President, like I \nsay, if they read one thing, they ought to read the book, ``One World, \nReady Or Not'' by Bill Crider. They will get an education on where we \nare, because the author spent 2 years going around the world, as well \nas in the United States, talking to the various executives and quoting \nthem at that particular time. You can't understand some of the various \nprovisions.\n\n  I think, since I have the opportunity to present them, we ought to \nunderstand, in country after country, the precious rules of \ninternational trade. In India, for example, when General Motors wanted \nto sell its European-made Opal, the price of admission was a radiator \ncap factory. So GM moved the factory from Britain. In Korea, to sell \nfast trains, the French agreed to subcontract the assembly to the \nKoreans. In China, AT agreed to manufacture advanced switching \nequipment as a quid pro quo for wiring Chinese cities. In Australia, if \nyour sales are above a certain threshold, you must negotiate with the \nGovernment on an agreement locating research and development in \nAustralia. For production,\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\nyou must export 50 percent of what you import, and it must have 70 \npercent local content. At least 33 electronics companies from Japan, \nEurope, and the United States have agreed to do that.\n  According to an official from Motorola, ``If you don't cooperate with \nthe Australians, they have the statutory authority to exclude you from \nbidders' lists and deny regulatory permits for products.''\n  Well, Madam President, it's not just out there in the Pacific rim, \nwhere the control--Friedrich List kind of control --trade that works, \nthat builds them up. Right this minute, one-half of the world's savings \nis in the country of Japan. While they are talking about the yen and \nthe devaluation of it and while they are talking about the banking \ndifficulties, watch what Edmund Finkleton said in ``Blind Side.'' Come \nthe year 2000, while they are a bigger manufacturing country, with 120 \nmillion, compared to our 260 million and the vast natural resources \nthat we have in the United States, they already outproduce us. They \nwill have a larger economy and gross domestic product--that little \ncountry of Japan. Why? They control it. As Friedrich List says, the \nwealth and strength of a nation, if you please, is measured not by what \nthey consume, but what they produce. Akio Marita went on further--I was \nat a forum with him about 16 years ago up in Chicago. We were talking \nabout the Third World emerging nations, and he commented: ``The \nemerging country has to develop a manufacturing capacity in order to \nbecome a nation state.'' After we talked a few minutes, he pointed to \nme and said, ``Senator, that world power that loses its manufacturing \ncapacity will cease to be a world power.''\n  We have gone, in a 10-year period, from 26 percent of our work force \nin manufacturing down now to 13 percent. We are back to Henry Ford. \nHenry Ford said that he wanted his workers to be able to purchase the \narticle they were producing. Madam President, today, middle-America \nworkers, not having those manufacturing jobs, can't afford the car. \nThey can't purchase it. We are losing our middle class, all along, if \nyou please, competing with ourselves.\n  Over 50 percent of what we are importing, if you please, is U.S. \nmultinationally generated. The U.S. multinationals are the fifth column \nin this trade war that we are in. They are in behind the lines gutting \nus here in the Congress, working through the special trade \nrepresentative, trying to take away the authority under the \nConstitution to make laws and otherwise regulate foreign commerce. That \nis the authority of the Congress, and that is the reason we have that \nparticular amendment. But we always talk, and I listened to the \ndistinguished President when he talked about trade. He only mentioned \nexports.\n  I want to challenge anybody to go to a CPA when they do their tax \nreturn next month and say, ``Let's just talk about what we got in, not \nwhat we spent, just one side of the ledger.'' If you had a CPA that \nmade up your return that way, you would fire him. But that is \nconstantly, constantly, constantly the way we look at the returns with \nrespect to international trade.\n  What really happens is, yes, while we in the United States are the \nmost productive industrial workers, whereas we have improved \nproductivity, and whereas we are, for example, in my State, an \nexporting State--I was just down at a Presidential Exporting Council \nmeeting in Greenville, SC, and we are proud of it--the imports far and \naway outdistance the exports.\n  In the last 15 years, before we got to last year, there has been an \naverage of over $100 billion a year deficit, imports, in the balance of \ntrade. That means we have bought from the foreigners $1.5 trillion more \nthan we have sold to them. But how do you get that through to the \nFinance Committee where they just casually go on and on talking about \ndragon ladies and what a wonderful agreement we have? What, Madam \nPresident, is the merchandise deficit--I say ``deficit''; I repeat \n``deficit''--in the balance of trade last year? The merchandise deficit \nin merchandise trade was $187 billion.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, we made some money off of loans, insurance, and \nservices. So the overall deficit was quoted to be $114 billion. But I \nam looking at that industrial backbone. I am looking at that economic \nstrength. I am looking at that world power trying to continue being a \nworld power. I am realizing more and more every day that the 7th Fleet \nand the atom bomb don't count anymore. They just don't regard it. You \nare not going to use a nuclear attack; we all know that. I was bemused \nwhen they moved the fleet into the Taiwan Strait, because, in 1966, I \nwas on an aircraft carrier, the Kitty Hawk, up in the Gulf of Tonkin, \nand we could not stop 20 million North Vietnamese. They didn't have \nplanes and choppers and all this equipment that we had. But we have \nalready tried that aircraft carrier. I wondered how an aircraft carrier \nor two in the Taiwan Strait was going to stop 1.2 billion Chinese when \nit could not stop a mere 20 million Vietnamese. Come on. Money talks. \nThe economic strength, and in the world trade councils and otherwise in \nthis global trade war that we are in--we are unilaterally disarming. We \nare giving away capacity. That capacity agreement in Singapore was \nwhere they manufacture them in Japan but Japan very cleverly got the \nEuropeans to bring the pressure on us. And we walked away and said it \nwas a good agreement. And I have lost 4,000 jobs in my State. I am \nlosing thousands of jobs with NAFTA. I am looking around. Now I am \nseeing in telecommunications--what effect is this going to have? I \nguess in order to keep the Senator from South Carolina quiet they will \nbuy the TV stations and run them because under the agreement they can. \nThere is no question about it. They can own these broadcast properties.\n\n  Down to the basic fundamental involved, just a couple of weeks ago we \nhad Washington's Farewell Address here. The very Founding Father talked \nabout the fundamental of the Hollings amendment. I can almost quote \nword for word. He said, If, in the opinion of the people, the \nmodification or distribution of the powers under the Constitution be in \nany particular wrong, then let it be changed in the way that the \nConstitution designates, for while usurpation in the one instance may \nbe the instrument of good it is the customary weapon by which free \ngovernments are destroyed.\n  That is the line of this particular amendment. We are giving it away. \nWe proceed by a fifth column. We are talking about jobs but we are \nexporting them faster. We are importing even faster the finished goods. \nWe are weakening the democracy. The middle class is disappearing. And \nthey are all hollering ``Whoopee. The economy is good, and let's give \nsome millions so that politicians of one group can investigate \npoliticians of another group about politics.'' That is the most asinine \nthing that you have ever seen. But that is where they give all the \ntime. I can see some impatience. They don't want to listen about \ninternational trade, and the trade war. No. They don't want to listen \nabout that. But they want to talk about independent prosecutors and \ninvestigators. I would give millions to the Federal Election Campaign \nCommission. They are bipartisan. Let them investigate, no holds barred. \nI would give even more millions to the Department of Justice. Let them \ninvestigate, no holds barred, for any violation of the law.\n  But mind you me. It seems like we have learned enough here from that \nWhitewater thing. We went through an exercise. We had 44 hearings, \nmillions of dollars wasted, and time and everything, all hoping to get \non TV and investigate each other. Now they want to start up this \nsession and talk about bipartisanship, and not talking about what is \neroding the democracy itself in this country. I say that because when I \ntalk about the middle class, Chesterton wrote that the strength of this \nlittle democracy here in America was that we had developed a strong \nmiddle class.\n  We are headed, if you please, the way of England. That is what they \ntold the Brits after World War II. ``Don't worry. Instead of a nation \nof brawn, you will be a nation of brains. Instead of producing \nproducts, you will provide services; a service economy. Instead of \ncreating wealth, you will handle it and be a financial center.'' And \nEngland has gone to hell in an economic hand basket. You have the haves \nand the have-nots, London is no more than an amusement park. You go \nthere, and the Parliament is talking the same kind of\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\nextraneous nonsense that we are engaged in, and investigating each \nother and not getting on with the serious matters of truth in \nbudgeting. Let's have it. I am going to talk to a group here in just a \nminute, and I hope we can get to them so that we can bring the record \nout about truth in budgeting.\n  And truth in trade negotiations agreements and trade--an agreement \nhas been made, not a treaty. They insist that you don't have to come \nback to the Congress itself when they amend the law, and they are in \n100-percent agreement of foreign ownership. There is no question about \nthat. They just say it is not necessary while other Members say it is \nnecessary. I thought that we ought to clarify once and for all our \nduties here, and have a clarion call, or a wake-up call, on this most \nimportant issue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not be able to use that time \nbecause I have to go to another meeting. I appreciate the time and the \ncourtesy of the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth. But I would like \nto use 20 minutes because my friend from South Carolina covered a broad \nvariety of issues, some of which I assure my colleague from South \nCarolina we will be addressing in hearings in the Commerce Committee--\nthe results of NAFTA, the results of free trade; perhaps some of the \nreasons why unemployment is at its lowest in America. The last quarter \nit was just downgraded to 3.9 percent GNP growth--the reason Americans \nfinally in the lower middle-incomes are seeing increases; why this \neconomy is the envy of the world; why it is that free trade has played \nsuch an important role.\n  I had the pleasure--the distinct pleasure, I say to my friend from \nSouth Carolina--of spending some time in his State. There happened to \nbe an important Republican primary in the last election. It was a great \nprivilege and honor for me to get to know many of the wonderful \ncitizens of his State. In case he has not noticed, they are doing very \nwell. They are working at the BMW plant. They are working at the Sony \nplant. They are working at all these corporations and companies that \nhave come to this terrible country of ours which is so protectionist \nand so outrageous. They are coming to our country, I am sure the \nSenator from South Carolina has noticed. And in the view of the South \nCarolinians that I spoke to, they think it is a lot better with the \nhigh-paying jobs at the BMW plant than at a textile mill; than standing \nin front of a loom in that kind of back-breaking, sweat labor that \nexisted; where they are getting higher salaries and more benefits, \nthanks to the companies and corporations that have come into South \nCarolina; thanks to the enlightened leadership of the State of South \nCarolina, including the Senator from South Carolina who has attracted \nthem.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would love to yield. But I just listened for the last \n45 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina, and, as much was I would \nlike to hear from him again, I have to go to another meeting. I \napologize. But if the Senator from South Carolina would promise me to \nbe brief, I will be glad to yield to him for a brief answer.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are very proud that the Senator from Arizona has \nbeen to the showcase area up there in the Piedmont. But down there we \nhave that situation where there is 11 percent unemployment in Richland, \n14 percent in Williamsburg and Barnwell, and, 12 percent over in \nMarlborough. So we have the haves and have-nots.\n  I am very proud. I made the first trip to Europe where we have 100 \nGerman plants, 50 Japanese plants now. And I am very proud that I \ninstituted the technical training which makes us most productive at \nBMW. We thank the Senator, very much, for his visit. I would be glad to \nshow him the other parts that I am also worried about.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from South \nCarolina that I did travel the entire State. His point is well made \nthat it is not a totally even economy. He can come to my State and find \nout that in the southern part of my State it is as high as 35 to 40 \npercent unemployment in the city of Nogales. But the overall economy is \ngood. It is better, in my view, because of free trade, and again the \nenlightened policies of seeking and obtaining foreign corporations who \ncome in and give high-paying jobs.\n  I also, by the way, have had the chance to go to Hilton Head and \nCharleston and some of the other areas that are doing extremely well. \nBut there is no sense in going through a road map of the depiction of \nthe State of South Carolina which is a lovely and beautiful State, as \ncertainly the Senator from South Carolina well knows.\n  But I want to repeat to him again. We will have hearings in the \nCommerce Committee about the state of the American economy, about the \nimpact of trade, where protection works and where it doesn't, and what \nthe effects of NAFTA has been and whether we should expand NAFTA, which \nwould be a proposal of the administration.\n  I will say with all respect to the Senator from South Carolina, I \nbelieve the members of the committee and the American people will be \nenlightened by our debate because I know that the Senator from South \nCarolina is well informed and holds very strong views, as do I and \nother members of the committee. I note the Senator from West Virginia \nis here, who also has his problems within his State.\n  So I hope the hearings we will have will not only have a legislative \nresult but also will perform the much-needed function of enlightening \nthe American people and our colleagues as to what free trade is all \nabout, its effects, and, by the way, the effects of protectionism and \nrestraint of trade.\n  I do oppose the amendment offered by Senator Hollings, and I will at \nthe appropriate time offer a motion to table. This amendment, in my \nview, jeopardizes Ms. Barshefsky's nomination. The chairman of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Archer, has conveyed to Finance \nCommittee Chairman Roth that the House will reject the amendment and \nthereby kill the nomination of a very qualified individual.\n  I share with my colleagues the position of the President of the \nUnited States. Mr. President, I think it is very important. I ask \nunanimous consent that the statement of administration policy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\ns.j. res. 5--waiver for ustr appointment (roth (r) de, and moynihan (d) \n                                  ny)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports the enactment of S.J. \n     Res. 5, which would authorize the appointment of Charlene \n     Barshefsky as the United States Trade Representative.\n       When the Senate Considers S.J. Res. 5, Senator Hollings' \n     amendment relating to the President's long-standing authority \n     to carry out trade agreements may also be considered. The \n     Administration strongly opposes the Hollings amendment, which \n     would effect a major change in trade agreement implementing \n     procedures with immediate and harmful effects on U.S. \n     consumers, firms, and workers. The Hollings amendment would \n     hinder, delay, and, in some cases, jeopardize agreements that \n     greatly serve the Nation's interests.\n\n\n               harmful effects of the hollings amendment\n\n       The Hollings amendment could require congressional approval \n     of every trade agreement that might be construed to require a \n     change in U.S. law. The amendment is unnecessary to assure \n     that the Executive Branch is conforming to congressional \n     mandates on trade negotiations, is overly burdensome for both \n     the President and the Congress, and could endanger the \n     benefits to the United States of some trade agreements.\n       The overwhelming majority of trade agreements that the \n     President concludes can be--and traditionally have been--\n     implemented under existing statutes. If the authority to \n     implement an agreement does no already exist, then the \n     President must seek that authority. If the President were to \n     implement an agreement in a manner that is not authorized by \n     law, the courts can strike down such actions. If the Congress \n     disagrees with a trade agreement, it can pass legislation \n     directing the President to implement the agreement in a \n     particular way or to refrain entirely from implementing that \n     agreement. If a trade agreement requires a change in \n     statutory law, Congress along has the authority to make such \n     a change. The Hollings amendment is unnecessary to clarify \n     this point.\n       However, the Hollings amendment goes much further, and the \n     absence of hearings has precluded a full opportunity to \n     determine precisely what the implications of the\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\n     amendment are. By requiring congressional action whenever a \n     trade agreement would ``in effect'' change U.S. law, the \n     Hollings amendment could impose long delays on implementing \n     trade agreements that would otherwise bring immediate \n     benefits to U.S. consumers, firms, and workers. Moreover, the \n     vague term ``in effect'' would cause great uncertainty, since \n     the amendment leaves undefined who determines when an \n     agreement ``in effect'' requires a change in law and what \n     implications arise for implementing changes in regulation \n     or administrative practice called for in trade agreements.\n       The burdensome character of the amendment becomes clear \n     when one considers that the Administration concluded \n     approximately 200 trade agreements in the last four years. \n     Under the Hollings amendment, any such agreement that \n     occasioned any change in law, including technical and \n     typically non-controversial changes to our tariff schedule, \n     would have to be approved by the Congress.\n       The prospect of nearly continuous consideration of trade \n     agreements by the Congress also raises the possibility of \n     delaying the entry into force of agreements beneficial to the \n     United States. For example, the Hollings amendment could \n     greatly delay--and perhaps jeopardize--recent agreements \n     that:\n       Elminiate tariffs on 400 pharmaceutical products shipped to \n     key markets around the world (these tariff cuts had been \n     widely sought by our medical community because of their \n     potential to quickly lower the costs of producing anti-AIDS \n     drugs and other life-saving pharmaceuticals);\n       Cuts $5 billion in global tariffs on semiconductors, \n     computers, telecommunications equipment, software, and other \n     information equipment (these are tariff cuts that directly \n     benefit high-technology products made by some of our most \n     highly competitive industries, and that support 1.5 million \n     manufacturing jobs and 1.8 million related services jobs); \n     and\n       Open the global market for basic telecommunication \n     services, providing enormous benefits to our dynamic U.S. \n     telecommunications industry.\n       If the Hollings amendment were applied to these agreements, \n     they would have to be submitted to Congress for review and \n     approval. Yet each of these agreements was negotiated under \n     congressional authorization and in close consultation with \n     Congress, and each enjoys overwhelming industry support.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I will not go through the whole statement \nof administration policy except to say the administration strongly \nsupports the resolution which will authorize the appointment of \nCharlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. Among other things it \nsays:\n\n       The Hollings amendment could require congressional approval \n     of every trade agreement that might be construed to require \n     changing U.S. law. The amendment is unnecessary to assure the \n     executive branch is conforming to congressional mandates on \n     trade negotiations, is overly burdensome for both the \n     President and Congress, and could endanger the benefits to \n     the United States of some trade agreements.\n       The prospect of nearly continuous consideration of trade \n     agreements by the Congress also raises the possibility of \n     delaying the entry into force of agreements beneficial to the \n     United States. For example, the Hollings amendment could \n     greatly delay--and perhaps jeopardize--recent agreements that \n     eliminate tariffs on 400 pharmaceutical products shipped to \n     key markets around the world * * * cut $5 billion in global \n     tariffs on semiconductors, computers, telecommunications \n     equipment, software * * * open the global market for basic \n     telecommunication services, providing enormous benefits to \n     our dynamic U.S. telecommunications industry.\n\n  Mr. President, what does the Washington Post say about it? It says:\n\n       The Telecommunications Deal. After 3 years of tough \n     negotiations, the world's leading economies have reached a \n     landmark agreement to liberalize trade in telecommunications \n     services. Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene \n     Barshefsky, who led both sets of talks, predicted the U.S. \n     information technology industry will now lead the growth of \n     the U.S. economy as the car industry did 40 years ago. This \n     wasn't a traditional agreement in which one country \n     grudgingly agreed to accept textile imports, say, in order to \n     gain access for its tomato exports. Instead, every nation \n     involved acknowledged the benefit to itself of liberalization \n     and deregulation of the model that the United States and \n     Great Britain have pioneered. Half the world's people have \n     never made a phone call. Poorer countries, where most of them \n     live, will attract the investment that they need only if they \n     play by these new rules of openness and competition.\n\n  The Washington Times:\n\n       Teleco Mania. For the second time in three months, tough \n     minded and determined U.S. trade negotiators under the \n     auspices of the 2-year-old World Trade Organization have \n     hammered out a multinational high tech trade agreement that \n     will be immensely beneficial to firms and workers based in \n     the United States and consumers worldwide.\n\n  The list goes on and on, Mr. President, of the almost universal \npraise of this landmark agreement that Ms. Barshefsky has been able to \nachieve. Frankly, there were a lot of pessimists who believed that she \ncould not do that. I believe she is well qualified for the job. \nPresident Clinton referred to Ambassador Barshefsky as a brilliant \nnegotiator for our country. She is a tough and determined \nrepresentative for our country, fighting to open markets to the goods \nand services produced by American workers and businesses.\n  I will not go through her qualifications, Mr. President, in the \ninterest of time because they are illustrious.\n  Her foresight and depth of understanding of our country's \ninternational trade relations are essential to our Nation's continued \neconomic growth. She is exceptionally qualified, and I am sure that the \nfull Senate will join me in confirming her nomination to be the U.S. \nTrade Representative.\n  From financial services to Japanese insurance to global \ntelecommunications, Ambassador Barshefsky has proven herself to be a \ntough negotiator. For example, in April of 1996, as one of her acts as \nUSTR, Ambassador Barshefsky walked away from the poor efforts made \nunder the auspices of the World Trade Organization regarding basic \ntelecommunications services. She made everyone come back to the table \nand last month concluded the WTO's basic telecom agreement which \nrepresents a change of profound importance. A 60-year tradition of \ntelecommunications monopolies and closed markets will be replaced \nstarting in January 1998 by market opening, deregulation and \ncompetition, the principles championed here by many of us for a long \ntime.\n  Senator Hollings has concluded that the recently announced \ntelecommunications agreement of the World Trade Organization would \nchange U.S. statutory law. Not only do I disagree, but as I mentioned, \nthe Senator finds himself on the other side of the argument with \nPresident Clinton.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that written responses to \nquestions from Senator Lott and Senator Kerrey be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Written Response to Questions From Senator Lott\n\n\n                           Telecommunications\n\n       Could you please explain in greater detail the \n     administration's position that no implementing legislation, \n     or legislation of any kind, will be required for the \n     telecommunications agreement currently under negotiation in \n     Geneva.\n       The U.S. offer will reflect our statutory obligations. \n     While at this time we do not believe its implementation will \n     require any legislative changes, we are continuing to consult \n     with Congress on this issue.\n       The offer allows market access to the local, long distance \n     and international services markets through any means of \n     network technology, either on a facilities-basis or through \n     resale of existing network capacity. The U.S. offer limits \n     direct foreign investment in companies holding common carrier \n     radio licenses, as is required by Section 310 (a) and (b)(1), \n     (2) and (3) of the Communications Act of 1934 (the ``Act''). \n     The offer specifically states that foreign governments, \n     aliens, foreign corporations and U.S. corporations more than \n     20% owned by foreign governments, aliens or foreign \n     corporations may not directly hold a radio license.\n       Based on Section 310(b)(4) of the Act, the offer places no \n     new restrictions on indirect foreign ownership of a U.S. \n     corporation holding a radio license. Section 310(b)(4) allows \n     such indirect foreign ownership unless the Federal \n     Communications Commission finds that the public interest will \n     be served by the refusal to grant such a license. The U.S. \n     offer is to allow indirect foreign ownership, up to 100%, \n     under this provision.\n       The U.S. offer permits a foreign government indirectly to \n     own a radio license, unless the FCC finds that such ownership \n     is not in the public interest. Under the public interest \n     test, the FCC looks at many factors, such as financial and \n     technical ability of the applicant, international agreements, \n     national security concerns, foreign policy concerns, law \n     enforcement concerns and the effect of entry on competition \n     in the U.S. market. In the event of a successful conclusion \n     to these negotiations, the U.S. offer will allow the FCC to \n     continue to apply these public interest criteria, as long as \n     they do not distinguish among applicants on the basis of \n     nationality or reciprocity, consistent with the obligations \n     of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.\n       The U.S. offer maintains COMSAT's monopoly on access to \n     INTELSAT and Inmarsat, as required by the Communications \n     Satellite Act (47 U.S.C. 721).\n       The offer does not contain any restrictions on licenses to \n     land submarine cables based on the statutory authority of the \n     President (delegated to the Federal Communications Commission \n     in consultation with the Secretary of State) to issue landing \n     licenses. The statute permits withholding such licenses to \n     assist in obtaining landing rights\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\n     in other countries maintaining the rights or interests of the \n     United States and its citizens and protecting U.S. security \n     (47 U.S.C. 35). The United States will obtain landing rights \n     in other WTO member countries if the negotiations conclude \n     successfully and will retain its ability to protect its \n     national security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Written Response to Questions from Senator Bob Kerrey\n\n\n                           telecommunications\n\n       Last April when the parties agreed to postpone the deadline \n     for negotiations in the GBT, the U.S. offer did not reflect \n     the statutory language under sections 310 (a) and (b) that \n     the foreign ownership limitations under the law apply to \n     ``foreign governments or their representatives.'' Does USTR \n     intend to modify the U.S. offer to adhere to the statutory \n     language of sections 310 (a) and (b)? If not, why?\n       The U.S. offer will reflect our statutory obligations. \n     While at this time we do not believe its implementation will \n     require any legislative changes, we are continuing to consult \n     with Congress on this issue.\n       The offer allows market access to the local, long distance \n     and international services markets through any means of \n     network technology, either on a facilities-basis or through \n     resale of existing network capacity. The U.S. offer limits \n     direct foreign investment in companies holding common carrier \n     radio licenses, as is required by Section 310 (a) and (b) \n     (1), (2) and (3) of the Communications Act of 1934 (the \n     ``Act''). The offer specifically states that foreign \n     governments, aliens, foreign corporations and U.S. \n     corporations more than 20% owned by foreign governments, \n     aliens or foreign corporations may not directly hold a radio \n     license.\n       Based on Section 310(b)(4) of the Act, the offer places no \n     new restrictions on indirect foreign ownership of a U.S. \n     corporation holding a radio license. Section 310(b)(4) allows \n     such indirect foreign ownership unless the Federal \n     Communications Commission finds that the public interest will \n     be served by the refusal to grant such a license. The U.S. \n     offer is to allow indirect foreign ownership, up to 100%, \n     under this provision.\n       The U.S. offer permits a foreign government indirectly to \n     own a radio license, unless the FCC finds that such ownership \n     is not in the public interest.

In the event of a successful conclusion \n     to these negotiations, the U.S. offer will allow the FCC to \n     continue to apply these public interest criteria, as long as \n     they do not distinguish among applicants on the basis of \n     nationality or reciprocity, consistent with the obligations \n     of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.\n       The Administration is continuing to consult with Congress \n     and the FCC to determine whether it would be helpful to \n     modify the U.S. offer to include any additional parts of the \n     statute's text in the offer's text.\n       In the alternative, if USTR does modify its offer, please \n     cite what precedent gives USTR the authority to hold that the \n     exception under the public interest waiver of section \n     310(b)(4) vitiates the statutory limitation of control by a \n     ``foreign government or the representative thereof'' under \n     310(a), which has no waiver?\n       Section 310(a) prohibits direct ownership of a radio \n     license by a foreign government or its representative. \n     Similarly, Section 310(b)(1) prohibits direct ownership of \n     a radio license by an alien or its representative. Section \n     (b)(2) contains the same prohibition for foreign \n     corporations. Section 310(b)(3) prohibits direct ownership \n     of more than 20% of a U.S. corporation holding a radio \n     license by a foreign government, an alien or a foreign \n     corporation. All these prohibitions on direct ownership \n     are contained in the U.S. offer.\n       Section 310(b)(4) explicitly allows indirect ownership by \n     all three--a foreign government or its representative, an \n     alien or its representative or a foreign corporation, unless \n     the FCC determines that such ownership is not in the public \n     interest. This is also reflected in the U.S. offer. In \n     preparing the offer, the Administration has consulted closely \n     with Congress and FCC staff and is continuing to consult on \n     the question of implementing legislation and whether to \n     modify the offer.\n       If USTR successfully negotiates an agreement, would there \n     be any change or limitation on the FCC's use of the Effective \n     Competitive Opportunities test to examine the openness of a \n     foreign market, which it adopted pursuant to the public \n     interest waiver test of section 310(b)(4)?\n       If the GBT concludes successfully, the FCC will continue to \n     apply the public interest test to applicants under section \n     214 and to applicants for radio licenses under section 310. \n     The only change that would occur would be that the Executive \n     Branch would advise the FCC not to consider reciprocity as a \n     prong of the test on the basis that the U.S. would have \n     obtained substantial market access commitments from its major \n     trading partners and the vast majority of countries whose \n     carriers are likely to apply for radio licenses in the U.S.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the reason why I ask that is because there \nare many technical and legitimate questions that are raised by Senator \nLott, Senator Kerrey, and by Senator Hollings. The responses that \nAmbassador Barshefsky made, I think, are important to be in the Record. \nI will not take the time of the Senate to read those.\n  The amendment, I believe, is not only not good for America, but I \nbelieve that the amendment represents a different view of trade and how \nnations should treat each other in this world competitive marketplace. \nI believe that the American worker can compete with any worker in the \nworld. I believe that the American worker is the finest in the world. I \nwould rather have an American working to build a product than any other \nnationality, without any disrespect to any of them. With that \nfundamental belief that American workers can compete and do a better \njob, then I am in favor of reducing the barriers, which the agreement \nthat Charlene Barshefsky has negotiated will accomplish.\n  Telecommunications is a $600-billion-a-year industry. The World Trade \nOrganization's basic telecom agreement will double the size of the \nindustry over the next 10 years. There is not a single \ntelecommunications business in America that does not totally support \nthis agreement. The agreement will lead to the creation of countless \njobs in U.S. communications companies, in high tech equipment makers, \nand in a range of industries such as software, information services and \nelectronic publishing that benefit from telecom development.\n  This agreement is literally unprecedented. It covers over 90 percent \nof world telecommunications revenue and includes 69 countries, both \ndeveloped and developing. It ensures that U.S. companies can compete \nagainst and invest in all existing carriers. Before this agreement, \nonly 17 percent of the top 20 telecommunications markets were open to \nU.S. companies. Now they have access to nearly 100 percent of these \nmarkets.\n  The range of services and technologies covered by this agreement is \nbreathtaking--from submarine cables to satellites, from wide-band \nnetworks to cellular phones, from business internets to fixed wireless \nfor rural and underserved regions. The market access opportunities \ncover the entire spectrum of innovative communications technologies \npioneered by American industry and workers.\n  Most important, the agreement will save billions of dollars for \nAmerican consumers. The average cost of international phone calls will \ndrop by 80 percent, from approximately $1 a minute on average to 20 \ncents per minute over the next several years. The agreement, as I said \nearlier, was widely lauded by those in the telecommunications industry.\n  Mr. President, of equal concern is the impact this amendment would \nhave on the ability of the President to negotiate future trade \nagreements. The Hollings amendment could require congressional approval \nof every single trade agreement that might result in any change in \nregulations or administrative practice, no matter how slight the \nchange. The overwhelming majority of trade agreements that the \nPresident concludes can be--and traditionally have been--implemented \nunder statutes that the Congress has already put on the books. If the \nPresident tries to implement an agreement in a manner that is not \nprovided for under legislation, the courts can prohibit him from taking \nthose steps.\n\n  The amendment is harmful to our Nation's trade interests. The \napproval requirement imposed by the amendment would impose long delays \nand could create uncertainties for lucrative trade agreements that \nwould otherwise bring immediate benefits to American consumers, firms \nand workers. It is the American workers who would be hurt by this \namendment.\n  Under Senator Hollings' amendment, the President could not use the \npowers already granted him if he intends to make any change in \nregulatory or administrative practice, no matter how insignificant. \nThis amendment would require an act of Congress every time the \nPresident allocates a new cheese or sugar quota, adds a quota on a \ntextile or apparel product, or implements a tariff rate quota on \nagricultural products, such as those recently negotiated on imported \ngoods such as tobacco. The President has traditionally made these \nroutine changes\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nunder proclamation authority granted by the Congress.\n  Finally, Ambassador Barshefsky will also have a busy coming year. It \nis my hope that she will move quickly to send the Congress legislation \nto provide for a clean reauthorization of fast-track authority so \nnegotiations can begin immediately to expand the North American Free \nTrade Agreement to Chile. Pending successful expansion of NAFTA, \nnegotiations should continue on the development of a free trade area of \nthe Americas.\n  Substantial questions will also arise regarding extension of MFN \nstatus to China and the accession of China into the World Trade \nOrganization. I am confident that Ambassador Barshefsky is up to these \nchallenges.\n  Mr. President, the United States has historically been a world leader \nin opening markets and expanding trade. I believe leadership waned over \nthe first term of the Clinton administration. It is my hope, and, \nindeed, my prediction, that under the leadership of Charlene \nBarshefsky, the United States will again take its place as the world \nleader for open and fair trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Hollings amendment and support \nSenate Joint Resolution 5 so that Ambassador Barshefsky can be \nconfirmed and appointed to serve as our next U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Mr. President, I regret there is not time, but there will be \nopportunities in the future to debate these issues with my friend from \nSouth Carolina, who I have said on many occasions is not only \nenlightening but on occasion entertaining as well, which makes for \nspirited and involved debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time back to Senator Roth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nCharlene Barshefsky to be the next United States Trade Representative. \nIn representing a State with a long history of trade with Canada, I \nhave taken particular interest in President Clinton's nominee for USTR.\n  I have had serious concerns about this administration's lack of \naggressiveness in pursuing the concerns of Maine's farmers and \nbusinesses regarding unfair trade practices by neighboring Canada. \nCanada is Maine's No. 1 trading partner, and Mainers value this \nrelationship, but we want it to be a fair relationship. When evidence \nis found that trading practices are not fair, the United States needs \nto take strong and effective action.\n  To underscore my concern about this problem, I withheld my support \nfor Ambassador Barshefsky until I had an opportunity to meet with her \nto discuss several trade issues important to the people of my State. \nFarmers, fishermen, and others in natural resource industries have long \nbeen concerned about unfair trade practices by the Canadian Government.\n  Maine potato farmers, in particular, have labored under trade \npractices that have threatened the very survival of some farms. \nParticularly troubling are apparent subsidies from the Canadian \nGovernment that allow Canadian farmers to sell their products at \nartificially low prices, thus enabling Canadian farmers to dump large \nvolumes of potatoes into the American market. At the same time, there \nis concern that Canadians may be erecting trade barriers that make it \ndifficult for our farmers to sell their products in Canada.\n  We cannot continue to tolerate Canadian trading practices that \nadversely affect Maine potato farmers, who have seen more than their \nshare of hard times. However, I am encouraged by Ambassador \nBarshefsky's recent actions, which include asking the International \nTrade Commission to undertake an investigation to determine the nature \nand extent of Canadian potato subsidies. This is a step in the right \ndirection and a good sign that these issues will finally get the \nattention they deserve. But it is only a first step. It is critical \nthat the administration follow through and take action to assure a \nlevel playing field.\n  Another issue I raised with the Ambassador was the frustration of \nsome Maine shellfish companies with newly instituted inspection fees on \nshellfish products exported to Canada. Maine shellfish exporters have \nbeen concerned that the Canadians are unfairly targeting their products \nfor inspection in an attempt to make it more difficult for Maine \nshellfish to be shipped to Canada. On this issue I found the Ambassador \nto be very responsive. She has been helpful with gathering information, \nand I am pleased USTR officials have begun meetings with their Canadian \ncounterparts to review these onerous fees.\n  Finally, I also raised the issue, which the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina has talked about, and that is the issue of the U.S. \ntariffs on capacitors. As part of the Information Technology Agreement \nnegotiated in Singapore last year, the administration agreed to a \nEuropean proposal to eliminate the current 9 percent tariff on \ncapacitors entering the United States. Under the agreement, the tariff \nwould be eliminated in July of this year.\n  The elimination of this tariff could pose a serious hardship on \nseveral American companies, one of which is in my State of Maine. The \nAmbassador and I discussed this hardship, and I made the case that the \nindustry was unaware of even the potential that this tariff could be \neliminated. I asked what measures could be taken to provide some \nrelief.\n  I was impressed with the Ambassador's knowledge on this issue, and I \nwas very encouraged by a commitment she made to me to find middle \nground with the Europeans that would give American manufacturers of \ncapacitors more time to adjust to a tariff elimination.\n  Specifically, we talked about the possibility of having a phaseout of \nthe tariff, rather than the abrupt elimination in July.\n  In closing, I would like to address the issue of the need to waive a \nprovision passed last Congress as part of the lobbying disclosure act. \nThis provision prohibits the appointment of any person who has \nrepresented a foreign government in a trade dispute with the United \nStates from serving as USTR or deputy USTR. Like many of my colleagues, \nI was very concerned about the need to exempt someone from a law that \nis on the books and has been passed so recently. Since the foreign \ncountry involved is Canada, I was particularly concerned because of the \ncontentious trading relationship that my State has had over the years \nwith Canada on many important products. However, after addressing this \nissue with Ambassador Barshefsky, I learned that she was previously \nexempted from this provision in her capacity as deputy USTR. It, \ntherefore, does seem reasonable to me to allow this waiver to follow \nher into her new duties as USTR, and I agree with the Finance \nCommittee's unanimous recommendation to waive the law.\n  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with Ambassador \nBarshefsky and her staff to discuss these important issues. They are \ncritical issues to my constituents. I found her to be very \nknowledgeable and responsive. I am hopeful that her tenure as USTR will \nbring about renewed interest, commitment and, most of all, action on \ntrade issues confronting the people of Maine.\n  I appreciate the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee \nyielding me time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to express my extremely \nstrong, very enthusiastic support for the nomination of Charlene \nBarshefsky to be our U.S. Trade Representative. This is an important \nvote for America, for its future. I urge my colleagues to give her the \nunanimous vote of confidence that she has, in fact, already earned \nthrough her record of incredible fortitude, ability, and a long list of \ntrade accomplishments, even as acting USTR.\n  The President has put forward, frankly, a most unusual person--\nunusually skilled, highly qualified, for one of the most important jobs \nin the U.S. in Government, and that is being\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\nour Nation's lead trade negotiator and keeping up with all developments \nall over the world all the time. It is an incredible job.\n\n  She now should have the official title to proceed with the job \nawaiting her in trade negotiations and efforts that offer immense \nopportunities and extremely high stakes for our industries, for our \nworkers, and for our economy.\n  In just the last year alone, on a whole host of other things, as our \nacting trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky has concluded a \nrenewal of our critical semiconductor agreement with the Japanese; seen \nthrough an agreement to remove tariffs around the world on information \ntechnology products; and won agreement of a massive telecommunications \npact that promises more than $1 trillion in worldwide economic benefits \nthrough the year 2010, all of this as acting trade representative.\n  Beyond that, I would point to one of Charlene Barshefsky's strongest \nqualifications: Her masterful grasp of complicated issues surrounding \nChina's integration into the global economy.\n  We have all read, hopefully, all of the writing that has come out \nabout China since the death of Deng Xiaoping. I believe that China is \nthe single biggest long-term macroeconomic challenge facing the United \nStates. We cannot duck it. We must handle it intelligently.\n  China is the world's largest country, in terms of population, and its \neconomy will surpass ours sometime in the not too distant future. If \nits accession to the World Trade Organization, in particular, is not \nhandled properly, the ramifications for the United States could be \nserious and long lasting. This takes the hand of a master. That hand \nbelongs to Charlene Barshefsky.\n  We are also very fortunate to count on Ambassador Barshefsky as we \nface the challenge of our trade relationship with Japan. This winter I \ntook, as I always do, a delegation of West Virginia business people to \nJapan and Taiwan. One of the messages we heard, in a troubling fashion \nvery frequently, was that Japan was looking much more toward turning to \nthe World Trade Organization for the settlement of previously \nnegotiated bilateral trade agreements, turning, therefore, away from \nthe bilateral process which has traditionally characterized our \nnegotiating relationship with Japan.\n  I don't blame them if they are trying to avoid a U.S. negotiating \nteam headed by somebody as forceful and capable as Charlene Barshefsky. \nMy response is that overall United States-Japan relations depend on our \nability to deal with one another, on a bilateral basis, on our trading \nissues, and then have occasional recourse to the WTO, but none of this \ncould we do any better than by having Ambassador Barshefsky at the helm \nrepresenting our country, our people, the people from my State.\n  It is impossible for me to explain how strongly I feel about the \nnomination and the confirmation of that nomination hopefully on this \nday.\n  To turn to the amendment we are now debating, the Senator from South \nCarolina is one of the most forceful advocates in the Congress for \nAmerican interests in the global economy. I learned a great deal about \nissues coming from discussions with him about the globalization of the \neconomy. He talks about it a great deal with great erudition, and I \nadmire and share his intense commitment to American workers and \nindustries.\n  The Senator from South Carolina also has a very long-time interest in \nthe issue of foreign ownership of American telecommunications services, \nwhich, in fact, happens to be the root cause of the Senator's \namendment, although this dispute is not about broadcast rights but \nabout telecommunications services--not about broadcast rights but about \ntelecommunications services--like cellular or international calling.\n  Clearly, there is a difference of opinion about what U.S. law allows \nin the area of ownership of telecommunications services. This is a \ndifference of opinion, not only between the Senator from South Carolina \nand USTR, but between the Senator and something called the Federal \nCommunications Commission, which he declines to recognize on this \nmatter.\n  The Senator, as the former chairman of the Commerce Committee and the \nranking member now, also disagrees with the current chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator John McCain, who has just spoken, as well as the \nchairman of the House Commerce Committee, Mr. Bliley, over this law.\n  As I understand it, the U.S. offer in the telecommunications \nagreement tracks U.S. law, meaning this dispute is really over the \ninterpretation of current U.S. law by the FCC, which the ranking member \nof the Commerce Committee does not like, not the trade agreement \nreached by USTR.\n  I thoroughly agree with the Senator from South Carolina that Congress \nmust assert its constitutional right and responsibility to oversee \ninternational trade and international commerce, and I am in full \nagreement Congress should act when a trade agreement makes commitments \nthat differ from current law. But that is already the law of the land. \nThat exists now under the current law.\n  If a trade agreement reached by the executive branch requires a \nchange in law, Congress must act to implement the agreement. When the \nPresident agreed to the Uruguay round, Congress had to pass \nimplementing legislation for us to meet its terms, which we did. \nHowever, to cite another example, when the President agreed to the \nshipbuilding agreement at the OECD, Congress did not agree to change \nAmerican law to implement that particular agreement.\n  As somebody who, like the former chairman and ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee, opposed NAFTA as I did, I am certainly not saying \nthat we should signal that this or any other administration has a blank \ncheck to make trade agreements that are not in America's interest. But \nthat is not what the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina is \nabout. This amendment would create a whole new role for Congress that \ncould have a chilling effect--would have a chilling effect--on trade \nnegotiations that, in fact, seek to serve and strengthen U.S. \ninterests, which he talks about.\n  My problem with the Senator's amendment is that it would do much more \nto reaffirm Congress' role in responding to trade agreements that \nrequire a change in our laws. By using the language in the amendment \nwhich says that any trade law which would--and then the keywords are--\n``in effect amend or repeal statutory law,'' I am afraid it would \nentangle Congress in a constant, complicated, unnecessary process of \nacting on trade agreements that do not embody actual changes in U.S. \nlaw and don't require congressional involvement to obtain the benefits \nof those agreements.\n  I respect the fact that the Senator questions a part of the new \ntelecommunications trade agreement negotiated in Geneva. Disagreements \nbetween members of the legislative branch and executive branch are very \ncommon, even on an intraparty basis. But we have existing procedures to \nresolve disputes like that when they come up. A challenge can be taken \nup with the courts or something called legislation can be offered to \nchange the particular practice in dispute.\n  The problem with the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina is \nthat instead of proposing a specific change of law, which addresses his \ninterpretation of the law affecting ownership of telecommunications \nservices, he is proposing a new, generic, far-reaching role for \nCongress that could affect nearly all future trade agreements.\n  For example, USTR recently concluded an agreement which would \neliminate tariffs that were on some widely sought after anti-AIDS \ndrugs. Under current law, this could be put into effect--under current \nlaw--in 60 days under Presidential proclamation authority. However, if \nthe Hollings amendment were to pass, such routine and noncontroversial \nchanges would require a new act of Congress that could mean waiting \nmonths or maybe even watching the benefits of this trade agreement \nnever materialize.\n  The amendment by the Senator from South Carolina calls for a major \nshift in U.S. trade policy. It has not been discussed or considered in \nthe Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over all reciprocal trade \nagreements.\n  Finally, even if all these questions could be answered, the House has \nalready said that they will ``blue slip'' the waiver resolution if it \ncontains this amendment, because it goes against\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\nthe constitutional provision that all measures which affect revenues \nmust originate in the House of Representatives. So this amendment on \nthe waiver resolution would doom the underlying nomination, and \nCharlene Bar- \nshefsky is too good a nominee to see that happen.\n  With respect for my colleague from South Carolina, I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote against his amendment. This is not the way, not the \ntime, nor the policy to use in resolving the Senator's dispute over a \nspecific provision of a specific trade agreement. That disagreement \nshould be pursued through other avenues that all of us use on a very \nregular basis. In this case, the amendment would establish an entirely \nnew process, a new law, a new role for Congress regarding all trade \nagreements. It is a role that is unnecessary and could prevent our \ntrade negotiators from doing the kinds of work that we charge them to \ndo in representing our best interests.\n  Rarely, if ever, have I seen an international agreement that has \nvirtually no opponents in either the business community or from \nAmerican workers. Usually, people point to winners and losers in \ninternational trade agreements. Sometimes people are afraid they could \nlose their jobs, or they feel that their business could be \ndisadvantaged relative to their competitors. But on this Telecom \nagreement, notwithstanding the objections of the Senator from South \nCarolina and a couple of others, I've heard barely a peep.\n  This international telecommunications agreement truly breaks new \nground. For the first time ever, an international trade agreement \neffectively guarantees competition. The United States put forward \nregulatory guidelines modeled on our own telecommunications law, and 65 \ncountries agreed to adopt most, if not all, those procompetitive \nprinciples. That is extraordinary.\n  This agreement between 69 countries will open nearly 95 percent of \nthe worldwide telecommunications services market to competition. A \nmarket which will exceed $600 billion in gross revenues this year \nalone. Mr. President, I'd point out that in April of last year, \nCharlene Barshefsky walked away from the talks when only 40 countries \nhad made offers, representing only 60 percent of global revenues.\n  Included in this agreement are local, long-distance, and \ninternational calling services; submarine cables; satellite-based \nservices; wide-band networks; cellular phones; business intranets; and \nfixed wireless services for rural and underserved regions. What this \nagreement did not cover are broadcast services.\n  It is believed that competition by telecom service providers is \nexpected to lead more than $1 trillion in economic benefits for \nconsumers around the world through 2010. While U.S. consumers have \nalready reaped much of the benefit of deregulation and increased \ncompetition, the FCC has pointed to billions of dollars of savings from \nthis deal for American consumers due to the eventual lowering of costs \nfor international calling by 80 percent--from more than $1 per minute \nto less than 20 cents--the actual cost of placing such a call.\n  I'll admit that I am disappointed that some countries, such as Japan, \nKorea, and Canada, didn't offer to open up their markets quite as much \nas the United States did, but reaching this agreement doesn't in any \nway prevent us from further negotiations with them in this area.\n  I'd also point out two things. First, even though these countries, \nand some others, maintained limits on purchasing existing providers, in \nmost cases, American firms can still go in to those same countries and \ncompete on their own--and the regulatory principles will guarantee that \nthey are not blocked from connecting to existing telecommunications \nnetworks.\n  Second, if it is Japan we are talking about, the idea that anyone \nplans to purchase more than 20 percent of NTT any time soon, is \nridiculous. NTT is the world's largest company, worth well over $100 \nbillion--I'm told that 20 percent would cost about $23 billion. Right \nnow, 3 percent of NTT is owned by foreigners, and I haven't heard that \nanyone plans to buy much more than that. What American firms are \ntalking about is the chance to start or invest in new common carriers \nin Japan, such as Japan Telecom, which is connected to the Japanese \nRailroad, and which anyone can invest in with no limitations. I'll \nadmit that I am concerned with the 20-percent limitation on KDD, which \nis a much smaller company than NTT--about the size of one of our Baby \nBells, but I'm hopeful we can work this out in future negotiations.\n  To conclude, today we have finally reached the moment to extend the \ntitle of United States Trade Representative to somebody who I think is \nmagnificently qualified to take that job. Superb qualifications, \nsuperbly tested, and now prepared to advance America's interests even \nfurther. What we are going through today threatens to block her, which \nhurts her in China, which hurts her in Japan, which hurts her all over \nthe world, and therefore through hurting her, our interests.\n  So I urge the unanimous vote that she deserves, that she be made \nAmbassador, the granting of the Dole waiver that is required, and the \ndefeat of the amendment that does not belong here and has consequences \nthat could truly harm, not help, American interests. I yield the floor \nand thank the distinguish Finance chairman.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I strongly support the adoption of the \namendment introduced by the senior Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nHollings]. On the face of it, it is a straightforward, simple \nproposition that attempts to preserve the integrity of the laws that we \npass, and that are the subject of discussion and/or negotiation between \nthe United States and other nations. It says that if our Executive \nbranch negotiators reach an agreement which amends or repeals U.S. law, \nthat agreement may not be implemented until the agreement is approved \nby the Congress. Who could dispute such an obviously valid proposition?\n  The case at hand, the negotiation of a new telecommunications \nservices agreement, apparently effects changes in U.S. law dealing with \naccess to the U.S. market in relation to the access of American \ncompanies into foreign markets. This is a matter which was very \ncontroversial in connection with the consideration of the landmark \nTelecommunications Act of 1996. In working with the Commerce committee \non this legislation, I was involved in developing certain changes to \nsection 310(b) of the underlying statute dealing with foreign \nownership. The matter was so controversial that the conferees on that \nlegislation were unable to reach agreement, and changes to the foreign \nownership provisions were dropped from the final conference agreement.\n  It is all the more important that our negotiations, in the light of \nthe controversial nature of this matter, take care not to effect what \namounts to a change in the law by virtue of negotiating a provision of \nan international agreement without taking the role of the Congress into \naccount. The law and an agreement should not be put into conflict on \nsuch a matter, and Senator Hollings is right to insist that no such \nnegotiated change should be implemented until the Congress has agreed \nby amending the law which governs the situation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support the joint resolution before us \nwaiving certain provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 relating to the \nnomination of Ambassador Barshefsky to the position of United States \nTrade Representative.\n  Let us make no mistake as to the quality of Ambassador Barshefsky's \nservice. We are not simply endorsing her as an exception to the act. \nRather, she could not be more deserving of confirmation. Let's examine \nher record.\n  Her service has been marked by substantive accomplishments on an \nunprecedented scale. Over 200 trade agreements have been enacted, and \nshe has been in the middle of the dispute process for the most \ndifficult of all--the Chinese anti-piracy agreement--and more than 20 \nseparate agreements with the Japanese in such areas as auto parts, \ntelecommunications, government procurement, semiconductors, and medical \nequipment and technology. Many of her accomplishments have directly \nbenefited my State of Utah which, despite its small size, is one of the \nNation's leading exporters of technology and software.\n  Like many other members of the Senate Finance Committee, I have been \ninundated by letters from hundreds of Barshefsky supporters. This\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\noutpouring of support underscores my own impression, as I expressed at \nthe recent Finance Committee hearing, that she is a most qualified \nnominee for U.S. Trade Representative.\n  But let me draw attention to one particular comment regarding her \nsuccess in the Chinese trade negotiations. I refer to a statement from \nthe Recording Industry Association of America, a sector that has been \nespecially hard hit by Chinese intellectual property piracy. In his \nrecent letter to me, RIAA chairman and CEO, Jay Berman, reported, ``I \npersonally witnessed her negotiations with China in June, 1995, that \nled to the immediate closing of 15 pirate CD [compact disc] plants.''\n  She has been repeatedly credited with breakthroughs in other sectors \nas well.\n  As my good friend from Delaware said only moments earlier, she has \nvastly expanded market access for American business--in Asia, Latin \nAmerica, and Europe. More importantly, her work will be seen as an \nadvent to still another American century, a century that will be marked \nby rising prosperity everywhere.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nDelaware.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request which has \nbeen cleared with the minority. I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe allotted times for debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in \nrelation to the Hollings amendment No. 19: Senator Hollings 9 minutes, \nSenator Conrad 5 minutes, Senator Daschle 10 minutes, Senator Burns 6 \nminutes, Senator Roth 5 minutes; and immediately following that vote \nthe joint resolution be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage of Senate Joint Resolution 5; further, if the \nresolution passes, the Senate then proceed to executive session and \nimmediately vote on the confirmation for the nomination of Charlene \nBarshefsky. I further ask unanimous consent that prior to the second \nand third vote there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to briefly address two questions: \nNo. 1, the question of a waiver for Ambassador Barshefsky; and, No. 2, \nthe approval of Ambassador Barshefsky as our trade representative.\n  Mr. President, I represent the State of North Dakota. We are right \nnext to Canada. The question of a waiver for Ambassador Barshefsky \nrelates to the question of her previous representation of Canada on \ntrade issues, and that requires a waiver if she is to become our trade \nrepresentative.\n  Mr. President, anyone who has worked with Ambassador Barshefsky \nunderstands her full commitment and dedication to the trade interests \nof the United States.\n  My State has been involved in a longstanding dispute with Canada with \nrespect to unfairly traded Canadian grain coming into this country at \nbelow their cost and having a devastating effect on the farmers of my \nState, not only the producers in North Dakota but farmers in Montana, \nfarmers in South Dakota, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska. Charlene \nBarshefsky has stood with us shoulder to shoulder to get a fair result.\n  Mr. President, this issue first came up when she was approved as the \nDeputy USTR 4 years ago. She has done a superb job in her position at \nthe trade representative's office. I think anybody who has followed her \ncareer and watched the job she did in negotiating to open up Pacific \nrim countries to our trade, the job that she has done fighting for U.S. \ninterests in trade disputes with Canada, that she represented for a \nbrief time on limited issues when she was in the private sector, would \nunderstand there is no reason--none--to deny a waiver to allow Charlene \nBarshefsky to become our trade representative.\n  Mr. President, Charlene Barshefsky is superb. I have dealt with many \ntrade representatives. Rarely does one find someone of her background, \nher intelligence, her talent and her commitment. Those are qualities \nthat we want working for the United States in these very difficult \ntrade negotiations. And she has shown her mettle over and over and \nover. I urge my colleagues to vote for the waiver and to vote for \nCharlene Barshefsky to be our next trade representative. I thank the \nChair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from Delaware.\n  I rise today with some concerns about the new trade representative, \nCharlene Barshefsky. But I also rise to support her nomination. She has \nproven herself to be a tough negotiator as the acting trade \nrepresentative. She recently played a major role in the opening of \nforeign markets in telecommunications, an agreement which we hope will \ndecrease the costs of international calls and likely to have similar \nimpact on domestic rates as well as U.S. companies competing on a \nworldwide basis.\n  But on the other hand, Ms. Barshefsky's bidding on the \nadministration's behalf of NAFTA to expand into some South American \ncountries has me somewhat concerned.\n  There is nobody in this body who fights harder for his people than \nthe Senator from South Carolina. And I think I know why, because I \nvisited that State one time, and he walks among those people who have \nlost their jobs in textile mills and understands those people's pain.\n  We are now suffering that kind of a pain because of the border wars \nwith Canada in the State of Montana. Whenever you start talking about \nfast tracking authority to expand NAFTA, and you understand the effect \nNAFTA has had on us in the beef industry and the grain industry--and \nthat is what I am; I am not anything else fancy--then I say we have to \napproach that very cautiously, because I am not going to lower the \nliving standards of my farmers for the sake of so-called free trade \nunless it is fair trade. If left unchecked, it will also contribute to \nthe devastation of other sectors in our Nation's economy as well, if we \ndo not just look at some of these things.\n\n  We live in a free economy, we live in a global economy. I admit while \nCanadian livestock producers reap the benefits of new profit markets, \nMontana producers are hit with a flood of imports at the same time that \nthe cattle market is already at the bottom of its scale. So we cannot \nafford any more of this. To stem that, we will have to do it through \nenabling legislation.\n  I say that the pending amendment is one that has to be discussed \namong the FCC, keeping in mind that the final rule of last year's \ntelecom bill has not been written yet. So, I have some very strong \nconcerns about the expansion that this President and this \nadministration want to take. We see loaded trucks with cattle going \nthrough Montana, and we say, are they stopping here? And they say, no, \nthey are going south. We lost the Mexican market, plus we lost some of \nour own markets through the last little deal. We got snookered a little \nbit talking about NAFTA.\n  I oppose any kind of fast track as far as the expansion of NAFTA is \nconcerned because I think it has to be done the right way. I voted \nagainst it the first time, understanding where the Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from Montana were coming from, and I will \nprobably, unless we have a mechanism we can work out these troubles \nthat we have, playing on a level playing field, I am saying right now \nthat if you want to ship cattle into the United States, I want you to \nhave the same rules and regulations, the same environmental laws as we \nhave to comply with in this country. That is only fair.\n  If Ms. Barshefsky is a tough negotiator, I will stand beside her, but \ndo not use agriculture as a pawn and then sell it out like we have in \ntimes past. One has to remember that agriculture is still the largest \ncontributor to the GDP in this country. I will support her in the \nupcoming confirmation vote and hope that she works with us in Congress \nwhenever negotiations of expansion get under way.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me acknowledge the one kind word we \ngot this afternoon in this debate. The Senator from Montana is on \ntarget. He is right. We go home and we see the jobs not only created at \nthe BMW's but we see the jobs that have been lost, and that retraining \nout of Washington will not suffice. I do appreciate it very much, and I \nagree with him. He brings it right to the fore, the straw man they have \nput up.\n  They talk fast track, they talk regulations, they talk the \ndifferences between broadcast and common carrier under the statute, as \nthere being a distinction, and, of course, the most serious one they \nbring is the character of the lady herself, which I never would suggest \nanything otherwise, and is of the finest character as an individual, \nMs. Barshefsky. That is not a debate.\n  She happens to say that you do not need any approval of Congress. \nWell, then, I ask, why did the previous man of character, and just as \ndazzling as Ms. Barshefsky, Mickey Kantor--and I inserted in the Record \nhis request that we amend the law so he could agree on foreign \nownership. Now she is saying there is not any agreement, and there are \nall kinds of straw men.\n  The junior Senator from West Virginia was saying there is a \ndistinction here. I am talking about broadcast rights and television \nservices. I put these two sessions in there, and it can be read, ``No \nbroadcast or common carrier license shall be granted to the foreign \ngovernment'' and on and on and on. It is crystal clear that there is no \ndistinction. That is why none other than the Chairman of the FCC asked \nthat it be changed.\n  So we really come to the floor after 2 to 3 years of asking for a \nchange, not effecting the change, the 95 Members of the U.S. Senate \nvoting and saying, all right, we agree that there be no change, and now \nthey are all coming and saying, ``Well, this is going to have a \nchilling effect,'' when the special trade representatives change the \nlaw and give away the store, the 100 percent ownership.\n\n  Heavens above, we cannot make it more clear to everyone. We read \nsection 8, article 1, of the Constitution: ``The Congress shall have \npower'' and it goes on ``to lay and collect taxes'' and No. 2, to \nborrow money, and No. 3 ``to regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' \nIt does not say regulate foreign nations on a fast track. It does not \nsay regulate commerce regulation laws. It says regulate commerce. These \nfellows could not have voted for the Constitution if they had been a \nforefather back in the founding days.\n  I never said anything about regulations. The Senator from Rhode \nIsland came in and brought that up, and they keep on bringing up these \nstraw men and talking about a complicated process. You could not make \nan agreement or anything else of that kind, having a chilling effect. \nThe language is just as simple and constitutionally clear as you can \npossibly make it: ``No international trade agreement,'' which is what \nwe have in the telecommunications agreement ``which would in effect \nremand or repeal statutory law''--I put the two statutes in that have \nbeen amended or repealed; not regulations or anything else or fast \ntrack and all the other things--``of the United States may be \nimplemented by or in the United States until the agreement is approved \nby Congress.'' It says that is approved by Congress under its \nconstitutional duty.\n  Now, there is absolutely a terrible misunderstanding about this so-\ncalled free trade. It is just like the crowd running around acting like \nthey have revenues--the doubletalk on the budget. Everybody wants to \ncut the revenues, cut the revenues, taxes are too burdensome, cut the \nrevenues, but ``I want to balance the budget and I have a plan to \nbalance it.'' How can they pay the bill by cutting the revenues? How \ncan we possibly have free trade when we restrict the trade?\n  We say to that U.S. corporation, ``Before you can do business, you \nhave to have a minimum wage. You have to comply with the Social \nSecurity requirements for pension and retirement rights. You have to \nhave Medicare requirements by the Finance Committee. You have to have \nclean air. You have to have clean water, plant closing notice, parental \nleave,'' and on down the list of all these requirements--OSHA, safety \nworkplace, safe machinery. All these requirements that Congress put on \nand then say, ``I have free trade.'' Well, you can go to Mexico and you \ndo not have to have any of that. That is why we immediately ipso facto \nwith that NAFTA agreement went from a plus balance of trade to a \nwhooping negative, which they promised otherwise, losing all the jobs \nand wrecking Mexico and the United States.\n  Some question was raised about the Pacific rim. We have a deficit in \nthe balance of trade with Indonesia of $4.1 billion. We have a deficit \nin the balance of trade with Japan of $47.5 billion. We have a deficit \nin the balance of trade with China of $39.4 billion. A deficit in the \nbalance of trade with Malaysia, $9.4 billion. Taiwan is $11.4 billion. \nA deficit in the Philippines of $1.7 billion. A deficit in Thailand of \n$4.9 billion. A deficit in Singapore of $3.2 billion. And we can cite \nthe European ones. I had them here on a list a minute ago. We know \nthere is a deficit in Canada, and, yet, they talk about everything so \nmagnificent. Let's rush over to China and get another agreement--quick. \nHeavens above, don't they understand that we are losing, we are not \nwinning? This crowd around here act like they are accomplishing \nsomething.\n\n  Well, we have the Federal Republic of Germany, minus $15.4 billion; \nVenezuela, minus $8.1 billion; Italy, deficit and a balance, minus $9.4 \nbillion. We can go right on down the list. It is all in all in all--I \nsaid the sum total of merchandise trade in deficit. That is, we bought \nmanufactured goods. There is the great productive United States--not \nthe workers. We know the workers are the most productive. That is why \nwe got 100 German industries. That is why we have 50 Japanese \nindustries. That is why we have, companies Michelin--I called on them \n35 years ago, and now we got 11,600 jobs from France in my State. We \nare not talking about productivity. We are talking about the \nproductivity of this Congress, this Government up here. We are the ones \nthat are not producing. We are the ones that are not producing, chasing \nour tail around the mulberry bush, with independent prosecutors and \ninvestigations.\n  We know the problem is too much money in the game. Everyone has to \nskirt around this, twist this, turn that, and along goes the Supreme \nCourt saying, soft money, you can do this and that and the next thing. \nSo there we are. We are not producing here. We have $187 billion more \nthan we bought in merchandise than what we sold. They keep on talking \nabout exports, exports. So we are going out of business and nobody \nwants to talk about it. They bring up all these straw men about the \ncomplicated process, the chilling effect, new role for Congress--there \nis no new role. It is the only role that we have, a constitutional \nrole. I think that we ought to just retain the balance of the time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I retain the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we have had a great deal of debate on the \nHollings amendment. So, in closing, I will be brief, but I want to make \ntwo simple points. First, no trade agreement--I emphasize ``no trade \nagreement''--has the stature to supersede U.S. statutory law. If a \ntrade agreement seeks to accomplish a result not in conformity with \nU.S. statutory law, the Congress must enact legislation to achieve that \nresult.\n  Second, the amendment, whatever its merits, will cause Senate Joint \nResolution 5 to be blue-slipped in the House if the amendment is agreed \nto. The only result that the amendment can accomplish is to derail the \nBarshefsky nomination. Make no mistake, I have a letter from Bill \nArcher, chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. He says that, \n``Specifically, I understand that the Senate maybe asked to consider \nparticular provisions, such as one suggested by Senator Hollings, which \nwould change the manner in which Congress considers trade agreements\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\nand legislation having a direct affect on customs revenue. Although I \nstrongly support Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination, I would have no \nchoice but to insist on the House constitutional prerogative and to \nseek the return to the Senate of any legislation including such a \nprovision.''\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Hollings amendment. I \nyield whatever time I have to my distinguished colleague from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the chairman and I have a letter we have \njust received from Charles F.C. Ruff, counsel to the President, and \nafter the upcoming vote, we will vote on the resolution itself. He \nstates:\n\n       Because the President strongly desires to appoint \n     Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky as USTR, and in order to \n     ensure the absolute propriety, without question, of her \n     appointment, President Clinton will not appoint Ambassador \n     Barshefsky until S.J. Res. 5 has been enacted.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1997.\n     Hon. William Roth, Chairman,\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Finance Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan: I write to urge \n     you to pass S.J. Res. 5 as quickly as possible without \n     amendment. As you know, Section 21(b) of the Lobbying \n     Disclosure Act of 1995 prohibits the President from \n     appointing anyone to serve as United States Trade \n     Representative (USTR) or Deputy USTR if that person had in \n     the past directly represented, aided or advised a foreign \n     government in a trade dispute or trade negotiation with the \n     United States. Because the President strongly desires to \n     appoint Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky as USTR and in order \n     to ensure the absolute propriety, without question, of her \n     appointment, President Clinton will not appoint Ambassador \n     Barshefsky until S.J. Res. 5 has been enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles F.C. Ruff,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to listen to \nthe debate this afternoon, and I appreciate and commend the \nparticipation of the distinguished Senator from Arizona and our ranking \nmember on the Finance Committee, and certainly the chair of the Finance \nCommittee, the Senator from Delaware, for their leadership on this \nissue.\n  I think it has been shown this afternoon that, as a representative of \nthe United States in trade negotiations around the world, Ambassador \nBarshefsky has proven herself to be a tough and effective advocate of \nAmerican interests. Her solid record of achievement has done much to \nlevel the playing field for American producers. She understands the \nchallenges facing the United States in the world trading system. Her \nnegotiating style combines careful preparation, great stamina, \ndetermination, and a willingness to exercise the leverage provided by \nU.S. trade laws when circumstances warrant it.\n  For example, as a key architect of the United States-Japan Framework \nAgreements, she used the leverage provided by tariffs on Japanese \nluxury car imports to gain better market access in Japan for American \ncar manufacturers without penalizing consumers back home. Thanks, in \npart, to her efforts, exports of foreign vehicles to Japan have \nincreased by 30 percent last year, and the number of American franchise \ndealer outlets reached near 20. American companies are making \nsubstantial investments in Japan and forging important new partnerships \nwith Japanese business.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky has also demonstrated she appreciates the \ncrucial role agriculture trade plays in the American economy. Last \nyear, the trade surplus in agricultural products reached $28.5 billion, \nthe largest of any industry. Still, as she has acknowledged to me, we \ncould do far better. Annual surveys compiled by the Office of U.S. \nTrade Representative indicate that roughly half of the foreign trade \nbarriers facing U.S. products are in the agricultural sector.\n  Persistent market access barriers and other unfair trade practices \ncontinue to be a source of concern, and although agricultural exports, \nas a whole, have risen, problems remain in many areas, including beef \nand cattle prices.\n  In my view, liberalizing world trade is part of the answer to \nproblems in the agricultural economy. However, our negotiators must be \nprepared not only to seek new global agreements but also to ensure that \nindividual trading partners comply with their market access commitments \nfrom previous ones.\n  Thankfully, in Charlene Barshefsky, we have found someone who \nunderstands this challenge. In recent years, she has worked to increase \nbeef exports to Korea, increase the availability of fresh produce in \nJapan and China, and thwart European trade barriers that could have \ndevastated American soybean and corn exports. There has been a 30 \npercent increase in the value of agricultural exports since 1994, and I \nam confident that we will continue to build on this progress under her \nleadership.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky has been widely praised and supported by \nindustry leader in many sectors of the economy. Alfred J. Stein, \nchairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association and VLSI Technology \nInc., has stated that ``the President could not have found a more \ntalented and dedicated envoy to represent the U.S. trade interest.'' \nJohn E. Pepper, Chairman of Procter and Gamble Company, has said that \n``Ambassador Barshefshy . . . represents U.S. trade interests in an \naggressive yet diplomatic manner. The nation is fortunate to have [her] \nas our U.S. Trade Representative.'' Gary Hufbauer, a scholar at the \nInstitute for International Economics, has described her as ``easily \nthe most qualified, most knowledgeable person on trade law ever \nnominated to this post.''\n  In my opinion, Ambassador Barshefsky's experience, knowledge and \ntenacity make her the best person for the job. She has my full support, \nand I urge my colleagues to support her nomination and the proposed \nwaiver from the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  The waiver is necessary because she performed a limited amount of \nwork for Canadian interests while she was an international trade lawyer \nin private practice. Effective January 1, 1996, the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct bars anyone who previously represented a foreign government from \nbeing nominated for a senior USTR post. The Ambassador was exempted \nfrom this requirement during her service as Deputy USTR, and it is \nappropriate to ``grandfather'' her tenure as U.S. Trade Representative \nas well.\n  The distinguished ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings, is proposing an amendment to the waiver that I must \nreluctantly oppose. I have sympathy for the issue he raises and might \nwell support his efforts under different circumstances. However, the \nleadership of the body has expressed its firm opposition to Senator \nHollings' legislation, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman \nArcher has indicated that he will seek to have any bill including the \nlanguage ``blue-slipped'', or sent back to the Senate, on the grounds \nthat it would constitute a revenue measure that must originate in the \nHouse.\n  For these reasons, adoption by the Senate of the Hollings amendment \nwould almost certainly delay Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination for an \nunacceptably long time. The Senate has a responsibility to approve the \nPresident's Cabinet nominees as expeditiously as possible. Ambassador \nBarshefsky is a particularly fine choice, and, in my view, the Senate \nshould not take any action that would delay her confirmation further. \nAccordingly, I must ask my colleagues to vote no on the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Again, Mr. President, let me urge all Senators who support the \nnomination\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\nto support the joint resolution waiver to give Ambassador Barshefsky \nthe kind of bipartisan support that her record, that her ability, that \nher intellect, and that her potential demand.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Hollings amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before the Senate votes on Senate Joint \nResolution 5, I want to reiterate the importance of passing this \nwaiver. The waiver is essential.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. Senators \nwill take their conversations to the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. The waiver is essential to ensure that the President is \nable to appoint this capable nominee to the post of USTR.\n  I want to make just two points. First, when the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct was passed, Ambassador Barshefsky was serving as Deputy USTR. As \nsuch, the act expressly did not apply to her in that position.\n  Second, the Ambassador never lobbied the U.S. Government on behalf of \na foreign government or foreign political party.\n  Under these circumstances, I strongly feel that passage of the waiver \nis appropriate to assure the appointment of Ambassador Barshefsky as \nUSTR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York will suspend. The \nSenate will please come to order.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just to supplement the chairman's \nremarks, I would like to point out that he and I have received a letter \ntoday from Charles F.C. Ruff, Counsel to the President, stating:\n\n       Because the President strongly desires to appoint Charlene \n     Barshefsky as USTR and in order to ensure the absolute \n     propriety, without question, of her appointment, President \n     Clinton will not appoint Ambassador Barshefsky until S.J. \n     Res. 5 has been enacted.\n\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I rise in support of Charlene Barshefsky's \nnomination as the United States Trade Representative.\n  I have scrutinized Ms. Barshefsky's nomination very carefully. During \nthe time of her confirmation hearing before the Finance Committee, I \nsubmitted a list of 10 specific questions concerning her past work on \nbehalf of the Canadian Government, her commitment to aggressively \ndefending and advocating United States trade interests before all \nforeign parties, and her commitment to raising issues of interest to \nMaine before the Canadian Government, particularly with regard to \nMaine's long-running problems on potato trade. I ask unanimous consent \nthat these questions and her responses be printed in the Record after \nmy statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. SNOWE. My reason for investigating this nomination was simple: to \nmake certain that this nominee could be counted on to defend United \nStates. interests in the trade arena, and to ensure that her past legal \nwork for Canadian entities would not in any way influence the exercise \nof her duties as United States Trade Representative.\n  Ms. Barshefsky's written responses to my questions, and on her \nresponses to the questions of other senators and the Finance Committee, \nindicate that her nomination does not pose any such problems.\n  As has been widely reported, Ms. Barshefsky worked, while an attorney \nfor a Washington, DC, law firm, for several Canadian entities. But as \nher responses to the Senate detail, this work amounted to a tiny \nfraction of the total over the course of her 18-year career as a trade \nattorney in private practice. In fact, Ms. Barshefsky has certified to \nme and to the Finance Committee that her work for all Canadian \nGovernment entities represents less than 1 percent of the total hours \nthat she spent working while in private practice. Furthermore, Ms. \nBarshefsky states in her responses to me that she never lobbied the \nU.S. Government on behalf of any foreign government or political party.\n  I also questioned Ms. Barshefsky closely regarding her commitment to \ndefend American interests in the arena of international trade. Ms. \nBarshefsky's responses are unequivocal. She states that she will \nforcefully defend and advocate American business interests in all \ninternational trade disputes, negotiations, and discussions involving \nthe United States. She states that she will aggressively pursue all \neffective remedies to unfair trade practices committed by other \ncountries against American businesses. And she states that she will \npursue the strict adherence to, and vigorous enforcement of, all United \nStates trade laws.\n  Ms. Barshefsky also specifically says that, if confirmed, she will \nensure that the USTR's office raises the issues of concern to the U.S. \npotato industry during our bilateral meetings with Canada.\n  In addition to her words on paper, we also have Ms. \nBarshefsky's track record. She served as Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative from 1993 to 1996, and as Acting U.S. Trade \nRepresentative for the past year. Her experience in these positions has \ngiven us a body of work to evaluate, and a record upon which to judge \nwhether Ms. Barshefsky means what she says. And from what I have seen \nin her performance of her duties in these positions, through my own \ndealings with her, and from what other Senators have said, I believe \nthat her deeds will be consistent with her words after she is \nconfirmed.\n\n  I have spoken with and sought the assistance of Ms. Barshefsky on \nseveral occasions over the past year. In each instance, I have found \nMs. Barshefsky to be responsive and cooperative. She displayed a \ngenuine interest in the problems facing my constituents, and offered a \nnumber of options through which the administration could be of \nassistance.\n  I think it is also instructive to look at the Canadian softwood \nlumber issue. Although Ms. Barshefsky had, while in private practice, \nrepresented Canadian interests on the countervailing duty case that the \nUnited States filed against Canada in 1991, she later served as the \nsecond-highest ranking trade negotiator in the United States Government \nand participated in the negotiation of a bilateral agreement approved \nin 1996 that curtails subsidized Canadian softwood imports into the \nUnited States. That agreement has restored a measure of fairness to the \nlumber trade between the United States and Canada. And we would not \nhave successfully concluded the agreement without the strong support of \nour senior trade officials like Ms. Barshefsky because the Canadians \nwere under no legal obligations to sign an agreement with us. The \nUnited States had lost a succession of binational dispute resolution \npanel decisions on the issue up to that point, and had no way to \nlegally require Canada to negotiate.\n  Mr. President, I was concerned when I first learned about some of Ms. \nBarshefsky's past work, but upon investigating this matter and \nquestioning Ms. Barshefsky, I accept her assurances that this work will \nnot influence her decisions and actions as the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. And I am confident that she will defend and advocate \nAmerican interests in the international trade arena, consistent with \nthe policies of the Clinton administration. I cannot find anything in \nthe record that compels opposition to Ms. Barshefsky's nomination, and \nI believe that she has earned the support of the Senate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            Written Response to Questions from Senator Snowe\n\n\n                       Canada/Journal of Commerce\n\n       The Journal of Commerce reported on November 15, 1996, \n     that, as a lawyer in private practice, you were retained by \n     the Canadian federal government and the Government of Quebec \n     on issues involving trade with the U.S. in lumber and pork. \n     What was the specific nature of the services that you \n     provided on these governments on these issues, and at what \n     times did you provide these services?\n       Following is the verbatim response provided to the Senate \n     Finance Committee Questionnaire Statement of Information for \n     Potential Nominees, Question C.6 on Potential Conflicts of \n     Interest:\n       ``Before becoming the Deputy United States Trade \n     Representative in May of 1993, I worked for 18 years as a \n     lawyer with the Washington law form if Steptoe & Johnson. The \n     vast majority of my work during those 18 years was in the \n     international trade area, particularly in the area of trade \n     litigation, including antidumping, countervailing duty, \n     escape clause, and similar on-the-record litigations arising \n     under the U.S. trade laws. My representation of foreign \n     governments or foreign political parties was limited to \n     Canada, viz, the Government of Quebec and the Embassy of \n     Canada, which were disclosed at the time that I was confirmed \n     in 1993 to serve as Deputy United States Trade \n     Representative. At no time during the 18 years that I \n     practiced law did I ever lobby on behalf of any foreign \n     government or foreign political party.''\n       With respect to the Government of Quebec, my work involved \n     providing guidance and legal drafting assistance to the \n     Steptoe & Johnson lawyers responsible for the client in \n     connection with on-the-record litigation in two trade cases: \n     1) the administrative reviews of countervailing duty orders \n     on Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork from Canada (hereinafter \n     Canadian Pork) and the appeal thereof to an FTA panel; and 2) \n     the petition filed under Section 302 of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     by the G. Heilman Brewing Company (later jointed by Stroh's \n     Brewing Company) concerning Canadian beer practices \n     (hereinafter Canadian Beer). I did not meet with any U.S. \n     government officials or appear on behalf of Quebec in any \n     proceeding, nor did my name appear on any of the briefs or \n     submissions in any of the proceedings. With respect to \n     Canadian Beer, neither I nor the firm were involved in the \n     GATT Panel proceeding.\n       My work related to the Government of Quebec began in \n     October of 1989 and ended in March 1991, almost six years \n     ago. My time on the Canadian Pork and Canadian Beer matters \n     totaled approximately 240 hours, which represented just over \n     0.50 percent of my work while in private practice.\n       With respect to the Embassy of Canada, my former law firm \n     and I were retained by the Embassy to monitor developments in \n     the United States concerning a broad range of substantive \n     areas, including international trade. The contract with the \n     Embassy of Canada for this monitoring work stated that\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\n     Steptoe & Johnson was ``to provide legal advice to the \n     Canadian Embassy, in Washington, D.C., on political, \n     legislative and regulatory developments in the United States \n     relating to trade and economic issues.'' The Embassy \n     explicitly prohibited lobbying on its behalf and I did not \n     lobby.\n       We routinely reviewed developments in the international \n     trade area, which included administrative, legislative and \n     judicial actions on issues of relevance to the Embassy, \n     ranging from changes in U.S. trade law to investment \n     restrictions in various countries. I coordinated the work of \n     other lawyers and paralegals in the firm as well, and routed \n     to them pertinent materials for their use.\n       Pursuant to the monitoring contract, the Embassy requested \n     that I also provide advice with respect to two specific trade \n     matters. First, I directed the preparation of memoranda on \n     the options and legal consequences if Canada were to \n     terminate its settlement agreement with the United States \n     involving softwood lumber, as well as the implications of \n     judicial, administrative and legislative developments in U.S. \n     trade law on possible future trade litigation in the event \n     that Canada decided to terminate the settlement agreement. I \n     did not recommend to the Embassy what course of action Canada \n     should take with respect to the lumber matter. At the time \n     that I directed this work, the settlement agreement was in \n     force; there was no pending trade litigation and there were \n     no negotiations on softwood lumber between the United States \n     and Canada. In fact, my work on the settlement agreement \n     ended several months before the countervailing duty \n     litigation on Softwood Lumber from Canada began.2\n       Second, I reviewed certain draft composite texts prepared \n     by the Chairmen of the GATT working groups on antidumping and \n     countervailing duty law for circulation to all of the \n     approximately 117 countries that participated in the Uruguay \n     Round MTN. The Chairmen's drafts that I commented on were \n     prepared by the GATT Chairmen as an attempt to reflect the \n     consensus of GATT members. They were not U.S. texts. My \n     review of these draft texts involved comparative analyses of \n     the Chairmen's drafts with past GATT provisions, GATT \n     practice, prior Chairmen's drafts, and U.S. law, as \n     appropriate, and an evaluation of the potential impact of \n     these and alternative texts on U.S. law.\n       My time spent on the MOU settlement agreement and MTN \n     matters totaled approximately 145 hours, or slightly more \n     than 0.30 percent of my work while in private practice. My \n     work on these two matters was done intermittently from May \n     1990 to December 1991, and ended more than five years ago.\n       What other Canadian governments, business, industry groups, \n     or organizations have you represented on matters related to \n     trade with the United States? What was the specific nature of \n     the services that you provided to these entities, and at what \n     times did you provide these services?\n       As indicated in response to question 1, I represented the \n     Canadian Forest Industries Council (``CFIC'') in the \n     countervailing duty litigation on Softwood Lumber from \n     Canada. CFIC is an unincorporated association comprised of \n     trade associations in the Canadian forest products sector, \n     private Canadian softwood lumber producers, Canadian \n     exporters of softwood lumber, and U.S. importers of softwood \n     lumber. The services provided included those required in \n     an on-the-record trade litigation, such as brief writing, \n     assistance with preparation of responses to Department of \n     Commerce questionnaires, and oral advocacy. I was retained \n     in October, 1991, and my involvement ended when I left my \n     former law firm, Steptoe & Johnson, in April, 1993.\n       Were you ever retained by a Canadian entity to work on a \n     particular issue at a time when that entity was engaged in a \n     formal dispute resolution proceeding with the United States \n     related to that issue under trade agreements signed by the \n     United States and Canada? If so, what was the specific nature \n     of the work that you performed for that entity on that issue?\n       See question 1 which describes all my work relating to \n     foreign governments. As indicated above, I was retained by \n     CFIC in the countervailing duty litigation on Softwood Lumber \n     from Canada.\n       Were you ever retained by a Canadian entity at a time when \n     that entity was involved, either directly as a government, or \n     indirectly as an interest lobbying a Canadian Federal or \n     provincial government, in negotiations on bilateral and \n     multilateral trade agreements to which the United States was \n     a party? If so, can you please describe the specific nature \n     of that work?\n       With respect to being retained directly by the Canadian \n     government, see response to question 1. I was never retained \n     by any client to lobby Canadian Federal or provincial \n     governments.\n       Were you ever retained by the Canadian federal government, \n     a provincial government, or any other Canadian entity to \n     perform work related to the Uruguay Round negotiations of the \n     GATT, particularly as these negotiations related to the \n     United States? If so, can you please describe the specific \n     nature of this work?\n       See response to question 1.\n       (a) Do you think your past work in the private sector on \n     behalf of Canadian entities will in any way hamper your \n     ability to perform your duties as the U.S. Trade \n     Representative as those duties relate to Canada? (b) Do you \n     feel compelled to recuse yourself on any matters that come \n     before the U.S. Trade Representative's office on issues \n     related to Canada?\n       (a). No.\n       (b) No. However, I have recused myself from any particular \n     matter involving specific parties in which I served as \n     counsel on that matter while in private practice, unless I \n     have been authorized to participate in that matter under the \n     provisions of 5 C.F.R. 2635, Subpart E.\n       Can you assure me and other senators that your past work on \n     behalf of any Canadian entity will not have any bearing on \n     the performance of your duties as the U.S. Trade \n     Representative?\n       Yes, unequivocally.\n       American businesses need a forceful, aggressive, and \n     indefatigable advocate in the position of U.S. Trade \n     Representative, particularly when dealing with intransigent \n     and unscrupulous governments like Canada's. (a) Do you intend \n     to forcefully defend and advocate American business interests \n     in all international trade disputes, negotiations, and \n     discussions involving the United States? (b) Will you \n     aggressively pursue all effective remedies to unfair trade \n     practices committed by other countries against American \n     businesses? (c) Will you, to the extent authorized in the \n     position of Trade Representative, pursue the strict adherence \n     to and vigorous enforcement of all U.S. trade laws?\n       (a) Yes\n       (b) Yes\n       (c) Yes\n       Do you intend to make full use of Sections 201, 202, and \n     203 of the Trade Act to assist American industries that are \n     suffering from injurious import surges?\n       Sections 201, 202 and 203 are the so-called escape clause \n     or safeguards sections of our trade laws. These provisions \n     are administered primarily by the International Trade \n     Commission (ITC), not the USTR. The law permits an entity \n     that is representative of an industry, including a trade \n     association, firm, union or group of workers to petition the \n     ITC for relief. Alternatively, the President, USTR or House \n     Committee on Ways and Means or Senate Committee on Finance \n     may request the ITC to conduct an investigation. the ITC's \n     investigation is to ``determine whether an article is being \n     imported into the United States in such increased quantities \n     as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat \n     thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like \n     or directly competitive with the imported article.'' Once the \n     ITC makes an affirmative injury determination, the ITC then \n     recommends to the President certain actions to address the \n     injury to the domestic industry. USTR is also involved in \n     providing a recommendation to the President as to what course \n     of action would best assist an industry in adjusting to a \n     serge in imports. If confirmed as USTR, I would intend to \n     review all recommendations by the ITC to grant relief to an \n     injured industry in order to ensure that USTR provides the \n     President with the most considered recommendation possible \n     regarding remedy actions that might be taken.\n       Based on our past discussions, I know that you are aware of \n     the long-running trade problems that the potato industry in \n     Maine and other states has had with Canada. If confirmed, do \n     you intend to make the satisfactory resolution of potato-\n     related trade disputes with Canada a high-ranking and \n     continuous priority of the United States? Will you take steps \n     to ensure that this issue is prominently featured on the \n     agenda of any major bilateral trade discussions with Canada?\n       As you know, in close consultation with the Maine potato \n     industry, I sent a formal request to Marcia Miller, Chairman \n     of the ITC, requesting a formal 332 investigation on \n     conditions of competition in the fresh and processed potato \n     industry. This investigation will focus on the factors \n     affecting trade between the United States and Canada. I \n     expect to receive this report by July 15. The report will \n     provide information on Canadian prices and costs of \n     production which may be useful to the Maine potato industry \n     and the U.S. government.\n       I have become very familiar with this issue and will work \n     closely with you over the months ahead on finding ways to \n     address the concerns of this important industry. You can be \n     assured that we will continue to raise the issues of concern \n     for the Maine potato industry at our bilateral meetings with \n     Canada.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support the \nnomination of Charlene Barshefsky to become the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative.\n  Mr. President, one of the things I find most interesting about \nCharlene Barshefsky is that in many ways she is a study in \ncontradiction. On the one hand, she is a tough-as-nails trade \nnegotiator who has developed a reputation for bringing the most \nexperienced and determined of opponents to their knees. On the other \nhand, she is a loving and supportive wife and mother who recognizes the \nimportance of family and, despite having very important \nresponsibilities, makes time for her children.\n  Mrs. Barshefsky's tough negotiating strategy has earned her the \nnickname ``Stonewall'' from her colleagues, and ``Dragon Lady'' from \nthe Japanese.\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\n This reputation, however, was not gained at the expense of attention \nto her children. It has been reported that she has been known to help \nher children with homework while on the telephone to Hong Kong and \nother far off places.\n  Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to witness Mrs. Barshefsky's \nabilities first hand in the 1980's. At that time, a number of my \ncolleagues and I fought to stop Chile from dumping Government \nsubsidized copper on the world copper market potentially putting \nthousands of people in New Mexico and throughout the United States out \nof work. Although U.S. copper producers ran the most competitive mining \noperations in the world, Americans were loosing jobs because the \nChilean Government was subsidizing its industry with Government \nrevenues and development funds from the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund. Charlene Barshefsky was one of the primary \npeople who worked to rectify this situation.\n  Mrs. Barshefsky has successfully worked on numerous other trade \nrelated issues since then. She became the Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative in May, 1993, and Acting Trade Representative in April, \n1996. She marshaled support for the Global Information Technology \nAgreement and successfully concluded negotiations on the Basic \nTelecommunications Services Agreement to expand telecommunications \ntrade and facilitate the building of a global information \ninfrastructure. She played a vital role in solving trade disputes with \nJapan and China. She fought to open markets for the U.S. agricultural \nindustry, and is leading efforts to expand trade with Europe. In fact, \nits hard to find an area of trade where Mrs. Barshefsky has not been \ninvolved.\n  Charlene Barshefsky's tenacity and skill as a trade negotiator is \nwell know the world over. Her demonstrated ability to do an exceptional \njob, her reputation for being a supreme tactician and tough negotiator, \nand her ability to do all of this and still make time for her family \nmakes her an ideal choice for this post. For these reasons and others, \nit gives me great pleasure to support Charlene Barshefsky's nomination.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to voice my strong support \nfor the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. \nAmbassador Barshefsky has done an outstanding job as acting USTR since \nher appointment last April.\n  I believe Ambassador Barshefsky is one of the best nominations \nPresident Clinton has made and am honored to have the opportunity to \nspeak on her behalf. Charlene Barshefsky is an aggressive and \narticulate advocate of U.S. trade interests and has been very \nsuccessful in defending U.S. business and agriculture throughout the \nworld. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is vital to opening \nup trade markets to U.S. goods, and Charlene Barshefsky has proven \nherself to be very effective at doing just that.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky understands that U.S. agriculture and industry \ncan compete very effectively in the international market, but only if \ntrade barriers are torn down. She has been relentless in her efforts to \nexpand market access for U.S. exports and to promote U.S. trade \ninterests abroad.\n  I am particularly impressed with Ambassador Barshefsky's work on \nintellectual property rights. My State is home to the Nation's largest \nsoftware producer and to many smaller software and video game \ncompanies. These businesses have faced devastating problems with the \ncounterfeiting of their products overseas. Ambassador Barshefsky has \nbeen a leader in the fight to end such violations of U.S. intellectual \nproperty rights. Last year, she negotiated a tough deal with China. By \nthreatening sanctions against $2 billion in Chinese exports to the \nUnited States, she was successful in forcing Beijing to crackdown on \nsoftware counterfeiters. While intellectual property theft still \noccurs, Ambassador Barshefsky has made great strides in defending \nUnited States interests in Asia.\n  She has also worked as a tough negotiator on Pacific Northwest wheat \nexports to China. As many of my colleagues know, China has, for the \npast 25 years, imposed arbitrary restrictions on the importation of \nwheat from the United States. The Chinese Government claims that \nWashington State wheat is infected by TCK Smut disease and therefore \nforbids its import into China for fear that the disease will spread to \nChinese wheat. Unfortunately, their claim has no scientific basis. \nAmbassador Barshefsky has worked diligently to eliminate trade \nrestrictions based on unsound science. Although her efforts have not \nyet been successful, she has been the strongest voice Washington state \nwheat growers have had in the administration for several years.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Charlene \nBarshefsky, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm \nher as U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, once more, I strongly endorse the nomination \nof Ambassador Barshefsky. I urge my colleagues to vote for her. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, as we approach St. Patrick's Day, the \nthoughts of many turn to Ireland. More than 44 million Americans are of \nIrish ancestry. It is often erroneously assumed that the vast majority \nof Irish-Americans are Catholics. But at least half of the 44 million \nare Protestants, many of which are descendants of the ancestors of the \npresent-day Protestant communities in Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n  In the 1990 census, nearly 6 million Irish-Americans defined \nthemselves as ``Scotch-Irish''--an American term which did not begin to \nbe used widely until the mid-19th century. Most of Protestant \nimmigration from Ireland occurred in the 18th and early 19th centuries, \nwhereas the majority of the large number of Irish who arrived in the \nUnited States beginning in the mid-19th century at the time of the \npotato famine in Ireland were Catholic.\n  The Scotch-Irish in America are descendants of the approximately \n200,000 Scottish Presbyterians who settled in Ireland in the early 17th \ncentury. The modern Protestant majority in Northern Ireland are \ndescendants of that Ulster Plantation.\n  In the late 1600's, religious persecution of Scottish Presbyterians \nby England led some to leave Ulster and seek religious freedom in the \nAmerican colonies. Many of these immigrants settled in the Chesapeake \nBay area. One such immigrant, Francis Makemie, is the father of \nAmerican Presbyterianism.\n  The largest numbers of Scotch-Irish immigrants, about 250,000, left \nfor the American colonies in the 18th century in the decades leading up \nto the Revolutionary War. They left Ulster less for religious than \neconomic reasons, because of the decline in the linen industry, failed \nharvests, and high rents for tenant farmers. Many of these immigrants \nwere so poor that they made their way to the colonies only by becoming \nindentured servants. The destination of the earliest of these \nimmigrants was New England although many of these subsequently moved \ninland to the frontier. In ``The Scotch-Irish and Ulster,'' Eric \nMontgomery writes of these immigrants:\n\n       Ideally suited for the new life by reason of their \n     experience as pioneers in Ulster, their qualities of \n     character and their Ulster-Scottish background, they made a \n     unique contribution to the land of their adoption. They \n     became the frontiersmen of colonial America, clearing the \n     forests to make their farms and, as one would expect, they \n     had the defects as well as the qualities of pioneers. \n     President Theodore Roosevelt described them as ``a grim, \n     stern people, strong and simple, powerful for good and \n     evil, swayed by gusts of stormy passion, the love of \n     freedom rooted in their very hearts' core.''\n  The Scotch-Irish were staunch Calvinists and their religious \ndifferences with New England's Congregationalists led, after 1725, to a \nshift in their immigration from New England to Pennsylvania. These \nimmigrants first settled near Philadelphia, but soon spread west \nthroughout the entire State. Others went south to the Carolinas and \nGeorgia, always extending the frontiers.\n  The Log College was established to train Presbyterian ministers near \nPhiladelphia in 1726 or 1727 by Scotch-Irish minister Rev. William \nTennent, Sr. It developed close ties with the College of New Jersey, \nwhich was founded in 1746, and later became Princeton University.\n  The impact of Scotch-Irish settlers on America was significant. \nArthur Dobbs, a member of the Irish Parliament and a landowner from \nCounty Antrim, became Governor of North Carolina in 1753. Five signed \nthe Declaration of Independence--Thomas McKean, Edward Rutledge, James \nSmith, George Taylor and Matthew Thornton. John Dunlap of Strabane \nprinted the Declaration and also founded the Pennsylvania Packet, the \nfirst daily newspaper in America.\n  Large numbers of Scotch-Irish immigrants joined the fight for \nAmerican independence. Irish volunteers performed so courageously in \nthe Revolutionary Army that Lord Mountjoy told the British Parliament, \n``We have lost America through the Irish.''\n  Charles Thomson came to Pennsylvania as an indentured servant, and \nwent on to serve as the Secretary of the Continental Congress from 1774 \nto 1789.\n  Scotch-Irishman Henry Knox was one of four members of President \nGeorge Washington's first Cabinet. John Rutledge was the first Governor \nof South Carolina. Thomas McKean was the first Governor of \nPennsylvania, and William Livingstone was the first Governor of New \nJersey.\n\n  The Scotch-Irish were strong supporters of the Jeffersonians in the \nearly years of American independence. The Harvard Encyclopedia notes:\n\n       The Scotch-Irish turned out in strength to vote for Thomas \n     Jefferson in the election of 1800, and their influence, along \n     with that of other immigrant groups, may well have been \n     decisive in New York and thus the nation at large.\n\n  Twelve Americans of Scotch-Irish ancestry became President of the \nUnited States. The fathers of Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan and \nChester Alan Arthur were each born in Northern Ireland. And James Polk, \nAndrew Johnson, Ulysses Grant, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, \nWilliam McKinley, Woodrow Wilson, and Richard Nixon were all of Scotch-\nIrish ancestry. President Clinton's family tree has several Irish \nbranches, and undoubtedly contains both Scotch-Irish and Catholic \nroots.\n  The Scotch-Irish parents of John C. Calhoun emigrated to Pennsylvania \nand then moved to South Carolina. Born in 1782, he was elected to the \nHouse of Representatives from South Carolina at the age of 29, and went \non to become Senator, Secretary of War, Secretary of State, and Vice \nPresident. As chairman of the Senate House Foreign Relations Committee \nin 1812, he introduced the declaration of war against Britain. His \nportrait is on the wall of the reception room adjacent to the Senate \nChamber today, as one of the five greatest Senators in our history.\n  Many other famous Americans are of Scotch-Irish descent. Sam Houston \nserved as Governor of Tennessee before moving to Texas and leading the \nfight for Texas' independence from Mexico. Before Texas joined the \nUnion, he served as the first President of the Republic of Texas and, \nafter, as Governor. He was a staunch defender of the Union, but his \nefforts to keep Texas from seceding prior to the Civil War failed, and \nhe was removed as Governor when he refused to take Texas out of the \nUnion after the vote to secede.\n  Stonewall Jackson was a descendent of Scotch-Irish immigrants from \nCounty Armagh. Davy Crockett was Scotch-Irish. Cyrus McCormick, \ninventor of the mechanical reaper, was given the French Legion of \nHonour by Napoleon, who described McCormick as ``having done more for \nthe cause of agriculture than any other living man.'' A successful \nbusinessman, active Democrat, and Presbyterian, he founded the \nMcCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago.\n\n  The Mellon family emigrated to Pennsylvania from County Tyrone in \n1818. Thomas Mellon, a young boy at the time, became a successful \nlawyer, banker, and businessman in Pittsburgh. He founded what became \nthe\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\nMellon Bank, and was instrumental in the growth and development of \nPittsburgh. His son, Andrew Mellon, served as Secretary of the Treasury \nfor Presidents Harding and Coolidge. He helped found Gulf Oil, Alcoa, \nand the Union Steel Co., which later merged into the U.S. Steel Corp. \nHe assembled one of the world's greatest art collections, established \nthe National Gallery of Art, and donated his collection to the gallery \nwhere vast numbers of Americans enjoy it every year. Andrew's son, \nPaul, and other members of the Mellon family have carried on the \nfamily's business success and extraordinary philanthropy.\n  The Scotch-Irish have also been well-represented in the arts. Edgar \nAllen Poe, Stephen Foster, Horace Greeley, founder of the New York \nTribune, and Harold Ross, founder of the New Yorker, were all Scotch-\nIrish.\n  The majority of Irish-American Protestants today define themselves as \n``Irish,'' not ``Scotch-Irish.'' By and large, the term ``Scotch-\nIrish'' fell into disuse over the years as discrimination against \nCatholics in this country declined.\n  Immigrants to America from all parts of Ireland, whether Catholic or \nProtestant, have made brilliant contributions to the success of \nAmerica. Those of us who are committed to a just and peaceful \nresolution of the conflict in Northern Ireland know that peace will \nonly be achieved there when both traditions are treated equally and \nfairly, and when mutual respect and a good-faith political process \nreplace bombs and bullets as the means for settling disputes.\n  Ireland's extraordinary contributions to America reflect Ireland's \ntwo great traditions--Protestant and Catholic--and America honors them \nboth on St. Patrick's Day 1997.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I will deliver the first in a series \nof statements on the theme of NATO enlargement. In the next 4 months \nleading up to the Madrid Summit in July, I will examine the rationale \nfor NATO's admitting new members, which countries appear to be leading \ncandidates for admittance to the alliance, how NATO and Russia can \ndefine a new relationship, the responsibilities of our European allies \nin the process, and how to share the costs of enlargement fairly.\n  Mr. President, as many of our colleagues are aware, the distinguished \nforeign Minister of the Republic of Hungary, Laszlo Kovacs is in \nWashington this week for a series of meetings. I would like to take the \noccasion of the foreign Minister's visit to note the progress that \nHungary has made toward meeting the criteria for membership in the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and to thank his government for the \nassistance it has provided to our forces involved in the Bosnia \nmission.\n  Mr. President, the foreign Ministers from the 16 NATO members will \nmeet in Madrid in early July to decide which Central European \ndemocracies should be invited to begin accession negotiations with the \nAlliance.\n  In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, Congress named \nHungary--along with Poland, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic--as a \nleading candidate for NATO membership and, therefore, eligible for \ntransition assistance. I plan to travel to the region over the Easter \nrecess to assess the progress that these countries have made toward \nmeeting the criteria set out in the NATO enlargement study. Today, \nhowever, I can already point to several things that indicate to me that \nHungary is well on its way toward assuming the responsibilities of NATO \nmembership.\n  The first is the successful effort by Hungary to conclude bilateral \ntreaties with its neighbors, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Students \nof Central European history know how truly important these treaties are \nfor the security of the region. Many had predicted that the end of the \ncold war would bring with it a resurrection of Hungary's territorial \nclaims against its neighbors, and they predicted an era of instability \nthat would make us wish the cold war had never ended.\n  Events, and the concerted effort of the Hungarian Government, have \nproven the pessimists wrong. First, Hungary has succeeded in \nestablishing a stable, open democracy that has allowed the Hungarian \npeople to enjoy the fruits of political and economic freedom.\n  Equally important, Hungary has recognized that its security and \nprosperity are dependent upon a resolution of the territorial claims \nthat poisoned relations with its neighbors in the decades after World \nWar I.\n  For those of my colleagues who have asked: ``Why should NATO admit \nnew members?'' I ask you to look closely at the Hungarian example. One \nof the criteria for new members of NATO is that they must resolve all \nterritorial disputes with their neighbors.\n  Just as common membership in NATO has allowed France and Germany to \novercome the enmity and territorial disputes that had resulted in three \nwars in 80 years, so too has the prospect of NATO membership led to \nreconciliation in Central Europe. The Hungarian Government is to be \ncommended for its forward-thinking policies that recognize that \ncooperation is the key to stability in Europe in the 21st century. I \nparticularly want to recognize the political courage of Hungarian Prime \nMinister Horn in disregarding the criticism of ultranationalists in his \ncountry and signing these treaties.\n  In exchange for renouncing territorial claims, Hungary has secured \npledges that its neighbors will respect the rights of the large ethnic \nHungarian communities in those countries. As the European Union also \nbegins to expand its membership eastward, I hope that national \nboundaries in Central and Eastern Europe will matter less and less, and \nthe free exchange of people, products, and ideas will help ensure peace \nand prosperity for all.\n  Romania and Slovakia are home to the largest Hungarian communities \noutside Hungary, and ideally we would like to see them join NATO as \nwell. I am pleased by the recent progress made by Romania, which \nthrough free and fair elections has peacefully changed its government. \nThe new ruling coalition, incidentally, includes a party representing \nthe interests of the Hungarian minority.\n  Slovakia, unfortunately, for the past several years has seemed to be \nheading in the wrong direction. I must question the commitment of Prime \nMinister Vladimir Meciar to democracy, particularly to minority rights \nand a free press. The treaty with Hungary is a step forward, but if \nSlovakia is to join the community of Western democracies, it must show \nthat it will not water down its commitments to respect the cultural and \nlinguistic rights of its ethnic Hungarian citizens.\n\n  The other theme I want to focus on today is the cooperation that \nHungary has extended to us and our allies in connection with the \nongoing peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. An essential part of that \nmission has been a staging base in Taszar, Hungary, which the Hungarian \nGovernment has leased to the U.S. military. It is from that base that \nwe have deployed our forces to Bosnia to prevent a return to Europe's \nworst fighting since World War II. As former Secretary of Defense Perry \nhas stated, without the cooperation of Hungary, the IFOR and SFOR \nmissions would have been immeasurably more difficult.\n  At Taszar 1,200 Hungarian troops are working with 3,200 Americans. \nThis cooperation has allowed Hungarian officers and enlisted men to \nunderstand how a NATO military functions and what Hungary must do to \nallow its forces to operate jointly with those of the NATO countries. \nBy all accounts, the work at Taszar has been a rousing success, both in \nsupporting the IFOR and SFOR missions and in helping the Hungarian \nmilitary.\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\n  The threat to the security of Europe today no longer comes from an \neasily identifiable Soviet adversary; it comes from the prospect of \ninstability. It comes from the prospect of future Bosnias. NATO must \nadapt to this new reality and prepare itself to undertake missions \noutside the territory of its member states.\n  Our experience at Taszar shows that Hungarian membership in NATO will \nhelp us and our allies to carry out these new missions and will enable \nus together to help maintain the security and stability of the \ncontinent as a whole.\n  Moreover, the Taszar experience shows how NATO enlargement can help \nreduce costs that we and our allies would face without enlargement. \nEnlargement will allow us and our allies access to bases like Taszar in \ntimes of crisis, and it will allow the central European democracies to \nrely on others for part of their security, thereby reducing the cost to \nthem of restructuring their militaries.\n  Let me reiterate that the prospective new members of NATO must agree \nto make the financial sacrifice necessary to modernize their \nmilitaries. We will, of course, do our fair share to help. In that \nregard, the 15 percent of the direct enlargement costs that last \nmonth's Pentagon cost study envisages the United States will assume \nseems an equitable proposal. But the prospective new members and the \nnon-U.S. current NATO members must shoulder the largest share of the \ncosts.\n  My meeting with Mr. Kovacs today to discuss Hungary's progress toward \nNATO membership was extremely fruitful, and, as I mentioned earlier, I \nwill visit Budapest later this month to help me ascertain for myself if \nHungary is ready to join the Atlantic alliance.\n  I commend the Hungarian people on the progress they have made in \ncreating a successful democracy and free-market economy over the past 8 \nyears and for their determination to ensure their security through \ncooperation with their neighbors and other democracies.\n  I hope that Hungary will continue in this direction and will meet the \ncriteria for membership in NATO so that in July it will be in the group \nof prospective members invited to begin accession negotiations with the \nalliance.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama for giving me the opportunity to \ntake the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nAlabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1975-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1976-S1978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MR. ANTHONY LAKE\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to give to the Senate the \nstatus on the confirmation process in the Intelligence Committee of \nAnthony Lake, who has been nominated by President Clinton to be the \nnext Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  As I have said on many occasions, I intend to treat the confirmation \nof Anthony Lake, President Clinton's nominee to be Director of Central \nIntelligence in a serious, thorough and fair manner.\n  The Central Intelligence Agency and the intelligence community \ndeserve a strong and independent leader to carry them into the 21st \ncentury. I believe that everyone in the Senate recognizes that.\n  This leader must be able to guide the fine men and women that serve \nour country and keep watch on our adversaries, sometimes under the most \ntrying and dangerous of circumstances.\n  And, this leader must be deserving of the confidence of the \nPresident, the Congress, and the American people.\n  This is a controversial nomination, we have known this from the \nbeginning. And it is essential that we address all of the issues \nassociated with Mr. Lake's fitness to lead the intelligence community, \nand his ability to make the transition from White House insider to \napolitical provider of intelligence information.\n  I'd like to comment on the six areas in which the committee has \nconsiderable work to complete as we proceed with Mr. Lake's \nconfirmation hearings which will begin on Tuesday. We want to get the \nprocess moving, but it is important that we have the fullest \ncooperation from the White House.\n  These six areas are, among others: First, investigation of the role \nthe National Security Council, under Mr. Lake's leadership, had in \nquestionable DNC fund-raising practices, as well as any knowledge Mr. \nLake may have had, if any.\n  Second, Mr. Lake's use and interpretation of intelligence provided to \nhim as National Security Advisor, including how he helped translate \nthis intelligence into administration policy.\n  Third, the Justice Department's settlement of Mr. Lake's ethics \nviolations and the potential irregularities in this settlement.\n  Fourth, the way in which Mr. Lake handled the ``no instructions'' \npolicy toward Iranian arms shipments through Croatia to Bosnia.\n  Fifth, review of Mr. Lake's FBI background investigation.\n  Sixth, review of written answers Mr. Lake provided to the committee's \nquestions for the record, many of which require further explanation \nthan was provided.\n\n\n                   NSC Interactions with DNC Contacts\n\n  We will continue our investigation into the role of the NSC staff, \nunder Mr. Lake's direction, in the expanding controversy over foreign \ncampaign contributions.\n  At issue is the extent to which Mr. Lake knew of the ties the White \nHouse was building with questionable fund-raisers and foreign \ncontributors and what effect this might have had on administration \nforeign policy.\n  It is apparent that his staff had knowledge of the involvement, and \nalthough on many occasions advised against it for either political or \nforeign policy reasons, never seemed to raise the flag of illegality.\n  And if Mr. Lake was fully informed, did he participate in decisions \nto continue this involvement or were any admonitions he might have \ngiven regarding the nature of these meetings completely ignored?\n  This question goes to the heart of Mr. Lake's ability to be an \neffective Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  The committee must consider this issue in great detail and determine \nif Mr. Lake could become embroiled in a potential independent counsel \ninvestigation into these matters, as we read in the press.\n  The intelligence community deserves a leader that will not be \ndistracted by such an investigation, if it occurs.\n  The information supplied by Mr. Lake could be the tip of an iceberg, \nand more inquiry is required. For example, Mr. Lake does not appear to \nshed any light as to why his staff met with Pauline Kanchanalak, the \nThai businesswoman and lobbyist whose contributions to the DNC were \neventually returned.\n  New allegations about Ms. Kanchanalak appear in the press every day \nall over America, and perhaps the world.\n  For example, last Tuesday, the New York Times reported, and I quote: \n``One Justice Department official said subpoenas also were served on \nthe United States-Thai Business Council, a trade-promotion group formed \nin part by Pauline Kanchanalak, a lobbyist who helped raise $250,000 in \npolitical donations that have since been returned by the Democratic \nNational Committee.''\n  The article goes on to say: ``Government officials said the Justice \nDepartment two weeks ago subpoenaed records from the Export-Import Bank \nconcerning Ms. Kanchanalak's efforts to help Thai investors * * *''\n  I ask for unanimous consent that this and other articles about Ms. \nKanchanalak be entered into the Record at this point in their entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 1997]\n\n                 Inquiry Into Gifts to Democrats Widens\n\n                         (By Christopher Drew)\n\n       The Justice Department today subpoenaed the records of \n     Johnny Chung, a California businessman who gave $391,000 to \n     the Democratic Party, and others who made large donations \n     while seeking access to the White House, Government officials \n     said.\n       One Justice Department official said subpoenas also were \n     served on the United States-Thai Business Council, a trade-\n     promotion group formed in part by Pauline Kanchanalak, a \n     lobbyist who helped raise $250,000 in political donations \n     that have since been returned by the Democratic National \n     Committee.\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\n       The subpoenas show that a Justice Department task force is \n     continuing to widen its investigation into alleged \n     improprieties in the Democrats' drive to raise huge sums for \n     last year's elections.\n       The committee also is reviewing the donations made by Mr. \n     Chung and others. It has already returned nearly $1.5 million \n     in questionable donations. And one Democrat familiar with \n     that review said today that the party is likely to return an \n     additional $1 million, either because it could not verify the \n     sources of the money or because the donations seemed \n     improper.\n       Mr. Chung and Ms. Kanchanalak have declined to speak to \n     reporters, and their lawyers could not be reached for comment \n     last night.\n       Mr. Chung, an engineer who was born in Taiwan and is now an \n     American citizen, has captured attention for his intense \n     efforts to exploit his donations for commercial gains. Since \n     mid-1994, he has visited the White House at least 50 times, \n     sometimes bringing business associates from China and other \n     Far East places that he wanted to impress.\n       Mr. Chung took two Chinese beer executives to a White House \n     Christmas party in 1994, where they were photographed with \n     President and Mrs. Clinton. The beer company later placed the \n     photo in a glass display case promoting its product in one of \n     Beijing's main shopping districts.\n       It could not be learned exactly what records were sought in \n     the subpoenas issued today. But Justice Department officials \n     have said they were examining whether any foreign money might \n     have been improperly funneled into Democratic Party coffers.\n       Mr. Chung's lawyer, Brian A. Sun, told The New York Times \n     last week that his client, who runs a fax-services business \n     in Torrance, Calif., had received more than $3 million from \n     investors over the last three years. Mr. Sun estimated that \n     nearly $1.5 million of that total had come from foreigners as \n     Mr. Chung expanded into consulting for foreign businessmen \n     who wanted to make deals in the United States.\n       Mr. Sun said that Mr. Chung had done nothing wrong, and \n     that Mr. Chung's foreign partners were not involved in his \n     decisions to make the contributions. But it also is likely \n     that the Justice Department investigators would want to trace \n     the flow of money into Mr. Chung's accounts.\n       California records show that Mr. Chung incorporated seven \n     companies with investors from China and Hong Kong over the \n     last two years, and Federal election records show that \n     several of his largest political donations were made at about \n     the same time as the incorporations.\n       Mr. Chung also donated $50,000 to the Democratic Party in \n     March 1995, shortly after he took high-level Chinese \n     businessmen to watch Mr. Clinton give a radio address. Aides \n     to Donald L. Fowler, then the national chairman of the \n     Democratic Party, have said they arranged that White House \n     visit at Mr. Chung's request. Mr. Fowler has said he was not \n     personally involved and did not solicit a donation from Mr. \n     Chung in return for the favor.\n       Ms. Kanchanalak, a Thai citizen who lives in Virginia, got \n     help from John Huang, the former Democratic fund-raiser who \n     is at the center of the Federal inquiry, in setting up the \n     United States Thai-Business Council.\n       Government officials said the Justice Department two weeks \n     ago subpoenaed records from the Export-Import Bank concerning \n     Ms. Kanchanalak's efforts to help Thai investors win \n     financing to build 105 Blockbuster video stores in Thailand. \n     Ms. Kanchanalak has denied doing anything wrong.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 27, 1997]\n\n                   FBI Inquiry on Funding Is Widening\n\n                (By David Rogers and Edward Felsenthal)\n\n       Washington.--A Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into \n     foreign influence in Democratic fund raising could lead \n     Director Louis Freeh to ask Attorney General Janet Reno to \n     seek appointment of an independent counsel for the case.\n       Mr. Freeh briefed senior senators yesterday on the \n     investigation, and officials later described the continuing \n     FBI investigation as larger than previously reported and \n     carried on outside the purview of the White House.\n       Serious evidence has been found of China's potential \n     involvement in steering money to Democrats. That involvement \n     appears to have been driven largely by business interests \n     seeking influence and following the model of rival Taiwanese.\n       Pauline Kanchanalak, a major Democratic fundraiser who has \n     represented Thai companies with large investments in China, \n     has emerged as a key figure in the probe, officials said. \n     While refusing to comment on details of the briefing, senate \n     Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said the \n     evidence of foreign influence was ``deep and disturbing.''\n       ``We need an independent counsel if we ever needed an \n     independent counsel,'' the Alabama Republican said.\n       The Justice Department last night painted a less dire \n     picture of Mr. Freeh's briefing, and Attorney General Reno \n     continued to say that career prosecutors in the department \n     can handle the fund investigation. Neither Sen. Shelby nor \n     other officials familiar with the briefing were prepared to \n     say what Mr. Freeh's final recommendations would be. But \n     lawmakers of both parties said the investigation is regarded \n     very seriously by the director, who has committed substantial \n     resources to it.\n       FBI spokesman John Collingwood last night would say only \n     that it is ``a matter that is entirely within the purview of \n     the attorney general.''\n       Ms. Kanchanalak's role is important both because of her \n     foreign clients and past access to National Security Council \n     staff at the White House. As such, her prominence could pose \n     additional problems for former NSC adviser Anthony Lake, \n     whose nomination to direct the Central Intelligence Agency \n     already faces opposition in the Senate. Ms. Kanchanalak \n     couldn't be reached for comment.\n       Critics of the Clinton administration have recently stepped \n     up their demands for an independent counsel, particularly \n     with the disclosure this week that the president himself \n     played a role in encouraging the use of the White House as a \n     fundraising vehicle. Federal law requires the attorney \n     general to ask the federal appeals court here to appoint an \n     independent counsel when there are ``credible'' and \n     ``specific'' allegations of criminal wrongdoing against an \n     official. The law explicitly applies to the president, \n     cabinet members and some campaign officials; the attorney \n     general has the discretion to apply it to others as well.\n       Some say that threshold has clearly been crossed. ``I \n     thought [Ms. Reno] had gotten past the point where she didn't \n     have much choice under the statute some time ago,'' said \n     Theodore Olson, a Washington lawyer who was assistant \n     attorney general during the Reagan administration. Several \n     lawmakers--including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of \n     Mississippi, GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic \n     Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York--have called for an \n     independent counsel.\n       Ms. Reno said yesterday in a hearing before a House \n     committee that she still hasn't seen enough evidence to \n     justify such an appointment. She added that she is still open \n     to the idea if sufficient evidence emerges ``as we proceed \n     with the very comprehensive investigation that we now have \n     under way.'' Ms. Reno has appointed a task force of career \n     prosecutors to monitor the matter and to alert her if they \n     conclude an independent counsel is necessary.\n       Lawyers agree that the independent-counsel law is fairly \n     straightforward, requiring only a barebones determination by \n     the attorney general of whether further investigation is \n     necessary. But the question of what makes up a ``credible'' \n     allegation is obviously a judgment call. In addition, given \n     the complexities of the campaign-finance laws, it isn't \n     always clear what constitutes a violation.\n       Some lawyers believe that the attorney general should err \n     on the side of naming an independent counsel and leave it to \n     the appointee to decipher the law.\n       But Justice Department officials maintain that Ms. Reno has \n     very little discretion. People think that ``whenever there's \n     a mess, there's [supposed to be] an independent counsel,'' \n     said a spokesman for Ms. Reno. ``Congress could have written \n     the law that way, but they didn't.''\n       At a news conference yesterday, President Clinton \n     reiterated his position that the decision was up to Ms. Reno. \n     ``It's a legal decision the attorney general has to make,'' \n     he said. ``I'm not going to comment.''\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, these allegations about Ms. Kanchanalak, \ncoupled with her interactions with the National Security Council, are \nvery troubling to me and other members of the Committee. We must fully \nunderstand what part, if any, Mr. Lake played.\n  And while Mr. Lake has said that the NSC involvement with the \nindividuals in question was ``from a foreign policy rather than a \ndomestic political point of view,'' the material he provided to the \ncommittee gives some indications otherwise.\n  For example, Mr. Lake advised the President against a meeting with \nChinese nationals set up by Charlie (Tree) Trie, a major DNC \nfundraiser, based on the recommendation of his staff that it not take \nplace for political reasons.\n  And when asked about providing photos of the President with Chinese \nnationals identified as major DNC contributors, a member of Mr. Lake's \nstaff commented on balancing foreign policy considerations against \ndomestic politics. He did not seem to be bothered by the fact that \nChinese nationals were identified as major DNC contributors. Clearly, \nthis is an indication of possible illegal activity.\n  Before questioning Mr. Lake about his leadership in these areas, we \nintend to question his staff further as to the role the NSC played in \ninteractions with and vetting of these DNC contributors and foreign \nnationals.\n  Senator Kerrey, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and I \nhave requested that the NSC staff be available for the interviews on \nthe record prior to the formal hearings, which will begin, as I have \nsaid earlier, next Tuesday. We reserve the right to call NSC staff \nmembers to testify under oath, if we deem that in order.\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\n  The use of intelligence is another area.\n  One of the key responsibilities of the Director of Central \nIntelligence is to provide unbiased intelligence to the President and \nto the Congress. Thus, it is very critical that we examine Mr. Lake's \nrecord as a consumer of such intelligence.\n  How did he translate intelligence into policy at the NSC? Did he \nignore intelligence estimates, spin them to fit administration policy, \nor raise the standards of evidence?\n\n  We have concluded our investigation surrounding the administration's \nuse of intelligence in shaping policy toward China, and there are some \nserious inconsistencies. We are prepared to discuss these with Mr. Lake \nin the closed session of the committee.\n  Mr. President, given the allegations mentioned in every newspaper \nabout Chinese involvement in DNC fundraising, this is an area for some \nserious questioning about potential influences on policy, and it should \nbe.\n  For example, there are still documents we wish to review as to the \nrole intelligence played in our policy toward the Government of Haiti. \nThe administration has consistently refused to transmit this \ninformation to Congress. Senator Kerrey and I have requested these \ndocuments, and we are still awaiting the National Security Council's \nresponse.\n  We are also reviewing United States knowledge and assessment of \nrecent events in Iraq and their impact on our policy there and how Mr. \nLake used this knowledge in formulating that policy. We are pursuing \nsimilar questions in areas relating to Cuba, Somalia, Bosnia, and \nPakistan.\n  Ethics violations is another area we are pursuing.\n  While the Justice Department has reached a settlement with Mr. Lake \nregarding his failure to sell energy stocks that were deemed to create \na conflict of interest for him, resulting in a payment of a $5,000 fine \nby Mr. Lake, the Committee on Intelligence has been investigating this \nmatter further.\n  Although Mr. Lake claims that the failure to sell stocks was a simple \noversight, Justice Department investigators interviewed by the \ncommittee documented 14 occasions over a 2-year period on which Mr. \nLake was reminded that he still owned the stocks. It was only after a \nWhite House ethics officer discovered the stocks on his financial \ndisclosure form for a third time that Mr. Lake did divest himself of \nthe investments. Thus, a key question is whether this violation \nrepresents financial mismanagement on the part of Mr. Lake or a \ncomplete disregard for the seriousness of the ethics standards applied \nto all Federal employees.\n  Additionally, what example does this set for the intelligence \ncommunity professionals who must be held to the highest standards of \npersonal conduct?\n  The Intelligence Committee is also investigating the thoroughness of \nthe Justice Department's investigation into Mr. Lake's stocks, \nparticularly those energy-related stocks which created a conflict of \ninterest and subsequent fine. Given that Mr. Lake garnered a profit of \nover $25,000 on these investments, I have trouble, as other members of \nthe committee do, understanding the Justice Department's arbitrary fine \nof $5,000, which is the maximum allowed, I understand, for a potential \nmisdemeanor offense.\n  If the case, on the other hand, had been referred to the Justice \nDepartment's civil division, a much greater fine of up to $50,000 per \noffense could have been imposed. Why wasn't this course taken? We do \nnot know, but we will pursue it.\n  Iran-Bosnia and the ``no instructions'' policy.\n  A key criterion for a Director of Central Intelligence is the extent \nto which he or she can gain the confidence of the Congress in keeping \nMembers fully and currently informed of intelligence community actions. \nMr. Lake's role in the execution of the secret ``no instructions'' \npolicy toward Croatia allowing Iranian arms to flow into Bosnia and the \ndecision, Mr. President, not to inform Congress of this action has \ncalled into question Mr. Lake's ability to be forthright with the \nCongress.\n  The distinguished former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, my \ncolleague and an expert in the area, Senator Specter, has raised \nserious questions regarding this matter which we intend to explore \nfully during our hearings.\n  While Mr. Lake has admitted that it was wrong not to inform Congress \nof the ``no instructions'' policy, there remains a number of \ninconsistencies in testimony before both Houses of Congress as to the \nextent of the policy decision and its implementation. The Intelligence \nCommittee is working with other congressional committees to review \npertinent testimony and decide on an appropriate panel of witnesses to \npursue this matter during Mr. Lake's confirmation hearings. The Senate \nconfirmation hearings will represent the first time that Mr. Lake will \ntestify under oath on his role in the development and execution of this \npolicy.\n  As to the FBI background investigation, there has been no resolution \nregarding requests made by me and a large number of my colleagues to \nreview Mr. Lake's complete FBI background file. Negotiations between \nWhite House Counsel Charles Ruff, Senator Kerrey, and I are continuing.\n  A significant number of my colleagues have written the distinguished \nmajority leader stating that they need to review the complete \nbackground investigation before they would be prepared to vote on this \nnomination. Our thorough review of Mr. Lake's background investigation, \nI believe, is key to a fundamental understanding of Mr. Lake's \ncharacter and integrity, as it would be for anyone else.\n\n  Finally, the committee is reviewing information provided by Mr. Lake \nin response to questions propounded by the committee earlier. We \nrequire some clarifications to Mr. Lake's answers, and therefore \nadditional questions have been put forward that must be addressed.\n  There are some areas where we are requesting additional supporting \ndocumentation to Mr. Lake's answers, such as his financial disclosures \nand issues associated with a potential conflict of interest, and we \nwill request for the committee a review of material that was redacted \nfor various reasons.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to provide the \nSenate with a status of the Lake confirmation process and an \nopportunity for me to lay out some of the concerns that I and some of \nmy colleagues have about this nomination. We intend to work through \neach of these issues in a fair and a thorough manner and look forward \nto questioning Mr. Lake and others beginning next Tuesday, March 11.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1976-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1978-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1978-S1979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE NOTICE OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE IRAN EMERGENCY--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 20\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

This emergency is separate from \nthat declared on November 14,\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\n 1979, in connection with the Iranian hostage crisis and therefore \nrequires separate renewal of emergency authorities.\n  The factors that led me to declare a national emergency with respect \nto Iran on March 15, 1995, have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including its support for \ninternational terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the \nmeans to deliver them, continue to threaten the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States.

A bill to provide an exception to the restrictions on \neligibility for public benefits for certain legal aliens; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n      the elderly and disabled legal immigrant support act of 1997\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last year we approved the most \ncomprehensive welfare reform this Nation has ever known. Because the \nchanges were so comprehensive, this body approved the bill with much \nreservation, particularly on the provision for the elderly and disabled \nlegal immigrants.\n  Today, I correct one of the major challenges left over from the \nwelfare reform last year that if uncorrected, will have a devastating \nimpact on the States and counties by shifting the cost of caring for \nthe seriously ill and destitute disabled and elderly legal immigrants \nwho have absolutely no other means of support.\n  I am here to offer the Elderly and Disabled Legal Immigrant Support \nAct with Senator Boxer as the cosponsor in the Senate, and Congressman \nCampbell and Congresswoman Lofgren as sponsors in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The Elderly and Disabled Legal Immigrant Support Act of 1997 would \nexempt from the current ban on SSI, those elderly, disabled and/or \nblind legal immigrants, who came to this country prior to passage of \nthe welfare bill--August 22, 1996, who can demonstrate that they have \nno family and have no other source of support. This legislation \nprohibits SSI for all legal immigrants coming to this country following \nthe date of enactment of the welfare reform bill, August 22, 1996.\n\n  This legislation corrects what I believe is a grave mistake in the \nFederal welfare reform law--a blanket denial of SSI to all legal \nnoncitizens, no matter how elderly, disabled, destitute and ill they \nmay be.\n  Over 20 California county supervisors, both Republican and Democrat, \nhave spoken out, in one voice, that the legal immigrant provisions of \nthe welfare law will be disastrous for California counties and this \nlegislation is critical for the Counties and for the country.\n  In California alone, 200,000 to 326,000 people may lose SSI by August \n22, 1997.\n  Los Angeles County estimates that eliminating benefits for 93,000 \nlegal immigrants in its county could cost up to $236 million a year.\n  San Francisco estimates that 20,000 legal noncitizens may turn to the \ncounty's general assistance program, at a total cost of up to $74 \nmillion.\n  Many top immigrant States and counties will also bear the burden of \ncaring for the elderly, disabled, and blind legal immigrants who are \nbanned from SSI.\n  New York--126,860 legal immigrants may lose their SSI, costing the \nState approximately $240 million annually.\n  Florida--77,920 legal immigrants may lose their SSI, costing the \nState approximately $300 million annually.\n  Texas--59,160 legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  Illinois--25,960 legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  New Jersey--25,500 legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  Massachusetts--25,140 legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  The Republican Governors who supported the welfare reform bill now \nrealize that the new law, as written, will result in a huge financial \ncost-shift to their states.\n  President Clinton has also recognized that legal immigrants who \nbecome disabled after entry should not be banned from SSI and food \nstamps and has allocated $13.7 billion in the 1998 budget for this \npopulation who have nowhere else to turn.\n  As we speak, 125,000 SSI cancellation notices are going out to \nelderly, disabled, and blind legal immigrants every week. Many elderly \nand disabled legal immigrants have absolutely no family or friends to \nturn to for support and will be destitute. They have no one to turn to, \nexcept county relief programs or, at worst, homeless shelters. \nEffective August 22 of this year, all legal immigrants currently \nreceiving SSI will be cut from the rolls regardless of their \ncircumstances.\n  I know that prior to welfare reform, the door was open for sponsors \nto bring in their parents and then neglect to support them or, if they \nare unable to support them, to know that legal immigrants were eligible \nfor SSI. The number of noncitizens collecting SSI had increased by 477 \npercent in the 14 years from 1980 to 1994, while for citizens the \nnumbers increased by 33 percent during the same period. Clearly, one \ncan extrapolate from these statistics that legal immigrants were using \nSSI at 15 times the rate of citizens.\n  I hold the sponsors accountable for the support of legal immigrants \nthey bring into the country who they have pledged to support. But the \nFederal welfare reform banning SSI for virtually all legal immigrants--\neven those whose sponsors cannot afford to support them, or those \nrefugees who have no sponsors at all--will create extreme hardship for \nthose elderly, blind, and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to \nsupport themselves.\n  Let me tell you the story about a 73-year-old legal immigrant in San \nFrancisco on SSI. She was welcomed to this county from Vietnam in 1980. \nShe was a refugee from Communism with no family in the United States. \nShe speaks no English and she is suffering from kidney failure. She \nrequires dialysis three times a week. Under this new law, this 73-year-\nold woman will lose SSI, her only source of support.

A bill to clarify the tax treatment of certain disability \nbenefits received by former police officers or firefighters; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           THE POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS TAX CLARIFICATION ACT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would provide a measure of tax fairness for more than 1,000 police \nofficers, firefighters, and their families in my home State of \nConnecticut. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator \nLieberman.\n  This bill clarifies the tax treatment of heart and hypertension \nbenefits awarded to Connecticut's police officers and firefighters \nprior to 1992. The clarification is necessary because of an error made \nin the original version of Connecticut's heart and hypertension law. \nUnder that law, Connecticut intended to treat heart and hypertension \nbenefits as workmen's compensation for tax purposes. Unfortunately, \nbecause of the language used in the State statute, the heart and \nhypertension benefits became taxable under a ruling by the Internal \nRevenue Service [IRS] in 1991.\n  Since the IRS ruling, Connecticut has amended its law. But that \nchange does not help those police officers, firefighters, and their \nfamilies, who received benefits prior to the amendment. These law-\nabiding citizens accepted the benefits with the understanding that they \nwere not taxable. Now, as a result of the problem with the State law, \nand through no fault of their own, they have been charged with back \ntaxes, interest, and penalties by the IRS. This has created serious \nfinancial difficulties for a number of families.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join with me in remedying this \nproblem. Across this Nation, our firefighters and police officers work \nhard to protect our homes and businesses. They face incredible danger, \nand sometimes risk their lives, to help keep our communities safe. The \nhazards they face make their jobs particularly stressful. They need the \nsecurity provided by heart and hypertension benefits. They should not \nhave to contend with back taxes and penalties assessed due to an error \nin State law.\n  Under this legislation, which would remove their liability for heart \nand hypertension benefits for the years affected by the IRS ruling--\n1989-91, we can treat these public servants and their families more \nfairly. This bill is narrowly drafted to accomplish that limited \npurpose and would not affect the tax treatment of heart and \nhypertension benefits awarded after January 1, 1992.\n  Mr. President, my efforts to pass this legislation date back to the \n102d Congress. During that Congress, Senator Lieberman and I worked \nwith Representatives Barbara Kennelly and Rosa DeLauro and this bill \nbecame a part of the Revenue Act of 1992. Although the Revenue Act was \npassed by Congress, it was vetoed by President Bush 1 day after he lost \nthe election. We tried again during the 103d Congress, but we were \nunable to move the bill through the relevant committees. Last year, we \nhoped to move the bill as part of a broader tax and pension package, \nbut that legislation was also stalled.\n  I urge my colleagues to help pass this legislation quickly this year. \nWe must provide relief to the Connecticut police officers, \nfirefighters, and their families, who are facing severe financial \nhardship even though they have tried to follow the rules. Through no \nfault of their own, they have been hit with significant back taxes and \npenalties. We should remedy this problem and help them move on with \ntheir lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISABILITY BENEFITS RECEIVED \n                   BY FORMER POLICE OFFICERS OR FIREFIGHTERS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--For purposes of determing whether any \n     amount to which this section applies is excludable from gross \n     income under section 104(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, the following conditions shall be treated as \n     personal injuries or sickness in the course of employment:\n       (1) Heart disease.\n       (2) Hypertension.\n       (b) Amounts To Which Section Applies.--This section shall \n     apply to any amount--\n       (1) which is payable--\n       (A) to an individual (or to the survivors of an individual) \n     who was a full-time employee of any police department or fire \n     department which is organized and operated by a State, by any \n     political subdivision thereof, or by any agency or \n     instrumentality of a State or political subdivision thereof, \n     and\n       (B) under a State law (as in existence on July 1, 1992) \n     which irrebuttably presumed that heart disease and \n     hypertension are work-related illnesses but only for \n     employees separating from service before such date; and\n       (2) which is received in calendar year 1989, 1990, or 1191.\n\n     For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ``State'' \n     includes the District of Columbia.\n       (c) Waiver of Statute of Limitations.--If, on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act (or at any time within the 1-year \n     period beginning on such date of enactment) credit or refund \n     of any overpayment of tax resulting from the provisions of \n     this section is barred by any law or rule of law, credit or \n     refund of such overpayment shall, nevertheless, be allowed or \n     made if claim therefore is filed before the date 1 year after \n     such date of enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Specter, \n        and Mr. Faircloth) (by request):\n  S. 394. A bill to partially restore compensation levels to their past \nequivalent in terms of real income and establish the procedure for \nadjusting future compensation of justices and judges of the United \nStates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               federal judicial compensation legislation\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the request of the Judicial \nConference of the United States, I am introducing a bill to increase \nthe current salaries of Federal judges and to establish a procedure for \nfuture cost-of-living increases in judicial compensation.\n  This legislation was prepared by the Administrative Office of the \nUnited States Courts. I believe that, out of comity to the judicial \nbranch, the Senate should have on record the judiciary's specific \nproposals with respect to judicial compensation, so that we can give \nthose suggestions a full and fair hearing. These proposals deserve fair \nconsideration.\n  Federal judges have not received a cost-of-living salary adjustment \nsince January 1994. This bill would amend United States Code title 28, \nsections 5, 44(d), 135, and 252, to provide an immediate, one-time 9.6 \npercent adjustment in the compensation of Justices of the Supreme Court \nand Federal circuit court, district court, and international trade \ncourt judges appointed under article III of the Constitution. The bill \nwould also have the effect of increasing, by the same percentage, the \nsalaries of Federal court of claims and\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\nbankruptcy judges and full-time U.S. magistrate judges, since their \nsalaries are, by statute, fixed based on the salaries of Federal \ndistrict court judges.\n  With respect to future judicial salary adjustments, the bill would \namend section 461 of title 28 to end the current linkage between the \njudicial, congressional, and Executive Schedule compensation. Instead, \njudicial salaries would be adjusted automatically on an annual basis, \nin the same percentage amount as the rate of pay of Federal employees \nunder the General Schedule.\n  Finally, the bill would repeal section 140 of Public Law No. 97-92, \nthereby removing the current requirement that Congress affirmatively \nvote for cost-of-living increases for Federal judges.\n  If we are to attract and retain the most capable lawyers to serve as \nFederal judges, it is vitally important that we ensure that those \nresponsible for the effective functioning of the judicial branch \nreceive fair compensation, including reasonable adjustments which allow \njudicial salaries to keep pace with increases in the cost of living. As \nChief Justice Rehnquist stated in his ``1996 Year-End Report on the \nFederal Judiciary,'' ``We must insure that judges, who make a lifetime \ncommitment to public service, are able to plan their financial futures \nbased on reasonable expectations.'' This bill, which I am introducing \nat the request of the Judicial Conference, proposes changes viewed by \nthe Judicial Conference as advancing this objective--an objective with \nwhich I believe most Senators would agree. The bill merits serious \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JUDICIAL SALARIES.\n\n       (a) Increase in Judicial Salaries.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding sections 5, 44(d), 135, \n     and 252 of title 28, United States Code, the annual salary \n     rates of the Chief Justice of the United States, Associate \n     Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, judges of \n     the United States Courts of Appeals, judges of the United \n     States District Courts, and judges of the United States Court \n     of International Trade, are increased in the amount of 9.6 \n     percent of each applicable rate in effect on the date \n     immediately preceding the effective date of this subsection \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $100 (or if midway between \n     multiples of $100, to the next higher multiple of $100).\n       (2) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect on \n     the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on \n     or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Judicial Cost-of-Living Adjustments.--Section 461(a) of \n     title 28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Effective on the same date that the rates of basic \n     pay under the General Schedule are adjusted pursuant to \n     section 5303 of title 5, each salary rate which is subject to \n     adjustment under this section shall be adjusted by the same \n     percentage amount as provided for under section 5303 of title \n     5, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100 (or if midway \n     between multiples of $100, to the next higher multiple of \n     $100).''.\n       (c) Automatic Adjustments Without Congressional Action.--\n     Section 140 of the resolution entitled ``A Joint Resolution \n     making further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year \n     1982, and for other purposes,'', approved December 15, 1981 \n     (Public Law 97-92; 95 Stat. 1200; 28 U.S.C. 461 note) is \n     repealed.\n       By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n\n  S. 395. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify \nthe method of payment of taxes on distilled spirits; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n      THE DISTILLED SPIRITS TAX PAYMENT SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Distilled Spirits \nTax Payment Simplification Act of 1997,'' a bill more readily known as \nAll-In-Bond. This bill would streamline the way in which the Government \ncollects Federal excise tax on distilled spirits by extending the \ncurrent system of collection now applicable only to imported products \nto domestic products as well.\n  Today wholesalers purchase foreign-bottled distilled spirits in \nbond--tax free--paying the Federal excise tax directly after sale to a \nretailer. In contrast, when the wholesaler buys domestically bottled \nspirits--nearly 86 percent of total inventory--the price includes the \nFederal excise tax, prepaid by the distiller. This means that hundreds \nof U.S. family-owned wholesale businesses increase their inventory \ncarrying costs by 40 percent when buying U.S. products, which often \nhave to be financed through borrowing.\n  Under my bill, wholesalers would be allowed to purchase domestically \nbottled distilled spirits in bond from distillers just as they are now \npermitted to purchase foreign-produced spirits. Products would become \nsubject to tax on removal from wholesale premises. This legislation is \ndesigned to be revenue neutral and includes the requirement that any \nwholesaler electing to purchase spirits in bond must make certain \nestimated tax payments to Treasury before the end of the fiscal year.\n  All-In-Bond is an equitable and sound way to streamline our tax \ncollection system. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Distilled \n     Spirits Tax Payment Simplification Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Reference to 1986 Code.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided, whenever an amendment or repeal is expressed in \n     terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \n     provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a \n     section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF DISTILLED SPIRITS BETWEEN BONDED \n                   PREMISES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5212 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 5212.

A bill to amend titles 5 and 37, United States Code, to \nprovide for the continuance of pay and the authority to make certain \nexpenditures and obligations during lapses in appropriations; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n            THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PROTECTION ACT\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing an \nimportant piece of legislation called the Federal Employee Compensation \nProtection Act.\n  With the 1995 to 1996 Government shutdown fresh in our minds, I think \nit is crucial that we take steps in this Congress to keep faith with \nour Federal employees and make sure they are never again sent home \nwithout pay. My bill will keep that faith by protecting Federal \nemployee pay and benefits during a future Government shutdown. This \nbill ensures that Federal employees in Maryland and across the Nation\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\nwill be able to make their mortgage payments, put food on the table, \nand provide for their families during a shutdown.\n  The last shutdown of the Federal Government severely disrupted the \nlives of thousands of Federal employees and their families. In my State \nof Maryland alone, there are more than 280,000 Federal employees. They \nare some of the most dedicated and hard-working people in America \ntoday. These employees have devoted their careers and lives to public \nservice, and they should not have been used as pawns in a game of \npolitical brinkmanship.\n  During the last several years, Federal employees have endured their \nfair share of hardship. Downsizing, diet COLA's, delayed COLA's, and \nattacks on pensions and health benefits have damaged morale at nearly \nevery Federal agency. These assaults must stop. We cannot continue to \ndenigrate and downgrade Federal employees and at the same time expect \nGovernment to work more efficiently.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and also work to \nprevent any future shutdowns of our Government. We have a contract with \nour Federal employees, and we should encourage their dedication by \nensuring that the contract is honored and their pay and benefits are \nnot put in jeopardy.\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing this important \nlegislation to ensure the protection of Federal employee pay and \nbenefits in the event of a furlough.\n  We have a responsibility to the men and women who have dedicated \nthemselves to public service and I would hope that my colleagues would \njoin Senator Mikulski and me in our ongoing effort to maintain the \nFederal Government's commitment to its dedicated work force.\n  Federal workers have just experienced the most difficult Congress in \nrecent history. Federal employees became hostages in the budget battle \nwhich resulted in two successive Government shutdowns. At this time \nlast year, Federal employees were in a constant state of anxiety--\nconcerned about the future of their jobs, whether they would be laid \noff or have to work without pay, all as their workloads continued to \naccumulate. Despite this tremendous pressure and the constant attacks \non their pay and earned benefits, Federal workers continue to provide \nconsistent, quality service on behalf of all Americans.\n  As I have stated many times before, Federal employees have already \nmade significant sacrifices in past years in the form of downsizing \nefforts, delayed and reduced cost of living adjustments, and other \nreductions in Federal employee pay and benefits. It is, in my view, \ncritical that we protect Federal employees from the type of senseless \nabuse they endured during the Government shutdowns last Congress. \nFederal workers should never again find themselves in a situation \nwhere, through no fault of their own, they may have to either work \nwithout pay or be prohibited from coming to work at all.\n  Mr. President, Federal employees have made a choice to serve their \ncountry and we should respect and reward that choice by supporting \nthese hardworking, dedicated individuals. Through the legislation \nSenator Mikulski and I are reintroducing today, we will continue to \nsend the message to the Federal work force and to all American citizens \nthat Congress honors and values the commitment those who work for the \nGovernment have made.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Leahy):\n\n  S. 397. A bill to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to extend the civil service retirement provisions of such chapter \nwhich are applicable to law enforcement officers, to inspectors of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, inspectors and canine \nenforcement officers of the U.S. Customs Service, and revenue officers \nof the Internal Revenue Service; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n       THE HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS RETIREMENT BENEFITS ACT OF 1997\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Hazardous \nOccupations Retirement Benefits Act of 1997.\n  This legislation will grant an early retirement package for revenue \nofficers of the Internal Revenue Service, customs inspectors of the \nU.S. Customs Service, and immigration inspectors of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service.\n  Under current law, with the exception of the groups listed in this \nlegislation, all Federal law enforcement officers and firefighters are \neligible to retire at age 50 with 20 years of Federal service. This \nlegislation will amend the current law and finally grant the same 20-\nyear retirement to these members of the Internal Revenue Service, \nCustoms Service, and Immigration and Naturalization Service. The \nemployees under this bill have very hazardous, physically taxing \noccupations, and it is in the public's interest to tenure a young and \ncompetent work force in these jobs.\n  The need for a 20-year retirement benefit for inspectors of the \nCustoms Service is easily apparent. These employees are the country's \nfirst line of defense against terrorism and the smuggling of illegal \ndrugs at our borders. They have the authority to apprehend those \nengaged in such activities and carry a firearm on the job. They are \nresponsible for the majority of arrests performed by Customs Service \nemployees. In 1994, inspectors of the Customs Service seized 204,000 \npounds of cocaine, 2,600 pounds of heroin, and 559,000 pounds of \nmarijuana. They are required to undergo the same law enforcement \ntraining as all other law enforcement personnel. These employees face \nmultiple challenges. They confront leading criminals in the drug war, \norganized crime figures, and increasingly sophisticated white-collar \ncriminals.\n  Revenue officers struggle with heavy workloads and a high rate of job \nstress, resulting in a variety of physical and mental symptoms. Many \nIRS employees must employ pseudonyms to hide their identity because of \nthe great threat to their personal safety. The Internal Revenue Service \nhas put out a manual for their employees entitled: ``Assaults and \nThreats: A Guide to Your Personal Safety'' to help employees respond to \nhostile situations. The document advises IRS employees how to handle \non-the-job assaults, abuse, threatening telephone calls, and other \nmenacing situations.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is cost effective. Any cost that is \ncreated by this act is more than offset by savings in training costs \nand increased revenue collection. A 20-year retirement bill for these \nemployees will reduce turnover, increase yield, decrease employee \nrecruitment and development costs, and enhance the retention of a well-\ntrained and experienced work force.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me again in this Congress in expressing \nsupport for this bill and finally getting it enacted. This bill will \nimprove the effectiveness of our inspector and revenue officer work \nforce to ensure the integrity of our borders and proper collection of \nthe taxes and duties owed to the Federal Government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 398. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require the \nuse of child restraint systems approved by the Secretary of \nTransportation on commercial aircraft, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 airline children's safety legislation\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President I introduce legislation that would \nprotect our Nation's small children as they travel on aircraft. We \ncurrently have Federal regulations that require the safety of \npassengers on commercial flights. However, neither flight attendants \nnor an infant's parents can protect unrestrained infants in the event \nof an airline accident or severe turbulence. A child on a parent's lap \nwill likely break free from the adult's arms as a plane takes emergency \naction or encounters extreme turbulence.\n  This child then faces two serious hazards. First, the child may be \ninjured as they strike the aircraft interior. Second, the parents may \nnot be able to find the infant after a crash. The United Sioux City, \nIA, crash provides one dark example. On impact, no parent was able to \nhold on to her-his child. One child was killed when he flew from his \nmother's hold. Another child was rescued from an overhead compartment \nby a stranger.\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\n  In July 1994, during the fatal crash of a USAir plane in Charlotte, \nNC, another unrestrained infant was killed when her mother could not \nhold onto her on impact. The available seat next to the mother survived \nthe crash intact. The National Transportation Safety Board believes \nthat had the baby been secured in the seat, she would have been alive \ntoday. In fact, in a FAA study on accident survivability, the agency \nfound that of the last nine infant deaths, five could have survived had \nthey been in child restraint devices.\n  Turbulence creates very serious problems for unrestrained infants. In \nfour separate incidences during the month of June, passengers and \nflight attendants were injured when their flights hit sudden and \nviolent turbulence. In one of these, a flight attendant reported that a \nbaby seated on a passenger's lap went flying through the air during \nturbulence and was caught by another passenger. This measure is \nendorsed by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Aviation \nConsumer Action Project.\n  We must protect those unable to protect themselves. Just as we \nrequire seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, and car seats, we must mandate \nrestraint devices that protect our youngest citizens. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation that ensures our kids remain \npassengers and not victims.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CHILD SAFETY RESTRAINT SYSTEMS ON COMMERCIAL \n                   AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 447 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 44725. Child safety restraint systems\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Secretary of Transportation \n     shall issue regulations requiring the use of child safety \n     restraint systems that have been approved by the Secretary on \n     any aircraft operated by an air carrier in providing \n     interstate air transportation, intrastate air transportation, \n     or foreign air transportation.\n       ``(b) Age or Weight Limits.--The regulations issued under \n     this section shall establish age or weight limits for \n     children who use the child safety restraint systems.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter \n     447 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new item:\n\n``44725.

INTERNATIONAL STANDARD.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States \n     representative to the International Civil Aviation \n     Organization should seek an international standard to require \n     that passengers on a civil aviation aircraft be restrained--\n       (1) on takeoff and landing; and\n       (2) when directed by the captain of such aircraft.\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n\n  S. 399. A bill to amend the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and \nExcellence in National Environmental and Native American Public Policy \nAct of 1992 to establish the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict \nResolution to conduct environmental conflict resolution and training, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n      THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to promote \nfair, timely and efficient resolution of our Nation's environmental \ndisputes.\n  This bill would establish, within the Morris K. Udall Foundation, the \nUnited States Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution. The \ninstitute would offer alternative dispute resolution services, \nincluding assessment, mediation, and other related services, to \nfacilitate parties in resolving environmental disputes without \nresorting to protracted and costly litigation in the courts. I ask \nunanimous consent that a summary of the legislation be included in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my statement.\n  This legislation simply gives the Udall Foundation the means to do \nwhat Congress asked it to do 5 years ago. When the Udall Foundation was \nestablished in 1992, it was charged with the task of establishing a \nprogram for environmental dispute resolution. Since then, the \nfoundation has sponsored seminars and workshops on conflict resolution. \nBut it has lacked the funding and explicit direction that would enable \nit to run a program that could provide conflict resolution services. \nThis bill provides both the direction and the authorization for \nfunding.\n  It is particularly fitting that an institute devoted to environmental \nconflict resolution would operate under the auspices of the Udall \nFoundation. Morris K. Udall's career was distinguished by his \nintegrity, service, and commitment to consensus-building.\n  I had the distinct pleasure of working with Mo Udall on one of his \ngreatest legislative achievements--the Arizona Wilderness Act. That act \nprotects 2.5 million acres in the Arizona wilderness in perpetuity and \nwas passed thanks, in large part, to Mo Udall's efforts to achieve \nconsensus within the Arizona delegation.\n  Using Mo Udall's success in passing the Arizona Wilderness Act as its \nmodel, the U.S. Environmental Conflict Resolution Institute at the \nUdall Foundation would seek to promote our nation's environmental \npolicy objectives by reaching out to achieve consensus rather than \npursuing resolution through adversarial processes.\n  Mr. President, over 5,000 Federal court decisions on environmental \nlitigation have been handed down in the past two decades. Today, some \n400 to 500 environmental lawsuits are filed each year in Federal \ncourts. In its 16th annual report, the Council on Environmental Quality \nestimated that fully 85 percent of Environmental Protection Agency \nregulations are challenged at some time in the courts, either by groups \nthat find the rules too stringent or by groups that believe them to be \ntoo lax. In short, resorting to the courts is all too common in \ndisputes over environmental issues.\n\n  This bill seeks to move our Nation away from this litigious trend by \nproviding an alternative conflict resolution process. This process is \nintended to preclude the need for lawsuits by engaging the parties in \nprofessionally mediated discussions. It could also be used as a \nsolution of last resort, if the parties agreed to put aside litigation \nalready filed in the courts and instead utilize the services of the \ninstitute.\n  The benefits to be gained by the Federal Government through a \nnational environmental dispute resolution program include more than \nlitigation cost savings. Delay associated with litigation can also \nprevent the timely enforcement of our environmental laws.\n  For more than ten years, I have been working to promote safety and \nquiet in Grand Canyon National Park. This issue, as well as any other, \nexemplifies how alternative dispute resolution could perhaps help us \nachieve national environmental policy objectives far better than \nlitigation.\n  In 1987, legislation I authored to promote safety and provide for the \nsubstantial restoration of natural quiet in the Grand Canyon was signed \ninto law. Ten years later, the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] \nthis year issued a final rule on overflights over the Grand Canyon. \nThis rule was scheduled to go into effect on May 1, 1997. However, \ndespite the substantial time and effort that both the FAA and the \nNational Park Service have put into this rulemaking, including \nconsultations with many outside interests, lawsuits have now been filed \nchallenging the rule and delaying its implementation.\n  Mr. President, I do not mention this to criticize those who have \nexercised their right to file suit in the Grand Canyon overflights \nmatter. I refer to this situation because it concerns me that \nprotecting the Grand Canyon could be significantly delayed through \nlitigation, when the parties might reach a more timely and mutually \nacceptable resolution if they were provided an opportunity to work \nthrough their differences in a nonadversarial forum. The institute \ncreated by this legislation would provide an alternative to litigation \nin this and similar situations and create an opportunity for more \nconstructive problem-solving and effective policymaking.\n  One hundred twenty-six years ago, Abraham Lincoln wisely counseled:\n\n       Discourage litigation, persuade your neighbor to compromise \n     whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is \n     often the real loser in fees, expenses, and waste of time.\n\n  That advice could not be more sound today as we seek to resolve our \nNation's environmental conflicts and to\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\npromote timely and effective implementation of laws and regulations to \nprotect and preserve our natural environment.\n  I am pleased that the Council on Environmental Quality has registered \ntheir support for the goals and concepts in this bill. In addition, the \nUdall Foundation, the Grand Canyon Trust, the National Parks and \nConservation Association, Friends of the Earth, and Trout Unlimited \nhave given their support to this effort. I ask unanimous consent that \ncopies of support letters from these groups be included in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and support this legislation that \nwould bring common sense and efficiency to the resolution of our \nNation's environmental disputes.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Environmental Policy and Conflict Resolution Act of 1997\n\n       Purpose: To establish, within the Morris K. Udall \n     Foundation, the United States Institute for Environmental \n     Conflict Resolution to assist in implementing national \n     environmental policy. The Institute would provide alternative \n     dispute resolution services, including assessment, mediation, \n     and other services, to facilitate resolving environmental \n     disputes without litigation.\n       Bill authorizes use of the Institute by Federal agencies:\n       Federal agencies could use the Institute's conflict \n     resolution services for a fee.\n       Bill creates a revolving fund to:\n       Fund operations and fully support the Institute through a \n     one-time $3 million appropriation.\n       Receive fees from parties using the Institute's services.\n       Supplement an annual appropriation for a five-year period \n     beginning in 1998.\n       The Council on Environmental Quality would:\n       Receive notification when a federal agency requests to use \n     the Institute's services.\n       Concur in any request to use the Institute's services for \n     interagency dispute resolution.\n       The Institute would be under the Udall Foundation because:\n       One purpose for which the Udall Foundation was established \n     in 1992 was to establish a program for environmental conflict \n     resolution.\n       The Udall Foundation has hosted seminars, workshops and \n     research related to environmental dispute resolution but, has \n     lacked funding to provide mediation services.\n       Conflict resolution and consensus building were major \n     themes of Udall's thirty year public career as a member of \n     the House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   S. 399--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n       Section 1: Short title--``The Environmental Policy and \n     Conflict Resolution Act of 1997''.\n       Section 2: Definition of Terms.\n       Section 3: Adds the Chair of the Council on Environmental \n     Quality as an ex officio non-voting member of the Udall \n     Foundation Board.\n       Section 4: Bill Purpose: To establish as part of the Udall \n     Foundation the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict \n     Resolution (Institute) to assist the Federal Government in \n     implementing national environmental policy.\n       The Institute would provide assessment, mediation and other \n     related services to resolve environmental disputes involving \n     agencies and instrumentalities of the United States.\n       Section 5: Authorizes the Udall Foundation to establish the \n     Institute and provide assessment, mediation, and other \n     alternative dispute resolution services.\n       Section 6: Revolving Fund:\n       Creates a Revolving Fund for the Institute to operate. The \n     revolving fund would be administered by the Udall Foundation \n     and would be maintained separately from the Trust Fund \n     established for scholarships awarded by the Udall Foundation.\n       Section 7: Use of the Institute by a Federal Agency:\n       Authorizes use of the Institute by a federal agency which \n     may enter into a contract to expend funds for the use of the \n     Institute's services. Any funds spent by an agency on the \n     Institute would go into the Revolving Fund.\n       Requires concurrence by the Council on Environmental \n     Quality (CEQ) for two agencies to seek to resolve a dispute \n     at the Institute. CEQ would be notified of any agency request \n     to use the Institute's services.\n       Section 8: Authorization of Appropriations:\n       Authorizes a one-time appropriation of $3 million to the \n     Revolving Fund for fiscal year 1998 and $2.1 million in \n     appropriations over a 5 year period beginning in 1998 to \n     fully operate the Institute.\n       The Revolving Fund would be replenished by fees from \n     parties using the Institute's services.\n       Section 9: Conforming amendments.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Council on \n           Environmental Quality\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for requesting the \n     Administration's views on your draft legislation entitled the \n     ``Environmental Policy and Conflict Resolution Act of 1997.''\n       The legislation represents a commendable effort to assist \n     private entities and government in resolving environmental \n     and natural resource conflicts by expanding the range of \n     services available from the Morris K. Udall Foundation to \n     include resolution of disputes involving federal agencies. \n     The Administration supports the concepts and goals embodied \n     in your legislation. However, the Administration needs to \n     complete its review of the bill language prior to providing a \n     comprehensive Administration position. We expect to provide \n     additional comments on the bill in the near future.\n       As you know, last September, the President awarded the \n     Medal of Freedom to Congressman Udall. The President's \n     remarks at the time bear repeating:\n       ``During a remarkable 30-year career, Morris Udall was a \n     quiet giant of the Congress. Warm, funny, and intelligent, he \n     was truly a man of the center, who forged consensus by \n     listening to others and by reasoned argument. His landmark \n     achievements--such as reforming campaign finance, preserving \n     our forests, safeguarding the Alaskan wilderness, and \n     defending the rights of Native Americans--were important \n     indeed. But he distinguished himself above all as a man to \n     whom others--leaders--would turn for judgment, skill, and \n     wisdom. Mo Udall is truly a man for all seasons and a role \n     model for what is best in American democracy.''\n       It is entirely fitting to ask the institution established \n     by Congress in Congressman Udall's name to help with the hard \n     job of helping people solve their disagreements over the \n     lands, waters, and resources we all share and must steward \n     responsibly. This Administration has made every effort to \n     break down the barriers between government and citizens. \n     Voluntary mechanisms to enhance communication and \n     understanding within government and between agencies and the \n     people they serve can assist meaningfully in this regard.\n       I appreciate your willingness to incorporate provisions \n     that recognize the important dispute resolution purposes of \n     the National Environmental Policy Act and the inter-agency \n     coordination function of the President's Council on \n     Environmental Quality.\n       The Administration would be pleased to work with you as \n     your legislation proceeds.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Kathleen A. McGinty,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Parks and Conservation Association, Friends of \n           the Earth,\n                                                    March 5, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Parks and Conservation \n     Association and Friends of the Earth are pleased to endorse \n     the concept of a U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict \n     Resolution, the subject of legislation you intend to \n     introduce on March 5.\n       Resolving environmental disputes before they reach the \n     litigation stage is a goal we strongly support. Your \n     legislation would enable federal agencies to solve disputes \n     among themselves or with other non-federal parties by using \n     the institute's staff for mediation and other services.\n       In general, we believe litigation should be the last resort \n     in enforcing or upholding our environmental laws, provided \n     that negotiated agreements clearly adhere to statutory \n     mandates. We also believe negotiated solutions, in general, \n     allow disputants more creativity and flexibility to solve \n     problems and issues in cost effective ways.\n       Many environmental disputes, including those involving our \n     national parks, could be resolved by good-faith negotiations \n     led by an honest broker. The unfolding case of buffalo \n     management in Yellowstone is a case in point. Here, a lawsuit \n     filed by Montana against two federal agencies has \n     precipitated the killing of almost one third of Yellowstone's \n     buffalo herd. A court order is driving the slaughter. \n     Although this wildlife tragedy is abhorred by all of the \n     parties involved, collectively they did nothing effective to \n     prevent it. In retrospect, it is clear that the slaughter \n     might have been avoided had the parties committed themselves \n     to good faith negotiations years ago when the issue first \n     emerged.\n       Thank you for your leadership on environmental issues \n     generally and for your constructive approach to conflict \n     resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul C. Pritchard,\n       President, National Parks and Conservation Association.\n     Brent Blackwelder,\n       President, Friends of the Earth.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Trout Unlimited,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of Trout Unlimited's 95,000 \n     members nationwide, I am\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\n     writing to support the bill that you intend to introduce \n     today. The bill would amend the Morris K. Udall Scholarship \n     and Excellence in National Environmental and Native American \n     Public Policy Act of 1992 by establishing a new environmental \n     conflict resolution program within the Morris K. Udall \n     Foundation. We believe the new conflict resolution program \n     holds great promise for resolving the intractable \n     environmental disputes that continue to plague federal \n     natural resources agencies and other interests involved with \n     federal environmental laws.\n       The mission of Trout Unlimited is to conserve, protect and \n     restore North America's trout and salmon resources and the \n     watersheds on which they depend. Our work often takes us into \n     difficult environmental conflicts involving many federal \n     agencies. Over the past two decades, we have been deeply \n     involved in disputes regarding implementation of the \n     Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the federal \n     land management laws, in which federal agencies have had very \n     difficult conflicts. Failure to resolve these conflicts in a \n     timely fashion has adversely affected trout and salmon \n     resources. We are particularly hopeful that the new \n     interagency conflict resolution mechanism proposed by your \n     bill will yield a new and better way of resolving these \n     disputes.\n       We salute your authorship of the bill and look forward to \n     working with you to get it enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Steve Moyer,\n     Director, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Morris K. Udall Foundation,\n\n                                        Tucson, AZ, March 3, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: It gives me great pleasure as Chairman \n     of the Board of Trustees of the Morris K. Udall Scholarship \n     and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation to \n     inform you that the trustees unanimously and enthusiastically \n     endorse your unique concept for the creation of the United \n     States Institute for Environmental Dispute Resolution as part \n     of the Udall Foundation.\n       As you know, federal agencies have been increasingly \n     involved in environmental disputes as parties to lawsuits \n     based upon their regulatory actions. Continuing to wage these \n     conflicts in the costly and time-consuming arena of the \n     courts drains federal resources and can serve to delay \n     federal actions to protect the environment. Alternative forms \n     of environmental conflict resolution for federal agencies are \n     needed to prevent these and other adverse effects associated \n     with protracted litigation.\n       Since it began in May 1995, the Udall Foundation has worked \n     to create a national environmental conflict resolution \n     program, as directed in its authorizing legislation. The \n     Foundation has sponsored workshops and seminars on \n     environmental conflict resolution and has begun funding \n     several research projects.\n       On April 4-5, 1997, the Foundation will host \n     ``Environmental Conflict Resolution in the West'' in Tucson, \n     Arizona. This will be the largest gathering of its kind. \n     Several hundred people from around the country, including \n     professional mediators, facilitators, researchers, and \n     federal, state and local agency officials are expected to \n     attend this conference to discuss alternative approaches to \n     environmental dispute resolution and collaborative problem \n     solving.\n       Despite these efforts, the Foundation has lacked the \n     funding to directly pursue conflict resolution by providing \n     mediation and other services to resolve environmental \n     disputes. The legislation you are introducing will finally \n     enable the Foundation to provide a program to conduct \n     environmental conflict resolution at the national level.\n       We believe that your legislation will allow the Foundation, \n     through the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict \n     Resolution, to make a positive impact on the cost and pace of \n     environmental dispute resolution for years to come. The \n     Foundation is prepared to do all it can to establish a \n     program committed to helping to resolve these conflicts \n     fairly and as efficiently as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Terrence L.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Trustees of the Grand \n     Canyon Trust, a conservation organization dedicated to the \n     conservation of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau, I am \n     pleased to endorse and offer our support for your bill \n     creating the United States Institute for Environmental \n     Conflict Resolution.\n       The Trust has long held that many conflicts that arise from \n     differences between parties regarding environmental policy \n     and regulation could best be solved through mediation and \n     alternative dispute resolution rather than in courts of law. \n     Too often the will of the American public to protect our \n     natural resources and ecological treasures is lost amid \n     posturing and polarization by parties embroiled in conflict \n     over environmental issues. We believe that your legislation \n     will enable the United States Institute for Environmental \n     Conflict Resolution to actively mediate and conduct \n     environmental conflict resolution in a positive, constructive \n     manner.\n       The Grand Canyon Trust pledges to work in concert with the \n     Morris K.

A bill to amend rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, relating to representations in court and sanctions for \nviolating such rule, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n              THE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT PREVENTION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nimportant tort reform legislation. Tort reform is needed for many \nreasons--one of which is to free our courts of frivolous lawsuits. \nFrivolous lawsuits take the courts' time away from trying legitimate \nlawsuits, and deprive the truly injured of timely resolution of their \nclaims.\n  Mr. President, our courts are supposed to be venues for resolving \ndisputes. Lawsuits are supposed to be the means by which injured \nparties seek relief--they are not intended to be used as weapons to \nharass, delay, or increase the cost to the other party. Too often \nentire lawsuits, or claims within ongoing lawsuits, are used as \nweapons. The bill that I introduce today takes a stab at these \nlawsuits. It toughens the penalties for filing frivolous lawsuits and \ninsures that if someone files a frivolous lawsuit, that someone will \npay.\n  Our front-line defense against this misuse of the legal system is \nrule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule is intended \nto deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party. \nThe power of rule 11 was diluted in 1993. This weakening is \nunacceptable to those of us who want to preserve courts as neutral \nforums for dispute resolution and who believe that lawsuits are not \nweapons of revenge, but a means for an injured party to gain relief.\n\n  Senator Brown introduced a bill very similar to this legislation in \nthe last Congress. The Senate adopted the text of his bill as an \namendment to the Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act. \nHis amendment passed by a vote of 56 to 37.\n  The bill that I am introducing today is similar, but not identical to \nSenator Brown's bill. The civil rights community raised some concerns \nwith his bill, and my version of the legislation is responsive to these \nconcerns. The provision that was opposed reinstated the rule 11 \nrequirement that allegations contained in motions and other court \npapers be well grounded in fact when filed, rather than allowing a \n``reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.'' \nUnlike Senator Brown's bill, my bill does not change this subsection of \nrule 11.\n  My bill does take strong steps to thwart frivolous lawsuits. First, \nmy bill makes sanctions for the violation of this rule mandatory. One \nof the\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nmost harmful changes that took effect in 1993 was to make sanctions for \nproven violations of this rule permissive. This means that if a party \nfiles a lawsuit simply to harass another party, and the court decides \nthat this is in fact the case, the offending party still might not be \nsanctioned. This is unacceptable. The offending party might not be \npunished at all, which provides no deterrence for this offending party \nor anyone else who wants to misuse the courts. My bill reinstates the \nrequirement that if there is a violation of this rule, there are \nsanctions.\n  My bill also removes the limitation on sanctions, and allows \nsanctions to be paid to the injured party for more than attorneys' fees \nand expenses. In addition, this legislation allows the sanctioning of \nattorneys for arguing for an extension of current law if their actions \nviolate this rule. Again, if the rule is violated, there needs to be \nsanctions.\n  Mr. President, this bill will not, by itself, stop the misuse of our \ncourts. It is, however, a good first step. It is a necessary step. It \nis a bill that we must pass to sanction those who use the legal system \nto harass and torment others. That is not what the courts were \nestablished to do. We must protect the integrity of the courts and \npreserve them for proper use.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 401. A bill to improve the control of outdoor advertising in areas \nadjacent to the Interstate System, the National Highway System, and \ncertain other federally assisted highways, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   the scenic highway protection act\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Scenic \nHighway Protection Act, legislation that will control billboard blight \nand put a stop to the policies that have actually encouraged billboard \nconstruction and destroyed rural vistas across America. Every year \nhundreds of miles of rural scenery disappear, millions of taxpayer \ndollars are spent, and thousands of trees on public lands are \nunnecessarily cut. Why? Because billboards continue to proliferate \nalong our Nation's highways.\n  During debate on the National Highway System Act in 1995, billboard \nproponents pushed an amendment that would have forced States and \nlocalities to allow billboards on Federal aid highways. Fortunately, \nthis proposal was defeated. My legislation attempts to give States the \nnecessary tools to regulate and end the growth of billboards and \nprotects the strict billboard controls enacted in Vermont and many \nother States.\n  In the coming months, Congress will consider reauthorization of the \nNation's transportation law, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and \nEfficiency Act. Proponents of billboard proliferation will most likely \ntry again to override State billboard control laws. This time, we are \nprepared to enact legislation that will reduce and control billboards \nnationwide. My legislation will send a signal to billboard owners that \nAmerica is ready to end uncontrolled billboard blight.\n  The language in my bill will place a permanent freeze on the number \nof new billboards placed along Federal aid highways. for a new \nbillboard to go up, an old one must come down. The legislation will \nalso prohibit billboards in unzoned areas, eliminating the ability to \nrandomly place billboards in rural America. My bill will end the \npractice of cutting trees on public lands for the sole purpose of \nbetter billboard visibility and reinstate the requirement that Federal \nand State funds be used to remove billboards when communities decide \nthe sign violates local zoning laws. Finally, the legislation will \nplace a 15-percent gross revenue tax on all billboards, ending the free \nride for billboards. The money will be used to remove billboards in our \nNation's most scenic areas.\n  This legislation will move the 1965 Highway Beautification Act closer \nto its original intent of preserving the public's investment in our \nhighways by protecting scenic areas and natural resources. Let us end \nthe taxpayer subsidized proliferation of billboards.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n\n  S. 402. A bill to approve a settlement agreement between the Bureau \nof Reclamation and the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  SETTLEMENT AUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that \nwill authorize a settlement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the \nOroville-Tonasket Irrigation District in Washington State. I introduced \nsimilar legislation last year. Congressman Doc Hastings has introduced \nlegislation on this subject in the House of Representatives, and the \nHouse Resources Committee will mark up the legislation today.\n  This legislation will authorize a carefully negotiated settlement \nbetween the BOR and the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District. If \nenacted, this legislation will save the BOR, and therefore the Nation's \ntaxpayers, money that would otherwise be spent fighting with the \nirrigation district in court.\n  Earlier this week the administration sent a letter to me indicating \nthat it would support the settlement bill, provided that several \nchanges be made to the legislation. The legislation that I introduce \ntoday includes the changes requested by the administration. At this \ntime, I ask unanimous consent to include a copy of the administration's \nletter of support for the legislation in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                        Bureau of Reclamation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1997.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: Thank you for your letter requesting \n     the Administration's views on H.R. 412.\n       The Bureau of Reclamation has executed a settlement \n     agreement with the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District \n     (District) in preference to litigation over construction of \n     the Oroville-Tonasket (O-T) Unit Extension. The settlement \n     agreement provides that its terms will not become effective \n     unless Congress enacts authorizing legislation by April 15, \n     1997.\n       While the Administration supports implementing the \n     settlement agreement, it can only support H.R. 412 if the \n     amendments shown on the attached page are adopted. These \n     amendments are needed to clarify that the transfer of title \n     will not affect the repayment obligation of the Bonneville \n     Power Administration (BPA) for irrigation assistance, and \n     that the settlement agreement will not affect the District's \n     obligation to continue to pay BPA wheeling charges. In \n     addition, the amendments are needed to deauthorize the \n     project irrigation works upon transfer of title. The \n     Administration strongly encourages the adoption of these \n     amendments, which are consistent with the intent of the \n     settlement agreement.\n       Thank you for your interest in the Oroville-Tonasket Claims \n     Settlement and Conveyance Act. If you have any questions, \n     please call 208-4501.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Eluid L. Martinez,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n\n                         amendments to H.r. 412\n\n       1. At the end of section 5, insert the following new \n     subsection (c):\n       ``(c) Project Construction Costs.--The transfer of title \n     authorized by this Act shall not affect the timing or amount \n     of the obligation of the Bonneville Power Administration for \n     the repayment of construction costs incurred by the Federal \n     government under Section 202 of the Act of September 28, 1976 \n     (90 Stat. 1325) that the Secretary of the Interior has \n     determined to be beyond the ability of the irrigators to pay. \n     The obligation shall remain charged to and be returned to the \n     Reclamation Fund as provided for in section 2 of the Act of \n     June 14, 1966 (80 Stat. 200), as amended by section 6 of the \n     Act of September 7, 1966 (80 Stat. 707).''\n       2. At the end of section 6, insert the following new \n     sentence: ``The rate that the District shall pay the \n     Secretary for such reserved power shall continue to reflect \n     full recovery of Bonneville Power Administration transmission \n     costs.''\n       3. In Section 11(a), delete the sentence that read: ``After \n     transfer of title, any future Reclamation benefits received \n     pursuant to chapter 1093 of the Reclamation Act of June 17, \n     1902 (32 Stat. 388), and Acts supplementary thereto or \n     amendatory thereof, other than as provided herein, shall be \n     subject to approval by Congress.''\n       4. At the end of Section 11 insert the following new \n     subsection (c):\n       ``(c) Deauthorization.--Effective upon the transfer of \n     title to the District under this section, that portion of the \n     Oroville-Tonasket Unit Extension, Okanogan-Similkameen \n     Division, Chief Joseph Dam Project, Washington referred to in \n     Section 7(a) as the Project Irrigation Works is hereby \n     deauthorized. After transfer of title, the District shall not \n     be entitled to receive any further Reclamation benefits \n     pursuant to the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, and Acts\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\n     supplementary thereto or amendatory thereof.''\n       5. Add in the Committee report language:\n       ``It is the understanding of the Committee regarding this \n     legislation that the amount of Oroville-Tonasket Project \n     irrigation assistance that the Bonneville Power \n     Administration will repay is not expected to exceed \n     $75,000,000, and that repayment is now scheduled to be made \n     in the year 2042.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 403. A bill to expand the definition of limited tax benefit for \npurposes of the Line Item Veto Act; to the Committee on the Budget and \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order \nof August 4, 1977, as modified by the order of April 11, 1986, with \ninstructions that if one committee reports, the other committee have 30 \ndays to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                  THE EXPANSION OF LINE-ITEM VETO ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nexpand the Line-Item Veto Act to cover one of the largest and fastest \ngrowing areas of the Federal budget, tax expenditures. I am especially \npleased to be joined in offering this legislation by my good friend, \nCongressman Tom Barrett of Milwaukee who is spearheading this \nlegislation in the other body. Both bills expand the Line-Item Veto Act \nwhich took effect this past January and will remain in force for the \nnext 8 years.\n  Mr. President, both Congressman Barrett and I supported the new Line-\nItem Veto Act that was signed into law last session. Though it isn't \nthe whole answer to our deficit problem, I very much hope it will be \npart of the answer.\n  However, the new Line-Item Veto Act failed to address one of the \nlargest and fastest growing areas of Federal spending--the spending \ndone through the Tax Code, often called tax expenditures.\n  According to the Senate Budget Committee's most recent committee \nprint on tax expenditures, prepared by the Congressional Research \nService, we will spend nearly half a trillion dollars on tax \nexpenditures during the current fiscal year. Citizens for Tax Justice \nestimates that over the next 7 years, we will spend $3.7 trillion on \ntax expenditures, and sometime in the next 2 to 3 years, the total \namount spent on tax expenditures will actually surpass the total \ndiscretionary budget of the United States.\n  Mr. President, despite making up a huge and growing portion of the \nFederal budget, tax expenditures are beyond the reach of the new \nPresidential line-item veto authority. As currently structured, that \nauthority only extends to so-called limited tax benefits, defined in \npart to be a tax expenditure that benefits 100 or fewer taxpayers. As \nlong as the tax attorneys can find 101st taxpayers who benefit from the \nproposed tax expenditure, it is beyond the reach of the new \nPresidential authority.\n  Mr. President, it may not even be necessary for the tax attorneys to \nfind that 101st taxpayer. If a tax expenditure gives equal treatment to \nall persons in the same industry or engaged in the same type of \nactivity, it is exempt from the new Presidential authority no matter \nhow narrow the special interest spending.\n  Further, if all persons owning the same type of property, or issuing \nthe same type of investment, receive the same treatment from a tax \nexpenditure, that tax expenditure is similarly outside the scope of the \nPresident's new authority.\n  Mr. President, there are still more exceptions that make it even \nharder for a President to trim unnecessary spending done through the \ntax code. For example, if any difference in the treatment of persons by \na new tax expenditure is based solely on the size or form of the \nbusiness or association involved, or, in the case of individuals, \ngeneral demographic conditions, then the new spending cannot be touched \nby the President except as part of a veto of the entire piece of \nlegislation which contains the new spending.\n\n  By contrast, we find none of these elaborate restrictions on the new \nline item veto authority for spending done through the appropriations \nprocess or through entitlements. The new Presidential authority is \nhandcuffed only for spending done through the Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, this raises several problems.\n  First, and foremost, it shields an enormous portion of the Federal \nbudget from this new tool to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending. If \nthe authority established by the Line-Item Veto Act is to have meaning, \nit cannot be preempted from being used to scrutinize this much \nspending.\n  A second problem raised by the inability of the new Presidential \nauthority to address new tax expenditures is that it creates an \nenormous loophole through which questionable spending can escape. We \nhave already seen discussions of how special interest spending can be \ncrafted to avoid the new Presidential authority. While the current \nLine-Item Veto Act power given the President formally covers \ndiscretionary spending and new entitlement authority, a special \ninterest intent on enacting its pork barrel spending could readily do \nso by avoiding the discretionary or entitlement formats, and instead \ntransform their pork into a tax expenditure. As we know from the \nelaborate limits placed on the President's ability to apply the new \nauthority to spending through the Tax Code, most special interest pork \nthat takes the form of a tax break is beyond the reach of the Line-Item \nVeto Act.\n  Mr. President, no matter how powerful this new authority is with \nregard to discretionary spending and entitlement authority, it is \nvirtually useless against tax expenditures, and thus invites special \ninterests to use this avenue to deliver pork.\n  A further problem with the lack of adequate Presidential review in \nthis area is the very real potential for inequities in the \nimplementation of the new Line-Item Veto Act authority. These \ninequities arise in part from the progressive structure of marginal tax \nrates--as income rises, higher tax rates are applied. In turn, this \nmeans that many tax expenditures are worth more to those in the higher \nincome tax brackets than they are to families with lower incomes.\n  In some instances, tax expenditures provide no benefit at all to \nindividuals with lower incomes.\n  This is not the case with entitlement and discretionary spending \nprograms--both areas covered by the Line-Item Veto Act. The benefits of \nthose programs often are targeted to those with lower income.\n  The net effect is that the scope of the current Line-Item Veto Act \ncovers programs that often benefit those with low and moderate income, \nwhile it is powerless with regard to programs that often benefit \nindividuals and corporations with higher incomes.\n  Mr. President, tax expenditures have another feature that makes it \nespecially important that we extend the new Line-Item Veto Act to cover \nthem, namely their status as a kind of super entitlement. Once enacted, \na tax expenditure continues to spend money without any additional \nauthorization or appropriation, and without any regular review. In \nfact, while even funding for entitlements like Medicare or Medicaid can \nbe suspended in rare instances such as a Government shut-down, funding \nfor a tax expenditure is never interrupted.\n  Tax expenditures enjoy a status that is far above any other kind of \ngovernment spending, and as such, it should receive special scrutiny. \nExtending the Line-Item Veto Act to cover them will provide some of \nthat needed review.\n  Mr. President, as I have noted, tax expenditures make up a huge \nportion of the budget. They will soon exceed the entire Federal \ndiscretionary budget. Citizens for Tax Justice reports that if all \ncurrent tax expenditures were suddenly repealed, the deficit could be \neliminated and income tax rates could be reduced across the board by \nabout 25 percent.\n  Clearly, tax expenditures have an enormous impact on the deficit, and \nwe need to pursue two tracks with regard to them. First, we must cut \nsome of the nearly half a trillion dollars in existing spending done \nthrough the tax code. Any balanced plan to eliminate the deficit over \nthe next few years must contain cuts to spending in this area.\n  And second, with so much of our budget already dedicated to this kind \nof spending, we must bring tax expenditures under the Line-Item Veto \nAct and give the President the authority to act on new spending in this \narea as he does in other areas.\n  Our legislation does just that by eliminating the highly restrictive \nlanguage with respect to tax expenditures.\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\n  Mr. President, as with the recently enacted Line-Item Veto Act \nitself, this bill to extend that new authority is not the whole answer \nto our deficit problems, but it can be part of the answer, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this effort to put teeth into the new \nPresidential authority with respect to the tax expenditure portion of \nthe Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 403\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify the budget process to provide for separate \nbudget treatment of the dedicated tax revenues deposited in the Highway \nTrust Fund; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nas modified by the order of April 11, 1986, with instructions that if \none committee reports, the other committee have 30 days to report or be \ndischarged.\n\n\n                HIGHWAY TRUST FUND INTEGRITY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure, along \nwith my dear friend and colleague, the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator John Chafee, entitled the Highway Trust \nFund Integrity Act of 1997. Our cosponsors are Senators Nickles, \nCochran, and Gregg.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of us understand that transportation and \nhighway funding is critical to our individual States and the entire \nNation. Good highways link our communities, towns, and cities with \nmarkets. They link our constituents with their schools, hospitals, \nchurches, and jobs.\n  An effective transportation system should move us into the 21st \ncentury. Back in 1956, the Federal Highway Trust Fund was established \nas a way to finance the Federal Aid Highway Program. This was to be a \ndedicated trust fund, supported by direct user fees and taxes. It was \ncalled a trust fund because once the money went in, we were supposed to \nbe able to trust that that money would come back out for use on our \nroads, highways, and bridges.\n  However, the 1990 Budget Act eliminated the linkage between the \nrevenues raised by the user taxes and the spending from the \ntransportation fund. We know now that what we promised ourselves and \nour constituents, that the highway trust fund user taxes would be \ndeposited and the trust fund would be used for highways, has not been \nobserved. We see now an illogical process that allows highway trust \nfund dollars not to be spent in order to permit spending more in other \ncategories. I believe that is wrong. My constituents are telling me \nthis is wrong and they have challenged me to find a solution. I believe \nwe have come up with that solution.\n  Let me explain, briefly, Mr. President, what the bill is: First, it \nis a budget bill, not a tax bill or an ISTEA highway authorization \nbill. This bill would ensure that the highway trust fund dollars are \nspent for the purposes for which they were intended and that it would \nbe deficit neutral. The bill would reestablish the link between the \nhighway trust fund taxes and highway spending by transferring the taxes \nand the spending to a new budget category--a revenue constrained fund--\nthat is part of the unified budget. This new category would have its \nown budget rules to ensure that highway programs were fully funded and \ndeficit neutral. This bill would restore the trust to the trust fund \nbecause highway spending would equal the highway trust fund taxes \ncollected the prior year. It is consistent with achieving a balanced \nbudget because it comes with its own built-in cap--the revenue received \nfrom the highway trust fund. It does not take the highway trust fund \noff-budget, but it also does not attempt to spend the balances that \nhave accumulated or the interest on those balances. We do not attempt \nto resolve the arguments of the past. Instead we have focused on \ndeveloping a workable process for the future.\n\n  I do not believe that the status quo is sustainable, primarily for \ntwo reasons.\n  First, our country has tremendous infrastructure needs. Take my State \nof Missouri alone. A recent report by the Road Information Program \nstated that Missouri has the seventh highest percentage of structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete bridges in the country, and that \nmore than half of its major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and \nin need of improvement. My State has the third highest percentage of \nurban freeway congestion in the Nation, and highway fatalities in \nMissouri have increased by 17 percent since 1993. These statistics will \ncontinue to grow as vehicle travel continues to grow and the \ninfrastructure crumbles.\n  Second, I know that my constituents, and I would say the American \npublic, will not continue to support a process that sentences \ntransportation spending to compete with other discretionary programs \ndespite its unique dedicated funding source.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to take much more time, but there is one \nmore issue I would like to address. Senator Chafee and I have focused \non the highway account of the highway trust fund. The bill we are \nintroducing today does not address the mass transit account of the \nhighway trust fund. It is not included due to some concern transit \nadvocates have expressed--not in regards to the budget process being \nproposed, but over the level of funding that transit receives. I \nbelieve it is important that a workable solution be found for transit \nand I am committed to working with the Banking Committee, which has \njurisdiction for the transit programs, and transit advocates in \ndeveloping a proposal.\n  I want to thank my dear friend Senator Chafee for his leadership in \nthe area of transportation. We will have ample opportunity to continue \nour work together as the reauthorization of ISTEA progresses. Senator \nChafee has heard me 100 times stress the need for a formula change so I \nwill not get into that one today. I do however want to thank him and \nhis staff for their help on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, let me close by saying that this bill is the basis for \na transportation funding policy for the future--a starting point for a \nfairer, more forward-looking transportation funding policy. I hope my \ncolleagues will join us and cosponsor this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Summary of Highway Trust Fund Integrity Act of 1997\n\n\n                                general\n\n       Keeps the Highway Trust Fund on-budget, as part of the \n     unified Federal budget.\n       Reestablishes the linkage between Highway Trust Fund taxes \n     and spending that was lost when the Budget Enforcement Act of \n     1990 split the Federal budget process into two categories.\n       Consistent with achieving a balanced Federal budget by \n     2002.\n       Increases funding to meet our nation's substantial \n     transportation needs.\n       Creates a new budget category that reflects the unique, \n     revenue-constrained nature of the HTF. This new category, \n     called a Revenue Constrained Fund (RCF) would have its own \n     budget rules to ensure that transportation programs are \n     fully-funded but deficit neutral.\n\n\n                    revenue constrained funds (rcf)\n\n       The new RCF budget category would be a separate category, \n     and would not be a subset of either the mandatory budget \n     category or discretionary spending category.\n       Under the RCF proposal, the spending from Revenue \n     Constrained Funds would be equal to the amount of tax \n     receipts collected for the prior year. Spending would be \n     limited to tax receipts in the prior year to ensure that \n     Highway Trust Fund spending would never exceed actual \n     receipts.\n\n\n        example of problem under current federal budget process\n\n       One would expect that increased Highway Trust Fund taxes \n     would make room in the\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\n     budget for increased transportation spending. Unfortunately, \n     this is not the case.\n       Under the current rules, gas tax increases do make room in \n     the budget for additional spending, but not for increased \n     transportation spending. Under the current rules, the only \n     way to fund the highway trust fund program at the level of \n     Highway Trust Fund tax receipts is by cutting other \n     discretionary programs. We must reform the Federal budget \n     process to correct this illogical outcome.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nMissouri for his prime work on this piece of legislation. The money \nthat goes into the highway trust fund this year will go out for \ntransportation purposes next year, and I believe that is the right way \nto do things. It has varied from some of the other proposals that have \nbeen put in which provide that the accumulated interest of the \naccumulated principle of the fund be spent. We don't do that. We \nprovide that what came in last year through taxes will go out the \nfollowing year for transportation purposes.\n  Mr. President, today I join as a cosponsor of the Highway Trust Fund \nIntegrity Act of 1997. This legislation, sponsored by my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, and cosponsored by Senators Nickles, Cochran \nand Gregg, reestablishes the link between highway trust fund taxes and \ntransportation spending.\n  I believe that our proposal represents a reasonable and responsible \nsolution to a problem that faces the Congress as it considers the \nreauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct.\n  I hope that this bill will serve as a starting point for further \ndiscussions with my colleagues, especially my colleagues from the \nBudget and Appropriations committees. I recognize that proposals that \nmodify the budget process are by their nature, controversial, and upset \nthe status quo. However, I think change is necessary and the status quo \nis no longer an acceptable outcome.\n\n\n                              The Problem\n\n  As most of you are aware, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 split \nthe Federal Budget process into two categories, one for receipts and \nmandatory spending and the other for discretionary spending. highway \ntrust fund taxes, like other revenues, are in the mandatory category, \nbut almost all highway spending falls within the discretionary \ncategory. Each budget category has its own rules, procedures, and \nincentives. Because the highway trust fund is split between these two \ncategories, different parts of the highway trust fund are subject to \ndifferent budget rules, and the link between the highway trust fund \ntaxes and transportation spending is severed.\n  Let me give an example of the problem the current situation causes. \nOne would expect that increased highway trust fund taxes would make \nroom in the budget for increased transportation spending. \nUnfortunately, this is not the case. Under the current rules, gas tax \nincreases do make room in the budget for additional spending, but not \nfor increased transportation spending. Under the current law, the only \nway to fund transportation programs at the level of highway trust fund \ntax receipts is by cutting other discretionary programs, such as law \nenforcement and education. We must reform the Federal budget process to \ncorrect this illogical outcome.\n\n\n                              The Solution\n\n  Our proposal reestablishes the connection between highway trust fund \ntaxes and transportation spending by putting the highway trust fund \ntaxes and spending in the same budget category. ``The Highway Trust \nFund Integrity Act of 1997\" transfers all of the highway trust fund \nreceipts and outlays into a new budget category that reflects the \nunique, revenue-constrained nature of the highway trust fund. This new \ncategory, called the revenue constrained fund, would have its own \nbudget rules to ensure that transportation programs are fully-funded \nbut deficit neutral.\n\n  Under this proposal, spending from the highway trust fund would be \nequal to the highway trust fund tax receipts collected for the prior \nyear. Spending would be limited to tax receipts in the prior year to \nguarantee that highway trust fund spending would never exceed actual \nreceipts. If tax receipts into the highway trust fund are less than \nexpected, transportation spending would be constrained, making the \ntrust fund deficit-neutral.\n  This bill does not create a new entitlement program. highway trust \nfund spending would be strictly limited by the amount of taxes \ndeposited in the prior year thereby ensuring that the highway trust \nfund will be deficit neutral. Other entitlement programs do not have \nthis guarantee.\n\n\n                          Trust Fund Balances\n\n  One of the questions that has been raised regarding our proposal is \nhow it treats the balances that now exist in the highway trust fund. \nOur proposal does not specifically address the status of the balances \nthat now exist in the highway trust fund. In developing this proposal, \nwe have attempted to focus on establishing a workable process for the \nfuture that reestablishes the connection between the highway trust fund \ntaxes and transportation spending. We think we can develop a broad \nconsensus on a proposal to spend the taxes deposited into the highway \ntrust fund going forward. Such a broad consensus is not possible \nregarding the balances that now exist in the highway trust fund. There \nis significant disagreement about the validity of spending those \nbalances, and our bill does not attempt to resolve this disagreement.\n\n\n                       Congressional Jurisdiction\n\n  Another question that has been raised about our proposal is how this \nproposal would change the jurisdiction of the various committees in the \nCongress over the highway trust fund. Our bill does not change the \njurisdiction among Congressional committees. It is our intention that \nall of the committees involved in setting transportation policy would \ncontinue to provide policy input and oversight for those areas \ncurrently under their jurisdiction.\n  The tax committees would continue to play their role in setting tax \nrates of the highway trust fund; the authorizing committees would \ncontinue to play their role, including determining the program \nstructure and distribution formulas for the formula grant programs, and \nthe appropriations committees would continue to provide oversight and \nmake decisions about the programs under their control.\n  Under our proposal, the total amount of highway trust fund spending \nwould be determined by the American people who pay the taxes deposited \ninto the trust fund. Neither the authorizing committees nor the \nappropriations committees would determine the total level of spending.\n\n\n                                Transit\n\n  In developing this legislation, we have focused on the programs and \nspending of the Highway Account of the highway trust tund. The highway \naccount programs are under the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, the committee for which I serve as \nchairman. The bill we introduce today only addresses the highway \naccount of the trust fund; it does not address the Mass Transit \nAccount.\n  However, as part of the ISTEA reauthorization, I believe a similar \nproposal should be developed for the transit account of the highway \ntust Fund. Senator Bond and I plan to work with transit advocates and \nmembers of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over transit \nprograms, to craft such a proposal.\n  The Highway Trust Fund Integrity Act of 1997 is a forward looking \nbill. It is consistent with achieving a balanced Federal budget by \n2002. It does not take the highway trust fund off-budget, but it does \naddress concerns that the bond between transportation taxes and \ntransportation spending has been broken.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Abraham, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 405. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the research credit and to allow greater opportunity \nto elect the alternative incremental credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\nthe research and experimentation credit permanent extension act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce a bill to \nmake\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\nthe current tax credit for increasing research activities permanent \nwith my friend and colleague Max Baucus. We are also joined by Senators \nD'Amato, Abraham, Boxer, Bingaman, Moseley-Braun, Dorgan, Murray, \nDeWine, Conrad, Rockefeller. Companion legislation will be introduced \ntoday by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Robert Matsui in the House. \nThe Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 temporarily extended this \ntax credit until May 31, 1997, when it is set to expire.\n  As the United States is shifting from an industrial based economy to \nan information and technology based economy, conducting research for \ntomorrow's products and methods is increasing in importance. In 1981, \nthe Reagan administration and the Congress recognized this need, and \nthe credit for increasing research and experimentation [R] activities \nwas first enacted. Unfortunately, the credit has been victim to \nrepeated short term extensions that included a break in the \navailability of the credit.\n  Mr. President, this nation is the world's undisputed leader in \ntechnological innovation. American know-how has given our Nation \nbenefits undreamed of a few years ago. Research and development by U.S. \ncompanies has led the way in delivering these benefits, which enhance \nU.S. competitiveness as well as the quality of life for everyone. And, \nas the pace of change in our world quickens, the role of research has \ntaken on increased importance. Today, the credit is needed more than \never to keep up with our changing world.\n  The R credit has played a key role in placing the United States \nahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. \nStudies of the credit indicate that the marginal effect of $1 of the \nR credit stimulates approximately $1 of additional private research \nand development spending over the short-run, and as much as $2 of extra \ninvestment in research over the long-run.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of the R credit, though certainly very \nsignificant, have been limited by the fact that the credit has been \ntemporary. In many fields, particularly pharmaceuticals and \nbiotechnology, there are relatively long periods of development. The \nmore uncertain the long-term future of the R credit is, the smaller \nthe potential of the credit to stimulate increased research. This only \nmakes sense, Mr. President. U.S. companies are managed by prudent \nbusiness men and women. They evaluate their research and development \ninvestments by comparing the present value of the expected cash flow \nfrom the research over the life of the investment with the initial cash \noutlay. These estimates take into account the potential availability of \ntax credits. However, because of the uncertainty of a tax credit that \nhas been allowed to continually expire, many decision makers do not \ncount on the R credit as being available in the long-run. This, of \ncourse, means that fewer research projects will meet the threshold of \nviability and results in fewer dollars being spent on research in this \ncountry.\n\n  In the business community, the development of new products, \ntechnologies, drugs, and ideas can result in either success or failure. \nInvestments carry a risk. If a project has a high risk of failure, the \nR tax credit will help ease the cost of taking the chance to find the \ncure for killer diseases such as cancer, to build the next microchip, \nor the next generation of heart monitoring equipment that can save \nlives. If the project becomes a success, resulting in a new drug that \ncan cure a disease or a new breakthrough technology, then what happens? \nAdditional investment is made, workers are hired, new jobs are created \nand many Americans benefit from the initial research and \nexperimentation. In this way, all Americans can benefit from the R \ntax credit.\n  Mr. President, a small investment in R today produces dividends and \nrewards tomorrow. This tax credit is a credit for investment, for \neconomic growth, and for creating new jobs. What if we don't act? As \nthe Peat Marwick study confirms, the benefits of the R tax credit \nreach into the future. Failure to extend the credit beyond May 31, \n1997, will weaken our Nation's ability to stay competitive in the \nfuture.\n  It is important to note that while U.S. investment in research and \ndevelopment has generally grown since 1970, our international \ncompetitors have not stood still. Other nations, such as Japan and \nGermany are constantly knocking at the door trying to build the better \ncar, the faster computer, or a more effective drug. Uncertainty, about \nthe future of the credit will make firms hesitant to make long-term \ncommitments and investments in the critical long-term research projects \nthat really are the source of the breakthrough drugs and the new \ntechnologies. In fact, United States non-defense R, as a percentage \nof gross domestic product [GDP], has been relatively flat since 1985, \nwhile Japan's and Germany's have grown.\n  Unlike a few years ago, it is now not always necessary for U.S. firms \nto perform their research activities within the boundaries of the \nUnited States. As more nations have joined the United States as high \ntech manufacturing centers, with educated work forces, multinational \ncompanies have found that moving manufacturing functions overseas is \nsometimes necessary to stay competitive. The same is often true with \nbasic research activities. In fact, some of our major trading partners \nnow provide generous tax incentives for research and development \nconducted in those nations. These incentives are more attractive than \nthe R credit the United States provides, particularly when the \ntemporary nature of our credit is considered. Therefore, Mr. President, \nwe are at risk of having some of the R spending in the United States \ntransferred overseas if we do not keep competitive.\n  President Clinton, when campaigning for the Presidency in 1992, \nrecognized the importance of stimulating private R investment and \ncalled for a permanent R credit. The 1993 tax bill had a 3-year \nextension. Last year, we extended the credit for only 1 year because of \nrevenue constraints in the small business bill. The President's fiscal \nyear 1998 budget contains another 1-year extension. These proposals for \nextensions are well and good, Mr. President, but they do nothing to \ngive stability to risky, long-term research and experimentation \ninvestments. The certainty of the availability of the tax credit is now \nalmost as important as the credit itself. It might well make the \ndifference between a decision to undertake an expensive multiyear \nresearch project and a decision to forego such research.\n\n  I hope this year we can put our support behind investment in research \nand make this credit permanent.\n  Mr. President, my home State of Utah is home to a large number of \ninnovative companies who invest a high percentage of their revenue in \nresearch and development activities. For example, between Salt Lake \nCity and Provo lies the world's biggest stretch of software and \ncomputer engineering firms. This area, which was named ``Software \nValley'' by Business Week, is second only to California's Silicon \nValley as a thriving high technology commercial area.\n  In addition, Utah is home to about 700 biotechnology and biomedical \nfirms that employ nearly 9,000 workers. These companies were conceived \nin research and development and will not survive, much less grow, \nwithout continuously conducting R activities.\n  In all, Mr. President, there are approximately 80,000 employees \nworking in Utah's 1,400 plus and growing technology based companies. \nResearch and development is the lifeblood of these firms, and hundreds \nof thousands more throughout the Nation that are like them. A permanent \nand effective tax incentive to increase research is essential to the \nlong-term health of these businesses.\n  I am aware, Mr. President, that not every company that incurs R \nexpenditures in the United States can take advantage of the R credit. \nAs the credit matures and business cycles change, the current credit \ncan be out of reach for some companies. Thus, as part of the latest \nextension of the credit Congress enacted an elective alternative credit \nto broaden the reach of this incentive. However, Congress should \ncontinue to examine ways to improve it and to make the credit more \neffective in delivering incentives to increase R activity.\n  In the meantime, however, it is important that this Congress send a \nstrong signal that the current credit\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\nshould not be allowed to expire. I urge my colleagues to show their \nsupport for the concept of a permanent R credit by cosponsoring this \nlegislation and support the kind of research activities that will \nmaintain American leadership in the technological developments that \nwill lead us into the next century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \njoin with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and my other \ncolleagues Senators Abraham, Boxer, Bingaman, Conrad, D'Amato, DeWine, \nDorgan, Moseley-Braun, Murray, and Rockefeller to introduce this bill, \nwhich is so critical to the ability of American businesses to \neffectively compete in the global marketplace. Companion legislation \nhas been introduced in the House by Representatives Nancy Johnson and \nRobert Matsui.\n  Our Nation is the world's undisputed leader in technological \ninnovation, a position that would not be possible, absent U.S. \ncompanies' commitment to research and development. Investment in \nresearch is an investment in our Nation's economic future, and it is \nappropriate that both the public and private sector share the costs \ninvolved, as we share in the benefits. The credit provided through the \nTax Code for research expenses provided a modest but crucial incentive \nfor companies to conduct their research in the United States, thus \ncreating high-skilled, high-paying jobs to U.S. workers.\n  The R credit has played a key role in placing the United States \nahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. \nEvery dollar that the Federal Government spends on the R credit is \nmatched by another dollar of spending on research over the short run by \nprivate companies, and $2 of spending over the long run. Our global \ncompetitors are well aware of the importance of providing incentives \nfor research, and many provide more generous tax treatment for research \nand experimentation expenses than does the United States. As a result, \nwhile spending on nondefense R in the United States as a percentage \nof GDP has remained relatively flat since 1985, Japan's and Germany's \nhas grown.\n  The benefits of the credit, though certainly significant, have been \nlimited over the years by the fact that the credit has been temporary. \nIn addition to the numerous times that the credit has been allowed to \nlapse, last year, for the first time, when Congress extended the credit \nit left a gap of an entire year during which the credit was not \navailable. This unprecedented lapse sent a troubling signal to the U.S. \ncompanies and universities that have come to rely on the Government's \nlongstanding commitment to the credit.\n  Much research and development takes years to mature. The more \nuncertain the long-term future of the credit is, the smaller its \npotential to stimulate increased research. If companies evaluating \nresearch projects cannot rely on the seamless continuation of the \ncredit, they are less likely to invest on research in this country, \nless likely to put money into cutting-edge technological innovation \nthat is critical to keeping us in the forefront of global competition.\n  Our country is locked in a fierce battle for high-paying \ntechnological jobs in the global economy. As more nations succeed in \ncreating educationally advanced work forces and join the United States \nas high-technology manufacturing centers, they become more attractive \nto companies trying to penetrate foreign markets. Multinational \ncompanies sometimes find that moving both manufacturing and basic \nresearch activities overseas is necessary if they are to remain \ncompetitive. The uncertainty of the R credit factors into their \neconomic calculations, and makes keeping these jobs in the United \nStates more difficult.\n  Although the R credit is not exclusively used by high-technology \nfirms, they are certainly key beneficiaries of the credit. In my own \nState of Montana, 12 of every 1,000 private sector workers were \nemployed by high-technology firms in 1995, the most recent year for \nwhich statistics are available. Almost 400 establishments provided \nhigh-technology services, at an average wage of $34,500 per year. These \njobs paid 77 percent more than the average private sector wage in \nMontana of $19,500 per year. Many of these jobs would never have been \ncreated without the assistance of the R credit. Making the credit \npermanent would most certainly provide the incentive needed to create \nmany more in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and look forward to \nworking with them and with the administration to make the research and \nexperimentation tax credit permanent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Lieberman, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 406. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nclarification for the deductibility of expenses incurred by a taxpayer \nin connection with the business use of the home; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                 the home office deduction act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Home \nOffice Deduction Act of 1997. I am joined today by my friends and \ncolleagues, Senators Baucus, Allard, Bond, Lieberman, and Burns. This \nbill will clarify the definition of what is a ``principal place of \nbusiness'' for purposes of section 280A of the Internal Revenue Code, \nwhich allows a deduction for an office in the home.\n  This bill is designed to reverse the 1993 Supreme Court decision in \nCommissioner versus Soliman. When this decision was handed down, it \neffectively closed the door to legitimate home office deductions for \nhundreds of thousands of taxpayers. Moreover, the decision unfairly \npenalizes many small businesses simply because they operate from a home \nrather than from a store front, office building, or industrial park.\n  Mr. President, until the Soliman decision, small business owners and \nprofessionals who dedicate a space in their homes to use for business \nactivities were generally allowed to deduct the expenses of the home \noffice if they met the following conditions: First, the space in the \nhome was used solely and exclusively on a regular basis as an office; \nand second, the deduction claimed was not greater than the income \nearned by the business. Through the Soliman case, the Supreme Court has \nnarrowed significantly the availability of this deduction by requiring \nthat the home office be the principal business location of the \ntaxpayer. This requirement that the home office be the principal \nbusiness location has proven to be impossible to meet for many \ntaxpayers with legitimate home office expenses.\n  For example, under the Soliman decision, a self-employed plumber who \ngenerates business income by performing services in the homes of his \ncustomers would be denied a deduction for a home office. This is \nbecause, under the rules, his home office is not considered his \nprincipal place of business because the business income is generated in \nthe homes of the customers and not in his home office. This is the case \neven though the home office is where he receives telephone messages, \nkeeps his business records, plans his advertising, stores his tools and \nsupplies, and fills out Federal tax forms. In fact, having a full-time \nemployee in the office who keeps the books and sets up appointments \nwould still not result in a home office deduction for the plumber.\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\n  This is preposterous, Mr. President, and we need to correct it. My \nbill would rectify this result by allowing the home office to qualify \nas the principal place of business if the essential administrative or \nmanagement activities of the business are performed there.\n\n  The truly ironic effect of the Supreme Court's decision is that a \ntaxpayer who rents office space outside of the home is allowed a full \ndeduction, but one who tries to economize by working at home is \npenalized. This makes no sense to me.\n  The Home Office Deduction Act of 1997 is designed to restore the \ndeduction for home office expenses to pre-Soliman law. Rather than \nrequiring taxpayers to meet the new criteria set out by the Court, the \nbill allows a home office to meet the definition of a ``principal place \nof business'' if it is the location where the essential administrative \nor management activities are conducted on a regular and systematic \nbasis by the taxpayer. To avoid possible abuses, the bill requires that \nthe taxpayer have no other location for the performance of these \nessential administrative or management activities.\n  Mr. President, today's job market is rapidly changing. New \ntechnologies have been developed and continually improved that allow \ninstant communication around the once expansive globe. There is even \ntalk of virtual offices, which are equipped only with a telephone and a \nhookup for a portable computer. These mobile communications have \nrevolutionized the definition of the traditional office. No longer is \nthere a need to establish a business downtown. Employees are \ntelecommuting by facsmile, modem, and telephone. Today, both a husband \nand a wife could work without leaving their home and the attention of \ntheir children. In this new age, redefining the deduction for home \noffice expenses is vital. Our tax policy should not discriminate \nagainst home businesses simply because a taxpayer makes the choice, \noften based on economic or family considerations, to operate out of the \nhome.\n  In most cases, start-up businesses are very short on cash. Yet, for \nmany, ultimate success depends on the ability to hold out for just a \nfew more months. In these situations, even a relatively small tax \ndeduction for the expenses of the home office can make a critical \ndifference. It is important to note that some of America's fastest \ngrowing and most dynamic companies originated in the spare bedroom or \nthe garage of the founder. Our tax policies should support those who \ndare to take risks. Many of tomorrow's jobs will come from \nentrepreneurs who are struggling to survive in a home-based business.\n  Mr. President, the home office deduction is targeted at these small \nbusiness men and women, entrepreneurs, and independent contractors who \nhave no other place besides the home to perform the essential \nadministrative or management activities of the business. The Soliman \ndecision drastically reduced the effectiveness and fairness of this \ndeduction and must be reversed.\n  This legislation can also have an important effect on rural areas, \nsuch as in my home State of Utah. Many small business owners and \nprofessionals in the rural areas of Utah must spend a great deal of \ntime on the road, meeting clients, customers, or patients. It is likely \nthat many of my rural constituents will be unable to meet the \nrequirements for the home office deduction under the Soliman decision. \nMr. President, we must help these taxpayers, not hurt them, in their \nefforts to contribute to the economy and support their families.\n\n  The Home Office Deduction Act of 1997 not only has strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Congress, but also has the support of the following \norganizations: The Alliance of Independent Store Owners and \nProfessionals, the American Animal Hospital Association, the American \nSmall Business Association, the American Society of Media \nPhotographers, the American Society of Travel Agents, Americans for \nFinancial Security, the Bureau of Wholesale Sales Representatives, \nCommunicating for Agriculture, the Home Office & Business Opportunities \nAssociation of California, the Illinois Women's Economic Development \nSummit, the Manufacturers Agents National Association, the National \nAssociation for the Cottage Industry, the National Association of the \nSelf-Employed, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the \nNational Electrical Manufacturers Representatives Association, the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses, National Small Business \nUnited, the National Society of Public Accountants, the Promotional \nProducts Association International, the Small Business Legislative \nCouncil.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us as cosponsors of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 406\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Home Office Deduction Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF PRINCIPAL PLACE OF \n                   BUSINESS.\n\n       Section 280A(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) as \n     paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) Principal place of business.--For purposes of \n     subsection (c), a home office shall in any case qualify as \n     the principal place of business if--\n       ``(A) the office is the location where the taxpayer's \n     essential administrative or management activities are \n     conducted on a regular and systematic (and not incidental) \n     basis by the taxpayer, and\n       ``(B) the office is necessary because the taxpayer has no \n     other location for the performance of the essential \n     administrative or management activities of the business.''\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to taxable \n     years beginning after the December 31, 1996.\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \njoin with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, to introduce this \nimportant bill today. The Home Office Deduction Act of 1997 will \ncorrect a problem that has unfairly hurt thousands of small businesses \nin this country.\n  In 1993, the Supreme Court, in its Commissioner versus Soliman \ndecision, substantially narrowed the availability of the home office \ndeduction. Until the Soliman decision, small business owners and \nprofessionals who dedicated a space in their homes for business \nactivities were generally allowed to deduct the expenses of the home \noffice if the space was used solely and exclusively and on a regular \nbasis as an office, and the deduction was not greater than the income \nearned by the business.\n  In the Soliman case, the Supreme Court limited the credit to only \nthose persons who met with customers in the home office, or who \nconducted the primary business function in the home. This principal \nbusiness location requirement has proven to be impossible to meet for \nmany taxpayers with legitimate home office expenses.\n  the ironic effect of the Supreme Court's decision is that a taxpayer \nwho operates from a store front, an office building, or an office park \nis allowed a full deduction, but one who chooses to work at home is \npenalized. This ruling denies the home office deduction to self-\nemployed plumbers, home-care nurses, and other self-employed business \npeople who try to economize by working from their homes but cannot meet \nwith customers there due to the nature of their businesses.\n  Our bill is designed to restore the home office deduction to \nthousands of American men and women who work at home. Rather than \nrequiring taxpayer to meet the new criteria set out by the Court, the \nbill allows a home office to meet the definition of a principal place \nof business if it is the sole location where essential administrative \nor management activities are conducted on a regular and systematic \nbasis by the taxpayer. To avoid possible abuses, the bill requires that \nthe taxpayer have no other location for the performance of these \nactivities.\n  The job market in the United States is constantly changing. New \ntechnologies are helping to make the work-at-home option a practical \nreality, bringing all the benefits to society that home-based \nbusinesses can provide. Mothers and fathers, whether single or married, \nare more often choosing to work at home to be with their children. \nHaving a parent at home who can help\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nsupervise children while earning a living can have a tremendous \npositive effect on the well-being of our families and of society.\n  Restoration of the home office deduction was one of the most \nimportant recommendations to come out of the June 1995 White House \nConference on Small Business. Some of America's fastest growing and \nmost dynamic companies originated in the spare bedroom or the garage of \nthe founder. To foster continued economic growth and to encourage \nAmericans to start their own business ventures, we need to pass \nlegislation that will put home-based businesses on an equal footing \nwith other enterprises.\n  I urge my colleagues and the administration to support this \nlegislation, and look forward to seeing it enacted in the 105th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 407.

Mr. President. I introduce legislation designed to \nclarify the authority of the FCC to authorize foreign investment in \nUnited States broadcast and common carrier radio licenses. Joining me \ntoday, is Chairman Burns of the Subcommittee on Communications.\n  Mr. President, American companies and consumers worldwide will \nbenefit tremendously from the passage of this legislation. No one can \ndeny that U.S. telecommunications services providers ability to compete \nin the global market is hampered by the restrictions that we place upon \nforeign companies seeking to do business here. The problem is quite \nsimple: the more restrictive the foreign ownership rules are here in \nthe U.S., the more oppressive are the regulations that are placed on \nUnited States companies in other countries. The solution is just as \nsimple: the greater the willingness by the United States to permit \nforeign ownership of U.S. companies, the greater the success of the \nU.S. companies wishing to maximize their ownership opportunities \noverseas.\n  This bill accomplishes just that by amending section 310(b) to: \nFirst, remove the statutory limitation on foreign indirect investment \nin U.S. corporations holding common carrier or aeronautical radio \nlicenses (but not broadcast licenses); second, allow foreign direct \ninvestment greater than 20 percent in U.S. corporations holding common \ncarrier or aeronautical radio licenses, if the FCC finds it in the \npublic interest; third, explicitly prohibit any corporation with more \nthan 20 percent foreign government ownership from holding common \ncarrier, aeronautical or broadcast licenses.\n  It is clear that lowering barriers to foreign ownership in this \ncountry will result in greater opportunities for U.S. service providers \noverseas. The ripple effect on the U.S. telecommunications industry as \na whole would increase the benefits across the board from consumers to \nmanufacturers to service providers. The only way for the United States \nto effectively lead the world in establishing an expansive global \nmarketplace is to set the standard in this country by which U.S. \ncompanies want to be measured overseas. Liberalizing foreign ownership \nrestrictions under 310(b) would send that message to our foreign \npartners loud and clear.\n  That is why I am introducing this bill, and I encourage my colleagues \nto join me and support the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish sources of funding for certain \ntransportation infrastructure projects in the vicinity of the border \nbetween the United States and Mexico that are necessary to accommodate \nincreased traffic resulting from the implementation of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, including construction of new Federal \nborder crossing facilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  the border infrastructure, safety and congestion relief act of 1997\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, Senator Bingaman and I are \nintroducing the Border Infrastructure, Safety and Congestion Relief Act \nof 1997, legislation to authorize assistance for States along the U.S.-\nMexico border which must cope with the increased demands on roads and \nother public infrastructure that result from expanded international \ntrade. Our bill is also\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\nbeing introduced in the House of Representatives by my good friend, \nRepresentative Bob Filner.\n  Last week, in a hearing before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee on ISTEA, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater noted that \nsince the passage of NAFTA, ``we have seen a tremendous growth in \ntrade. To make the most of these opportunities, we are proposing a new \nprogram to help improve our border crossings and major trade \ncorridors--programs that will facilitate our domestic and international \ntrade * * *.''\n  Secretary Slater is right: NAFTA has greatly increased trade across \nour borders. If we all work together to fix our border crossings, \nincreased trade offers great opportunities for the entire nation. If we \ndo not, then NAFTA will act as an unfunded mandate that forces \nCalifornia and other border States to support other States' trade \nroutes.\n  The Administration is proposing a border crossing and trade corridors \ngrant program to improve traffic efficiency at border crossings, to be \nfunded at $45 million a year. All border States north and south would \nbe eligible.\n  As I told Secretary Slater at last week's hearing, I believe that the \nproposal, while a good step forward, is too limited for our border \nneeds. Forty-five million across 14 States is simply not enough to \naddress these crucial infrastructure problems.\n  The Administration also wants to establish a new innovative financing \nprogram that would provide loans and credit assistance for large \nprojects in the national interest--another good proposal, but one \nwhich, in my opinion, does not go far enough.\n  The Boxer-Bingaman-Filner bill provides a two-stage system for \nFederal assistance to fund the States' top-priority border \ninfrastructure projects:\n  First, it authorizes appropriation of $125 million each year in 1998 \nthrough 2001--a total of $500 million--for a border infrastructure fund \nto provide Federal grants to border States and local governments in \norder to pay for new or upgraded connections to the regional and \nnational road network. The bill also allows up to $10 million to be \ntransferred from the fund to Federal law enforcement agencies to use \nfor their own infrastructure improvements, such as border patrol roads \nand lighting.\n\n  Second, our bill would authorize appropriations of $100 million to \nprovide a Federal guarantee for loans made by border State \ninfrastructure banks [SIBS] or border authorities for high cost \nprojects such as toll roads that bring in revenue to the States. \nFederal guarantees will support up to $1 billion in State loans.\n  For California, this could mean up to $50 million in Federal \nguarantees, leveraging up to $500 million in loans. California is one \nof 10 States designated last year by the Secretary of Transportation to \nparticipate in this innovative new method of financing transportation \nprojects.\n  Third, the bill authorizes Federal loan guarantees for border \nrailroads, which could modernize and complete the San Diego and Arizona \nEastern railway. This section would provide $10 million a year for 4 \nyears for a total of $40 million in Federal funds to help railroads \nobtain low-interest private loans they might otherwise not get.\n  Finally, our bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit \nan annual report to Congress on the volume of commercial traffic that \nis crossing the United States-Mexico border, and the level of \ninternational commercial vehicle safety violations. This report will \nhelp us gauge the effectiveness of the Federal response to trade \ndemands on infrastructure in the border region.\n  Mr. President, since the entire Nation benefits from international \ntrade, I believe the Federal Government has a responsibility to help \npay for the improvements in roads and other infrastructure that make \nthat trade possible. Our bill will ensure that we begin to meet that \nFederal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Infrastructure Safety \n     and Congestion Relief Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, all \n     4 States along the United States-Mexico border will require \n     significant investments in highway infrastructure capacity \n     and motor carrier safety enforcement at a time when border \n     States face extreme difficulty in meeting current highway \n     funding needs;\n       (2) the full benefits of increased international trade can \n     be realized only if delays at the borders are significantly \n     reduced; and\n       (3) Federal receipts from United States customs duties and \n     fees are estimated to increase by an average of $800,000,000 \n     annually in fiscal years 1998 through 2001, and these monies \n     are an appropriate source of funding for programs designed to \n     address the infrastructure needs of border States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I chose to vote against the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, like I have in the past.\n  Many good arguments were made throughout the debate against amending \nthe Constitution of the United States to require a yearly balanced \nFederal budget. In fact, the Senate voted 14 times on amendments to \nimprove the underlying resolution, in the hope of revealing its \nshortsightedness. In every instance, I supported my colleagues. I \nbelieve we were successful in painting a clear and honest picture of \nthe disastrous effects such an amendment could have on the economic and \nsocial fabric of this country.\n  This debate is about our Nation's spending priorities as much as it \nis about constitutional integrity. During the course of debate, I \noffered an amendment that would have made it a policy of the United \nStates that in meeting the requirements of an annual balanced budget no \ncuts would be made that disproportionately affect children's programs \nin the areas of health care, nutrition, and education. Look at the \nevidence.\n  In the 104th Congress, dramatic cuts were made to programs for low-\nincome families. According to the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, more than 93 percent of the cuts in entitlement programs \ncame from programs for low-income people. Congress reduced entitlement \nprograms by $65.6 billion over the period from 1996 to 2002. In a \nletter of opposition to the BBA, the Women Legislator's Lobby, a group \nthat speaks for women legislators across the country, pointed out to \nSenators that in 1997 the Federal Government spent four times more on \nthe military than on housing, education, job training, and community \ndevelopment combined.\n  The people of Minnesota sent me to Washington to make tough, \nresponsible, fair decisions. Amending the Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget would put a legally binding dollar target above the \neconomic and social health of our country. Our goal of achieving fiscal \nresponsibility should appropriately focus on critical investments in \nprograms that provide basic nutrition, housing, health care, and \neducation to those less fortunate, especially children.\n  Our fixation with a constitutional amendment and our hunger for \npolitical gain have detracted from that important task. I will continue \nto press forward on finding a fair and equitable way to balance the \nbudget because I think it is important to our country's future. \nAmending the Constitution in this way is not the answer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1999-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WILSON K. SMITH\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, while on a field trip to a Civil War \nsite in the 1950's, a young African-American boy from Delaware asked \nhis teacher why there was no mention of black soldiers. He learned a \ncold, hard lesson that day--that even though black soldiers fought and \ndied for their country, they were not honored because of the color of \ntheir skin.\n  That field trip ignited what would become a 40-year crusade by a \nDelawarean named Wilson K. Smith. Mr. Smith is a retired Army Sergeant, \nwho was decorated with a Bronze Star and Silver Star during the Vietnam \nwar as a member of the 101st Airborne Division, First Special Forces. \nIn 1957, Sgt. Smith began collecting war stories from black veterans. \nBy 1979, he had tracked down all the African-American Congressional \nMedal of Honor recipients. In 1989, he began seeking financial pledges \nand support to build an African-American Medal of Honor monument.\n  I am proud to have worked closely with Mr. Smith over the last 5 \nyears to see the realization of his dream.\n  Last month, the names of the 85 African-American Medal of Honor \nrecipients were officially recognized in a permanent exhibit at the \nPentagon. This exhibit replicates a monument honoring black Medal of \nHonor recipients now on permanent display at Morgan State University in \nBaltimore, MD. Mr. Smith was the driving force behind the design and \nfundraising for this monument.\n  This monument will help keep the legacy of the African-American \nCongressional Medal of Honor recipients alive for generations to come. \nNever again will young African-American school boys and girls have to \nwonder why black veterans are not honored for their service and \nsacrifice to the United States of America.\n  The Medal of Honor is the highest award for bravery in military \nservice to our country, but few are aware of the names, faces and \nstories of heroism of the Medal of Honor recipients. These are truly \ninspiring Americans, who continue to serve this country by their \nexamples of courage, patriotism, and selfless dedication above and \nbeyond the call of duty. From the Civil War to the World Wars to \nVietnam to the Persian Gulf war, they have been the outstanding \ndefenders of liberty, the highest hope of humanity in struggle, and the \ntruest representatives of human strength. A memorial to bring that \ninspiration to African-Americans and to all of us, is a most worthy \nendeavor.\n  It truly has been my honor and pleasure to have strongly supported \nWilson Smith's crusade, along with many other national and State \nleaders, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Colin Powell. Wilson Smith is an outstanding man, Delawarean, \nU.S. veteran and historian. We all will forever owe him a double debt \nof gratitude for his service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1999-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1999-S2000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA AFL-CIO PRESIDENT VICTOR BUSSIE\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, next week working men and women \nfrom all over Louisiana will pause to honor a great and visionary \nleader and a remarkable man who has led Louisiana's AFL-CIO for the \npast 41 years. On March 10, my good friend Victor Bussie will retire as \npresident of my State's AFL-CIO--marking the end of a truly historic \npublic career during which time he was widely regarded as one of the \nmost powerful and respected men in Louisiana public life.\n  Those of us who have known and admired Vic Bussie for many years \nunderstand that his power was not so much derived from the position he \nheld, but from the force of his personality and the deep conviction and \npersonal integrity that he brought to every debate or endeavor. Simply \nput, Vic Bussie will always be remembered as one of the most honorable \nand decent men who ever served in public life.\n  Perhaps the greatest testimony to Vic Bussie's extraordinary career \nis the many tributes paid to him by those who often found themselves on \nopposing sides in legislative and political battles. Almost without \nexception, those who fought with Vic Bussie over the issues never had \nanything but the highest regard for his integrity and his\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\ntireless dedication to the cause of Louisiana's working men and women. \nAlways aided by his wife, Fran, Vic Bussie was not only an effective \nand articulate spokesman for organized labor; he also brought his \ninfluence and moral persuasion to bear on a wide variety of issues, \nincluding civil rights, education, health care, government reform and \neconomic development. In every case, I believe that the people of \nLouisiana are better off today because Vic Bussie took an interest in \nthose issues and dedicated himself to making life better for all of our \ncitizens, not just those in the labor movement.\n  Perhaps one of the greatest testimonies to Vic Bussie's influence and \npower were the many national political leaders who relied on him during \nhis 41 years at the helm of Louisiana's AFL-CIO. From John F. Kennedy \nto Lyndon Johnson to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton, presidents of the \nUnited States have often sought Vic Bussie's counsel and have relied on \nhim to build public support for their campaigns and their legislative \ninitiatives. In the mid-1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson was \nattempting to persuade my predecessor, Senator Russell Long, to support \nhis proposal to create the national Medicare system, he called on Vic \nBussie. As the story goes, Vic was on the next plane to Washington and \nit was not long afterwards that Senator Long announced his support for \nMedicare. As Russell and I have learned so many times, it is awfully \nhard to say no to Vic Bussie.\n  Mr. President, the late Adlai Stevenson once remarked that ``every \nage needs men who will redeem the time by living with a vision of \nthings that are to be.'' I suspect that Vic counted Adlai Stevenson as \none of his friends. In fact, I would not be surprised to learn that \nStevenson had Vic Bussie in mind when he uttered those words. As leader \nof Louisiana's labor movement for the past 41 years, Vic Bussie has \ncertainly redeemed his time well. All working men and women owe him a \ntremendous debt of gratitude and my wife, Lois, and I are very proud to \nbe part of the chorus of well-deserved praise that is coming his way \nduring the days leading up to his retirement.\n  I know I speak for many others when I say that Victor Bussie will \nalways be gratefully remembered for the outstanding service he has \nrendered to his State and his Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S1999-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2000-S2001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I oppose amending the U.S. \nConstitution with a rigid requirement that every year the Federal \nGovernment must have a zero budget deficit. I don't think it is \nappropriate to use our Nation's most revered governing document to lock \nin a budget and economic policy that cannot respond to changing needs \nand circumstances. And I do not believe such a requirement could be \nenforced without forcing a constitutional crisis.\n  In my view, Congress does not need an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution to perform its responsibility to enact responsible, \nbalanced Federal budgets. The President and the Congress have all the \ntools they need to reduce the deficit, to respond and adapt to the \ncountry's changing needs, and to keep us militarily and economically \nstrong. It is not a constitutional amendment that makes these choices, \nbut strong leadership and judgment. We must make the choices through \nrealistic cuts in spending, reasonable and fair tax policies, and the \nsetting of obtainable goals that show the specifics--every spending cut \nand every tax.\n  Congress can and should act to reduce the deficit. A Democratic \nCongress did just that in 1993, and the deficit has been cut by more \nthan 60 percent. Including an artificial, unworkable mandate in the \nU.S. Constitution is not the appropriate path to fiscal responsibility.\n  I offered and withdrew an amendment which would have protected \nMedicare from the autopilot of the balanced budget amendment. I offered \nthe Medicare amendment with the intention of engaging in a debate that \nwould expose the balanced budget amendment for the budgetary strait \njacket that it is. I offered the amendment with the firm belief that a \ndebate about the effects of a balanced budget amendment on Medicare may \nhelp some of my colleagues think through what their actions will mean. \nPeople don't want Social Security to be used to balance the budget--\nand, I believe Medicare is just as important to our constituents as \nSocial Security. Medicare provides West Virginia seniors with health \ncare security--Social Security with a measure of retirement security. \nMy amendment says that the pursuit of a balance budget should not rob \nseniors of the health care security they need and deserve.\n  The current constitutional balanced budget amendment, if passed, \nwould force deep and devastating cuts on the Medicare Program. Such \ncuts would increase the already too high out of pocket costs senior \ncitizens are forced to pay for basic health care. The pending \nconstitutional amendment is sure to drive up the percentage of a \nsenior's total income they must spend on health care services. \nCurrently, seniors' out of pocket costs are, on average, about 21 \npercent of their total income. This balanced budget amendment is likely \nto force seniors to spend 25, 30, 35, or even 50 percent of their total \nresources on the health care services they need. This increased burden \non seniors would force many seniors into poverty and make a greater \nproportion of them dependent on Medicaid services, in essence, \nshifting even more health care costs to the states.\n\n  I want my colleagues to recognize the real world consequences of \ntheir vote for an automatic, constitutional balanced budget--the \nimposition of devastating cuts in the Medicare Program. Every Senator \nwho I have heard speak publicly about Medicare has said they want to \nprotect, preserve, and strengthen the program. A balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution will do the opposite by devastating \nMedicare--simple math tells us this is true. If my colleagues mean it \nwhen they say they want to protect Medicare, they will oppose this \nconstitutional amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against Medicare \nbeing used as a piggy bank to be raided at the end of the year, when \nthe budget isn't in balance, for whatever unforseen economic reason.\n  I think my colleagues should consider the admonition of the Secretary \nof the Treasury about the consequences of a Constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment for Medicare beneficiaries. I asked the Secretary what \nhe thinks would happen to Medicare beneficiaries under a balanced \nbudget amendment when he appeared before the Finance Committee two \nweeks ago. Here is our exchange about the effects of the balanced \nbudget amendment:\n\n       Senator Rockfeller. Now we have this thing called a \n     balanced budget amendment, which, according to one of the \n     papers this morning, may lose steam in both chambers, and I \n     hope that is the case.\n       But, in the event that it is not, it will be, I think, very \n     problematic for Medicare if we go into a situation where, let \n     us say--Senator Moynihan has heard me talk about this many \n     times --back in the early 1980's in West Virginia we had \n     unemployment that ran up to 21 percent, and devastation to \n     the extent that we were laying off tens of thousands of \n     workers. And this was not common just to West Virginia, it \n     was true in the industrial heartland, as we were making a \n     major economic shift that was painful.\n       Now, if that were to happen again, and I see no reason why \n     it will not; Japan is now going through exactly that same \n     kind of difficulty, one that we would not have guessed that \n     they would have gone through 10 years after we did, but they \n     are. They are very down about it. They are going to be fine \n     in the long-term.\n       But if we were to run into that situation again in this \n     country and we had a balanced budget amendment and we had to \n     balance by the end of the year and we had to do our part here \n     in Finance, would we not run into what we used to call \n     sequestration?\n       Secretary Rubin. I think that you could easily run into a \n     situation, Senator. I think this is only one of the many \n     problems that a balanced budget amendment creates, and that \n     is, I do think it creates an additional threat to Medicare, \n     if that is what you are saying. If you get to the end of the \n     year and there is a very large, unexpected shortfall, which \n     happens from time to time, then I think the President could \n     be in a position where he would be forced to simply cease \n     sending out all checks.\n       Well, if you cease sending out all checks you will cease \n     sending out Social Security checks, you will cease sending \n     out Medicare checks, and you will cease sending out all other \n     kinds of checks, I think, instead of being able to deal with \n     it in some sort of a reasonable and sensible fashion.\n\n  The Medicare trust fund should not be used as a cash cow to balance \nthe budget in an effort to meet the restrictive requirements of a \nconstitutional\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\namendment. I believe it is clear that one consequence of Senate Joint \nResolution 1 would be the Medicare program, which provides health \nservices to 38 million senior citizens, will be cut in excess of what \nis required to protect seniors and beyond the dictates of good health \npolicy.\n  I am committed to charting a positive course for our Nation in the \n21st century, and I believe that we are moving in the right direction. \nSome of us have worked very hard in the recent years to do the job of \ndigging out from the exploding deficits of the 1980's, by reducing the \ndeficit, and changing the priorities of the Federal budget in order to \ncut waste and increase investment in America's future. I have cast many \nvotes in recent years for actual cuts, for detailed changes in policy, \nand for specific budget plans. These are the kinds of real votes that \nhave cut the deficit.\n  By working out a balance between what must be done to invest in our \npeople, and using their hard-earned tax dollars more wisely, we have a \ncourse that is far less reckless and dangerous than strapping this \namendment onto the U.S. Constitution. I truly believe we can achieve \nthe real goal of a balanced budget amendment--fiscal responsibility--if \nwe are brave enough to tackle the real challenges that confront us. For \nthe sake of real fiscal responsibility and the sake of West Virginia's \nfuture, I cast my vote against the constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/05/senate-section/article/S2000-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MR.

Mr. President, I rise to remind my fellow \ncolleagues that today marks the 27th anniversary of the entering into \nforce of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or \nNPT. All too often, the contributions to U.S. security made by \nmultilateral arrangements like the NPT go unrecognized.\n  I will speak today of a treaty that--with the accession by Oman last \nJanuary--now has 185 members. That is more than any international \nsecurity treaty in history. Though it is true that the NPT has not \neradicated the global threat of nuclear weapons proliferation--and that \nit faces some daunting challenges ahead --the treaty has undoubtedly \nserved U.S. interests well and deserves the respect and support of all \nMembers of Congress and indeed all Americans.\n\n\n                            Some Highlights\n\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record at the end of my \nremarks a list supplied by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency of \nall current signatories and parties to the NPT. The only major \nnonmembers are India, Pakistan, Israel, Brazil, and Cuba.\n  The NPT was negotiated throughout the 1960's and was signed by \nSecretary of State Dean Rusk on July 1, 1968. The treaty commits the \nUnited States, Britain, France, Russia, and China--the treaty's so-\ncalled nuclear-weapon states, defined as countries that detonated a \nnuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967--not to transfer, \ndirectly or indirectly, any nuclear explosive device or control over \nsuch a device to any other country, and ``not in any way to assist, \nencourage, or induce'' any non-nuclear-weapon state to acquire such a \ndevice. (Article I.)\n  As for the latter states, the treaty obligates them to forswear the \nbomb and to agree to full-scope safeguards of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency [IAEA] over all of their nuclear materials. (Articles II \nand III.)\n  The treaty also obligates all of its parties to pursue negotiations \ntoward nuclear disarmament, indeed to pursue the eventual goal of a \n``treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective \ninternational control.'' (Article VI.)\n  These respective obligations form the heart of the security \nobligations of members of the NPT. Though the treaty also encourages \npeaceful uses of atomic energy (Article IV), this encouragement \nobviously does not extend to help in making bombs or the fissile \nmaterials for use in such bombs. The ``NP'' in ``NPT'' continues to \nstand for nonproliferation--not ``Nuclear Proliferation'' or ``Nuclear \nProfiteering.''\n\n\n                          New Challenges Ahead\n\n  Now, many published critiques have already established that the NPT \nis far from a perfect treaty. Typically these include observations \nabout the limits of safeguards, the treaty's lack of complete \nuniversality, the lack of mandatory sanctions for violations, the \ninclusion of anachronistic language about ``peaceful nuclear \nexplosions,'' the lack of an explicit ban on nonnuclear-weapon states \nhelping other nonnuclear-weapon states to acquire the bomb, and \nallegations about the treaty's discriminatory division of the world \ninto nuclear have's and have not's.\n  Though many of these specific criticisms are well-founded, I would \nlike to identify some broader challenges that could someday jeopardize \nnot just this treaty, but the very existence of nonproliferation as a \nbasic norm of the international community.\n  Ironically, the first major challenge may well come from the \ndisarmers. Though the United States and Russia have recently made \nsubstantial reductions in their strategic arsenals, it is possible \nthat, someday, dozens of nonnuclear-weapon states may reconsider their \nmembership or abandon the treaty due to what they may believe is \ninadequate progress toward the goal of total nuclear disarmament. What \na hypocritical step that would be: it would amount not just to a form \nof extortion, but one based on some rather peculiar logic--``either you \ndisarm, right now, in the interests of world peace, or we will arm.'' \nHow this will serve the interests of either peace or nonproliferation \nis beyond me.\n  I agree that America and all the other nuclear-weapon states should \nreaffirm their obligation under the NPT to negotiate in good faith \ntoward the ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament. But I do not read the \nNPT itself as\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\ncompelling the United States to disarm as a precondition for other \ncountries to abide by the treaty. The START process has already shown \nthe world that America and Russia are serious about deep cuts in \nnuclear arms. And the world community will rightfully expect Britain, \nFrance, and China to make deep cuts of their own, toward the eventual \ngoal of eliminating all such weapons, as the treaty provides. I believe \nit is crucial that the nuclear-weapon states fulfill their end of the \nNPT bargain, but I do not believe that the complex and time-consuming \nprocess of nuclear arms reductions should serve as any pretext for \nfurther proliferation.\n\n  The second major challenge to the NPT will come from advocates of \ncommercial uses of plutonium or highly enriched uranium around the \nworld. I would hate to see countries use the NPT as a pretext for new \ndemands for access to sensitive technology relating to the manufacture \nof nuclear weapons. If, for example, the acceptance of full-scope \nsafeguards is interpreted by some countries as constituting some form \nof entitlement to produce highly enriched uranium or to separate \nplutonium, then the world would be a more dangerous place indeed. We \nneed less of such materials in world commerce, not more of them.\n  I have no doubt that IAEA safeguards are good and that they are \ngetting better, especially thanks to the agency's Programme 93+2 plan \nto improve safeguards, but the agency is already too under-funded and \noverworked to be taking on the new jobs of safeguarding a global \nplutonium economy, not to mention promoting one. And I continue to \nquestion the basic safeguardability of dangerous fuel cycle operations \nlike reprocessing and enrichment, given the difficulty of preventing or \neven detecting diversions which, though small in size, would be quite \nsufficient to make bombs.\n  Since no technical fix will ever eliminate all proliferation and \nterrorist threats from commercial uses of such materials, I would urge \nall supporters of nonproliferation to pursue a global moratorium or \noutright prohibition on all production of highly enriched uranium and \nthe separation of all bomb-usable plutonium for any purpose. Our goal \nshould not be the production by all or some countries of bomb-usable \nnuclear materials under safeguards--our goal should be a ban on the \nproduction of such materials, period.\n  The key point to keep in mind about safeguards is that they serve as \nan important instrument in America's diplomatic tool kit for fighting \nproliferation. By themselves, safeguards do not in any way constitute a \nsolution to the problem of proliferation. To the extent that they \ncomplement other U.S. nonproliferation initiatives, however, they \nthereby deserve our full support.\n  A third major challenge facing the NPT is that the nuclear-weapon \nstates will, for various reasons, compromise their not in any way to \nassist obligation under article I of the NPT. I have already seen signs \nof some erosion of this key duty, which on its face tolerates no forms \nof assistance.\n  Various current and proposed export control reforms would, if fully \nimplemented, undoubtedly open up new strains in the NPT's no assistance \ntaboo. I have in mind here such proposals as the following: to relax \ncontrols over sensitive dual-use items going to friendly countries or \nmembers of multilateral regimes; to drop controls over goods that are \nno longer state-of-the-art--as though obsolete hydrogen bombs would be \nany less of a proliferation threat; to regulate or prohibit only \nsignificant forms of assistance; to authorize sensitive dual-use \ntransfers so long as there is evidence that some other country is \nselling similar goods--this is the old ``foreign availability'' \nloophole; and to eliminate licensing requirements for many dual-use \ngoods, and other such dubious schemes.\n  Some of these themes were reflected in recent speech by a senior U.S. \nexport control official, who said the following:\n\n       We no longer have a clearly defined single adversary. \n     Instead, we aim to restrict a narrow range of transactions \n     that could assist in the development of weapons of mass \n     destruction in irresponsible countries like Iran and Iraq. In \n     attempting to do that, we have refocused our control system \n     on a smaller group of truly critical goods and technologies \n     and on specific problem end uses and end users in addition to \n     the so-called pariah countries. [Source: Under Secretary of \n     Commerce William Reinsch, speech before the National Security \n     Industrial Association, February 25, 1997.]\n\n  This quote illustrates the extent to which America's NPT's duty ``not \nin any way to assist'' is already being interpreted as meaning, in \neffect, ``* * * not to provide a narrow range of truly critical goods \nand technologies that could assist rogue nations to acquire nuclear \nexplosive devices.'' The NPT, however, makes no distinction between so-\ncalled critical items and any other items--it rules out any and all \nassistance to any nonnuclear-weapon state.\n  The irony of such reform proposals can be seen even more when one \nconsiders that export controls affect only a tiny fraction of U.S. \ntrade. According to Commerce Department data for 1995, $99.20 out of \nevery $100 in U.S. exports did not even require an export license. Not \nonly that--of those exports that did require a license in that year, \nonly one license out of a hundred was denied. In 1991, the Commerce \nDepartment received 30,537 export license applications--by 1995 this \nnumber had plummeted to only 9,845, and only 121 of these were \nultimately denied.\n  So the evidence is pretty slim, to say the least, to support any \nclaim that rolling back on export controls will substantially boost \nAmerica's competitiveness, except perhaps in the sense of increasing \nAmerica's competitiveness as a proliferator of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Yes indeed, America cannot only afford to comply in full \nwith the NPT's ``not in any way to assist'' prohibition--from a \nsecurity standpoint, it cannot afford not to comply with this \nobligation.\n  Unfortunately, the dubious claim of commercial need is not the only \nfactor eroding this prohibition under the NPT. The other threat appears \nin the form of well-meaning pleas coming from two strange bedfellows--\ncertain nongovernmental experts on nonproliferation, and various \ndefense hawks and strategic theorists inside countries that are working \non the bomb or keeping their bomb options wide open.\n  I am referring specifically to proposals to substitute the \n``management'' for the ``prevention'' of proliferation as a goal of \nU.S. policy. America, they argue, should help other countries to make \nto proliferation safe, to ensure that new regional balances of nuclear \nterror remain stable, and to take steps to ensure that new nuclear \narsenals around the world will remain reliable and guarantee secure \nsecond strike capabilities. In other words--they appear to believe that \nAmerica should now help to convert the old cold war doctrine of \n``mutual assured destruction'' into an export commodity.\n  Even highly esteemed organizations like the Council on Foreign \nRelations seem to be leaning in this direction. In a recent study \nreleased last January on U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy in South \nAsia and sponsored by the Council, the authors not only recommended \nthis basic approach, but also called for new U.S. arms transfers and \nnuclear cooperation with both India and Pakistan with no \nnonproliferation strings attached, specifically no requirement for \nfull-scope IAEA safeguards. [Source: Council on Foreign Relations, ``A \nNew US Policy Toward India and Pakistan,'' Richard N. Haass, Chairman, \nJanuary 1997.]\n  Russia, meanwhile, seems intent on selling two nuclear reactors to \nIndia without full-scope safeguards, while China--which has never \naccepted such safeguards as a nuclear supply condition--continues to \nengage in nuclear cooperation with Pakistan.\n  Unless the United States and other members of the world community \nrally in defense of the NPT and the heart of its verification scheme--\nfull-scope safeguards--I fear that more and more countries will be \ntempted to reassess their continued membership in that treaty. After \nall, why agree to safeguards restraints when the benefits of membership \nin the treaty can be obtained without such restraints? Nobody should \ntake the future of this treaty for granted. By their nuclear supply \npractices in South Asia, Russia and China are simply making \nproliferation pay.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by saying that if export \ncontrols remain a valuable instrument of nonproliferation, if the \ninertia toward the eventual goal of nuclear disarmament\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\nis sustained, if the inertia in some countries to make large-scale \ncommercial uses of bomb materials can be broken, and if the zealots of \nregional nuclear deterrence can be kept in check, then I truly believe \nthat the NPT will be with us for quite a while and the world will be \nbetter off as a result.\n  If these conditions are not satisfied, I fear not just for the future \nof this treaty, but for the future of world peace.\n  The list follows:\n\n   Signatories and Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n                   Nuclear Weapons--January 23, 1997\n\n             [Source: Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]\n\n       Afghanistan.\n       Albania.\n       Algeria.\n       Antigua and Barbuda.\n       Andorra.\n       Angola.\n       Argentina.\n       Armenia.\n       Australia.\n       Austria.\n       Azerbaijan.\n       Bahamas, The.\n       Bahrain.\n       Bangladesh.\n       Barbados.\n       Belarus.\n       Belgium.\n       Belize.\n       Benin.\n       Bhutan.\n       Bolivia.\n       Bosnia & Herzegovina.\n       Botswana.\n       Brunei.\n       Bulgaria.\n       Burkina Faso.\n       Burundi.\n       Cambodia.\n       Cameroon.\n       Canada.\n       Cape Verde.\n       Central African Republic.\n       Chad.\n       Chile.\n       China.\n       Colombia.\n       Comoros.\n       Congo, People's Republic of (Brazzaville).\n       Costa Rica.\n       Cote d'Ivoire.\n       Croatia.\n       Cyprus.\n       Czech Republic.\n       Denmark.\n       Djibouti.\n       Dominica.\n       Dominican Republic.\n       Ecuador.\n       Egypt.\n       El Salvador.\n       Equatorial Guinea.\n       Eritrea.\n       Estonia.\n       Ethiopia.\n       Fiji.\n       Finland.\n       Former Yugoslav.\n       Republic of Macedonia.\n       France.\n       Gabon.\n       Gambia, The.\n       Georgia.\n       Germany, Fed.
