Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to talk a \nlittle bit about the summit that is coming up soon--as a matter of \nfact, the 29th and 30th of this month. President Jiang Zemin of China \nwill visit Washington to have a summit meeting with President Clinton. \nIt is a good time I think for us to do two things. One is to think a \nlittle bit about our role with respect to the summit, our role as \nCongress. Another is that it is a good time for us to take another look \nat our policy and our bilateral relationships and reevaluate both of \nthose with respect to China and its goals.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs, \nthis relationship, of course, and its ramifications in the future, its \nimpact on the United States and the world is something that is very \nimportant to me. East Asia, of course, will be a source of one of our \nmost important economic and strategy challenges as we move into the \nnext century. China, with 1.2 billion people and an increasingly \nexpanding economy, will continue, and increasingly, to be a center of \nattention in Asia. To adequately meet those kinds of challenges, \nobviously, why, we need to continue to articulate and develop a \nworkable policy with respect to China and then, of course, to all of \nthe countries in Asia.\n  This administration has and continues to refer to our China policy as \na constructive engagement, which has a nice sound, a nice ring to it, \nbut I am not sure anybody really knows what that means. Apparently, it \ncan mean whatever one would like it to mean. If you ask 10 or 12 \ndifferent people, each of them might give you a different explanation \nof what it is. Moreover, and probably even more important, the Chinese \ndo not know what constructive engagement means. Many of them are not \npersuaded and talk often about the idea that our relationship with \nChina is one of containment, which it really is not.\n  So I think it is a good opportunity to make clear what our policy is \nwith respect to China. And it seems to me that that policy ought to \nreflect those things that are of concern to us, those things that are \nimportant to us, those things that will over time allow us to have a \nrelationship with China. I happened to have the opportunity to visit \nthere in August. Most of the leadership was at the coast because of the \nsummertime, but I did go there and visit with the Foreign Minister. We \ntalked a good deal about the upcoming summit and what it is that it \nmight be.\n  I was, and am still, a bit concerned that when you have a summit \nthere may be a compelling interest among the administration people to \nbe able to announce great things at the summit, which would be fine if, \nindeed, they are based on the kind of arrangements and the kind of \nagreements that really need to be made in order to have great things to \nannounce. It would be a shame, on the other hand, if we rushed to \nagreement on some things and came up with unsatisfactory agreements \nsimply in order to make the summit look as good as it should.\n  I agreed with the Foreign Minister that, indeed, it would be better \nto just have a summit to help our relationships, to talk about \nproblems, if that is all we could do, than to have some artificial \narrangements made in order to make some announcements.\n  So I think that is a little bit where we are. One of the things that \nI believe is important is that the Congress should be involved. In most \ncountries like China and Indonesia that have a different system, of \ncourse, the people do not really understand that Congress has something \nto do with foreign policy, that Congress is involved in foreign policy. \nThat is not the case in most countries. So I am hopeful, and I am now \nfairly confident, there will be some congressional involvement in this \nsummit.\n  One of the things I am glad has not occurred, however, as sometimes \ndoes is that--of course, we are free here and should speak out on \nwhatever we want--often you see a whole series of sense-of-the-Congress \nresolutions that are not very conducive to having a good meeting--some \nof them saying, well, if you do not behave, we will take away your \nvisas and all that sort of business, which may have merit but it does \nnot seem it is useful as we come up to a summit with the intention to \ntry to improve the relationships we have. I think those things are \ncounterproductive, as is the case generally with sanctions; sanctions \ndo not work. There are less than a handful of objectives that the \nChinese simply can't get somewhere else. We have sanctions on something \nwhen they are bargaining with Boeing for 777's and they go to France \nand buy Airbuses. That is kind of the way that works. We hurt our own \nrelationship for no positive reason.\n  Now, I am not an apologist for China. There are many things that are \nbeing done there that we think should be done differently, many things \nthat are being done there that are not consistent with our values, but \nI think probably as important as anything, if China wishes to be part \nof the family of business in the world, then there are some rules they \nhave to abide by or else they are not part of the family. Countries \nhave to stay with agreements that they have, the contracts they have.\n  So there are many things that make it more difficult to embrace \npeople in the international community. In the case of China, there are \nconcerns about Tibet, concerns about human rights, religious \npersecution, rule of law, intellectual property rights, relationships \nwith Taiwan. All of those things are concerns. But the issue is how do \nwe best deal with them. Nobody denies that there are problems we have \nto deal with, but as in the case of most favored nation, then you say I \nunderstand the problem. The question is how do we best deal with it. Do \nwe best deal with it by standing away? Do we best deal with it by \nsanctions? Or do we best deal with it by articulating a foreign policy \nand then saying we are going to stay with that policy? I believe that \nis the best answer for us.\n  There are a number of things that ought to be talked about, I \nbelieve, at this summit. I have met with Sandy Berger, who is the \nPresident's adviser and the person I think most responsible for the \nmeeting, who seems also to be in tune with this. There are about four \nreal issues that I hope are talked about very candidly and talked about \nin depth. One is nuclear proliferation --the idea of parts shipped to \nPakistan, the idea that Iran and the PRC have a nuclear cooperation \nagreement, changes to domestic law to prevent dual use. These kinds of \nthings. Now, we are in the course of the President certifying that \nthese things are not in fact happening, and I hope they are not. But we \nneed to talk about that. We need to have an understanding. We need to \nbe able to have visibility to see if, indeed, that is happening.\n  Another is human rights. I think we need to continue to speak out \nabout religious freedom. We need to continue to speak out about \npersonal freedom. Those are our values. We are not going to be able to \ntell everybody else how to live, but we can promote values that we \nbelieve are important. And among those at the top is human rights.\n  Trade. China, of course, wants to belong to the World Trade \nOrganization, and I, indeed, hope they do. I think it would be better \nfor us so that when you have trade problems, it is not a unilateral \nkind of thing but, indeed, would fall within the purview of the World \nTrade Organization. And some measures could be put on by other \ncountries as well as ours.\n  Finally, security. We have had good cooperation from the PRC with \nregard to North Korea. But one of the reasons that we are involved as \nwe are in China and in Asia is, of course, to stabilize the security of \nthis part of the world, which is terribly important to us. I think we \nhave been relatively successful in doing that.\n\n[[Page S10833]]\n\n  Mr. President, as this summit comes close, I am pleased that the \nCongress is somewhat involved. I am actually pleased that these have \nkind of been four issues that at least the National Security Council \nhas set forth. I hope we have honest, candid talks with the President \nof China. I hope we say in very understandable terms what our policy is \nin regard to human rights, in understandable terms what our policy is \nwith regard to trade. We obviously have to open up China so that our \ntrade deficit doesn't worsen.\n  So we have real problems to resolve. We do not resolve them by simply \nsaying we are going to have ``constructive engagement.'' I think we \nneed to be specific on a relatively small number of things that are \nimportant to us and then, by golly, stick with them. If we have an \nagreement on intellectual property and it is not adhered to, then we \nneed to do something about it. We should not try to run everything that \neverybody else does in another country, but those things that are \nimportant to us I think we ought to stay with. I look forward to the \nsummit. I hope it is a useful one. I hope it contributes to world \npeace. I hope it contributes to stability in world trade and perhaps \nmost of all the improvement of human rights in that part of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/20/senate-section/article/S10832-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION'S ACTIONS AGAINST RESTRICTIVE JAPANESE PORT \n                               PRACTICES\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission [FMC], Mr. \nHarold Creel, and the other Federal Maritime Commissioners, Mrs. Ming \nHsu, Mr. Joe Scroggins, and Mr. Delmond Won for their resolve in \npursuing trade liberalization of Japan's restrictive port practices.\n  The problem of unfair, restrictive port practices in Japan is a long \nstanding one. The United States carriers and United States Government \nhave asked the Japanese to reform their system for over a decade. The \nJapanese had refused even to acknowledge that this was a problem, much \nless to resolve it.\n  Two years ago, the carriers, weary of the futility of diplomatic and \ncommercial pressure, asked the FMC to address this. This was not a \nmatter of the FMC grandstanding or attempting to justify its existence. \nIn fact, I would note that the same Japanese restrictive port practices \nwere challenged at the World Trade Organization [WTO] by European \ncarriers. To date, the WTO has not acted on the European carrier \npetition. However, the FMC acted vigorously at the request of United \nStates industry interests to address a long-standing, Japanese-created \nsituation that could not be resolved through more amicable means. In \nSeptember 1995, the FMC issued orders to gather information on the \nsubject.\n  In November 1996, the FMC issued a proposed rule, with monetary \nsanctions to go into effect April 1997.\n  In April 1997, an agreement between the United States and Japanese \nGovernments resulted in Japanese commitments to achieve certain steps \ntoward reform by July 1997. Accordingly, the FMC postponed the \neffective date of the sanctions until September 1997.\n  But then the Japanese failed to meet their April commitments. In \nSeptember, the Japanese again asked for a postponement of the FMC rule. \nThe FMC refused, and beginning in September, fees of $100,000 per \nvoyage began accruing. The fees for the month of September, which \ntotaled $4 million, were due and payable October 15, 1997.\n  Despite frequent assurances by the Japanese carriers that they would \npay the fees, when the October deadline was reached, they refused to do \nso. Accordingly, the FMC took the next step, which is authorized by \nstatute and specifically spelled out in the final rule: to request that \nCustoms deny clearance of Japanese vessels at United States ports, and \nto request the Coast Guard to detain the vessels. This action is \nentirely avoidable upon payment by the Japanese carriers of their now \noverdue debts to the United States.\n  The Japanese port practices at issue result in costly, arbitrary, and \nunnecessary expenditures by United States carriers and prevent them \nfrom making their own decisions on whom to hire for stevedoring \nservices, from being licensed to operate their own terminals, and from \noperating efficiently. These practices are injurious not only to U.S. \ncarriers, but to all U.S. importers and exporters who rely on ocean \nshipping, and to the American consumer. Japanese port costs are the \nhighest in the world, and American consumers of Japanese goods \nultimately foot the bill. Moreover, Japanese carriers are not subject \nto such restrictions in their operations in the United States.\n  None of these achievements of the FMC would have been possible were \nthe FMC not an independent agency, separate from the executive branch \ndepartments. Only an independent agency, free from political pressure \nand the host of other concerns which frequently paralyze larger \nexecutive branch agencies, could have acted so swiftly and effectively. \nWe must ensure that the FMC continue to retain its independent status.\n  It is my understanding that United States and Japanese negotiators \nare coming close to an agreement that would resolve this issue. This \nissue would not be resolved, but for the actions of the FMC. Bravo, \nkeep up the good work, and ensure that whatever issues the Japanese \nGovernment agrees to are enforced for the benefit of the shipping \npublic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/20/senate-section/article/S10833-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am going to visit today about the fast-\ntrack trade debate that we are expected to take up here in the U.S. \nSenate in the next couple of weeks. It is an interesting topic. I \nexpect it will be a hotly contested debate as it deals with \ninternational trade.\n  I was in North Dakota last week, and I assume the presiding officer \nwas in Kansas and my other colleagues from here in the Senate were in \ntheir home States. I saw an interesting editorial in the largest \nnewspaper in North Dakota, the Fargo Forum. The editorial says: Farm \nEconomy Is at Risk. Then it describes the problems that our family \nfarmers are facing in North Dakota including, problems of lower \nproduction because of crop disease, the lack of moisture in some parts \nof our State, too much moisture in other parts of our State, and very \nlow prices that they receive for their grain. The editorial talks about \nan average size farm penciling out to a $23,000 loss in net worth this \nyear. This is for the average size farm with average production this \nyear.\n  I was thinking about this because as I travel in North Dakota I see a \ngreat many family farmers. Most of them are descendants of the \nhomesteaders in this country, the people who moved out to build a farm, \nand try to make a living. For some people it has been very, very hard.\n  In North Dakota about 200 years ago, in fact just about 7 or 8 years \nless than 200 years ago, we had a visit from Louis and Clark. Thomas \nJefferson, then President of the United States, bought from Napoleon \nBonaparte the Louisiana Purchase, as it was called, for 3 cents an \nacre. He bought all that land out there for 3 cents an acre. Some \njumped up in the Senate and said, why on Earth would you buy land out \nthere? There is nothing out there. There are Indians and sagebrush. Why \nwould you want that land?\n  If you were to equate what he paid for the Louisiana Purchase and \ncompared to our current budget, he paid the equivalent of $3 trillion. \nThis is as a percentage of what we spend today at the Federal \nGovernment level versus what Jefferson proposed to spend on the \nLouisiana Purchase. He bought for 3 cents an acre on all of that land. \nThis is equivalent of about $3 trillion of what we would have to pay \ntoday. Then he sent Louis and Clark to go look at what he had purchased \nto try to find a water route to the ocean out west.\n  I read, as the Presiding Officer and many others may have, the \nwonderful book that was just published about Louis and Clark's journey. \nI discovered that when Thomas Jefferson gave them the charge to go \nexplore that new territory, he gave Mr. Louis the opportunity to sign \nvouchers for whatever he needed for the trip. Mr. Louis went to St. \nLouis, MO, and he began signing vouchers. He was buying all kinds of \nthings in St. Louis that he felt were necessary, because he didn't know \nwhat he was going to confront on that trip or how long it would take \nhim.\n  He hired a bunch of folks and signed vouchers for a lot of things. \nThey said he bought 120 gallons of whiskey for the trip. I wonder if \ntoday the Citizens Against Government Waste would let somebody get by \nwith that. Well, probably not. Not 120 gallons of whiskey. Apparently, \nthe theory was he needed enough whiskey to get him up into and through \nMontana, because at that point it was too late to turn back. I don't \nknow whether that was said tongue-in-cheek or not.\n  In any event, the chronicles of the Louis and Clark expedition are \nquite wonderful. It is interesting to see our part of the country \nthrough their eyes 200 years ago because they stayed the winter in \nNorth Dakota. It was kind of chilly. They got hunkered down for the \nwinter in North Dakota. They chronicled that in their book as well.\n\n  Then, about 100 years passed, and toward the turn of this century we \nhad something called the Homestead Act, which led people to move out to \nStates like North Dakota and claim 160 acres of land and build a house \nand operate a farm and raise a family, and the land would be theirs \nunder the Homestead Act. So my State was populated by these \nhomesteaders about 100 years ago. It is about as difficult a life as \none can imagine, trying to start a farm out in the prairies of North \nDakota, facing the wind, and the uncertainty of the weather. Then there \nwas the question of, if you plant some seeds in the ground, will you \nget a crop? Will you have grasshoppers? Will you have crop disease? \nWill a hailstorm come along? And then, if you get a crop will there be \na price sufficient so you can sell the crop and make a living?\n  Now, 100 years after the homesteaders, we discover fewer and fewer \nyard lights in rural North Dakota. More family farmers are going broke. \nFewer family farmers can make a living. We continue to see the type of \neditorial I just described, ``The Farm Economy Is at Risk,'' which \ndescribes the net loss of so many family farms in North Dakota this \nyear.\n  Family farmers are the last of the free marketers in this country. \nThey don't ask for much. They don't get much. And they risk virtually \neverything they have, based on the marketplace. Yet, one by one those \ntens of thousands of family farmers, as small producers, confront a \nmarketplace of very large producers whose economic clout is enormous. \nIf you are raising a beef cow when you go to the marketplace you \nconfront the large beef packers, four of which control over 80 percent \nof the beef packing plants in this country. So you face an economic \npressure that really is not particularly fair. The result is, generally \nspeaking, lower prices than one would expect to exist in a free market.\n  When you try to market your wheat, you confront other economic \nenterprises. You confront the big millers, you confront the grocery \nmanufacturers, you confront the folks who are involved in the grain \ntrade, all of whom are large economic enterprises. Yet a family farmer \ncompetes in the marketplace against these larger economic interests \nwhich want lower prices. They want lower prices for family farmers, \nwhich means family farmers lose and they win.\n  The reason I describe all that is we come around now to this question \nabout trade. The discussion in the Congress will be negotiating new \ntrade agreements, because the President says, and a lot of both \nRepublicans and Democrats say that the route to economic health is \ntrade. That may be. The theory is the more you trade, the better off \nyou are. If you read the doctrine of comparative advantage from the \ngreat economic thinkers going back to Adam Smith and Ricardo and \nothers, the presumption was that every part of the world would do what \nit could do best and trade back and forth. This was the doctrine of \ncomparative advantage. Of course, what they were talking about was \ntrade from nation to nation, because there were no corporations at the \nadvent of that kind of economic theory. But, notwithstanding that, the \nprovision still exists, I suppose, in the minds of some, that the route \nto economic health is through trade. They believe that discussion \nshould not be about what kind of trade. Instead, the question should be \nhow much trade.\n  Some of us are concerned about our situation with trade. It is not \nbecause we believe we should not have aggressive trade practices or \nthat we should not find ways to market our goods overseas in foreign \nmarkets that might need those goods. It is not because we\n\n[[Page S10835]]\n\nbelieve that American consumers should not be able to take advantage of \ngoods produced elsewhere that they may want. Instead, we are concerned \nbecause we see a pattern of trade in this country that is not fair to \nthis country and that in the long-term inevitably weakens and injures \nour production and manufacturing base in America. The manufacturing \nbase is the center pole of a strong economy. If you weaken your \nmanufacturing base, you weaken the sector that provides the good jobs \nthat pay well and have good benefits.\n\n  We have been led into thinking, I expect, by some, that a measure of \neconomic health in America is not what you produce but what you \nconsume. Think to yourself, what are the economic indices that are used \nevery month to evaluate how healthy America is? It is what we consume \nevery month. Were sales up or down? That's the basis by which we \nevaluate is America doing very well. Yet there is very little \ndiscussion about what we produce.\n  I want to hold up a chart that describes the aggregate trade deficits \nin recent years. Even though we have been negotiating trade agreements \nand we have done a number of these trade agreements under the procedure \ncalled fast track, which I will describe in a moment, it is very hard \nto determine that we are moving in the right direction. This particular \nchart demonstrates that for 21 straight years we have run merchandise \ntrade deficits in this country, and in most recent years we have had \nthe largest deficits in America's history. Last year, the year before, \nthe year before that, and, incidentally, this year, we will once again \nsee the largest merchandise trade deficit in this country's history. It \nis very hard to take a look at all of this red ink and discern that \nsomehow we are doing very, very well.\n  I had written a piece about trade. Then there was an article in the \nWashington Post recently. The writer of this article described this \ntrade agreement in ways so that apparently I and others could \nunderstand it, suggesting that we just don't understand this. He said \nthat we don't understand that this is not a sign of economic trouble, \nbut that this is a sign of economic health. He reported the bigger the \ndeficits the better off you are. Let me read the description by the \nwriter from the Washington Post:\n\n       If someone offered to trade you $10,000 worth of apples for \n     $5,000 worth of pears, you'd jump at the deal. In the same \n     vein, we Americans can hardly be considered unfairly treated \n     if we obtain more imports that foreigners have slaved to \n     produce for our consumption in exchange for fewer exports \n     that we have slaved to produce for theirs.\n\n  Those of us from the middle of the country would have missed this \nentire economic theory had he not written this. In fact, I have an \nuncle, Uncle Harold, who would love to get involved in some of this \npear and apple trade. If someone offered to pay you $10,000 worth of \napples for $5,000 worth of pears would you jump at the deal? Yes, I \nsuppose you would, unless you didn't need the apples and you didn't \nhave the money to go in debt for the balance. That is the problem. This \nis always the thoughtlessness we get on trade debate. It is that \nsomehow America is getting something for free. The fact is, America is \ninheriting the largest trade deficits in its history and no one seems \nto care very much. This writer says the economists make the point that \nthis is very healthy, it is a wonderful thing.\n  In fact, in this same article they were talking about why we have a \ntrade deficit. There is kind of an incestuous relationship between all \nthe sources. The same people go to the same sources for the same \nquotes. This uses these same sources. The source, an economist, says \nthe reason we had a trade deficit is because America doesn't save \nenough. There is an interesting thought. Companies close their American \nplant and move it to Mexico because somebody in Detroit doesn't save \nenough or somebody in Russell, KS, doesn't save enough? I'm sorry, I \nstudied economics and I taught economics and that's not a theory with \nwhich I find credible. Maybe it's another theory that those of us in \nthe middle of the country don't understand.\n  This same source that said our problem is that we don't save enough \nand that's why we have huge trade deficits said many months ago that we \nhave a huge trade deficit because we have mounting budget deficits. He \nsaid that when the budget deficit goes down the trade deficit will go \ndown.\n  Well, guess what? The budget deficit has gone down 4 years in a row. \nWhat has happened to the trade deficit? The trade deficit has continued \nto increase to new record levels. So much for that theory. The same \nsource says, and some others say, that we have a trade deficit because \nof our currency valuation. They say that we have a strong dollar and \nthat causes the trade deficit. But, the dollar goes up and the dollar \ngoes down, we still have the trade deficit, and the trade deficit \ncontinues to grow. So much for that theory.\n  My point is, those who give us this malarkey about the trade deficit \nsomehow don't understand that these deficits, the largest deficits in \nthis country's history, mean that we are buying from abroad much more \nthan we are selling overseas, and the result is an outflow of American \njobs.\n  That may not mean much to people who write in the newspapers. It \nprobably doesn't mean very much to economists, and it probably doesn't \nmean much to politicians. Because I don't know of any journalist, \npolitician, or economist who has ever lost a job because of a bad trade \nagreement. In fact, I want someone to come to the floor of the Senate \nand advise me, as we have this debate in the next couple of weeks. Give \nme one name. Tell me the name of one economist, one politician, or one \njournalist who has ever lost his or her job because their plant moved \noverseas. It didn't happen. That is why to them this is all theory, and \nwhen their theories are wrong, they just wake up with a new theory. It \ndoesn't matter.\n  Will Rogers used to say when there is no place left to spit, you \neither have to swallow the tobacco juice or change with the times. I \nsay to all these economists who have delivered all this nonsense in \nrecent years, there's no place left to spit on these issues. You have \ngiven us eight reasons for the trade deficit, and all of them have been \ndisproved. All of them have been wrong, and maybe it is time for some \nnew sources. Maybe it is time for some new discussion about what this \ndeficit means to our country.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about so-called free markets. The free-\nmarket system is a wonderful system. I am not suggesting that we get \ninvolved in managing the economy. We have a free-market system that \nworks pretty well. Inside our country, it is interesting, the free-\nmarket system says, for example, that those farmers out there who get \nup and do chores at 6 in the morning and do evening chores at 6 in the \nevening, risk all their money and wonder what is going to happen, they \ncan lose $23,000 a year. At the same time the three supporting \ncharacters on ``Seinfeld,'' a leading television program, can get \n$600,000 a week. That is $600,000 a week for each of the three \nsupporting characters; $13 million a year in salaries. That is our \nmarket system. That is fine.\n  If you are 7-foot tall and can dunk a basketball, and you are 21 \nyears old and play for a certain team in the Midwest, you can get a \n$121 million contract for 6 years playing basketball. Pay somebody to \nplay basketball or hire 1,000 teachers. It is the same price. One 7-\nfoot basketball player or 1,000 teachers; one 7-foot basketball player, \nor a thousand family farmers making a profit. The market system \ndetermines what is what, and the market system is a wonderful system, \nbut it produces some aberrations from time to time.\n  One of the problems, as we describe a market system in the context of \ntrade, is this: People say, ``Well, what we need to have is a market \nsystem in which when we trade back and forth, it would be absolutely \nfree and unfettered.'' That leads to another question. If it is free \nand unfettered trade between us and Canada, us and Mexico, us and \nJapan, or us and China, why is it then that they can get their goods \ninto this country so much easier than we can get our goods into their \ncountry? Why?\n  Let me give some examples. Canada and wheat. We have a virtual flood \nof wheat coming into this country from Canada. We had kind of an \nagreement about how much would come in. Last year, Canada sent in \n21,000 semi-truckloads of wheat above the agreed-upon\n\n[[Page S10836]]\n\nlevel. What can we do about it? Nothing, because we don't have a trade \nremedy that works here. Canada sends it in through a State trading \nenterprise, which would be illegal in this country, and with secret \nprices, so no one knows at what price they are selling it in America. \nNonetheless, we have a wheat trade problem with Canada.\n\n  Is that free trade? No; I don't think so. I went to the border in an \norange truck, a 12-year-old 2-ton truck, with a man named Earl Jenson. \nWe took 200 bushels of Durum wheat from the United States to try to get \nit into Canada. Guess what happened to us at the border? They stopped \nus. They said you can't take wheat into Canada. All the way from the \nborder, we had watched semi-truckloads filled with Canadian wheat that \nwere coming south.\n  Is it fair trade? I don't think so. Is it free trade? I don't think \nso.\n  I can describe chapter and verse about the Mexico situation, but let \nme talk about both Canada and Mexico. We had the last free-trade \nagreement considered under what is called fast-track procedures. First, \nthe agreement is reached through negotiations that are not public but \nprivate negotiations. Then after they come from behind closed doors and \nsay, ``We reached an agreement,'' it comes to Congress, and Congress, \nbecause of fast-track procedures, is prevented from offering an \namendment. The last one was called NAFTA, the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement.\n  Just prior to the NAFTA trade agreement, our country had an $11 \nbillion trade deficit with Canada. Now some years later, the trade \ndeficit has doubled. We now have a $23 billion trade deficit with \nCanada. Just prior to the North American Free-Trade Agreement, we had a \n$2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Now we have a $16 billion trade \ndeficit with Mexico. Yet, we have people crowing on the floor of \nCongress, the House and the Senate, that these have been wonderful \nagreements. What kind of adding machines do they have? What kind of \nlogic are they using to suggest that when you find yourself in a deep \nhole that things are going just great? The NAFTA agreement has been a \ndisastrous agreement.\n  In fact, the Economic Policy Institute just did a study that said we \nhave lost 395,000 jobs in this country as a result of the NAFTA \nagreement. Those who claim, incidentally, there have been new jobs \ncreated in this country take a look at only one side of the ledger, and \nthat is the amount of exports we send out. They do not consider the \namount of imports that are sent in to displace what had previously been \nproduced here.\n  For example, they would take a look at Canada and Mexico and say, \n``Well, gee, we sent a little more to Canada, to Mexico, things are \ndoing just great.'' The problem is, we have had much, much more coming \nin from each of those countries, and we have gone from a positive trade \nbalance with Mexico to a substantial negative trade balance. We have \ndoubled our trade deficit with Canada. Who on Earth can conclude that \nis a trade policy on the right path?\n  Let's take China just for a moment. China's trade deficit has \nratcheted up, up, up and way up, and now our trade deficit with China \nis $40 billion a year and moving up toward $50 billion a year. They \nsay, ``Well, we're supposed to have free trade with all these folks.'' \nThere is no free trade with China. We can't get much American pork into \nChina. When China wants wheat, it shops elsewhere for wheat. It buys \nsome from us. With the $40 billion to $50 billion trade surplus it has \nwith us, it ought to be buying wheat from us.\n  When China needs airplanes and wants to buy airplanes, guess what it \nsays? ``We will buy American airplanes only if they are manufactured in \nChina.'' It is another way of saying, ``We want to trade with you, but \nwe want American jobs to move to China.'' That is not fair trade.\n  Japan this year will have a trade deficit increased by 20 percent \nabove last year. This year it is projected to reach $65 billion in \ntrade deficits that we will have with Japan. Year after year, every \nyear, the trade deficit with Japan goes on ranging and from around $50 \nbillion to over $60 billion.\n  Is our trade relationship with Japan a mutually \nproductive relationship? We could talk chapter and verse forever today \nabout the amount of American goods we cannot get into Japan because \ntheir markets are not open to us.\n\n  The administration says it wants fast-track authority because it \nwants to open foreign markets. I want to prevent fast-track authority \nbecause I am sick of having trade negotiators negotiate bad agreements \non the front end and then fail to enforce them on the back end. I say, \n``You go out and negotiate, go right ahead, come back and let's see \nwhat you have done. If you think these are fair agreements, you will \nget them passed through the Congress. If not, you are going to get a \nresounding no.'' They say, ``We can't negotiate under those \ncircumstances.''\n  It is interesting to me, there have only been five trade agreements \nreached under fast-track trade authority granted by the Congress ever \nin history. We haven't granted fast-track authority for complicated \nnuclear arms agreements or test ban treaties. We haven't granted fast-\ntrack authority for any of those. Only a handful of trade agreements \nhave had fast-track trade authority, and I ask my colleagues to \nevaluate what has been the result of those trade agreements.\n  Mr. President, I am going to propose a number of things when we talk \nabout fast track. I think that we ought to establish some principles \nthat evaluate what is right for this country. I said when I started \nthat I think we ought to have expanded trade. The more trade the \nbetter, as far as I am concerned, but I demand that the trade that we \nhave as a country be fair trade with other countries. We ought not \ncontinue to swallow huge deficits year after year only to find the \ncountries that move their goods into our marketplace with impunity \ndecide their marketplace is closed to us. That is not free trade, and \nthat is not fair trade.\n  When we discuss fast track, what I am going to propose is a number of \nprinciples that represent the basis of our trade policy:\n  No. 1: A principle ought to be to end chronic, escalating trade \ndeficits. Is that a goal of this country? If it is, we sure are not \ndoing well. I just showed you that the trade deficits have increased \nevery year. We ought to decide as a country that we ought to end the \nescalating trade deficits by increasing U.S. net exports.\n  No. 2: A trade agreement ought to result in real growth in the U.S. \neconomy, provide more and better jobs and improve living standards. \nIncidentally, there is no such principle that guides today's trade \nnegotiating.\n  No. 3: We ought to provide mandatory performance standards for trade \nagreements together with enforcement to ensure full reciprocity. It \nseems to me that when you go from a $2 billion trade surplus with \nMexico to a $15 billion trade deficit, someplace there ought to be some \nsnapback provision that allows Congress to look at that and say, \n``Oops, that's not what we meant; that's not headed in the right \ndirection.''\n  No. 4: No trade agreement ever ought to be negotiated that doesn't \ninclude adjustment mechanisms to prevent currency exchange rate \nfluctuations from distorting the trade flows. You can't have trade \nagreements and then have someone devalue their currency which wipes out \nevery single gain, plus 50 percent more, in the trade agreement on \nlowering tariffs. That doesn't make sense. Everybody understands you \nmust include these. These are the principles, I think, that we must \nconsider when we evaluate whether we want to provide fast-track trade \nauthority for new negotiations dealing with international trade.\n  I look forward to the debate we are going to have, because this \ncountry, I think, needs a new blueprint for trade negotiations. The old \ntrade blueprints are tired, worn and not working. It is no longer good \nenough to have trade policies that allow those corporations who decide \nthat they will personally profit by finding a place in the world to \nproduce at very low cost and then ship the production to Pittsburgh or \nLos Angeles or Fargo or Topeka just because that is good for their \nprofits. It is no longer acceptable to me that this ought to be a model \nfor trade.\n  If a company which is now an international concern says, look, ``My \nmodel for the future is I want to produce in Bangladesh, I want to \nproduce in Indonesia, I want to produce in Sri Lanka, and I want to \nship the\n\n[[Page S10837]]\n\nproduct to America,'' you say to them, ``Why do you want to produce \nthere?\n  ``I want to produce there because we can hire people for pennies an \nhour, a dime, 12 cents, 14 cents, a quarter, or 50 cents an hour. We \ndon't have the problem with pollution. We can pollute the air and the \nwater. We can hire kids. We won't have OSHA looking over our shoulder \nbecause we don't have safe workplace standards, and we can just pole \nvault over all those things we have negotiated and fought about for 50 \nto 75 years in this country. We can pole vault over all of those \nproblems as a producer and go overseas, close the U.S. manufacturing \nplant, hire foreign workers, have no problems on pollution, child labor \nand wage standards and then produce the same garage-door opener or \nproduce the same toothbrush or produce the same vacuum cleaner and ship \nit to America.''\n  That might be good for these corporations, but it is not good for \nAmerica because inevitably that means diminishing America's \nmanufacturing base. It means moving American jobs overseas and it means \ninjuring this country's long-term economic strength.\n  That is what this debate has to be about: What is in America's \neconomic interests; what is in our country's long-term economic \ninterest; and, what will best represent the opportunity to create new \njobs and advance our country's economic interests? That is what this \ndebate must be about.\n  I hope in the coming couple of weeks, on behalf of farmers and wage \nearners, and, yes, American businesses, we can decide we have a trade \nstrategy that doesn't now work, that causes substantial trade deficits, \nand substantial amounts of American jobs leaving and moving overseas. I \nhope we can decide that there is a better way and a different way. My \npurpose is not to promote some kind of xenophobic, isolationist, \nprotectionist strategy. It is not to put walls around our country, but \nto decide that the trade between us and our trading partners must be \nmutually productive. We must have trade between us and Japan be \nbalanced trade. If they get their goods into our marketplace, then we \nhave a right to demand we get our goods into theirs. The trade between \nus and China should be mutually beneficial; that if we have something \nthey want, they have a responsibility to buy it from us, and not demand \nthat we manufacture it on Chinese soil at a time when they have a $50 \nto $60 billion trade surplus with us or we a deficit with them. It \nseems to me now is the time for us to demand that.\n\n  One of the reasons that I am pleased that we are finally going to \nhave a debate about trade is that we have not been able to have any \ndiscussion about it. This turns instantly to a thoughtless discussion--\ninstantly--the minute you start turning to the issue of trade.\n  Finally, maybe in discussing fast track this will become a thoughtful \ndiscussion about what is in this country's best interests. Yes, \nexpanded trade, but, yes, especially better trade agreements that are \nbetter for this country and trade agreements that are enforced with \ntough, no-nonsense standards, saying we represent the economic \ninterests of our country--not other countries but our country.\n  The current trade strategy, resulting in huge recurring trade \ndeficits, hurts rather than helps our country. Those are trade deficits \nwe can solve by requiring that we be able to sell more goods around the \nworld and by requiring that trade agreements be fair and enforced.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding we will return to \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1173) to authorize funds for construction of \n     highways, for highway safety programs, and for mass transit \n     programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Chafee/Warner Amendment No. 1312, to provide for a \n     continuing designation of a metropolitan planning \n     organization.\n       Chafee/Warner Amendment No. 1313 (to language proposed to \n     be stricken by the committee amendment, as modified), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Chafee/Warner Amendment No. 1314 (to Amendment No. 1313), \n     of a perfecting nature.\n       Motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works, with instructions.\n       Lott Amendment No. 1317 (to instructions of the motion to \n     recommit), to authorize funds for construction of highways, \n     for highway safety programs, and for mass transit programs.\n       Lott Amendment No. 1318 (to Amendment No. 1317), to strike \n     the limitation on obligations for administrative expenses.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate, if \nthey have statements in connection with this legislation, to come over \nand deliver them. Now is an excellent opportunity. I do not envision a \ngreat deal else happening this afternoon. But this is an ideal chance \nfor those who have statements or questions that they wish to pose or to \ndiscuss the bill in some substance. Now is the opportunity.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The chairman of the committee is accurate. We all know \nthat very often there is the tendency to wait until the last moment, \nand we do not get an opportunity sometimes to say what we want to say \nor offer amendments. Now is the opportunity to speak on the bill. \nSenators may have questions about the bill. This is an excellent \nopportunity to take advantage of that because there may not be another \nopportunity.\n  So I, first of all, encourage Senators who have an interest in one of \nthe more important pieces of legislation, certainly one of the more \nexpensive bills that this Congress is going to pass this year, to come \non over. Tell us what you think. If you may have a problem with the \nbill, perhaps we can work it out. But now is the time. I urge Senators \non both sides of the aisle to do so because this is an opportune time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding that there would be an objection \nto amendments being considered. But absent that, Senators could come \nover\n\n[[Page S10838]]\n\nand discuss amendments that they might subsequently be filing or be \npermitted to be considered. So there is a chance to get a lot done this \nafternoon if those Senators in their offices would come on over and \ngive us the benefit of their wisdom on this matter, which we seek.\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest, until such occurs, the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I came back this week after our recess \nvery enthusiastic about moving forward on ISTEA. The people in my State \nare very anxious about it. It is an important issue to us, the funding \nof Federal highways. Our State, of course, has lots of highways and not \ntoo many people.\n  I must tell you I am disappointed we are not moving along a little \nfaster on something I think is probably the highest priority that we \nhave now before we adjourn for the fall, the funding of our Interstate \nHighway Program in the ISTEA. I hope we do find a way to move forward \nwith it. It seems like it is discouraging to us, discouraging to the \nAmerican people, when we find ourselves in gridlock here in the Senate, \nnot able to do the kind of things we want to do, the kind of things \nthat people want us to do, the kind of things that we came here to do.\n  In the meantime, however, I did want to give my thanks to our \nchairman, Senator Chafee, and our ranking member, Senator Baucus, for \nthe work they have done to bring this bill to the floor. It is a bill \nthat is not easy to manage, certainly, because it affects everyone.\n  Everyone has a little different idea of what the formula distribution \nought to be. I understand that. But they have, with the support of \ntheir committee, come to this floor with a bill that is, I think, a \nvery good bill. It is one of the things that has changed America, this \nidea of having an Interstate Highway System. The current ISTEA has made \nsome important changes through the years on surface transportation, but \nnow we are moving forward into another changing time. The President has \nused for several years the metaphor of a bridge to the 21st century. \nThis is, literally, a bridge to the 21st century. This is literally a \nmovement through our transportation system to the 21st century.\n  No one would argue this bill is perfect. It does not fit everybody's \nview of what it ought to be, but none do. This one is good and it is \nclose. It will create some new rules of the road that I think serve the \nnational interest and will help us to build highways and bridges to the \n21st century.\n  First, ISTEA is what it says, a national interstate transportation \nsystem. That means that it goes clear across the country. That means a \ngreat deal to the people in Wyoming. We are what you call a bridge \nState. We are between the east and the west coast. We are between the \nheavily populated areas. Of course, to get from here to there, you have \nto go through Wyoming, or Kansas, either of us which is a great treat.\n  Interestingly enough, Wyoming taxpayers contribute more to the \nhighway trust fund per person than any taxpayers in the country--it is \nbecause we do have lots of roads--nearly $200 per person. Yet we have, \nas do others, a deteriorating highway system, and roads and bridges \nthat are, at best, in fair to poor condition.\n  We are not satisfying national needs, either. The U.S. Department of \nTransportation reports this country only invests about 70 percent of \nwhat it needs to be investing in the infrastructure to maintain it. \nThese shortfalls hurt us all as taxpayers. What we need is a set of \nefficient and well-maintained roads that interconnect cities. They are \nas important as cities. They are a part of how we export our goods and \ntransfer business throughout the country. ISTEA makes smooth movement \nof people and merchandise throughout the year.\n  We have a couple of areas that are difficult. One, of course, is to \nfind the level of spending that is correct. We have, through the years, \nnot spent as much on Federal highways as we take in in Federal highway \nfunds, for obvious reasons. One is to help balance the budget. There \nwill be arguments about that, and certainly we would like to spend more \nmoney, take more money out of the fund and put it into the place for \nwhich it was taxed. It will be controversial. And part of the problem \nis maintaining our commitment to a balanced budget. The other is the \nformula through which the dollars that are spent are allocated \nthroughout the country in various States. Each of us seeks to do the \nbest we can for our State. I understand that.\n  This bill, I believe, achieves a fair funding formula. It recognizes \na national system. There is an area which I have special concern that I \nintend to raise during the course of this and that is our Federal \nparks. We have considered Federal lands, and in the bill they are \nconsidered, including Indian reservations, including BLM lands, and it \nincludes forest lands. I have to tell you the one that I think stands \nout the most are the national parks, for several reasons.\n  One reason is forests and BLM get some cooperation and coordination \nwith counties and States to help build roads in those areas, but the \nnational parks do not. National parks are responsible for national park \nroads in national parks. They belong to all the people of this country. \nIn addition, those who drive in the parks, and there are many miles \nthere, each of them are taxed for every mile that goes into the Federal \nprogram. About 40 percent of existing parks and roads and bridges are \nin poor or failed condition. There is approximately $1.8 billion \nbacklog in national park needs for roads--$1.8 billion. Yellowstone \nPark, the largest park in our State and indeed the country, has road \nneeds of $250 million. It will receive only $8 million under the \ncurrent law. The U.S. Department of Transportation and the National \nPark Service estimate that a minimum of $161 million annually should be \nspent on park roads.\n\n  So we take a small step toward resolving that problem. I think we \nneed to take a larger one. I hope we will give some consideration to \nthat. I expect to explore those opportunities.\n  ISTEA II as it exists, however, will streamline the program structure \nthat we have, give State and local governments more flexibility. I \nthink that is extremely important. This is a very diverse country. Each \nof our needs are much different. The needs for highway construction in \nMontana and Wyoming are much different than they are in New Hampshire, \nFlorida, and New York. So we need to give to the States the flexibility \nto use those dollars to the best advantage.\n  The bill consolidates five major programs into three. I think that is \nuseful. It is efficient. It saves money. It provides more flexibility \nin the safety program, and I think that is very important. It will \nalways ensure that taxpayers get more for their fuel dollars. We need \nto do that.\n  I am very excited about ISTEA II. I think if we can get it on the \nfloor as we should it will get great support. It is my feeling we \nshould pass this bill through the Congress. I am not enthusiastic about \nthe proposition of a 6-month extension. I think State highway \ndepartments need to have security and knowledge of what will happen in \nthe future so they can make the contracts that are necessary to \nimplement ISTEA.\n  I particularly thank Senators Warner, Chafee, and Baucus for their \nleadership. They have done an excellent job. I intend to support the \nbill. Senator Baucus and Kempthorne and I introduced earlier an ISTEA \nreauthorization bill, STARS 2000, and much has been incorporated into \nthis bill. We appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, ISTEA II maintains the integrity of the original ISTEA \nlaw and improves it by more equitable investment in taxpayers' fees and \nensures people all across the country will have access to all of the \ncountry and increases the flexibility. I urge our colleagues to step \naside from all the difficulties in holding up this bill for other \nreasons and move forward with this. There are other things that are \nimportant, of course. This happens to be before the Senate. We ought to \ndo it. The reauthorization has expired. We need to go forward with it. \nThis is an excellent bill. I urge we move forward with it and approve \nit as it is.\n\n[[Page S10839]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming for his statement. I agree we ought to move forward. This is a \nbill of tremendous importance everywhere in the Nation. It affects \nevery State. I hope we can get to it and take up the amendments and \ndeal with them up or down and move on to completion of this \nlegislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, while the chairman is waiting for \nSenators to come over and give their views on the bill, I thought I \nwould explain the main provisions in our bill and how the formula works \nso that Senators will better understand these items. If at any time a \nSenator wants to come over and speak, I will be more than pleased to \ninterrupt my statement and let that Senator say whatever he or she \nwishes to say.\n  Mr. President, today we are currently operating under a 6-year ISTEA \nhighway bill. The bill before us is a new 6-year ISTEA bill. This new \nbill will bring up to date some of the provisions that are in the \ncurrent law. By up to date, I refer to the formulas. Believe it or not, \nour current formula uses some historical factors such as the 1980 \ncensus data, as well as the 1916 postal road miles. That outdated data \nis included in the current funding formula to allocate dollars among \nthe States. When writing the new bill, the committee thought it made a \nlot of sense to dispense with the use of the old data. After all, some \nof the data are pretty old. The 1980's is old enough, but the 1916 \npostal road miles is going a bit far.\n  The current ISTEA program also has a lot of accounts. Eleven to be \nexact. It is difficult for States to work with all the different \naccounts. And it is a bit complex. So the new bill we are debating \ntoday eliminates that old historical data and brings the funding \nformulas up to date. This new bill also reduces the number of accounts \nfrom 11 to 5. This provides States with a lot more flexibility.\n  Let me briefly discuss how the current formulation works. As I said, \nthe new bill has five major accounts. One is the Interstate National \nHighway System, which has two components--the Interstate component as \nwell as the National Highway System component. Another is the Surface \nTransportation Program and another is the Congestion Mitigation and Air \nQuality Program, more commonly known inside the beltway as CMAQ. And we \nhave two equity accounts to kind of even things out for States.\n  Let me say a little bit about the Interstate National Highway System \naccount. It has two components--the interstate component and the \nNational Highway System component. We all know what Interstates are; \nthat is pretty obvious. Let me say that the National Highway System \ncomponent is essentially our other principal Federal roads. What do we \ndo with the interstate components? How are dollars allocated to States \nwith respect to the Interstate System that they have? It is very \nsimple. Fifty percent of the formula for interstate use is interstate \nlane miles. So the more interstate lane miles a State has, the more \ndollars that State is going to receive under our formula in the bill.\n  Well, what about the States that have, say, not quite so many \ninterstate lane miles, but the ones they do have are traveled very \nheavily? Those States feel they should receive adequate interstate \nfunds because their maintenance costs are higher because they have more \ntraffic on their interstates. We take care of that. Fifty percent of \nthe interstate component is lane miles and the other 50 percent is what \nwe call interstate vehicle miles traveled, otherwise known as VMT. So \nthere is a balance here with respect to the interstate dollars that are \nsent out to States. Fifty percent of the interstate component is based \nupon the number of interstate lane miles that a State has. This helps a \nState like my State of Montana which has a lot of interstate lane \nmiles. For States without a lot of interstate lane miles, the other 50 \npercent measures congestion as vehicle miles traveled. So my State does \nnot have a lot of vehicle miles traveled. Contrast that with the State, \nsay, of my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island, the chairman of \nthe committee. I suppose he does not have a lot of lane miles, but his \nvehicle miles traveled is probably high in Rhode Island compared with \nmy State of Montana. That is how we allocate dollars that go to \ninterstate highways. Virtually all of that money is for maintenance, \nbecause we have completed the interstate construction in our country. \nThose dollars go to maintenance. And again, we feel we have a fair \nformula that measures the extent and use of the interstate system. I \nshould mention that about $6 billion a year that goes into the \ninterstate account.\n\n  The other portion of the Interstate National Highway System we call \nthe National Highway System component. That is for non-interstate \nhighways or highways that have a lot of traffic. Again, $6 billion a \nyear goes into the National Highway System component. The formula for \ndividing this money among the States is also fair. It measures the \nextent and use of the other highways. Twenty percent of it is \napportioned to what we call principal arterial lane miles. Twenty-nine \npercent is apportioned according to principal arterial vehicle miles \ntraveled. So a larger percentage goes to those States that have more \ntraffic on principal arterials. Eighteen percent is allocated according \nto what we call arterial bridge square foot deficiencies. That is, if \nyou look at bridges that are deficient and calculate the number of \nsquare feet on the bridge, 18 percent of the dollars in our bill in the \nNational Highway System account go to States that have those \ndeficiencies. Twenty-four percent is allocated according to the State's \ndiesel fuel consumption. That is to measure truck use because the large \ntrucks that travel our highways do pound our highways much more than \naverage cars. Those States that have a lot of diesel fuel consumption \nare probably States that have a lot of truck use and, therefore, need \nmore dollars to maintain their highways. Twenty-four percent of the \nNational Highway System component is divided according to diesel fuel \nconsumption. Nine percent is allocated according to what we call \nprincipal arterial lane miles per person. This measures the population \ndensity on principal arterials. So that is the first main component of \nthe funding formulas in this bill --the Interstate National Highway \nSystem.\n  Let me mention the next major portion in this bill. It is called the \nSurface Transportation Program. The Surface Transportation Program is \nused for other transportation needs, and it is about $7 billion a year; \n20 percent is allocated according to Federal aid lane miles, 30 percent \naccording to Federal aid VMT, vehicle miles traveled--again, congested \nStates--25 percent to Federal aid for bridge square foot deficiency, \nand 25 percent according to contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. \nThat totals $7 billion. Again, that is the Surface Transportation \nProgram.\n  The next major program is the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality \nProgram. This is designed to allow our highway spending to merge, in \nsome sense, with our Clean Air Act. That is, we want our highway \nspending to be planned to meet our environmental concerns. CMAQ helps \nStates meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. We don't want our \nbill to encourage States to be not in compliance with the Clean Air \nAct. Rather, we would like our bill to encourage cities and States to \nbe in compliance with the standards in the Clean Air Act.\n  So this bill spends about $1.15 billion a year, according to the \nseverity of air quality nonattainment for ozone and carbon monoxide, \nand also for populations living in nonattainment areas. I must say, \nMadam President, that ISTEA, this bill, led the way on programs like \ncongestion mitigation air quality, otherwise known as CMAQ, and \nflexibility for States. The person who is principally responsible is \nSenator Moynihan from New York. When he wrote the ISTEA legislation \nabout 6 years ago, which we are currently operating under, he was the \nmain person that added those provisions in there.\n  So I might repeat, Madam President, that our current bill, ISTEA II, \nuses updated data, not old historical data,\n\n[[Page S10840]]\n\n1980 census data and 1916 postal road data. Rather, we use the latest \ncensus data available each year. We also use data based upon current \nfuel consumption because we think that is somewhat of an indication--\nnot a perfect indication--of how much State highways get \nused, therefore, the number of dollars that State would need for \nmaintenance and upkeep.\n\n  I think this is a pretty good formula. It is one that is fair to \ndifferent regions of the country. We have a very diverse nation. There \nis a wide variety of transportation needs among the States. From Maine, \nthe State of the current occupant of the chair, to California to Nevada \nor my State of Montana, every State is different. We have done our very \nbest to try to balance the different needs. I think that passage of \nthis bill out of committee by a vote of 18 to 0 somewhat reflects the \nviews of the Senators on that committee that this is a balanced and \nfair bill. Those eighteen Senators come from the West, from the East, \nfrom the South. We have Senators from so-called donee States and \nSenators from so-called donor States. I think we have done a good job.\n  I hope that Senators who have ideas on how to further improve this \nbill will come down and speak with the chairman of the committee and \nwith me because we are more than open to ways to improve this bill.\n  Madam President, I will pause now to allow Senators to come down and \nspeak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters \nwritten by the Congressional Budget Office be printed in the Record. \nThe first letter dated October 7, 1997, includes the cost estimate for \nS. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, \nthe ISTEA bill we are considering now, as reported by the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  This letter points to certain technical violations of the Budget Act \nin S. 1173. We have made adjustments in the committee substitute for S. \n1173 which was agreed to on October 8 to correct those deficiencies.\n  So that is the first letter, Madam President.\n  The second letter, dated October 6, 1997, includes more detailed \ninformation on the Minimum Allocation Program, one of the components of \nthe Federal Aid Highway Program that is exempt from the annual \nobligation limitation. The Committee on Environment and Public Works \nused the information in the October 6 Congressional Budget Office \nletter to make the technical budget corrections found in the committee \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1173.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1997.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1173, the \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Clare \n     Doherty (for federal costs), Pearl Richardson (for federal \n     revenues), and Marc Nicole (for the state and local impact).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Paul Van de Water\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n    s. 1173 intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1997\n\n(As reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on \n                            October 1, 1997)\n\n                                Summary\n\n       S. 1173 would reauthorize the Intermodeal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and would \n     provide $145.3 billion in contract authority for the Federal \n     Highway Administration's (FHWA's) Federal-Aid Highways \n     program for the fiscal years 1998 through 2003. In addition \n     to providing contract authority, S. 1173 would authorize the \n     appropriation of $2.1 billion for programs managed by the \n     Department of Transportation for the same six-year period. \n     The bill would create a new credit program that would likely \n     result in an increase in tax-exempt financing, and a \n     consequent loss of federal revenues. Because S. 1173 would \n     affect direct spending and receipts, pay-as-you go procedures \n     would apply to the bill.\n       S. 1173 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments except as a condition of receiving federal \n     assistance or participating in a voluntary federal program.\n\n               Description of the bill's major provisions\n\n       S. 1173 would reauthorize many of the existing components \n     of the Federal-Aid Highways program and would authorize some \n     new activities within the program. Over the 1998-2003 period, \n     contract authority under the bill would total $137.5 billion \n     for Federal-Aid activities that are subject to annual \n     obligation limitations in appropriation acts, and $7.7 \n     billion for activities that are exempt from such obligation \n     limitations. In addition, the bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of $2.1 billion over the same six-year period \n     for new highway-related spending.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                         By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                                              ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   1997         1998         1999         2000         2001         2002         2003\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline spending under current law:\n    Estimated budget authority \\1\\...........................       22,428       23,047       23,378       23,884       24,385       24,900       25,425\n    Estimated outlays........................................        2,057        2,052        1,650        1,346        1,162        1,064          980\nProposed changes:\n    Estimated budget authority...............................            0          665          238          -85         -324         -283           59\n    Estimated outlays........................................            0           73          245          333          407          482          552\nTotal spending under S. 1173:\n    Estimated budget authority...............................       22,428       23,712       23,617       23,800       24,060       24,617       25,484\n    Estimated outlays........................................        2,057        2,126        1,895        1,679        1,570        1,546        1,532\n \n                                                            SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending under current law:\n    Budget authority.........................................          364            0            0            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated outlays \\2\\....................................       18,366       18,595       18,853       19,242       19,670       20,215       20,755\nProposed changes:\n    Estimated authorization level............................            0          190          182          382          382          432          482\n    Estimated outlays \\3\\....................................            0          532        2,184        2,904        2,938        2,841        2,884\nSpending under S. 1173:\n    Estimated authorization level............................          364          190          182          382          382          432          482\n    Estimated outlays........................................       18,366       19,127       21,037       22,146       22,607       23,056       23,639\n \n\n[[Page S10841]]\n\n \n                                                                   CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated Revenues \\4\\.......................................            0           -1           -3           -9          -16          -22          -28\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1997 level is the amount of contract authority provided under ISTEA. The 1998-2003 levels are the amounts included in CBO's March 1997 baseline,\n  which assumes annual increases for anticipated inflation.\n\\2\\ Outlays from the mandatory contract authority for programs that are subject to annual obligation limitations, and from discretionary appropriations.\n\\3\\ Outlays from new authorizations in addition to the programs subject to annual obligation limitations.\n\\4\\ Minus signs denote a loss of revenue.\n\n       CBO estimates that spending under the bill would total \n     about $142 billion over the 1998-2003 period. Of that amount, \n     $131.6 billion would be discretionary outlays and $10.3 \n     billion would be direct spending. Of the $131.6 billion in \n     total estimated outlays subject to appropriation, about $129 \n     billion would come from contract authority, and $2.6 billion \n     would come from amounts authorized to be appropriated by S. \n     1173 or already appropriated in prior years. Under the CBO \n     baseline, direct spending outlays would total $8.3 billion \n     over the 1998-2003 period (about $2 billion less than the \n     six-year total for S. 1173), and discretionary outlays from \n     contract authority would total about $117 billion over the \n     same period (approximately $12 billion less than under S. \n     1173). The costs of this legislation fall within budget \n     function 400 (transportation).\n       Enacting S. 1173 would also affect revenues. The Joint \n     Committee on Taxation estimates that the new credit program \n     would increase tax-exempt debt, resulting in a loss of \n     revenues to the federal government totaling $79 million over \n     the 1998-2003 period.\n\n                           Basis of estimate\n\n       Enacting S. 1173 would affect direct spending, spending \n     subject to appropriation, and revenues. In particular, the \n     bill would provide $145.3 billion in contract authority, \n     which is a form of direct spending, for the Federal-Aid \n     Highways program. Most of the outlays from this contract \n     authority would be controlled by annual obligation \n     limitations imposed through the appropriation process. All of \n     the projected outlays controlled by appropriation action, \n     whether from appropriated budget authority or annually \n     limited contract authority, are shown in the table under \n     ``Spending Subject to Appropriation.'' Because a portion of \n     the new minimum guarantee program would be exempt from \n     obligation limitations, some of the outlays for that program \n     as well as all of the outlays for other exempt programs are \n     included in the table under ``Direct Spending.''\n       Direct spending\n       S. 1173 would authorize funding for a new Federal-Aid \n     Highways activity that would be partly exempt from obligation \n     limitations--the minimum guarantee program. Under this bill, \n     a portion of the minimum guarantee spending would be subject \n     to annual obligation limitations and the remainder would be \n     exempt. Outlays from the exempt portion of the minimum \n     guarantee program would be direct spending.\n       Under the baseline, CBO assumes continued funding for the \n     minimum allocation program (which would be replaced by \n     minimum guarantee funding), one of the exempt programs under \n     current law. Based on projections from the FHWA that CBO used \n     in its March 1997 baseline, the estimated funding for minimum \n     allocation would be $4.1 billion over the 1998-2003 period--\n     $639 million for 1998, $654 million for 1999, $670 million in \n     2000, $687 million in 2001, $704 million in 2002, and $721 \n     million in 2003.\n       Under the formula contained in S. 1173, we expect that the \n     minimum guarantee program would cost more than the minimum \n     allocation program. CBO assumes that this new program would \n     have the same obligation rates and outlay rates as assumed \n     for minimum allocation. Based on FHWA projections, CBO \n     estimates that funding for the portion of the minimum \n     guarantee program that would be exempt from obligation \n     limitations would total $5.7 billion over six years--$896 \n     million in 1998, $898 million in 1999, $909 million in 2000, \n     $926 million in 2001, $991 million in 2002, and $1,096 \n     million in 2003.\n       The emergency relief program, the other Federal-Aid \n     activity under current law that is exempt from obligation \n     limitations, is permanently authorized. S. 1173 would not \n     change the emergency relief program, which receives $100 \n     million each year.\n       For the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge project, S. 1173 \n     would provide contract authority of $100 million a year for \n     1998 and 1999, $125 million in 2000, $175 million in 2001, \n     and $200 million a year for 2002 and 2003. The bill would \n     exempt that spending from obligation limitations, so outlays \n     relating to the bridge project would be direct spending. CBO \n     estimates that outlays for the bridge project would total \n     about $640 million over the 1998-2003 period.\n       The contract authority authorized for transportation \n     infrastructure finance and innovation credit would also be \n     exempt from obligation limitations. CBO estimates that the \n     outlays for this new credit activity would total about $470 \n     million over the 1998-2003 period. The authorized funding for \n     the new credit program is assumed to be for the costs of the \n     subsidies to support the direct loans and loan guarantees \n     that would be provided under the bill. CBO estimates the \n     subsidy amount provided for each year would be spent over a \n     two-year period. (Subsidy outlays are recorded in the year \n     that loans are disbursed; we assume that loans obligated or \n     guaranteed under S. 1173 would be disbursed--on average--over \n     two years.)\n       Spending subject to appropriation\n       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that the amounts \n     authorized for highway programs would be appropriated by or \n     near the start of each fiscal year. Outlay estimates for all \n     of the spending subject to appropriation are based on \n     historical spending rates for the affected FHWA and NHTSA \n     programs. Because most of the outlays from contract authority \n     are governed by obligation limitations in appropriation acts, \n     they are discretionary and so are included in the table as \n     estimated outlays subject to appropriation. To estimate such \n     outlays, CBO used the obligation limitations specified in the \n     bill.\n       One of the new programs that would be controlled by \n     Federal-Aid obligation limitations is safety belt incentive \n     grants. A provision in the bill would require the Secretary \n     of Transportation to calculate the budgetary savings relating \n     to federal medical costs, including savings in the Medicare \n     and Medicaid programs attributable to increased seat belt \n     usage, and distribute that savings to the states that had \n     caused those budgetary savings. CBO estimates that there \n     would be no significant budgetary savings from this provision \n     because the likelihood that the provisions of the bill would \n     increase seat belt usage significantly is small and the \n     impact of any change in seat belt usage on Medicare and \n     Medicaid spending would likely be negligible and difficult to \n     identify. CBO assumes that states would only receive the \n     authorized amounts in the bill with no additional funds from \n     budgetary savings.\n       S. 1173 would give states some additional flexibility in \n     the use of their Federal-Aid Highways dollars, especially \n     funds for the National Highway System (NHS), and the Surface \n     Transportation Program (STP). The bill would give states the \n     ability to put a significant portion of their Federal-Aid \n     Highways dollars in a state infrastructure bank (SIB). Under \n     the bill, a SIB is an infrastructure investment fund that \n     could be created at the state or local level to make loans \n     and provide other forms of financial assistance to surface \n     transportation projects. In addition, a SIB could enhance \n     credit, serve as a capital reserve, subsidize interest rates, \n     ensure letters of credit, and provide security for debt \n     financing. The bill includes language ensuring that the \n     federal disbursements to SIBs do not exceed more than 20 \n     percent of the total federal funds obligated annually for \n     such purposes.\n       S. 1173 would give states the flexibility to use NHS and \n     STP funds for capital improvements for Amtrak or a publicly \n     owned passenger line, publicly owned intracity or intercity \n     passenger rail or bus terminals, capital improvements for \n     intelligent transportation systems, and publicly owned \n     magnetic levitation projects. Given this additional \n     flexibility, outlays could occur at faster rates for the \n     Federal-Aid Highways program than assumed in the CBO \n     baseline. The outlay pattern assumed for the Federal-Aid \n     program is rather slow, with outlays for each year's \n     obligations spent over nine years because of the significant \n     amount of capital expenditures within the program. If a \n     significant number of states were to spend a large portion of \n     their Federal-Aid Highways funds on Amtrak or other passenger \n     rail expenditures, magnetic levitation projects, or other \n     nontraditional Federal-Aid expenditures, the funds would be \n     spent more quickly than under the traditional program \n     structure.\n       S. 1173 would authorize the appropriation of $2.1 billion \n     over the 1998-2003 period for new highway programs. The bill \n     would authorize appropriations over the six-year period \n     totaling $750 million for grants to states for trade corridor \n     and border crossing grants, $300 million for the joint \n     partnership for advanced vehicles program, $30 million for \n     the transportation and environmental cooperative, and $20 \n     million for developing and maintaining a reporting system for \n     excise taxes on motor fuels. In addition, the bill would \n     authorize a total appropriation of $950 million for \n     magnetic levitation grants from 2000 through 2003.\n       S. 1173 would require the FHWA to conduct studies and \n     publish subsequent reports. It would require the Secretary of \n     Transportation to report on the extent and use by states of \n     uniformed police officers on Federal-Aid Highway construction \n     projects. It would also require the Secretary to report \n     annually on the rates of obligation of funds apportioned \n     under the Federal-Aid Highway program. A third provision \n     would direct the Secretary to submit a report on the \n     activities and results of the new federal credit assistance \n     activity under the bill. Based on information from the FHWA, \n     CBO estimates that the cost of completing the studies and \n     preparing the reports would be less than\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\n     $100,000 per year. In addition, the bill would require the \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) to complete three highway \n     studies and subsequently publish reports. According to GAO, \n     the cost of completing these studies and reports would not be \n     significant.\n       Revenues\n       Subtitle C, Chapter 2 of S. 1173 provides for a federal \n     credit program for such facilities as border crossings, \n     multistate trade corridors, intermodal facilities, toll roads \n     and other facilities that generate their own revenue streams \n     through user charges. The credit program, which is intended \n     to complement other funding and to leverage private co-\n     investment, could include secured loans, loan guarantees, and \n     lines of credit, up to a maximum amount of credit ranging \n     from $1.2 billion in 1998 to $2.0 billion in 2003. That \n     program could leverage new issues of tax-exempt bonds and \n     result in a net increase in the volume of outstanding tax-\n     exempt debt. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that \n     this program would result in revenue losses totaling $79 \n     million over the 1998-2003 period.\n\n                      Pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for \n     legislation affecting direct spending or receipts. CBO's \n     estimate of the bill's impact on outlays from direct spending \n     is summarized in the following table for fiscal years 1998 \n     through 2007. The table also contains estimates of changes in \n     revenues (governmental receipts) provided by the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation. For purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-\n     go procedures, only the effects in the budget year and the \n     succeeding four years are counted. Also, only direct spending \n     outlays are subject to pay-as-you-go requirements; the \n     discretionary outlays from contract authority subject to \n     obligation limitations are not included as pay-as-you-go \n     effects because those outlays are controlled by appropriation \n     acts.\n\n                                                   SUMMARY OF EFFECTS ON DIRECT SPENDING AND RECEIPTS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                    By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays..................................        73       245       333       407       482       552       517       384       361       336\nChanges in receipts.................................        -1        -3        -9       -16       -22       -28       -34       -40       -46       -51\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n              Intergovernmental and private-sector impact\n\n       S. 1173 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on \n     state, local, or tribal governments except as a condition of \n     receiving federal assistance or participating in a voluntary \n     federal program.

I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cochran pertaining to the introduction of S. 1296 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as a member of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works for nigh on to 21 years now, I rise with a \ngreat sense of pleasure and even pride at what our committee has done \nin the legislation before you, the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1997, known informally as ISTEA II. It is a work of \ngreat complexity, yet clarity of principle. It is a tribute to our \nchairman, Senator Chafee, to his distinguished and wholly informed, \ncarefully attentive ranking member, Senator Max Baucus of Montana. One \nwould not wish to overlook the work of Senator John Warner of Virginia, \nwhose subcommittee had to produce this measure. Nine months ago--and \nthis might be an augury for many of the matters that remain for the \nSenate in this session--9 months ago it was thought that this bill \nwould bring about some of the fiercest interregional battles of this \ntime in our national life. And, yet, to the amazement of all and to the \nvery great credit of the managers of the bill, it was reported out of \ncommittee unanimously. The committee has a long-standing tradition of \nbipartisanship, which is always challenged when the elemental and \nlegitimate interests of different regions, and different States, come \ninto play. It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that the authors \nof the bill chose to give it the same name, the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act, which we gave to the bill in 1991, ISTEA \nI, if you like. Robert A. Roe of New Jersey, then chairman of the House \nPublic Works Committee and a public servant of the highest capacity, \nand I, as the person charged with the task in the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, developed principles for the first \nhighway bill to mark the post-Interstate era. And here I would like to \nmake a point to which I will return at the conclusion of my remarks\n\n  The point is, Mr. President, that the Department of Transportation in \n1990-91 faced the unavoidable fact that the Interstate and Defense \nHighway System, the Eisenhower Interstate System, as it was named at \nthe behest of our beloved John Heinz, was finished. It was built, and \nthey could think of no other thing, no better move, no different task, \nthan to build another.\n  I think the distinguished managers will recall, as I will not forget, \nthe occasion on which we were summoned to an event in the auditorium at \nthe Executive Office Building. President Bush came, and stood on the \nstage by a great map of the United States with white background and red \nlines, just moving here and there, up and down, right, left. I thought, \n``Oh, my Heaven, is this the new interstate map?'' However, I was \nreassured finally by the then Secretary of Transportation, that no, \nthese were just illustrative lines drawn, presumptively for aesthetic \neffect, as might be an abstract expressionist painting exhibited in New \nYork's Museum of Modern Art in the 1980's. They had no idea what to do \nand had no instinct, save to go on doing what they had done.\n  Congress thought differently. Congress chose, in a cooperative mode, \nto devise the first post-Interstate era transportation program for the \ncountry.\n  The Interstate System was a long time in the making, Mr. President. \nIt began as a concept at the 1939 World's Fair. I may be one of the \nonly Members of the body who went to that fair, which was in Flushing \nMeadows in\n\n[[Page S10843]]\n\nQueens, NY. The General Motors Co., had an exhibit which was the great \nsensation and joy of the fair. It was called ``Futurama.''\n  Under a great plexidome, it showed a map of a portion of the United \nStates with Chevrolets and Buicks driving steadily through these great \ndivided highways with cloverleaf intersections, passing through \nmountains, stopping, in one instance, at the 40th floor, as I recall, \nof the Empire State Building. It was just a huge success as displays \ngo.\n  In 1944, President Roosevelt, having in mind the possibility that the \nDepression of the 1930's would return at the end of the Second World \nWar--this was a widely held belief--had Congress authorize an \ninterstate highway system to be built when the war was over and peace \nresumed.\n  This was done. The Interstate System was authorized. No funds were \nmade available. Then President Eisenhower came to office. One of the \ncurrent ideas was the creation of an Interstate system. He appointed a \ncommission to look into it, because this had a particular hold on his \npersonal experience.\n  His first command in 1919 had been to assume that enemy action had \ndestroyed the national railroad system, and he was to take a convoy of \nmilitary trucks from Fort Meade, on the outskirts of Washington, to the \nPresidio in California. He got there, but it was a tale to tell, and he \nwould tell it. It is a wonderful passage in a book he put out, \n``Stories I Like To Tell.''\n  He crossed the Mississippi River to the Pacific. He averaged about 4 \nmiles an hour. That wouldn't do if, indeed, there was a military \nemergency. And so the Interstate System became the Interstate Defense \nSystem. A dedicated gasoline tax was imposed--this was very much the \nwork of Jim Wright of Texas--and we began the largest engineering \npublic works project in the history of the world.\n  Indeed, we had already begun it in New York State where Governor \nDewey, in 1946, simply took it upon himself to build such a road with \nfunding from the sales of bonds. He built this road from the outskirts \nof New York City across the path of the New York Central Railroad and \nthe Erie Canal to Buffalo and down to Pennsylvania. It is called the \nNew York State Thruway. And the inspired civil engineer who built it, \nBertram Tallamy, was asked down by the Eisenhower administration to \ntake over the small Bureau of Public Roads in the Department of \nCommerce to build this national system. Previously, the Bureau of \nPublic Roads managed a very small Federal program, mostly involved with \nwhat we call farm-to-market roads for rural areas.\n\n  The Interstate System was a vast success, in many ways too much of a \nsuccess. It changed the outlay of the American economy, the regions, \nthe regional distribution. Cities emptied out, suburbs grew up, \nfactories moved, and a great change took place in our system. The use \nof automobiles doubled, and then redoubled. The time came, however, \nwhen this Interstate System, which really was a misnomer because most \nof the expanse was in and around cities, was finished and the time had \ncome to do something more.\n  The new legislation in 1991 established the principle of a balanced \nnational transportation investment policy, an intermodal policy to \nimprove mobility and access to jobs. Because as jobs left the inner \ncities all over our country, there was no public transportation \navailable to people who didn't have automobiles.\n  It provided for environmental protection. Sometime in the 1970's, we \nbegan to notice the phenomenon of air pollution in our cities. A \nscientist at the University of California identified the process by \nwhich smog is formed. Air quality became a genuine and urgent issue. We \nsaid we would look at the environment generally and see to it that \nlocal communities participated in decisions affecting their \nenvironment.\n  This, Mr. President, sounds like a routine statement. But before \nISTEA, participation by local communities was not a routine event for \nour National Highway Program. These plans were drawn up in Washington \nand administered from highway departments in State capitals. Local \ngovernments had little or no say. The money, the 90-10 money, the 95-5 \nmoney, could scarcely be resisted and decisions were centralized at the \nState level in a way that would surprise many who began the program.\n  If you would like to see an example of devolution, look to what our \ncommittee has done in these two bills in moving decisionmaking from the \nStates to regional and local groups. In the hearings that have been \nheld all over the country, there has been, as I understand, very strong \nendorsement of this legislation on this ground.\n  A hearing held at the Alexander Hamilton Custom House in Bowling \nGreen, NY, by Senator Warner brought the Governor of New Jersey, the \nGovernor of New York, the mayor of New York City, persons from the \nsurrounding counties in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York to say \nthis has been a revelation to us that we could have something to say in \nthe expenditure of Federal moneys. Federal funds didn't just have to go \nfor another highway, there was something called efficiency involved.\n  We would say in 1991 that there is no such thing as a free lunch and \nthere is no such thing as a free way. We have to introduce pricing \nprinciples where the users of the highways pay tolls, varied by hour of \nthe day or night. Electronics could be introduced to efficiently do \nthat.\n  At the time of the 1991 legislation, at the Triborough Bridge in New \nYork, which had been opened in time for the 1939 World's Fair, there \nstill were men, now women as well, standing at toll booths collecting \ntolls. Sixty years had gone by and not a bit of productivity had been \nintroduced into the system. Today, you go through with something called \nEZ Pass, which electronically collects the toll, and it has quite \ntransformed the system.\n  We talked about air quality. We talked about efficiency. We talked \nabout the need to maintain existing infrastructure, and we have been \nsuccessful. The present bill before you, ISTEA II, contains those \nprinciples, reasserts them and will continue them.\n\n  The bill does another important thing, and more important to some \nStates than to others. The 1991 legislation provided that States that \nhad built highways that were contributed to the Interstate System would \nbe reimbursed for the expense. This was clearly contemplated by the \noriginal authors of the Eisenhower legislation--a committee headed by \nGen. Lucius D. Clay. The bill before you continues that principle by \nincluding the interstate reimbursement program in the base amounts paid \nto States under the new formulas.\n  This is especially important to New York State, which was authorized \nto obtain $5 billion over the course of 15 years, and has already \nreceived some $600 million. The installments are about a third of a \nbillion each year.\n  There are other important problems yet to be resolved. There is an \nissue of the transit title of our bill. Transit is one aspect of \nnational legislation in which one region will be very much more \ninvolved than in others.\n  For example, a third of the transit rides in the United States are in \nthe New York region. Yet we receive only 18 percent of the funds, \ndespite having twice that much transit ridership. On balance, we do not \nget much in the way of flood plain protection. Our agricultural \nsubsidies are minimal. Our defense outlays are almost nonexistent. \nTransit is one of the key Federal programs that addresses New York's \nneeds.\n  We are a big nation, and not every part is exactly like another part. \nI see the brilliant chairman of our committee has returned. I want to \ntell him how grateful I am to him. But I say that if the transit \nformulas in this bill become radically different from those which \nexisted for many, many years, then it will be difficult for any number \nof us to support the final legislation. This need not happen, and it \nshould not.\n  We have a bill here before us from a unanimous committee that can \nreally solidify an enormous and important change. We are talking about \ntransportation policy for the next century. It is not going to be good \nenough just to go on building those superhighways of this century.\n  One of the measures that inspired us in 1991 was a report by a \ncommittee that had been established by the State of Florida to look \ninto what would it\n\n[[Page S10844]]\n\nrequire to accommodate the automobile traffic from Miami to the Disney \ncomplex in northern Florida by the year 2020. The report said it would \nrequire 40 lanes of interstate highway. Well, you keep that up and \nthere is nothing left of Florida. You have to do better, and you have \nto think differently than in the past. Today we must increase \ninnovation and investment in infrastructure, while including the \nabsolutely essential Federal labor protections that are written into \nlaw today and have been, in some cases, for 60 years.\n  Here, Mr. President, I have one final thing I would like to say. I do \nnot find any pleasure in it, but from time to time such statements are \nnecessary. I am not sure that the Department of Transportation is able \nto think differently. It is an organization created with one program to \nadminister, and that one program having concluded, it seems incapable \nof doing anything else.\n  As I said at the outset, in 1990, having completed the Interstate \nSystem, the only thing the Department of Transportation could think to \ndo, was to build another. In our legislation in 1991, without meaning \nto be particularly partisan, we provided $725 million to build some \nprototype magnetic levitation trains and other intelligent \ntransportation systems to get us past the point of a highway automobile \ndriver.\n  Magnetic levitation--it is the most important scientific idea in the \nhistory of ground transportation since the wheel. It is the first mode \nof transportation since persons got up on their hind feet, you might \nsay, which does not depend on friction. It is a frictionless mode of \nground transportation. The simple principles are magnets which lift a \nvehicle and moves it as if it were flying on the rails.\n\n  The idea, sir, was invented on the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, which \nconnects Long Island with the mainland, by a young nuclear engineer, \nstill thriving, working at the Brookhaven Laboratory, who was going \nback to MIT. As you can do only when you are a nuclear engineer and you \nare 26 years old, he thought up maglev, between the time he got on the \nbridge and the time he got off. A colleague patented it the other day.\n  I do not assert that it is the necessary new mode of transportation \nwithin city regions or in densely populated corridors. But I do say, \nsir, that they have a train running in Japan now that just broke some \nnew speed records.\n  By pure chance, this morning I received an invitation to the opening \nof the German system this next spring. It was in this morning's mail. I \nhave been on that system. I believe our distinguished chairman has also \nbeen there. In Germany, for what it is worth, they have decided to no \nlonger have intracountry air service. They will move by new high-speed \ntechnology such as this.\n  Sir, in the 6 years since ISTEA, the DOT did nothing, or nothing that \nI know of--and I will be very pleased to retract these remarks if they \nare inaccurate--to advance maglev. They pour concrete, or rather they \nknow the contractors that pour the concrete for them. When an \ninstitution gets so fixed on one mission that it cannot adapt to a new \nchallenge, to a new time, some of my radical friends in this body, and \nperhaps most especially in the other body, ought to ask whether that \ninstitution is really necessary. Under the legislation as written, this \nprogram could be run from an office of perhaps 10 people in the Office \nof Management and Budget, or what you will.\n  In the present legislation, the chairman, the ranking member, and \nSenator Warner, also said: We will give another try. And $30 million \nhas been provided for the program. And another $920 million is \nauthorized. It could be done.\n  We are entitled to hear from the Secretary of Transportation whether \nhe intends to try? Does he have anybody in the employ of the Department \nwho knows what the Congress is proposing? Is there any explanation why \nno effort was made to spend the money previously provided for maglev? \nYou know, organizations go brain dead, sir, in the history of the \nworld, in the history of governments that cannot adapt to new \ncircumstances.\n  I hope that the Department of Transportation would hear what was \nsaid. In that first legislation, we wrote at the outset a set of \nprinciples about efficiency, adaptability, local involvement, \nintermodalism because it seemed necessary. It was stipulated in law, \nblack and white law, that these principles should be printed and every \nmember of the Department of Transportation be given a copy. It was \nstipulated in law, black and white law, that the principles be printed \nin larger form and posted in every office of the Department. But I wish \nI could say there has been more of a response.\n  I hope I have not done an injustice to individuals in the Department \nwho have tried. But in fact, sir, we have little to show. And that is \nnot good enough. I do not think it is good enough for the managers or \nfor the Congress. They have done their work. Congress will have made \nthis law. It is now for the Executive to see that the law is faithfully \nexecuted.\n  We have had a good beginning. But we are no way at the conclusion. We \nare not as far as we had hoped to be, but this continues us in the \ndirection we set out in. I can only once again congratulate the \nesteemed Senator from Rhode Island, his colleague from Montana, and our \ncolleague from Virginia. They have brought to the Senate floor a bill \nwith the unanimous support of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. What 9 months ago seemed something not possible, surely not \nprobable, has now been done. It is an effort that should be \nacknowledged, praised and rewarded.\n  If I may speak just briefly in the colloquial, there is an old saying \nwhich, translated from the Gaelic, says, ``If you want an audience, \nstart a fight.'' Well, yes, true enough. But if you want legislation, \nfind unanimity, find consensus.\n\n  The managers have done this. I just want to congratulate them once \nmore. I know I shall have the opportunity when the final bill comes to \nthe floor.\n  I ask that the principles of the 1997 legislation as printed be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nHouse Report 102-404--Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \nof 1991\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     DECLARATION OF POLICY: INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION \n                   EFFICIENCY ACT.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to develop a National \n     Intermodal Transportation System that is economically \n     efficient and environmentally sound, provides the foundation \n     for the Nation to compete in the global economy, and will \n     move people and goods in an energy efficient manner.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System shall consist \n     of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected \n     manner, including the transportation systems of the future, \n     to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while \n     promoting economic development and supporting the Nation's \n     preeminent position in international commerce.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System shall include \n     a National Highway System which consists of the National \n     System of Interstate and Defense Highways and those principal \n     arterial roads which are essential for interstate and \n     regional commerce and travel, national defense, intermodal \n     transfer facilities, and international commerce and border \n     crossings.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System shall include \n     significant improvements in public transportation necessary \n     to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy \n     conservation, international competitiveness, and mobility for \n     elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and economically \n     disadvantaged persons in urban and rural areas of the \n     country.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System shall provide \n     improved access to ports and airports, the Nation's link to \n     world commerce.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System shall give \n     special emphasis to the contributions of the transportation \n     sectors to increased productivity growth. Social benefits \n     must be considered with particular attention to the external \n     benefits of reduced air pollution, reduced traffic congestion \n     and other aspects of the quality of life in the United \n     States.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System must be \n     operated and maintained with insistent attention to the \n     concepts of innovation, competition, energy efficiency, \n     productivity, growth, and accountability. Practices that \n     resulted in the lengthy and overly costly construction of the \n     Interstate and Defense Highway System must be confronted and \n     ceased.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System shall be \n     adapted to ``intelligent vehicles'', ``magnetic levitation \n     systems'', and other new technologies wherever feasible and \n     economical, with benefit cost estimates given special \n     emphasis concerning safety considerations and techniques for \n     cost allocation.\n\n[[Page S10845]]\n\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System, where \n     appropriate, will be financed, as regards Federal \n     apportionments and reimbursements, by the Highway Trust Fund. \n     Financial assistance will be provided to State and local \n     governments and their instrumentalities to help implement \n     national goals relating to mobility for elderly persons, \n     persons with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged \n     persons.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System must be the \n     centerpiece of a national investment commitment to create the \n     new wealth of the Nation for the 21st century.\n       The Secretary shall distribute copies of the Declaration of \n     Policy to each employee of the Department of Transportation \n     and shall ensure that such Declaration of Policy is posted in \n     all offices of the Department of Transportation.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from New York for his very fine comments. Coming from him they \nmean a lot. As we all know, he was the principal author of the bill \nthat emerged from the conference in 1997, the so-called ISTEA \nlegislation. It is due, principally, to Senator Moynihan, that that \nbill came out as it did. All of us were there. The Senator from Montana \nand I and others were there during those negotiations. The Senator from \nNew York was not the chairman of that conference, the chairman was the \nRepresentative from New Jersey, Mr. Roe. But the chairman of the Senate \nin the conference was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee at that time, the Senator from New York.\n  Out of that came a bill that I think has been a model. I have always \nsaid it and I will say it again that the principal credit for doing \nthat, achieving that, was what the Senator from New York did.\n  Regarding the magnetic levitation, I agree with him, the Senator from \nNew York. Based upon his urgings, I went over to Bremen, Germany, to \nsee the magnetic levitation demonstration tracks. It is about a 10-mile \ntrack that is in the form of a figure 8. We attained at that time \nspeeds of over 300 miles an hour with a cruising speed of 240 miles an \nhour. It was so calm you could rest a glass of water on the table or \nyou could write a letter with ease.\n  As the Senator from New York mentioned, there were considerable sums \nin the ISTEA legislation, but those sums, as I recall, were not spent \nbut were taken back by the appropriators over the years. So we have $30 \nmillion more from that in here. From that, we believe the Department of \nTransportation can arrive at the site. We ought to try one of these. \nWhere it will be, I don't know. It could well be in Texas or Florida, \nmoving vast amounts of people back and forth in some fashion wherever \nit might be. I am sure it will not be in the State of Rhode Island, but \nI am for it. And I am not necessarily saying we have to develop new \ntechnology. I think the Germans have developed some outstanding \ntechnology. I have not seen the one in Japan.\n  I think we ought to get on with it and see how it works in this \ncountry and see not only if the construction costs can be amortized but \nthe operating costs, likewise.\n  Again, I thank the splendid Senator from New York for his comments \nand appreciate the support he has given this legislation from the word \ngo.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join my colleague and chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in recognizing and praising the \nintelligence and the vision of the senior Senator from New York. I \nthink I can state without reservation and categorically that the \nSenator from New York is the most interesting Senator in the U.S. \nSenate. He is most interesting not because he makes outrageous \nstatements but for a lot of reasons. One is his historical knowledge. \nThe Senator from New York has a deeper historical knowledge of many \nfacets, whether it is American history, world history, technical \nhistory----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Architectural history.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Than anyone else in this entity. Very often he draws upon \nhis vast reservoir to enlighten us and remind us of something that \nhappened in the past and how it is relevant to what we are attempting \nto do in the future.\n  He is also most interesting because he is, I think, the most \nprofound. He comes up with more new ideas, has a broader perspective on \nwhat is happening, which enables him to approach a subject from more \nangles, more ways, and he thinks more outside the box, if you will.\n  There are many examples of that but one that comes to mind is what he \ndid in the last ISTEA bill, focusing on intermodality, a big word but \nvery important concept. Not just building concrete highways but all the \nvarious ways that transportation has to and should be connected.\n  For example, the Senator will remember we had a field hearing in New \nYork. I flew up to New York on an airplane. I didn't drive. I took a \nwater taxi in the Delta terminal over to some pier in New York and then \na taxi over to where the hearing was located. The point is that States, \nunder the vision of the Senator from New York, can spend ISTEA dollars \non a Delta water taxi. That is permissible. I don't know whether any \ndollars were spent, maybe, but they can be.\n  In addition, in our bill we give States added flexibility. Our bill \nallows States to spend money on Amtrak if they choose. In some States, \nAmtrak is a lot more important, or in parts of some States Amtrak it is \nmore important than others.\n  The intermodality, that flexibility, is made available here, to say \nnothing of spending money on transit. Highway dollars can be spent on \nmass transit. We don't have much mass transit in my State of Montana, \nbut certainly in the State of New York and other States transit is \nvery, very important. Bus lines, bike paths, you name it, States have a \nlot more flexibility and there are many more uses on the various \ncomponents of transportation that make up the totality \nof transportation instead of just highways.\n\n  Again, that was a vision of the Senator from New York that put in \nplace that concept 6 years ago and is continued and improved upon in \nthis bill. That is why we named it ISTEA II, and the next one, I am \nsure, will be ISTEA III.\n  There is no Senator who, as I said, is more interesting and can \ncontribute more than the Senator from New York. We deeply appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is curious that both the Senator from \nMontana and I serve on the Finance Committee, likewise on the \nEnvironment Committee with the Senator from New York. So I have served \nwith the Senator from New York for some 21 years on this committee and \n18 years or so on the Finance Committee. And then we both were on the \nIntelligence Committee back and forth at different times. The Senator \nfrom Montana has been on the Finance Committee, likewise, 15, 16 years \nor so. So I have always felt, Mr. President, because of serving on \nthose committees with the Senator from New York that I received a \nHarvard education without having to pay for it, and it has been worth \nit.\n  I know the story the Senator has told about then, I believe, Second \nLieutenant Eisenhower leading a convoy across the country. I think it \ntook about 40 days. And from that, as the Senator from New York pointed \nout, came this inspiration for the then Lieutenant Eisenhower, later \nGeneral Eisenhower, and then President Eisenhower, that we ought to \nbuild superhighways to get across this Nation.\n  So I echo what the Senator from Montana says. It has really been a \npleasure to work with the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am beyond words but not beyond gratitude. I could not \nthank my colleagues enough.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. On a separate subject, Mr. President, I know there are \nefforts made to get cosponsors on the so-called Byrd-Warner-Baucus, et \nal., amendment.\n  I say to my colleagues that might be listening, we have not seen that \nyet. That has not emerged. I hope people would go slow on cosponsorship \nof measures such as that because Senator Domenici and I have an \napproach that we think is a very good one and we want to make sure that \npeople just don't get committed in advance, particularly on a measure \nthey have not even seen yet.\n  I believe I am correct in saying that the Senator from Montana, that \nmeasure which was discussed on Thursday a week ago, in other words, \nsomething like the 9th of October and was imminent, has not yet \nappeared, am I correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, I will enthusiastically \ndescribe the contents of the amendment so Senators know what it is.\n\n[[Page S10846]]\n\n  The amendment, it is true, has not been finalized in its final form \nbut it certainly will be very quickly, and I might say to my good \nfriend from Rhode Island, it is a very good amendment because it is an \namendment which does not take money from other programs, as has been \nsaid by opponents. It is an amendment that does not require any \nadditional spending, a claim sometimes made by its opponents.\n  I might also say that the proposed amendment to be offered apparently \nby the Senator from New Mexico to be cosponsored by the Senator from \nRhode Island which is an amendment that I think will cause much more \nmischief than is currently realized because under that amendment it \ngives vast additional powers to the Budget Committee above which that \ncommittee now has which would necessarily take it away from the \nauthorizing committees.\n  In addition, that amendment the Senator described in conjunction with \nthe Senator from New Mexico would also be very mischievous because it \nwould require reauthorizing committees to go back and at least go to \nconference with the House every year on the highway bill, which would \nbe the cause of all kinds of disruption.\n  I urge Senators to be very careful and not be taken in by the \nlanguage of that amendment.\n  Again, the amendment we will provide will not mandate additional \nspending this year or any other year and will not take dollars from any \nother program that are important to people. It only says if there are \nsavings next year beyond those provided for by the budget resolution, \nand if there is discretion of the Budget Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee that those committees want to spend on \nhighway, that is their discretion. I think the Senators will find it is \na very good amendment and it is good for the country.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the point I was making is on October 9, \nThursday, before we left here, we were promised that this amendment was \nimminent. As a matter of fact, I thought I would be handed a copy then. \nBut now, 11 days have gone by and we still have not seen the amendment.\n  All I am saying to my colleagues is, just be cautious before leaping \non as cosponsors of something that no one has seen yet. I don't know \nwhat the problem is, the hold up in this piece of legislation is, but \nall I know, it is not here yet, and while the prediction is it will be \nsoon, all I can say is that is exactly what was said 11 days ago, and \ndespite the time off that staffs and others had during the recess, \nnothing has emerged.\n  I ask my colleagues to just hold their fire and keep their ammunition \ndry and let's see what the different proposals are that are inside \nhere, including the one which I wouldn't characterize in the same \nfashion as the Senator from Montana did, namely, the Domenici \namendment, which I will be part of.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/20/senate-section/article/S10837-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

\n     and\n       Whereas United States Senators Stevens and Murkowski of \n     Alaska, Senators Craig and Kempthorne of Idaho, Senator Smith \n     of Oregon, Senator Burns of Montana, and Senator Gorton of \n     Washington have introduced S. 431, a bill that would amend \n     Title 28 of the United States Code to divide the Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit into two circuits, and that has \n     the short title of the ``Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     Reorganization Act of 1997''; and\n       Whereas S. 431 proposes to remove the states of Alaska, \n     Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington from the Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and place them in a new Court \n     of Appeals for the Twelfth Circuit to be headquartered in \n     Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington; and\n       Whereas S. 431 would make each circuit judge of the Court \n     of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit whose duty station is in \n     Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, or Washington a circuit judge \n     of the new Court of Appeals for the Twelfth Circuit; and\n       Whereas the membership of the Court of Appeals for the \n     Ninth Circuit is heavily weighted toward the State of \n     California and the court seems to concern itself \n     predominately with issues arising out of California and the \n     southwestern United States; and\n       Whereas the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's case \n     filings in 1995 were greater than any other federal circuit \n     and in 1996 were the second greatest; and\n       Whereas the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit serves a \n     population of more than 45,000,000 people, well over one-\n     third more than any other federal circuit; and\n       Whereas members of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit have shown a surprising lack of understanding of \n     Alaska's people and geography that has resulted in decisions \n     that have often caused the people of Alaska unnecessary \n     hardship; and\n       Whereas, in the so-called ``Katie John'' subsistence case, \n     which is of tremendous importance to the people of the State \n     of Alaska, even though the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     circuit granted expedited consideration of that case, the \n     court did not issue its decision for over 13 months; and\n       Whereas Attorney General Bruce Botelho estimates that there \n     are more than 200 Alaska cases currently pending before the \n     Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; and\n       Whereas the Attorneys General of the States of Idaho, \n     Montana, Oregon, and Washington have also found previously \n     that similar issues of unnecessary delay concerning, lack of \n     understanding of, and lack of consideration for cases and \n     issues by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth circuit exist in \n     regard to those states; and\n       Whereas the Attorneys General of the States of Alaska, \n     Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington endorsed S. 965, \n     introduced in the previous Congress to create a new Twelfth \n     Circuit Court of appeals and the forerunner to S. 431; and\n       Whereas the creation of a new Court of Appeals for the \n     Twelfth Circuit encompassing the States of Alaska, Idaho, \n     Montana, Oregon, and Washington by S. 431 would benefit these \n     similar states by providing speedier and more consistent \n     rulings by jurists who have a greater familiarity with the \n     social, geographical, political, and economic life of the \n     region: Be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature supports \n     creation of a new Court of Appeals for the Twelfth Circuit \n     for the States\n\n[[Page S10853]]\n\n     of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington \n     headquartered in the Pacific Northwest; and respectfully \n     requests the United States Congress to act in an expeditious \n     manner.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable Al \n     Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and President \n     of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Strom Thurmond, President \n     Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Newt Gingrich, \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the Honorable \n     Trent Lott, Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, the constitution of 1789 gave future generations \n     liberty through the right of speech and assembly, the rights \n     of women to vote, and economic interest protection by the \n     government; and\n       Whereas, our constitution provides personal security and \n     protection and is the heart of the American system, and seeks \n     to ensure that each person is free from the threat of attack, \n     free of actions by others that diminish life, liberty, \n     health, or property or that prevent the ``pursuit of \n     happiness''; and\n       Whereas, the people of the nation are surrounded by attacks \n     on their personal security, their health and the health of \n     their families, and their rights to enjoy the air, water and \n     resources of the nation; and\n       Whereas, the dangers of toxic pollutants and contaminants \n     created by others that enter our bodies and homes, and \n     natural environment with an increasing threat to the public \n     health and the nation's natural resources is the challenge to \n     our generation of the kind other generations faced and \n     overcame: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to adopt an amendment to \n     the constitution providing that the right of each citizen to \n     clean and healthful air and water and to the protection of \n     other natural resources of our nation shall not be infringed \n     upon by any person; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be immediately \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, to the \n     secretary of the United States Senate, to the clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to each member of \n     the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-257. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 120\n\n       Whereas, Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, provides in part that ``. . . The Judges, both \n     of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices \n     during good Behaviour, . . .''; and\n       Whereas, this clause has been interpreted to mean that ``. \n     . . (a) person appointed to office of United States district \n     judge becomes entitled to draw salary of office so long as he \n     continues to ``hold office'', and he ``holds office'' until \n     he voluntarily relinquishes it or is ousted by impeachment or \n     death.'' Johnson v. U.S., 79 F. Supp. 208 (1948); and\n       Whereas, this clause has been further interpreted to mean \n     ``. . . Judges of federal ``constitutional'' courts which \n     have been invested with the judicial power of the United \n     States pursuant to this article are guaranteed life tenure \n     during good behavior and compensation which may not be \n     reduced during their term of office. . . .'' Montanez v. \n     U.S., 226 F. Supp. 593(1964). affirmed 371 F.2d. 79; and\n       Whereas, a common complaint that the public makes about \n     federal district judges is that they are not accountable to \n     the people because of this life tenure; and\n       Whereas, this public complaint continues that these judges, \n     because of their insulation and isolation after a certain \n     length of time in office, lose touch with the problems facing \n     and feelings of the majority of the American people; and\n       Whereas, state district, appellate, and supreme court \n     justices in Louisiana have specific limited terms of office, \n     as do other inferior federal courts, such as bankruptcy \n     judges whose term is fourteen years; and\n       Whereas, this constitutional amendment would not give the \n     people the right to vote for a federal judge, but only the \n     right to voice their opinion on whether the appointment of \n     federal district judges should be for a limited term short of \n     life tenure; and\n       Whereas, the system appears to still maintain an \n     independent judiciary uninfluenced by undue public pressure \n     in the inferior federal courts in which judges are not \n     granted life tenure; and\n       Whereas, Article V of the Constitution of the United States \n     provides that an amendment to the constitution may be \n     proposed by congress which shall become part of the \n     constitution when ratified by three-fourths of the several \n     states.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, the federal Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection \n     and Restoration Act (CWPPRA), Title III, P.L. 101-646, 1990, \n     and P.L. 102-212, 1991, 16 U.S.C.A. 777c and 3951-3956, \n     authorizes the granting of funds to coastal states to carry \n     out coastal wetlands conservation projects; and\n       Whereas, the act is the nation's most extensive wetlands \n     enhancement law and is of vital importance to Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, since Louisiana possesses approximately forty \n     percent of the coastal wetlands of the lower forty-eight \n     states, and has suffered as much as eighty percent of the \n     nation's annual wetland losses, the state receives the \n     ``lion's share'' of project funding under the act; and\n       Whereas, if the current loss rate of wetlands in Louisiana \n     is not slowed, an additional 800,000 acres of wetlands could \n     disappear by the year 2040 and the Louisiana shoreline could \n     advance inland as much as thirty-three miles in some areas; \n     and\n       Whereas, through CWPPRA and state funding, coastal \n     restoration projects, including barrier island and shoreline \n     restoration, have been undertaken in Louisiana to avert a \n     potential catastrophe and economic and ecological loss to our \n     state and the nation; and\n       Whereas, the CWPPRA project program is an example of a \n     federal/state partnership that can work in a practical and \n     effective manner to solve a national problem requiring local \n     action, and should therefore be continued; and\n       Whereas, such continuation should include the dedication of \n     at least twenty percent of total CWPPRA project funding to \n     restoration of Louisiana's barrier shoreline, including but \n     not limited to barrier islands and cheniers; and\n       Whereas, such continuation should further include the \n     feasibility of streamlining the planning process to eliminate \n     unnecessary duplication of effort and taxpayer expense, and \n     establish a ``block grant'' program for CWPPRA project \n     funding similar to other block grant programs recently \n     revised or established by congress; and\n       Whereas, by law CWPPRA project funding is dependent upon \n     the federal aid highway trust fund, as the portion of \n     revenues from such fund attributed to fuel tax receipts from \n     small engine power equipment usage are annually allocated to \n     funding of CWPPRA projects; and\n       Whereas, the federal aid highway trust fund was last \n     authorized by congress in 1991 in the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), P.L. 102-240; and\n       Whereas, such act expires in 1997, as does the authority to \n     transfer fuel tax receipts from small engine power equipment \n     usage, and must be reauthorized by congress; and\n       Whereas, if reauthorization does not occur, CWPPRA project \n     funding will lose its revenue source; and\n       Whereas, in the reauthorization act, reauthorization is \n     further needed for the gasoline tax, revenues from which go \n     into the highway trust fund; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to reauthorize laws \n     providing for the federal highway trust fund and continuing \n     funding for Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and \n     Restoration Act projects; be it\n       Further resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does \n     hereby request that congress amend the Coastal Wetlands \n     Planning, Protection and Restoration Act or other law as \n     necessary to dedicate at least twenty percent of overall \n     CWPPRA project funding to restoration of Louisiana barrier \n     shoreline, including but not limited to barrier islands and \n     cheniers; be it\n       Further resolved, That congress undertake review, study \n     and, if necessary, amendment of the Coastal Wetlands \n     Planning, Protection and Restoration Act or other law in \n     order to streamline the project planning process to eliminate \n     unnecessary duplication of effort, save taxpayer expense, and \n     ensure maximum efficient use of funds; be it\n       Further resolved, That such review, study and, if \n     necessary, amendment by congress include the feasibility of \n     creating a ``block grant'' program in the 1999 \n     reauthorization act for CWPPRA funds similar to other block \n     grant programs recently created or revised by congress; be it\n       Further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n       POM-267.

and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana, through the Department of \n     Natural Resources, has prepared and will submit for federal \n     approval the Louisiana Coastal Wetlands Conservation Plan \n     (Plan); and\n       Whereas, the United States Army, United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, and United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency are the federal agencies authorized under CWPPRA to \n     approve the Plan; and\n       Whereas, as provided by CWPPRA, the goals and purposes of \n     such Plan include:\n       (1) To achieve no net loss of wetlands in the coastal areas \n     of Louisiana as a result of developmental activities \n     initiated subsequent to approval of the Plan, exclusive of \n     any wetlands gains achieved through implementation of certain \n     restoration projects; and\n       (2) To provide a program for the review, evaluation, and \n     identification of regulatory and nonregulatory options to be \n     adopted by the state to encourage and assist private owners \n     of wetlands to continue to maintain those lands as wetlands; \n     and\n       (3) To provide a system for the state to implement that \n     accounts for gains and losses of coastal wetlands within \n     coastal areas, for purposes of evaluating the degree to which \n     the goal of no net loss of wetlands as a result of \n     development activities in such wetlands or other waters has \n     been attained; and\n       (4) To provide a program to be carried out by the state for \n     the purpose of educating the public concerning the necessity \n     to conserve wetlands in Louisiana, which presently comprise \n     approximately forty percent of the continental United States \n     coastal wetlands but are currently disappearing at a rate of \n     twenty-five to thirty-five square miles per year, and which \n     are of local, state, national, and international significance \n     as a resource for protection of coastal communities from \n     storms, fishery resources, wildlife habitats, water quality \n     management, and extensive sporting and tourism; and\n       (5) To provide a program to encourage the use of technology \n     by persons engaged in development activities that will result \n     in negligible impact on wetlands; and\n       Whereas, in addition to the above programs and benefits, \n     approval of the Louisiana Coastal Wetlands Conservation Plan \n     will have a direct financial benefit by reducing the state's \n     cost share for CWPPRA projects from a current twenty-five \n     percent match to ten percent for Priority Lists 5 (1996) and \n     6 (1997), and to fifteen percent on other Priority Lists for \n     expenditures incurred subsequent to approval of the Plan; and\n       Whereas, such cost share reductions will allow for more or \n     larger CWPPRA projects in Louisiana and an increased number \n     of state-only funded projects to be implemented to sustain \n     wetlands functions and values; and\n       Whereas, the Plan will also demonstrate the state's \n     willingness to address the question of wetland loss, thus \n     assisting in CWPPRA reauthorization set for congressional \n     vote in 1998; and\n       Whereas, under the authority of R.S. 49:214.1 through \n     214.5, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources is the \n     state agency responsible for the conservation, restoration, \n     and enhancement of the state's coastal wetlands resources, \n     and the Plan will provide for the Department of Natural \n     Resources to be the single state agency with \n     responsibility for implementing and enforcing the Plan; \n     and\n       Whereas, development of the Plan involved extensive public \n     participation and input, including more than ten public \n     hearings during 1996 and 1997, and also the opportunity to \n     provide written comments;

McKinley, the opportunity to enjoy a wilderness \n     experience, and the chance to encounter wildlife in its \n     natural habitat, and would connect to the Alaska Railroad \n     corridor; and\n       Whereas a new northern railroad access would enhance the \n     Mt. McKinley experience for visitors to Denali National Park \n     and Preserve, promote tourism statewide through greater \n     visitor satisfaction, and provide a foundation for year-round \n     visitation; and\n       Whereas insufficient transportation access to premier \n     viewing areas in Denali National Park and Preserve and the \n     lack of facilities at these areas are major obstacles to \n     enhancing the wilderness experience that the park offers; and\n       Whereas a new northern railroad transportation system and \n     visitor facilities can be designed and constructed so as not \n     to detract from the qualities that make Denali National Park \n     and Preserve the state's premier visitor attraction; and\n       Whereas the Wonder Lake area, located on the north side of \n     Denali National Park and Preserve, has a dry interior \n     climate, long daylight hours, and splendid viewing \n     opportunities, and offers the potential to promote both \n     summer and winter activities; and\n       Whereas creating a new northern railroad access into Denali \n     National Park and Preserve, taking advantage of a long-\n     established and historic transportation route previously used \n     by the mining industry, would offer an opportunity for the \n     private sector to meet the increased demand for tourism \n     facilities; and\n       Whereas, without making a substantial claim on the state's \n     financial resources, the state is uniquely able to assist in \n     this effort to develop a new northern railroad route by \n     supporting the private sector efforts underway, by making \n     available for use the state land adjacent to Denali National \n     Park and Preserve for the creation of a railroad route \n     corridor, and by monitoring negotiations that would encourage \n     development opportunities involving the private sector: Be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature strongly \n     supports the efforts of the federal and state governments and \n     the private sector to complete the necessary studies and \n     acquire the necessary permits that would identify and open a \n     new northern railroad\n\n[[Page S10858]]\n\n     route to the vicinity of Wonder Lake and spur the appropriate \n     development of visitor facilities in the Wonder Lake area; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     urges the Governor and the state's executive branch agencies \n     to be aggressive in their resolve to support the consensus of \n     Alaska opinion in supporting the creation of a new northern \n     railroad access into Denali National Park and Preserve, as \n     represented by resolutions of endorsement from the city \n     councils of North Pole, Fairbanks, Nenana, and Seward, the \n     Assembly of the Municipality of Anchorage, and the Assemblies \n     of the Denali, Fairbanks North Star, and Matanuska-Susitna \n     Boroughs, to enhance the Mt. McKinley experience for visitors \n     and the creation of a rail connection between the Wonder Lake \n     area and the Alaska Railroad; and be it further\n       Resolved, That appropriate state agencies should work with \n     the National Park and interested government officials and \n     representatives of the private sector to investigate the \n     potential of establishing a new northern railroad route into \n     the Wonder Lake area of Denali National Park and Preserve, \n     for the appropriate development of facilities in this area \n     that would serve the needs of park visitors.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-276.

A bill to provide for dropout prevention; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              THE NATIONAL DROPOUT PREVENTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nDropout Prevention Act. I will talk just a bit about the issue and talk \nabout the problem that I am trying to address and that this act is \nintending to address. It is a problem, I think, all Senators should \njoin me in trying to resolve and I believe will join me in trying to \nresolve.\n  We have a serious problem on our hands that is a threat to the youth \nof America. The problem is that far too many of our kids are dropping \nout of high school before they graduate. Some, even, are dropping out \nof middle school before they proceed on to high school.\n  Each fall, starting about a month ago, students begin dropping out of \nschool and they drop out in very, very large numbers. Nationwide, \nnearly half a million kids leave school each year. That is, leaving \nschool not by graduating but leaving school early and deciding not to \nstay in school and graduate. That is 2,700 dropouts for each school \nday. Studies show that our children are dropping out at a younger and \nyounger age.\n  Who are these kids who are dropping out of school? The charts that I \nhave here make the case fairly well. They are largely from low-income \nand middle-income families, and as a percent they are largely minority. \nThe numbers are disturbing across the board, but they are particularly \nalarming for Hispanic students.\n  First, on the income level. If you look at this chart, the top line \nshows the period from 1975 to 1995, a 20-year period. On the left-hand \nside we show the dropout rates for grades 10-12, ages 15-24, by family \nincome. What this means is that among students from low-income families \nat times it has been as high as 17 percent that have dropped out in a \nparticular year. In middle-income families, it is closer to 6 to 8 \npercent, and in high-income families it is substantially lower than \nthat. When you break it down not just by income level but by ethnic \nbackground, you can see that the problem is concentrated and \nparticularly alarming for Hispanic students who are dropping out at a \nrate more than double that of non-Hispanic students. Also, black \nstudents drop out at a rate about 50 percent higher than the rate for \nwhite students.\n  You can see from this chart the point I am making here, the top line, \nthe red line, represents the percentage of Hispanic students dropping \nout. This is called status dropout rates for persons 16-24, and you can \nsee somewhere between 30 and 35 percent of Spanish students nationwide \ndrop out rather than compete high school. It is a very serious problem, \nparticularly in that group, and of course that is a great concern in my \nState where a very large percent of the student population is Hispanic.\n  Why are they dropping out? With all the emphasis on self-reliance \nthese days it is tempting to ask what is wrong with kids that so many \nof them are leaving school. When you actually sit down and talk to \nthese young people, as I have done across New Mexico, you soon learn \nthat it is not the kids that are failing the schools as much as it is \nthe schools that are failing our young people. Ask groups of high \nschool students why they and their friends are leaving school and you \nwill hear the same answers again and again. Some of them are bored with \nthe dumbed-down lessons that they don't see as having any relevance to \ntheir own lives. They are lost in giant school buildings with endless \ncorridors and teachers who have very little time to give them or to use \nin encouraging them to succeed in their school work. They are trapped \nin an educational system that does not meet the individual needs of \nindividual students.\n  With all the focus on education these days you would think this issue \nwould be getting substantial attention but, in fact, it is not getting \nany real attention. It has been 8 years since President Bush and the \nNation's Governors established as a national goal that we would \ngraduate 90 percent of high school seniors by the year 2000. Obviously, \nwe are much closer to the year 2000, but we are nowhere near the goal \nof graduating 90 percent of our students before they drop out of \nschool.\n  Now, let's talk a little about the bill we are introducing, this \nNational Dropout Prevention Act of 1997. This is the only comprehensive \neffort that we have seen, that we have come up with, or that we are \naware of anyone coming up with, that will prevent students from \ndropping out of school and take this issue head on.\n  Let me outline the proposal very briefly. First, two basic points. \nThe reasons that kids drop out of school cut across racial and ethnic \nlines. The solutions we are proposing are aimed at helping all at-risk \nstudents make it through high school. Second, the emphasis here is on \npreventing students from dropping out of school by reforming the \nschools that they are in rather than trying to help students later \nafter they have made the decision to leave school.\n  But what I am proposing in this bill sets out to achieve four basic \ngoals:\n  First, to focus greater national attention on the problem and to \ncoordinate our Federal efforts to deal with the issue.\n  Second, to provide more resources to help communities to fight back \nat this problem.\n  Third, to enable school districts to try effective prevention \nstrategies that have been shown to work.\n  Fourth, to enlist the States where most of the resources are and most \nof the policy is related to education in the effort to keep more kids \nin school.\n  The bill directs the President to appoint a dropout czar within the \nDepartment of Education who would coordinate efforts at the national \nlevel, would streamline programs, would recommend changes and, most \nimportantly, could be held accountable for progress on dropout \nprevention. This czar would make sure that existing Federal programs \nsuch as the Upward Bound Program and vocational education do their \nlevel best to help at-risk kids to complete high school.\n  Second and third, this bill creates a new $100 million grant program \nto reach the 1,000 schools across the country with the highest dropout \nrates. With these funds, schools would be able to try proven strategies \nthat have been shown to work--strategies like breaking larger schools \ndown into smaller learning communities so that kids can have regular \nand closer contact with the adults in the school, particularly with \ntheir teachers, and can have challenging and relevant work to do.\n  Finally, because States are so much a part of our educational system, \nwe would ask them to place a greater emphasis on dropout prevention as \nwell. We have asked in this bill that instead of awarding education \ndollars based on how many students are enrolled in school 40 days into \nthe year, as my State does and as many States do, the States change \ntheir laws so that they monitor enrollment levels throughout the school \nyear. Because gathering accurate data is the first step toward fixing \nthe problem, we also ask that States keep track of who is leaving \nschool.\n  Let me show you a chart. This chart takes the 23 States that \npresently collect data on the number of students dropping out of school \nand it ranks them. It shows that, according to the statistics we have, \nas a percentage dropout rate, New Mexico --and this is on an annual \nbasis--ranks third in the country. Each Senator can look at this list \nand determine very quickly, first,\n\n[[Page S10860]]\n\nwhether his or her State collects data on this subject and, second \nwhere his or her State ranks in dealing with the problem.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me just summarize what our bill \ndoes. It coordinates the Federal dropout prevention initiatives; it \nstreamlines the unconnected and overlapping dropout prevention \nprograms; it provides additional Federal resources for dropout \nprevention programs at the State level and local school district level; \nit targets and expands participation by at-risk students in the \nprograms, and it calls on State and local agencies to coordinate and \nexpand their own efforts.\n  Mr. President, this is a difficult problem. It is one that we are not \ngoing to solve by waving some magic wand. The effort will demand a \nconcerted effort, a real commitment by State and local leaders, \nparents, educators and, of course, students. But if the issue is not \nplaced on the national agenda and done so immediately, our chances of \nmeeting this 90 percent graduation target any time in the near future \nwill be greatly diminished. Clearly, it will be impossible to meet that \nby the year 2000. But, hopefully, we can meet it some time in the next \ndecade if we get about the business of trying to do so.\n  This legislation is being introduced, Mr. President, with the hope \nthat we can begin to educate others in the Congress about the \nseriousness of the problem, begin to educate others in the country \nabout the seriousness of the problem. I hope we can get colleagues to \ncosponsor the legislation and that we can move toward hearings on the \nbill some time in the Labor and Human Resources Committee early after \nwe reconvene in the second session of this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 1296. A bill to reform the laws relating to Postal Service \nfinances, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                the postal financing reform act of 1997\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Postal \nFinancing Reform Act of 1997. This bill gives the Postal Service the \nauthority to deposit funds in private sector institutions, invest in \nthe open market, and borrow from private credit markets.\n  The statutory restrictions of current law on postal finances, \nborrowing, and purchasing were designed for a Postal Service that \nrequired regular infusions of appropriated funds to maintain public \nservice levels. For almost two decades now, the Postal Service has been \na self-supporting system.\n  The maintenance of U.S. Treasury control over Postal Service banking, \ninvesting, and borrowing is no longer necessary or justified. Current \nlaw prevents the Service from obtaining the most favorable combination \nof prices and services and results in added operating costs of over \n$100,000,000 annually. Under this new approach, the Treasury Department \nwould retain much of its current oversight, but it would no longer be \nthe sole provider of certain financial services to the Postal Service. \nThis bill makes the relationship between the Treasury and the Postal \nService similar to the relationship other government sponsored \nenterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have with the Treasury.\n  The bill I am introducing includes four main sections--those being \nsections 2 through 5. Section 2 amends title 39 of the United States \nCode to authorize the Postal Service to deposit its revenues in the \nPostal Service Fund within the U.S. Treasury or any Federal Reserve \nbanks or depositories for public funds. The requirement to obtain the \nSecretary of the Treasury's approval before any funds deposited \nelsewhere would be eliminated.\n  The third section terminates Treasury control of Postal Service \ninvestments. This will permit the Postal Service to invest any excess \nfunds either in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the Government of the \nUnited States, or in such other obligations or securities as it deems \nadvisable, provided that such investment is determined to be closely \nrelated to Postal Service operations by the Postal Board of Governors. \nBy providing the Postal Service with an opportunity to invest in U.S. \nGovernment obligations or other obligations on its own accord without \nunnecessary constraints, this section of the bill would permit the \nPostal Service to take advantage of favorable market conditions, and \ngive it the ability to make equity investments which fit its business \nstrategies.\n  Section 4 removes the control of the Secretary of the Treasury over \nthe Postal Service's financial borrowing decisions. The Postal Service \nwould still be required to consult with the Secretary of the Treasury \nregarding the terms and conditions of the sale of any obligations \nissued by the Postal Service under section 2006(a) of title 39, and the \nSecretary would still exercise a power of approval over the timing of a \nsale of obligations, in much the same manner as the Treasury acts as a \ntraffic cop with regard to the timing of obligations issued by other \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises.\n  Finally, this bill removes the requirement of the Secretary of the \nTreasury to purchase up to $2 billion in obligations of the Postal \nService. This section would still permit the Secretary of the Treasury \nto purchase Postal Service obligations, but only upon mutual agreement \nbetween the Secretary and the Postal Service. Removing this put on the \nTreasury would be consistent with the purpose of directing the Postal \nService borrowing to the private sector where it would be able to take \nadvantage of a broader market. This section would also make Treasury \npurchases of Postal Service obligations exempt from the various \nborrowing limits in title 39 of the United States Code thus enabling \nthe Postal Service and the Treasury by mutual agreement to address an \nunforeseen emergency situation. Such exempt purchases would themselves \nbe capped at $2.5 billion of outstanding obligations at any one time.\n  I invite Senators to consider this proposal for reform and support \nthis effort to ensure a more efficient and financially sound U.S. \nPostal Service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1296\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Postal Financing Reform Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to designate a Federal building located in Florence, \nAlabama, as the ``Justice John McKinley Federal Building''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               the justice john mckinley federal building\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nlegislation to honor John McKinley. John McKinley was a statesman, an \ninfluential State legislator, one of the founding trustees of the \nUniversity of Alabama, U.S. Senator, and the first U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice from the State of Alabama.\n  Born on May 1, 1780, in Culpepper County, VA, John McKinley began his \ncareer in Kentucky after learning the law on his own. In 1818, he moved \nto Alabama and shortly after his arrival, McKinley, along with Andrew \nJackson and John Coffee, became a member of the Cypress Land Co. This \ncompany was the largest single purchaser of land in north Alabama in \nthe land boom of 1818. In addition to pursuing his fortune, John \nMcKinley almost immediately entered Alabama politics. In 1820, he was \nelected to the State legislature.\n  In 1826, McKinley was elected by the State legislature to the U.S. \nSenate where he served until 1831. In the Old Senate Chamber, just down \nthe hall, he espoused a political theory that to many in Washington may \nseem quaint. He believed that the national government's sovereignty was \nlimited solely to the powers granted by the Constitution unless \nexpressly relinquished by the States. As chairman of the Committee on \nPublic Lands, he promoted transferring Federal lands to the States for \neconomic development. Defeated for a second term in the Senate, \nMcKinley returned to the Alabama legislature.\n  In the legislature, McKinley gained considerable influence by \ndenouncing the national bank and endorsing President Jackson s efforts \nto dismantle it. He also supported Martin Van Buren, Jackson's \ncandidate for President in 1836. When the Jacksonian Democrats regained \ncontrol of the State legislature, the new majority re-elected McKinley \nto the Senate. Shortly thereafter, as a reward for his loyalty to \nJackson and endorsement of Van Buren, the newly elected President \nnominated McKinley for a seat on the Supreme Court. The Senate \nconfirmed his nomination 1 week later on September 25, 1837, by voice \nvote.\n  Justice John McKinley was assigned to the ninth circuit, which \nencompassed Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. While riding \ncircuit in Mobile, AL, Justice McKinley heard the first of three cases \ncollectively known as Bank of Augusta versus Earle. In this \ncontroversial decision, McKinley upheld an Alabama statute prohibiting \nout-of-State banks from making loans in Alabama. The case which was \nappealed to the Supreme Court was heard in 1839.\n  The Court overturned the McKinley decision, and only McKinley \ndissented. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote the majority opinion which \ndeclared that there was a law of comity that applied among the States. \nTherefore, a bank had as much a legal right to offer interstate loans \nas they do in the charter State. In the lone dissent, however, McKinley \nmade the interesting point that the Court's majority had applied the \nState sovereignty doctrine in the extreme and that the States ceased to \nbe nations when they ratified the Constitution.\n  His most significant contribution to the Court was writing the \nmajority opinion in Pollard's Lesse versus Hagan (1845). This opinion \ndeclared that the Federal Government held public lands in trust until a \nterritory became a State. At the time a territory entered the Union, \nthe public land was rightfully State property. This decision provided a \nlegal basis for opening public lands and for furthering economic \ndevelopment.\n  In addition to Pollard, Justice McKinley wrote nine other opinions in \n1845, his most prolific year on the Court. After 1845, his work became \nsporadic due to general poor health. He attended, however, the Court's \nsessions as regularly as possible and contributed as best he could. \nJohn McKinley remained a member of the Court until his death in the \nspring of 1852.\n  There is no Federal building to honor Justice McKinley, and the \nlegislation that I am introducing will correct this oversight. The bill \ndesignates the Federal courthouse and U.S. Post Office complex in \nFlorence, AL as the ``Justice John McKinley Federal Building.'' The \nlegislation has received the endorsement of the following: Mayor Frost \nand the Florence City Council, the Lauderdale County Commission, \nTennessee Valley Historical Society, Florence

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to thank Dave \nWright for his many years of service to the listeners of Columbia, \nSouth Carolina's ``Sunny 100'' radio and to congratulate him on a job \nwell done. His tenure of nearly 40 years is a tribute to his tenacity, \nacumen, and energy. His dedication to his craft is an inspiration to \naspiring broadcasters everywhere.\n  Dave Wright's friends and colleagues will agree with me that his \nretirement is a bittersweet occasion. We wish him the best as he \nembarks on a new chapter in his life, yet we do not want to see him \nleave the airwaves. I always have considered Dave Wright to be the \nvoice of Columbia and shall miss hearing him during my travels through \nthe city. With Gene McKay and Bill Benton, he combined local news \nreporting with humor, music, and listener interaction to make the \n``Good Morning Columbia'' radio show one of the best in the Southeast.\n  Over the span of five decades, Dave Wright has provided the people of \nColumbia with humorous commentary on community news. It is no secret \nwhy they look forward to tuning in to Sunny 100 in the morning. Of \ncourse, his long record of service extends beyond Columbia; we all are \nproud of his service in the Air Force during the Korean war.\n  Fortunately for us, Dave Wright is not completely retiring from the \nnews business. South Carolinians look forward to his future coverage of \ngolf tournaments around the country, as they have since 1962. And we \nall are hoping to see him devote more time to one of his greatest \nloves: stand-up comedy.\n  Today I join the people of Columbia in thanking Dave Wright for \nbrightening our lives and our airwaves for almost 40 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/20/senate-section/article/S10863-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RYE, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate the Town of Rye, NH, for receiving the 1997 Walter B. \nJones Memorial and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration \nExcellence Awards for Coastal and Ocean Resource Management. The town \nof Rye received the awards for the category of excellence in local \ngovernment, which recognizes local communities that show exemplary \nleadership, innovation and accomplishment in coastal resource \nprotection and management.\n  Due to the gradual cut-off from the daily tidal water around the town \nof Rye, a number of wildlife habitats and marsh lands have steadily \ndecreased. By thier own initative, The town of Rye's Conservation \nCommission took immediate action and undertook an innovate project to \nrestore a majority of its historic salt marsh areas.\n  Since 1993, Rye has undertaken numerous salt marsh restoration \nprojects and is well on its way to restoring the majority of its \nhistoric slat marsh areas. Rye has also worked cooperatively with U.S. \nFish and Wildlife, splitting costs with the town to replace culverts \nand restore the tidal flow to approximately 18 acres of salt marsh.\n  To date, the town of Rye has jointly funded four restoration projects \naffecting 240 acres of salt marsh. Utilizing such agencies as the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife, the Environmental Protection Agency, the New \nHampshire Estuaries Project, as well as private businesses, the town of \nRye continues to improve and enhance the salt marsh areas.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Environmental Public Works \nCommittee, I am very concerned with every aspect of our environment. \nThe salt marshes in Rye, NH, are a very important part to the overall \nhabitat of the area and I am very pleased to know many other citizens \nof the Granite State share my concerns for the environment. But more \nimportantly, I commend the action taken by the town of Rye for making \nthe necessary changes to improve the salt marshes. It is this type of \ninitiative that exemplifies how local government and its citizens can \nbetter and more efficiently manage their environment than the Federal \nGovernment. The town of Rye has shown dedication and is a model as well \nas inspiration to other towns in New Hampshire and the country. \nCongratulations and appreciation are in order to the many people who \nhave selfishly worked to save the historic salt marshes. No town is \nmore deserving to receive the Excellence in Local Government Award than \nRye, NH.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/20/senate-section/article/S10863-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10863-S10864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A POSITIVE EFFORT\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Sunday, October 5, I had the \ngood fortune to speak at the Dedication of the new Jerome and Dawn \nGreene Medical Arts Pavilion at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. I \nspeak of good fortune not because I was able to offer some remarks at \nthe dedication of the splendid new pavilion, but because I was able to \nhear, Dr. Domenick P. Purpura, dean of the Albert Einstein College of \nMedicine, remind us all of the lasting significance of the American \nacademic medical center.\n  With eloquence, humor and a New Yorker's flair, Dr. Purpura \nreaffirmed my belief that our core values demand our dedication to, and \nwill provide for the future of, academic medical centers. He stated \nfrom the outset:\n\n       We are here . . . to dispel the septic rumor oozing from \n     some health policy think tanks to the effect that academic \n     medical centers such as ours are dinosaurs doomed to \n     extinction by the impact of the asteroid of managed care. \n     Look skyward! On this day of noble purpose the sun shines \n     brightly. No ashen clouds obscure the values that have made \n     American medicine a crowning achievement of Western \n     Civilization. And what are these core values? Simply stated: \n     Faith in evidence-based medicine and trust that our superbly \n     trained physicians will translate the basic science of \n     medicine into the art and science of patient care. These \n     values constitute the concrete foundation upon which the \n     three pillars of our academic medical center rests so \n     securely.\n\n  As the good Doctor said, these hospitals are not doomed to extinction \nby managed care, but rather destined for continued success due to our \nfaith, and their proven achievement, thus far.\n  Thirty-two years ago, in the first article of the first issue of the \nPublic Interest, I published some observations on the \n``Professionalization of Reform.'' The essay began with a passage from \nWesley C. Mitchell, who had been for near quarter a century (1920-45) \ndirector of research at the National Bureau of Economic Research, then \nbased at Columbia University.\n\n       Our best hope for the future lies in the extension to \n     social organization of the methods that we already employ in \n     our most progressive fields of effort. In science and in \n     industry . . . we cannot wait for catastrophe to force new \n     ways upon us . . . We rely, and with success, upon \n     quantitative analysis to point the way; and we advance \n     because we are constantly improving and applying such \n     analysis.\n\n  In the proven field of medicine, the burden of improving and applying \nanalytical methods falls on the academic medical center. Indeed, we \ncannot forget their influence on the state of medicine today--what Dr. \nPurpura called, the crowning achievement of western civilization.\n  Dr. Purpora reformulated Albert Einstein's e=mc\\2\\ to be ``e, \nexcellence [of the medical center] to be equal to m, motivation times \nc, commitment . . . and the square be the multiple rather than the \naddition of our joint commitment to excellence in patient care.'' \nCatastrophe will occur not because of ``the asteroid of managed care,'' \nbut rather due to a decline in either the motivation of Doctors like \nDominick Purpura or society's commitment to institutions like the \nAlbert Einstein College of Medicine.\n  I ask that the full text of Dr. Dominick P. Purpura's dedicatory \nremarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n              Jerome and Dawn Greene Medical Arts Pavilion\n\n                     (By Dominick P. Purpura, M.D.)\n\n       We are gathered here for several reasons. Most importantly \n     to bear witness to the felicitous marriage of high-spirited \n     philanthropy and good works, now consummated in this the \n     Jerome and Dawn Greene Medical\n\n[[Page S10864]]\n\n     Arts Pavilion. We are here for another purpose as well. To \n     dispel the septic rumor oozing from some health policy think \n     tanks to the effect that academic medical centers such as \n     ours are dinosaurs doomed to extinction by the impact of the \n     asteroid of managed care. Look skyward! On this day of noble \n     purpose the sun shines brightly. No ashen clouds obscure the \n     values that have made American medicine a crowning \n     achievement of Western Civilization. And what are these core \n     values? Simply stated: Faith in evidence-based medicine and \n     trust that our superbly trained physicians will translate the \n     basic science of medicine into the art and science of patient \n     care. These values constitute the concrete foundation upon \n     which the three pillars of our academic medical center rests \n     so securely. One pillar is this great medical center \n     committed to superb patient care; the second is the Albert \n     Einstein College of medicine, dedicated to excellence in \n     education and biomedical research. The third pillar is this \n     community whose loyalty and support ensure our continuing \n     vitality. I submit that neither the temblors of the \n     healthquake nor the asteroid of managed care can shake or \n     threaten the foundation of our AMC. Dinosaurs are we? Let us \n     not forget that dinosaurs, as every child knows, dominated \n     this planet for nearly 300 million years.\n       Besides who would have thought that the most vulnerable to \n     extinction by the impact of managed care might be the giant \n     insurance companies themselves? Asteroid impact sites are \n     difficult to predict. For us, in this holy week of \n     contemplation let us be comforted in the knowledge that good \n     deeds and good works still have currency as effective \n     challenges to potential economic catastrophes. Our species, \n     Homo sapiens, is not only man of wisdom who makes tools; he \n     is also man who plans and builds for the future. How we \n     rejoice when on occasion a man arises from our species who \n     redeems the time with a vision of what will be and has the \n     courage and motivation to pursue it to its realization. Mr. \n     Greene, I salute your uncommon wisdom in selecting parents \n     who gave you good genes and taught the boy to be the mensch \n     he is today. Yours and Mrs. Greene's benefaction strengthens \n     the ties that bind the College of medicine and the Montefiore \n     Medical Center by helping to provide a state-of-the-art \n     medical arts pavilion for the faculty we share in common \n     cause.\n       On behalf of the President of Yeshiva University and the \n     Board of Overseers of the Albert Einstein College of \n     Medicine, I congratulate the President and Trustees of the \n     Montefiore Medical Center and especially Jerry and Dawn \n     Greene for proving that our Academic Medical Center is not \n     only alive and well but that the Sun will continue to shine \n     upon us until it exhausts its thermonuclear energy. But not \n     to worry since that is not likely to happen for another 3 \n     billion years.\n       I conclude on a personal note of reinterpretation of Albert \n     Einstein's most famous special relativity equation E=mc\\2\\, \n     the equivalence of mass and energy. Let us consider the E to \n     be Excellence equal to m, motivation times c, commitment. \n     Excellence=motivation commitment.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nmeritorious efforts of Edward Villella, founder of the Miami City \nBallet, in the global dance community.\n  Mr. Villella's interest in dance began when he joined the School of \nAmerican Ballet, where he now serves on the board of directors, at the \nage of 10.\n  Early in his career, Edward Villella was the first American male to \nperform with the Royal Danish Ballet and was the only American asked to \ndance an encore at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.\n  Villella has honored America with his contributions to dance and his \ndedication to teaching dance to others. He danced for President John \nKennedy's inaugural and in 1975 captured an Emmy for his television \nproduction of ``Harlequin.''\n  Recently, he was 1 of the 11 recipients of the National Medal of Arts \nand was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame this year, the \nmost prestigious cultural honor that can be bestowed upon an individual \nin Florida.\n  Edward Villella has honored his State by being awarded a \ndistinguished Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime achievement.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Floridians everywhere, I applaud Edward \nVillella for his success. It is my earnest hope that his outstanding \ncontributions to our State will continue to inspire us for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/20/senate-section/article/S10864-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WORLD FOOD DAY AND THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, to mark the celebration of World \nFood Day on October 16, I rise today to recognize the work of the \nUnited Nations' World Food Programme. The U.N.'s World Food Program is \nthe largest international food aid organization in the world. Last year \nalone it fed over 45.3 million people in 84 countries, transporting 2.2 \nmillion tons of food by ship, canoe, river barge, on the backs of \ndonkeys and elephants, and by parachute drop in remote areas.\n  The World Food Programme distributes food at hospitals, clinics, and \nschools to fight malnutrition, which kills 11,000 children under the \nage of 5 every day and stunts the physical growth and intellectual \ndevelopment of those it does not kill.\n  When disaster strikes, the World Food Programme is there. When severe \ndroughts threatened North Korea and Southern Africa, the World Food \nProgramme helped prevent famine by feeding millions of people, \nespecially children. The World Food Programme has also provided food to \nensure the stability of the peace process in Mozambique and to assist \nrefugees when war hit the Caucasus.\n  The World Food Programme helps people escape the poverty trap by \npromoting economic self-reliance. In exchange for food, workers repair \ndykes in Vietnam, install irrigation systems in India, replant forests \nin Ethiopia, and construct mountainside terraces in Peru which prevent \ntopsoil erosion.\n  As an essential element of its strategy of combating hunger, the \nWorld Food Programme encourages the empowerment of women. In places \nlike rural Pakistan, the World Food Programme promotes female literacy \nby giving vegetable oil to parents who send their daughters to school.\n  In war-torn countries like Afghanistan, Guatemala, Cambodia, \nMozambique, Angola, and Bosnia, the World Food Programme trains local \npeople to carry out demining operations which clear roads and land, \nallowing the delivery and production of food and the safe return of \nrefugees.\n  Americans can take special pride in the accomplishments of the World \nFood Programme. Not only is the United States the program's single \nbiggest donor, it also played a central role in its creation, when \nPresident Kennedy committed the resources and leadership necessary to \nmake it a reality in 1963.\n  I urge you, my fellow colleagues, and all my fellow Americans to \nsupport the work of the World Food Programme.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/20/senate-section/article/S10864-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10864-S10865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ADDELIAR ``DEL'' GUY\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Nevadan, my friend, the late Judge Addeliar ``Del'' Guy \nIII, who died last year. This extraordinary individual will receive a \npermanent honor in my State on February 5, 1998. A local school, to be \nnamed the Addeliar Guy Middle School, will serve as a lasting tribute \nto this remarkable man.\n  In addition to serving as Nevada's first African-American judge, \nAddeliar Guy's legacy includes his role as a devoted husband, father \nand grandfather, decorated soldier, concerned citizen, community \nleader, talented litigator, and until his retirement, as an elected \njudge for the Eighth District Court of Clark County, where he served \nfor 20 years.\n  Judge Guy served in the Coast Guard in World War II, followed by \nactive duty in the United States Army through the Korean war. While in \nthe Army, Del had the chance to act as counsel for one of his fellow \nsergeants, sparking his interest in the exercise of justice. He later \ncontinued his military service in the Illinois and Nevada National \nGuard and the U.S. Army Reserve.\n  His extraordinary display of American patriotism has earned him \nanother prominent memorial in our State. On July 2, my colleagues and I \nin the Nevada congressional delegation\n\n[[Page S10865]]\n\npresided over the dedication of the new Las Vegas Ambulatory Care \nCenter for Veterans, which was named in his honor. The judge's many \nmilitary credentials include the Purple Heart, Meritorious Award Medal, \nKorean Service Medal with two battle stars, and a Combat Infantryman's \nBadge.\n  Upon leaving the Army, Del looked for work in the private sector, and \nalthough he had a wide range of aspirations and his experience as an \nofficer qualified him for many professional jobs, those opportunities \nwere closed off to him because of race. Fortunately for Nevada, he \ndecided to dedicate his life to the law and received his law degree \nfrom Chicago's Loyola University in 1957, where in his second year, he \nset his sights on achieving what would seem to many an impossible goal, \nearning a judgeship.\n  Although he once said that he would never leave Chicago, after \nattending a Young Democrats meeting in Las Vegas, he was persuaded to \njoin the District Attorney's Office when he was denied a judgeship he \nwas expecting in Illinois. Addeliar Guy became the first African-\nAmerican licensed to practice law in my State, and, in 1967, was \nofficially admitted to the Nevada bar. In his two decades on the State \nbench, he served as Alternate Justice of the Supreme Court and in 1975 \nwas appointed by then Governor O'Callaghan to the newly created Eighth \nJudicial District.\n  He truly believed in the law. I counted on Judge Guy's trademark \nintelligence and honesty, as well as his ability to astutely assess the \ncharacter and behavior of others. These qualities were invaluable as he \nassisted me in selecting young Nevadans as nominees for our Nation's \nmilitary academies.\n  Much of my admiration for Judge Guy stems from his continued enduring \ncommitment to people of the Silver State. Judge Guy's values are \nreflected not only in the way he lived his life, but in the many \norganizations he belonged to and served. Until his passing, he worked \nevery day as a citizen-soldier, contributing to groups like the NAACP, \nthe Bar Association, my Academy Board and local youth agencies. Judge \nGuy also served as a motivating force for Nevada's kids, promoting \neducation through the A.D. Guy Scholarship Fund and the Nevada Spirit \nof Art Contest.\n  The Honorable Addeliar Guy's lifetime of achievement is truly an \ninspiration, and he serves as an incredible role model for judicial \nprudence and legal acumen. I am confident that Nevadans will remember \nJudge Guy for his distinguished career, and I hope that the children \npassing through his namesake will be inspired by his phenomenal record \nof accomplishment and lifelong service to the State of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/20/senate-section/article/S10864-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10864-S10865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ADDELIAR ``DEL'' GUY\n\n Mr. REID.
