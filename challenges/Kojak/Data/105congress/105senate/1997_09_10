The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1125, As Modified Further\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today on the floor of the Senate to express my \nstrongest opposition to an amendment which I am sure has been offered \nin good faith but the effect of which really will be to intimidate \nadvocates of public health and, in particular, I think amounts to an \nintimidation of the attorney general of the State of Minnesota and, \nagain, the public health community who have hired legal advocates on \ntheir behalf and on the behalf, I might add, of the collective public \nhealth people in this country.\n  Mr. President, let me give a little bit of information about \nMinnesota's tobacco case, because this amendment does not have a \nneutral effect. My colleague, Senator Durbin from Illinois, last night \npointed this out. In a State like Minnesota we have pored through 36 \nmillion pages, 36 million documents, in what promises to be the biggest \ncourt case this winter. This will bring to light a tremendous amount of \ninformation in all likelihood, I think, dealing with some very serious \nabuses by the tobacco industry, which could lead to a very far-reaching \nand major financial settlement for Minnesota and also lead the way for \nother States. It also could lead the way toward some really dramatic \nprotection for people in this country. This amendment amounts to \nnothing less than an effort to intimidate advocates of public health \nand to intimidate the attorney general of the State of Minnesota.\n  The $250 per hour or $5 million cap altogether does not take into \naccount, as my colleague from Illinois mentioned last night, different \nefforts that have taken place in different States. But to me, again, \nregardless of the motivation, the effect of this amendment is a get \nMinnesota amendment and, I might add, it really goes after, again, most \nimportantly, advocates of public health.\n  I have no idea--I am not a lawyer--what the particular arrangements \nare between the attorney general and the contract with lawyers who are \nworking with our State, but I doubt very seriously that we, the U.S. \nSenate, have the constitutional right to directly intervene in that. I \ndo know this amounts to nothing less than an effort to get people to \nback down. I don't think that will happen, I say to my colleagues, not \nin Minnesota.\n  Let me say a little bit about Minnesota's tobacco case. Minnesota is \nthe first State in the Nation to charge the tobacco industry with \nconsumer fraud and antitrust violations and the second State to seek \nMedicaid reimbursement.\n  It is the only State with a private co-plaintiff, Blue Cross and Blue \nShield of Minnesota.\n  Minnesota's outside counsel, Robins, Kaplan, Miller, & Ciresi, has a \nnational reputation for resolving complex litigation battles against \ncorporate giants, including the Dalkon shield case and the Bhopal, \nIndia, chemical spill case.\n  This case was launched in August 1994. There are 36 million \ndocuments. The State has won the majority of pretrial motions and all \nappeals, including one in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The State has secured 30 million pages of documents through \ndiscovery. Minnesota has the largest collection of tobacco documents in \nthe world, housed in two secured depositories in Minneapolis and \nLondon.\n  Public documents already cited as evidence in the case have detailed \nyouth marketing, enhancement of the effect of nicotine, admissions of \nhealth problems, and other disclosures central to Minnesota's \nallegations. Most of the evidence remains under seal at the tobacco \nindustry's insistence.\n  The court is reviewing tobacco companies' most secret documents, \nformerly hidden under attorney-client privilege claims, for possible \ndisclosure. That is the current status.\n  The Minnesota case is rated by top tobacco stock analysts at \nBernstein Research as ``the biggest threat'' to the industry.\n  The trial begins January 1998.\n  I think that is what this is all about, at least in its effect. \nMinnesota's court case is the biggest threat to the industry. We will \nsee a disclosure of information that will be so critical to the health \nof people all across the country. This amendment amounts to an effort \nat intimidation toward the advocates of public health who have hired \nlawyers as their advocates and, again, I think is really aimed right at \nthe State of Minnesota, really aimed right at the attorney general of \nMinnesota.\n  This is a tobacco industry amendment. This industry doesn't want a \nState like Minnesota to go forward. This industry doesn't want lawyers \nout there representing the public health community. Let's be realistic \nabout it. The only way you can go through all these documents, the only \nway you can put together this kind of case, the only way you can go \nafter these tobacco companies, these giants, is by having lawyers \nworking for you. That is what the State of Minnesota has done. That is \nwhat the public health community has done. This amendment is an \namendment aimed at trying to bring a halt to this process.\n  Mr. President, I am not, again, an attorney, but I will raise two or \nthree final points. One, I don't really know how we in the Senate can \nsay to the attorney general of Minnesota or the State of Minnesota, \nwhatever your contractual arrangements are--and I don't even know what \nthey are with lawyers representing your State--we're going to come in \nand essentially declare that null and void; we're going to supersede \nthat contractual arrangement. I don't even know if we can do that.\n  No. 2, I will just tell you that when you are talking about 30 \nmillion pages of documents through discovery, this cap is not neutral \nin its effect on a State like Minnesota, and $5 million compared to \nwhat Minnesota might very well be able to accomplish by way of a damage \nsuit, by way of compensation for the people of Minnesota, by way of \ninformation for the public, by way of what information comes to those \nof us in the Congress, by way of what we can do with that information \nto protect the public health really amounts to hardly anything.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is a world of difference between $5 \nmillion and the amount ultimately that that kind of legal counsel on \nbehalf of the public health community will be able to obtain, again, by \nway of financial compensation and by way of information and by way of \nprotection for the public health, all of which has to do with research \nand protection of people's health in this country.\n  So let us just be real clear about this amendment. This is the \ntobacco company's dream amendment. That is what this is all about. And \nthat is what this vote is all about. I think my colleagues will be \nmaking a big mistake if they do not think that people cannot see \nthrough this.\n  Just a little bit of chronology here so that people in the country \nunderstand this debate right now. And I think they do already. My \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, joined by Senator Collins, \nRepublican from Maine, in a bipartisan effort, came to the floor of the \nSenate--let us just be sort of historical about this for a moment--and \nsaid, wait a minute, we had this tax package, and we had this budget \nbill,\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\nand that is what it was supposed to be all about. And lo and behold, \nsomebody slipped in a $50 billion relief package for the tobacco \ncompanies that they could use as credit toward any final compensation \nthat they owed to people in this country.\n  My colleague from Illinois was very polite. I will be just as polite \nbecause I do not really know who did it. He said that the tobacco \nindustry's lobbyists put this in the bill. They did not actually, \nliterally do that. Senators and Representatives did that. Actually, the \ntobacco companies' lobbyists are very powerful, obviously. We see it \nagain with this amendment. But they are not actually so powerful, as \nthe Chair knows, that they can actually directly write the amendment, \nliterally be the ones who put the amendment in in the conference \ncommittee. They cannot actually do that. They cannot actually sit there \nand pretend like they are Senators and Representatives. Actually some \nSenator or Representative has to do that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have three questions.\n  First, do you know whether the attorneys in the Minnesota case are \nbeing compensated on a contingent fee basis, that is, in which they \nwould get a percentage of the recovery, and in many of these States \nthey have done not much more than file a lawsuit, and already the \ntobacco industry is willing to pay large sums of money which would \nenable attorneys to receive huge fees for almost no work? I understand \nperhaps Minnesota is different and that they may be, perhaps, the only \nState in which the attorneys are employed on an hourly basis. Does the \nSenator know whether that is true or not?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, why not take all three questions and \nthen answer all three of them.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is the first one.\n  Second, is the Senator aware that, with regard to the receipt or \ncopying of the documents, those are expenses which are not covered by \nthis bill, or at least this bill provides a full payment of expenses to \nattorneys who incur them legitimately, even in furtherance of these \nlawsuits, and would be reimbursed? I pose those two questions to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My understanding is that on the first arrangement--and \nI am just learning about the arrangement right now--it is a contingency \nfee, which was challenged by the tobacco industry, and the tobacco \nindustry lost that in court, in response to your first question.\n  On the second question, I think, still, it does not have anything to \ndo with the----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the point by the Senator from Alabama is his \ncovers the expenses but does not cover the legal fees. So the expenses \nof literally physically collecting all these documents would be \ncovered, but to have the first attorney sit down and try to read them \nis going to be limited. So it is one thing to have a warehouse full of \ndocuments, but if you want to have competent legal minds reading those \ndocuments, deciding what is important for the lawsuit, the Senator from \nAlabama says that is fine, but we are going to put a ceiling on this, \nthere is just so much money to spend.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I guess the answer to the question, Mr. President, was \nthe Minnesota case is not on an hourly basis but on a contingent fee \nbasis?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is my understanding.\n  If I could go on--I think I have the floor--I was going to say to my \ncolleague, it is my understanding also that the tobacco industry \nchallenged that and that they lost in court.\n  Then in response to the second question, actually what my colleague \nfrom Illinois said was what I was going to say as well. Again, I am not \na lawyer, but it is pretty clear to me that it is fine to get the \ncompensation for the copying or whatever needs to be done with all the \ndocuments, but somebody has go through those documents, somebody has to \nread the documents, and somebody has to try to determine what those \ndocuments really are saying in terms of culpability, in terms of what \nmight have happened. That is, of course, the work that the lawyers are \ndoing on behalf of the public health community.\n  But, Mr. President, since there isn't a third question, let me go \nback because there are other colleagues on the floor. And I will be \npleased to----\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to present my third question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Sorry. You have the third question. I will be pleased \nto yield for the third question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Did the Senator know that this Senator refused to take \nmoney from the tobacco industry as attorney general and has sought \ntougher laws against the sale of tobacco to children and is not a tool \nor pawn of any tobacco company? In fact, I am offended it would be \nsuggested otherwise.\n  I believe tobacco is a very unhealthy substance. I think it is quite \nplain it causes cancer and premature death, and we ought to do \neverything we legitimately can to reduce its use. In fact, I am \nsupporting the amendment of the Senator from the State of Illinois and \nalso of the Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, that would prevent \nthem from having a $50 billion benefit. My concern is $14 billion in \nlegal fees to many attorneys who do not deserve anything like that kind \nof fee.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me respond to the third question. \nThen I will just finish up. But the first question actually raised by \nmy colleague from Alabama raises an interesting question.\n  In response to the third question, I say to my colleague from \nAlabama, I very much appreciate what he said. That is why I was very \ncareful in the beginning saying--I learned a long time ago to assume \ngood faith on the part of other colleagues, to basically assume people \nare doing what they think is right. I would not suggest that my \ncolleague is a pawn of anybody.\n  What I said was that the amendment, whatever the intention, has the \neffect, will have the effect, of intimidation of the public health \ncommunity and will have the effect of and amounts to an effort in terms \nof its effect to intimidate the attorney general in Minnesota and the \nState of Minnesota. That is exactly true, and in that respect, it is a \ntobacco company amendment.\n  Mr. President, actually--to go back to Minnesota--I find it \ninteresting that what happened apparently is Minnesota went to a \ncontingency fee, and then as a result of that, the tobacco companies \nchallenged this in court. So now we have an amendment on the floor \nwhich is another way of essentially trying to deal with this \narrangement in Minnesota. I do not think we in the U.S. Senate should \nbe doing this as it affects different States.\n  Mr. President, just a little bit of history to bring us to where we \nare right now.\n  So what happened is that unnamed colleagues--I mean, it was not the \ntobacco industry; they did not actually sit down in the committee and \nput the amendment in--somebody tucked the amendment in. Old politics, \nback room politics, you know, it just happens in the dark, just happens \nbehind the scenes. I mean, once upon a time people viewed that as being \nclever legislators. It just does not work that way any longer.\n  So my colleagues come to the floor, and they essentially say, ``Look, \nlet's just at least knock that out. That ought not be in there.'' That \nis what this amendment is about. That would be a proposition that we \ncould have an up-or-down vote on.\n  When I was back in Minnesota and the stories broke that in the tax \nbill we had this $50 billion tax break, tax credit, tax giveaway to the \ntobacco industry, people in Minnesota were saying to me, \n``Congratulations, Paul. You voted against that tax bill. You voted \nagainst that budget bill. You knew, and a lot of other people didn't.'' \nAnd I said to them, ``You know, I've got be honest. I voted against \nthat bill for other reasons. I didn't know. I would love to tell you I \nwas the one person who did and that is why I voted against it, but \nactually I didn't know.''\n  This was just sort of tucked in there. Some Senators, \nRepresentatives--one, two; I do not know how many--put it in there. It \nwas very cleverly done. But my colleagues have come to the floor and \nsaid, ``Look, we didn't know that\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\nwas in there. This is not the way it's supposed to work. This is not \nexactly a political process with a lot of accountability. We ought to \ntake it out. We can have an up-or-down vote on that.''\n  Now what we have is an amendment with the intended effect to \nintimidate advocates of public health. I mean, that is not the \nmotivation, but that would be the effect of it. I do not know that it \nis an intended effect. It probably isn't. But the effect of it would be \nto intimidate advocates of public health, to intimidate States like \nMinnesota where we have plowed through, again, 30 million pages of \ndocuments. The Minnesota case is rated by top tobacco stock analysts at \nBernstein Research as ``the biggest threat'' to the industry. And I can \nsee exactly what is going on here.\n  This is an amendment that is a dream come true for the tobacco \nindustry to try to go after States like Minnesota, to try to make sure \nthat States cannot go through with this. If that is what happens, then \nwe all lose.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just make it clear that this amendment, if \npassed, would have the effect of intimidating the public health \ncommunity, advocates for the public health community, and States like \nMinnesota that promised to bring to light, in what would be a huge \ncourt proceeding, information that will be vital to the public health \nof this country.\n\n  This amendment is not neutral in its effect. This is a tobacco \nindustry amendment. That is what this is all about. Therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues to vote no. As a Senator from Minnesota, I am proud that \nthe Minnesota case is viewed as the biggest threat to the industry. I \nam proud that the trial is going to begin in January 1998. I am proud \nthat, I think, a whole lot of information is going to come to light and \nwe are really going to learn much more about what exactly has been \ngoing on within this industry and how it has affected our families and \nhow it has affected our children.\n  But, Mr. President, this amendment is a get Minnesota amendment. This \namendment, with its caps, is an effort to go after Minnesota, to go \nafter advocates for Minnesota, to go after the public health community, \nto make sure that we do not have lawyers that are working on this and \nto make sure that ``the biggest threat'' to the industry court case may \nnever take place. It is an outrageous amendment. I hope colleagues will \nsee it for what it is and it will be voted down resoundingly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know that it is the desire of the \nSenator from Illinois and others to have the Senate make a judgment on \nthis issue. But it is a very, very important issue. I welcome the \nopportunity to join my colleagues in making comments about the \nimplications of this particular amendment. And I do so at this time.\n  Mr. President, the Sessions amendment is really one more attempt to \naid the tobacco industry at the expense of the public interest. Make no \nmistake about it, its effect would be to set up a major roadblock \npreventing the States from pursuing their cases against the tobacco \nindustry.\n  The Sessions amendment, as I read it, would restrict the ability of \nStates to retain the attorneys to pursue States' claims against the \ntobacco industry. As we all know, 40 States have filed suit against the \ntobacco companies. So far only two of those cases have been settled. \nJust yesterday, the tobacco industry said that it will no longer be \nsettling cases. The Texas case is scheduled to go to trial within the \nnext few weeks.\n  As Senator Wellstone has pointed out, Minnesota, which has done an \nenormous amount of work on covering the sordid history of the tobacco \nindustry, is scheduled to go to trial in just a few months.\n  So it would be an outrage for this Senate, acting at the behest of \nthe tobacco industry, to handcuff the States as they seek to compensate \ntheir citizens from an industry that kills 400,000 citizens each year.\n  If Senator Session's intent is to regulate the amount of attorney's \nfees to be paid as part of a national settlement, clearly, this \namendment is premature and unwarranted. Congress has not even begun to \nseriously debate the merits of the national proposal. The issue of \nattorney's fees in a settlement should be considered after there is a \nsettlement, not before.\n  The real intent of the Sessions amendment is clearly demonstrated by \nthe fact that, as originally drafted, it only sought to restrict the \nattorney's fees of attorneys representing the States, not the \nattorney's fees of the tobacco industry. To restrict the plaintiff \nattorney's fees would dramatically tilt the already uneven playing \nfield even more in favor of the tobacco companies. While Senator \nSessions has now added defense attorneys to his amendment, regulating \nthe amount of attorney's fees paid by the private party is highly \nquestionable and probably unconstitutional. Thus the effect of the \namendment would still be to place a burden just on the States.\n  Since under the terms of the settlement plaintiff attorney's fees \nwould be paid by the tobacco industry and those funds are not to come \nout of the proposed $368 billion national settlement, limiting \nplaintiff attorney's fees would not produce an additional dollar for \neither the State governments or the Federal Government. It would merely \nfurther enrich the tobacco industry.\n  While the amendment says that the money saved would be paid to the \nFederal Government for use by the National Institutes of Health, the \namount saved would never be determinable, and thus no significant \npayment to the Government would result.\n  So make no mistake about this amendment, blessed by the tobacco \nindustry, it is a ploy to kill the Durbin amendment. We were all \noutraged when we learned that a paragraph had been slipped into the \nbudget agreement to give the tobacco industry the $50 billion credit. \nThe amendment, if it is allowed to remain law, would cost the taxpayers \n$50 billion.\n  There has been a justified outcry against that gross abuse of the \nlegislative process. And there is now widespread support for repealing \nthat ill-conceived provision. Big tobacco knows that it cannot prevent \nrepeal directly, therefore, it has embraced the Sessions amendment as a \ndiversionary tactic.\n  Let us decisively reject this cynical gambit, beat the Sessions \nsecond-degree amendment, and overwhelmingly approve the Durbin \namendment. To do otherwise would be to erect an enormous roadblock in \nthe path of the States pursuing justice for their citizens against the \ntobacco cartel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. I speak in favor of the Sessions \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. I have not even given my speech. I don't know how you could \nhave a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is about the procedure we are to follow during the \nremainder of this debate.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield for a question on the procedure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wonder if the Senator would join Senator Sessions and \nmyself in a discussion of a limit on the remaining debate on this \namendment, if we could reach an accommodation and agreement as to how \nmuch time we would spend on the remaining debate?\n  Could I suggest, if the Senator would be kind enough to be party to \nthis discussion, that perhaps we agree to 40 minutes, equally divided, \nbetween us, if that is agreeable to the Senators on the other side.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think there is some discussion about us voting at \n10:45. I think that would be agreeable with me if there is no \nobjection. I think I indicated to the Senator from Illinois that I \nmight need 15 minutes. That would be for me, personally. I think there \nare some other Senators that would want to talk during that time on \nthis issue. I would be prepared to agree to that, but I would not want \nto limit my own time, the whole argument, in favor of this bill, to 15 \nminutes.\n  I want to say that to the Senator so I am not misleading him about \nthe time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might not have caught the last comment made by the \nSenator, but it is my understanding we are going to take a vote on a \nmotion to\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\ntable that I will offer at 10:45 and the time between now and then will \nbe equally divided between the proponents that Senator Sessions shall \nacknowledge, and the opponents that I shall acknowledge on my side, is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have some concern. My concern about that is that the \nopposition to this amendment has already been talking at least 20 \nminutes, so I do not think it would be appropriate and I would not be \nable to agree to an evenly divided 22 minutes on each side. Perhaps if \nyou added 15 minutes to that to our side and we voted at 11 o'clock, I \nwould be prepared to consent to that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. I agree to that time limit as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am sorry, I want to make sure there is \nclarity here.\n  The debate will continue now for an hour, evenly divided, is that the \npoint, and the vote to be taken at 11 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The debate will conclude at 11.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What I indicated I would agree to would be that we \nwould add 15 minutes to the 22 minutes that you have, making 37 minutes \nfor the proponent of the amendment and 22 minutes for the opposition. I \nthink that would be fair in light of the fact that you have already \ntaken more time than that this morning in opposition to the Senator's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands that clarification. That \nwould be in order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I do not have very many remarks on this but \nmy remarks have grown just since I have been here this morning.\n  I am fascinated with this accusation that my fellow Senator from \nAlabama is doing this on behalf of the tobacco folks. I have not seen \nhim do anything that has looked like it was on behalf of the tobacco \nfolks in this settlement. I have not done anything on behalf of the \ntobacco folks in this settlement, and during my campaign, even though I \nwas desperate for money, I didn't accept any money from the tobacco \nfolks.\n  I am in support of the second-degree amendment and I am in support of \nthe first-degree amendment. I am in support of both of them because \nthey both leave all the money on the table. That is kind of hard to \ndetermine. We do not know at this point what the money is that is on \nthe table. The Senator from Kentucky last night went through quite a \ndiscussion of how much it might be in addition to $368.5 billion, but \nthis debate is about how much less than $368.5 billion it might be.\n  Quite frankly, I am fascinated with the whole discussion on the \ntobacco settlement. I hear these comments about whether it is \nconstitutional to limit attorney's fees or not. I cannot tell you for \nsure that it is constitutional for us to be talking about a tobacco \nsettlement at all. This is an arrangement that the States entered into, \nthrough some lawsuits, and then some discussions, and now they are \nasking us to seal the deal on their behalf. Usually they are asking us \nto keep our hands out of their business, and I am in favor of doing \nthat. I think the States have some rights that we have infringed on for \na long time and that it is our job here to return as many of those \nrights to the States as we possibly can.\n  So now we have the States saying, ``Please meddle in our affairs and \nseal this deal for us.'' Quite frankly, I am not hearing them say, \n``Meddle in this deal but don't meddle in the attorney's fees.'' They \nare not saying that. We are not even sure what the attorney's fee \narrangements are between the different States.\n  If we have a constitutional right to do one, seal the deal, I think \nwe have a constitutional right, too, to make sure that we understand \nwhat the attorney's fees are.\n  When this passes it will not be the final time that it will be \ndebated. There will be a conference committee on it and one of the \nthings I have learned in the short time I have been here in the Senate \nis that those conference committees can do almost anything they want. \nWhen this particular amendment comes back it can have eliminated every \nconcern of the people in the House and the Senate. Everything we have \ndebated here can be changed or it can be left out.\n  I think at this point it is extremely important that we talk about \nthe attorney's fees and not let everybody in the country go running off \nto hire more attorneys at whatever rate they can entice them. Quite \nfrankly, I think this could turn into one of the biggest lotteries in \nthe United States. I think we need to have some parameters.\n\n  Now, the parameter that is in this amendment is $5 million, or $250 \nan hour for each and every hour they put in the process. It was \nmentioned just a little while ago that you have to have people read the \ndocuments and determine what is important out of several million \ndocuments. Well, each and every one of those people reading those \ndocuments would get $250 an hour, not just the lead attorney, and him \nhaving to separate it out to the people reading the documents for him, \neverybody gets $250 an hour. That is quite an economic boon. The only \nlimitation on it is $5 million per State.\n  Do you think these people went out and obtained $5 million worth of \nState money or even suggested that attorneys ought to be able to get \nthat through a contingency fee? If they did do that, why are they \nturning around and asking us to confirm what they did, but saying, ``We \ncannot give you the details?'' This amendment will bring out the \ndetails, and it is not the final action. The first-degree amendment \nbrings out the details.\n  We found that there was a stipulation in the last conference report--\nit was not an action we took, it was a conference report action--that \nthere would be a credit against the tobacco tax, and we say, no, we \nwill put that back on the table. I am all for putting that back on the \ntable. We are starting to commit settlement money without having a \nsettlement, without having a deal and without knowing whether the money \nis for the Federal Government or for the States. It is too premature to \nmake those kinds of deals.\n  I commend the Senators from Maine and Illinois for their effort to \nget the cigarette tax back on the table so we can decide, and I commend \nthe Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, for putting the attorney's \nfees on the table so we can take a look at whether they earned them or \nnot and what part they played in this process. It seems to me to be \nlogical.\n  Another little twist on this whole tobacco settlement is we are \ntalking about several years of payments in the tobacco settlement, but \nwe are talking about upfront, putting them out of business. There is \nnot much clamor against putting them out of business, but you do not \nget money over a long term from somebody that you put out of business.\n  We want to stop the cigarette sales. We want to get people to quit \nsmoking and having the harmful residuals that are showing up from the \ntobacco, but are we going to give away the first money that comes in, \nthe money that is most assured of having, to the attorneys? And then \nwhen we put them out of business, saying ``What happened to the other \n$300 billion we were going to get out of the bill? How come we don't \nget the money?'' We committed that money.\n  So I certainly hope that the Senate will be careful and not commit \nmoney that we do not have, commit money that we do not understand how \nwe are going to get, commit money that it may not be constitutional to \ntake. But I do hope we will investigate and work this thing to the \ngreatest benefit possible for stopping smoking and helping the health \nsituation in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his comments. He \nis a very thoughtful Member of this body and watches after the \ntaxpayers' money with great interest. I think his comments are right on \npoint. I am delighted to have him share those with us today.\n  We are talking about allowing $5 million in attorney's fees to be \npaid. In addition to that, we are talking about allowing unlimited \namounts of money to be spent for expenses in a litigation.\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\n That could be for computerization, committees, receiving records, \nclerks analyzing records and collating records, filing records, and \nstoring records.\n  I have been an attorney for a long time. This idea about 30,000 \ndocuments, that is what you normally say when you come to court and you \nare not ready to go to trial and you say, ``Judge, we have 5,000 \ndocuments.'' Well, probably 4,999 of them are some sort of receipts or \ndocuments that do not even need reviewing, have no real significance to \nthe issue at hand, but there may be a few in there that do. That is a \nprice of fame about how many documents it is--suggesting the great \ncomplexity of the case that may have very little to do with the \ncomplexity of the case.\n  Let me say this, there has been a lot of talk about big tobacco. I am \nnot supporting big tobacco. I am supporting the amendment that is on \nthe floor today.\n  What I would like to say is there is another big political force in \nthis country, there is another big force in this country that attempts \nto work its will, and that is the plaintiff lawyers. They are one of \nthe major contributors to campaigns in this Nation. They receive \nsettlements of millions of dollars in lawsuits and contribute millions \nof dollars to people, politicians and judges and others who further \ntheir view of what litigation is about.\n  Now, I believe in litigation. I am not against litigation. I am not \nagainst the lawsuits. I do not want to pass a bill that would stop \nthese lawsuits. I am going to tell you we are talking about not just \nmillions of dollars, not just tens of millions of dollars, not just \nhundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees. We are talking about \nbillions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars.\n  Published reports indicate that this time that the plaintiff \nattorneys, these private attorneys who are hired to do these cases by \nthe State attorney generals, they expect to receive $10 to $14 \nbillion--billion dollars.\n  In the State of Alabama, outside the education, the general fund \nbudget of the State of Alabama is less than $1 billion. We are talking \nabout a small group--not hundreds and hundreds of attorneys, but a \nsmall group of probably less than 100 firms, probably less than 50 \nfirms, receiving $10 to $14 billion in legal fees. Many of these States \nhave only just filed their lawsuits. The tobacco company comes in and \nagrees, and they put the money out on the table--$300, $400, or $500 \nbillion on the table. Most of these attorneys have contingent-fee \ncontracts, in which they intend to receive a percentage of that money, \nand they did little more than copy a lawsuit and file the same lawsuit \nsome other lawyer filed in some other State. They are entitled to do \nthat under their fee agreement. It is not right. It is money that ought \nto be going to the health of children in America.\n  This bill says we are going to put a limit on it, and $5 million is a \npretty good legal fee. In my opinion, $250 an hour is high-paid \nattorneys. I think anywhere else you would see that. So we think that \nis a good limitation on it. And it is unlimited on expenses that may be \nincurred. I think, Mr. President, this is a good way to deal with this \nmatter.\n  I am going to tell you what has offended me. I was a State attorney \ngeneral just last year, and I had some knowledge of how this litigation \nwas being managed and how these attorneys were being hired on a \ncontract basis. So I have asked about that when we have had hearings in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee of which I am a member. I have asked one \nof the attorneys general what the fee agreement was in his State. He \navoided answering that. Others have asked that question. We have gotten \nno answers. I have written an attorney general and two of these \nplaintiff lawyers and asked them, over a month ago, to tell me the \nnature of their fee agreement and how much they expected to get. I have \nyet to hear from them. Senator Grassley, a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has also written letters asking about how much money is \ngoing to be paid for attorney's fees, and they won't say. They have \neverything else spelled out in this global settlement, but they don't \ntalk about the billions of dollars that will be going to plaintiff \nattorneys, many of them who put little work into the case. They don't \nwant to talk about that.\n  In fact, this whole settlement agreement is designed to conceal the \namount of money paid as attorney's fees. There is no other way to \ndescribe it. I hate to say that. It is a serious matter, what is \nhappening here. Let me explain to you, as a litigator and attorney \nmyself, and former attorney general, I have an appreciation for this \nmatter. These private plaintiff attorneys who expect to make themselves \nrich on this settlement representing the States involved have said: We \nwon't talk about our attorney's fees publicly. We will just enter into \na side agreement with big tobacco and they will pay our attorney's \nfees. The tobacco industry will pay our attorneys' fees. The State of \nAlabama, the State of Minnesota, or the State of Illinois won't have to \npay our attorney's fees. The tobacco industry will pay our attorney's \nfees. That is a joke. That is not a way to settle a lawsuit. These \nattorneys work for the State, who is supposed to be paying their fee, \nnot the party on the other side, not the person they are suing. They \nshould not be paying the fee in a secret arrangement.\n  These attorneys are representing the State, the people. We need to \nknow and we are entitled to know how much they are being paid. This \nbill says that they must make public any fee agreements they have and \nreport to the people how much they expect to receive. I think that, at \na minimum, we need do that. It is time to send a message that we are \nnot going to tolerate this behavior. Everything else is going to be on \nthe table. We are not going to have bills that go through to provide \ntax benefits to tobacco and we are not going to have plaintiff lawyers, \nwho are some of the biggest contributors to political campaigns in \nAmerica, enriching themselves any more than tobacco ought to enrich \nitself with a secret, side agreement.\n  Now, let me talk about that just a little more. The problem --and I \nthink any lawyer would recognize this--is a conflict of interest. The \nattorney for one side says to his client: Don't worry about the \nattorney's fee, Mr. Client. I will get the attorney's fees from the guy \nwe are suing. He will pay me and we don't need to bother to tell you \nabout that. See? So the deal is, well, you get into a tough point in \nthe negotiation and you can't reach a settlement, and big tobacco says \nto the attorney for the State of Alabama, or the State of Illinois, or \nthe State of Minnesota: Well, why don't we just add a billion dollars \nfor attorney's fees, Mr. Attorney. Maybe you can agree to this idea.\n  See, that is the fundamental conflict that is there. I think this \nprobably would violate the standard rules of ethics. Certainly, it \nwould violate the high standards of the legal profession. And I am sure \nany group of prominent attorneys asked about that would express very \nserious concerns about that because it presents a conflict of interest \nand the kind of activity that ought not to be tolerated. So I think we \nneed to get into this. I think we need to limit these fees and take \nthat money, as our bill does, and send it to the National Institutes of \nHealth so it can be used for research on children's diseases. I think \nthat is the appropriate use of any of these excess fees.\n  Mr. President, let me just say this. There are a lot of States who \nhave just recently filed these suits. I submit they have done little \nmore than copy the suits that some of these other States have filed. \nYet, they are large States and they are going to receive tens of \nbillions of dollars, and based on what I understand may be a common fee \narrangement, these attorneys would be entitled to receive 25 percent of \nthe recovery. I don't know why the published reports say that it is $10 \nto $14 billion. That seems to me to be less than some of these \narrangements. Maybe, but at any rate, it is too much. Twenty-five \npercent of that may be $100 billion in legal fees, which could provide \nall kinds of assistance and aid to dealing with children's diseases and \nhealth-related matters, many of which we ought to focus on tobacco, \nbecause we do know that tobacco is a very unhealthy substance. We know \nthat teenagers who become smokers find it extremely difficult to quit \nlater as an adult. In fact, it is many times more difficult for a \nperson to quit smoking if they commence smoking as a teenager than if \nthey began as an adult. That is why we\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\nneed to deal with the health question of teen smoking and why I think \nit is an important national issue. I salute those who believe in doing \nsomething about it.\n  Finally, let me just say this. What business do we have in involving \nourselves in this kind of litigation and trying to involve ourselves in \nwhat kind of attorney's fees should be paid? The reason we are involved \nin it is because we have been asked to. The attorney generals, these \nplaintiff lawyers, and big tobacco have all asked us to involve \nourselves and legislate this settlement. That is an interesting, \nprobably unprecedented event, so far as I know, in the history of this \ncountry. We are talking about dealing with that professionally and \nanalyzing it. A number of committees in this body are looking at it \ntoday, and I am sure it will be hammered out and much will be done. But \nI simply say that if this body does not legislate a global settlement \nconcerning this litigation, this amendment will have no effect. It \ntakes effect only if there is a global legislative confirmation of some \nsort of this settlement. At that point, I think it is appropriate for \nus to limit attorney's fees and deal with this. As a matter of fact, I \nthink it is more than appropriate; I think it is absolutely essential \nthat we do so.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I say to this body that this amendment is, in no \nway, designed to assist big tobacco. I am offended that anyone would \nsuggest that it does. It is designed to put money in the hands of \nchildren by taking it from lawyers who are about to receive one of the \nbiggest windfalls in the history of litigation--not one of the biggest, \nbut the biggest windfall in the history of litigation in the entire \nworld is about to occur. Attorneys are about to receive tens, hundreds \nof millions of dollars for cases they only worked on a few months. A \nfew firms may have worked longer, but most only have worked a few \nmonths on these cases and have not expended large sums of money. This \namendment gives them a very generous $5 million in attorney's fees and \nan unlimited expense account to carry on their litigation. And, in \naddition, it says there has to be some reasonable limits. We are not \ngoing to allow them to have a jackpot justice and make tens of hundreds \nof millions of dollars off of litigation of this kind.\n  So I say to the distinguished Members of this body that this is a \nproper thing for us to do. It is a proper time for us to do it. I also \nsay there is something unhealthy here, something that does not quite \nsmell right, when we have secret agreements on attorney's fees, \nrepresenting billions of dollars, and they won't even be discussed at a \ntime we are being asked to evaluate this entire settlement.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly believe that this is a reasonable and \nfair amendment. It allows very generous attorney's fees and expenses to \nbe paid, but sets a cap on it so the people of this country can know \nthat the recovery in these lawsuits is going to help and not go to \nattorneys in a windfall.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Chair be kind enough to alert the Members as to \nthe remaining time allocated to both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 22\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from Alabama has 16 minutes and 8 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Why are we here today? Because the tobacco company lobbyists, at the \nlast minute, in our tax bill, which we considered several weeks ago, \nmanaged to sneak in a provision that was not debated on the floor of \nthe Senate, nor on the floor of the House. It was never brought to \npublic light. It wasn't discussed by the leadership, by anyone. And \nthis provision, which is 46 words at the end of the tax bill--a \nprovision which they hoped no one would notice--gave to the tobacco \ncompanies a $50 billion setoff against any tobacco settlement. The \ntobacco companies that came to us and said, ``We have learned our \nlesson, we are a new industry, we are sensitive to the public health \nproblems we have created,'' managed to sneak in in the dead of night \nand put in this provision, which gave them a $50 billion setoff.\n  Outrageous. When it was discovered and when we went about Capitol \nHill, from office to office, saying, ``All right, who is going to claim \npride of authorship here?'' Not a soul would admit they authored this \nprovision. After weeks of investigation, finally, a staff member came \nforward and said to the USA Today that it was prepared, word for word, \nby the tobacco companies. They put this provision in the law. They put \nit at the tail end of this bill, and the leadership on Capitol Hill \nlooked the other way, at best. As a result, this $50 billion outrage is \nnow in the law.\n  Senator Collins of Maine and I have offered an amendment to repeal \nthat. Now, the tobacco companies don't like our amendment. They have \nalready said publicly that if the Durbin-Collins amendment is adopted, \nit is going to jeopardize the settlement. They want a $50 billion \nwindfall. Well, I sense from the debate today that when this is over, \nthat provision is going to be repealed. But I have learned from over 10 \nyears of fighting these tobacco companies never to assume a thing. They \nalways have one trick left in the bag. Unfortunately, that trick is the \nSessions amendment.\n  Let me tell you this. I don't, for a moment, question the sincerity \nof my colleague from Alabama. Nor do I suggest that he is a cat's-paw \nof the tobacco companies. But make no mistake, if he ends up winning \nhis amendment, you will see a smile on the grizzled mug of Joe Camel, \nbecause the Sessions amendment will achieve what the tobacco companies \nhave failed to achieve. The Sessions amendment is the effort of the \ntobacco companies when they can't stop the lawsuits to stop the \nlawyers.\n  Oh, how they must despise these plaintiffs' lawyers--this army of \nlawyers who joined with attorneys general across the United States in \n40 different States and said, ``We will join with you in suing the \ntobacco giants. We understand each State is hard pressed to have the \nresources to bring the lawsuits. We will be involved in the lawsuits on \na contingent basis. If you win, if your State wins, then we get a fee. \nIf you don't, then our fee is reduced.''\n  It is a contingent-fee basis. It is a basis for many lawsuits. There \nis nothing inherently evil or outrageous about it. Many people come to \nlawyer's offices every day without the resources to prosecute a \nlawsuit, and a lawyer says, ``I will take it on a contingency. If you \nwin, I win a fee. If you lose, I don't win a fee.'' There is nothing \nsinister about this. It is a contingent fee.\n  So that is what we are debating here today. The Senator from Alabama \ncalls it jackpot justice. I have heard him in committee and on the \nfloor. And he has very strong personal feelings about contingent-fee \nlawsuits. That is his point of view. I don't share it. But consider \nwhat his amendment would do.\n  First, it would limit the total attorney's fees paid in the United \nStates of America to all the plaintiffs' lawyers assisting all the \nattorneys general to $250 million maximum--a huge sum of money, is it \nnot? But in the context of a tobacco settlement of $368 billion, how \nbig is it? It is one-tenth of 1 percent. That is the contingency fee \nwhich the Senator from Alabama thinks is a reasonable amount. I would \nsuggest to him that he shouldn't prejudge what each State attorney \ngeneral faced when they were asked by their taxpayers and consumers in \nthe State to bring a lawsuit against these giant tobacco companies and \nentered into agreements with the various attorneys to help them do \nthat.\n  In fact, I think quite honestly the Sessions amendment is designed to \nstop one lawsuit in particular--the Minnesota lawsuit. Attorney General \nSkip Humphrey of Minnesota said he is going to try it. Unlike the \nStates of Mississippi and Florida, which have settled, the State of \nMinnesota has said we are going to take this to trial. The tobacco \ncompanies dread that prospect because, if, in fact, Minnesota goes to \ntrial, then the documents which they have secreted, the documents which \nthey have concealed for decades, will finally come to light.\n  I went to a meeting a few weeks ago, Senator Daschle's task force on \nthis subject. And a representative of the tobacco companies came in, \nand said that if the Minnesota case goes to trial there will not be a \ntobacco settlement. They dread so the prospect that the things which \nthey have secreted away\n\n[[Page S9040]]\n\nfrom public scrutiny will come to light that they, in fact, have said, \n``Stop the Minnesota case.''\n  I believe the Sessions amendment wittingly or unwittingly will stop \nthe Minnesota case. Is that fair? Is that fair after the State of \nMinnesota and so many other States have invested so much in this effort \nfor us to step in at this moment, and say, ``We will void your \nagreements, we will void your contracts, we are the Federal Government, \nafter all, and we will second-guess you?''\n  Some people even question whether Senator Sessions' amendment is \nconstitutional. They wonder if we, in fact, under article I, section \n10, of the Constitution can impair the obligation of contracts already \nentered into. But I don't know that we will resolve that constitutional \nquestion on the floor.\n  What we can accept as a reality is that if the Sessions amendment \ngoes forward it will at least put a damper on any future lawsuits and \nperhaps stop them in place. They will be jumping for joy on tobacco \nroad, if the Sessions amendment is successful. In aiming at the \nattorneys and their contingency fees, the Sessions amendment hits the \npublic health community, which has had the courage to step forward with \n40 attorneys general and sue the tobacco companies. The Senator from \nAlabama may think that he is sending a message to the attorneys of \nAmerica about contingency fees. He is sending a message to tobacco \ncompanies that they still have a chance on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I hope my colleagues will not support this amendment. In fact, I \nwould like to let them know that if, in fact, my motion to table \nprevails and the Sessions amendment is not agreed to, that I will then \noffer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment of my own.\n  I would like to read it.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that attorney's fees paid in \n     connection with an action maintained by a State against one \n     or more tobacco companies to recover tobacco related costs \n     affected by Federal tobacco settlement legislation should be \n     publicly disclosed and should not displace spending in the \n     settlement legislation intended for public health.\n\n  The bottom line of my substitute would require each State, each \nattorney general, to make a public disclosure of their fee arrangement \nwith any attorneys that have been brought into this lawsuit, and no \nmoneys paid to those attorneys will be at the expense of the public \nhealth initiatives that are part of this settlement. Then in each State \nthe attorney general, in most cases elected, will have to be held \naccountable as he or she should be for their decision.\n  I don't think that is unreasonable. And I think, as they come forward \nto explain to the taxpayers of their State that they entered into this \ncontingency fee arrangement knowing that they might or might not \nrecover, that the attorney's fee ultimately paid will be justified by \nthe money coming back from the tobacco companies to the taxpayers of \nthe State. Public disclosure--I don't think that is unreasonable.\n  But I do believe the Sessions amendment is unreasonable. What it \nseeks to do is begin to draft the national tobacco settlement \nagreement. And I don't think that is fair, and I don't think this is \nthe appropriate time to do it.\n  The purpose of the Durbin-Collins amendment is to go back to where we \nstarted--to that point in time where the tobacco companies' offer of \n$368.5 billion, through the State attorneys general, came to Capitol \nHill to be debated. It wipes off the books the $50 billion set-aside--\nthe $50 billion giveaway--and it says we are back to the starting \npoint.\n  If we adopt the Sessions amendment, I think we are going to \njeopardize not only the active prosecution of these tobacco companies \nbut jeopardize this settlement agreement.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Alabama yield 5 minutes?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first off, I am a cosponsor of the \nunderlining Collins-Durbin or Durbin-Collins amendment. Second, I am a \nvery suspicious of this tobacco agreement.\n  I tend to think that there are some serious concerns here relative to \nwhat we are getting and what is being done. And especially I am \nconcerned about the fact that I think the only winners out of this may \nbe the trial lawyers and the tobacco companies. And I don't think that \nshould be the result of the settlement.\n  But I also strongly support what Senator Sessions, the former \nattorney general from Alabama, is proposing here because basically what \nwe have here is an unholy alliance between the tobacco industry and the \ntrial lawyers.\n  It was pointed out very effectively by Senator Sessions that there is \nalmost an ethical question here of whether then you pay off the people \nsuing you to stop suing--pay them all off in terms of multiple billions \nof dollars. We are talking about here potentially $40 billion to $50 \nbillion in attorney's fees, and whether or not when such an occurrence \nhappens, whether you have any sort of agreement which is fair, ethical, \nor appropriate. So Senator Sessions has raised an extraordinarily \nlegitimate question.\n  I think it is extremely inconsistent for those who are opposing the \ntobacco settlement generally, and who have put forward this amendment--\nthe underlying amendment, which is a good one, to try to knock out at \nleast one section of this proposal which was moved in the middle of the \nnight--for that same position to be arguing on behalf of the trial \nlawyers, I find that to be entirely inconsistent.\n  Moreover, I find the arguments that have been made from the either \nside to be filled with straw dogs and red herrings. Let's talk about \nthem for a second.\n  First is the argument that the Minnesota case wouldn't go forward. Of \ncourse the Minnesota case will be forward because the trial attorney's \nfees, which will be affected by the Sessions amendment, apply to the \nagreement--not to trying cases when there is a case tried, when it goes \nto trial, or when it is outside the parameters of the agreement. Then \nclearly the contingent fee will lie if the case is successful. So that \nis a red herring in the first order.\n  The idea that this is unconstitutional because there is some sort of \ncontract that is being abrogated, obviously it is constitutional \nbecause the fact is the Congress is being asked to create this \ncontract. That is what we are being asked to do. There is no contract \nyet. The Congress is being asked to create a contract. If we are going \nto be asked to create this contract, we can certainly dictate one of \nthe terms. And one nice term might be that we not end paying the trial \nlawyers $40 billion but rather pay NIH that $40 billion. In fact, by my \nestimate you can fund almost all the uninsured health care in this \ncountry today. Almost all of the people who do not have health care \ncould be funded if we were to take $40 billion of the trial lawyer's \nfees and apply it to the uninsured people in this country. And, as a \nresult, for almost a 5-year period I think you would have funding for \nthe uninsured health care of people who do not have health insurance in \nthis country. In fact, in the major debate that we just had over child \nhealth care insurance the issue was whether we should go from $16 to \n$24 billion in order to cover uninsured children in this country \ntoday--$24 billion for a 5-year period.\n  This $50 billion for trial lawyers--let's put it toward the kids. \nLet's put it toward health care. It is a heck of a good idea that the \nSenator from Alabama has come up with. NIH can use this money much \nbetter. Uninsured people in the health care community can use this \nmoney much better.\n  At the absolute minimum we should have some disclosure here as to \nwhat is going on. You talk about deals in the middle of the night, \nwhich the Senator from Illinois has so aptly pointed to, and the \nSenator from Maine has so aptly pointed to in the passage of this tax \nbreak, which is totally inappropriate, a deal in the middle of the \nnight. This is a deal in the middle of night on some other continent. I \nmean, we can't even find out what this deal is. At least we found out \nwhat the tobacco deal was on the tax side, and the Sessions amendment \nwill get us to the bottom of that issue to find out what the heck \nreally happened here, and how much\n\n[[Page S9041]]\n\nthe attorney's fees are going to be. But we know they are going be \nmassive. Otherwise they wouldn't be fighting so hard to keep us from \nfinding out about them.\n  So the Senator from Alabama has raised a totally appropriate \namendment. It is a red herring to allege that this in any way assists \nthe tobacco industry. It does just the opposite. The fact is that the \ntrial lawyers have had a stranglehold on, regrettably, this \nadministration. They have seen this administration veto two major \nproduct liability bills--the securities bill and the product liability \nbill, one of which we were smart enough to override, the other of which \nwe couldn't override as a result of the trial lawyer influence. Now \nwhen we are trying to get to the bottom of just how much is going to be \npaid here, how much is coming out of the people's pockets, we run into \nthis argument that it is inappropriate.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Alabama is totally appropriate. And \nI strongly support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields to the Senator from Maine?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 5 minutes to the cosponsor of my amendment, \nSenator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in very reluctant opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions. I do \nbelieve that the issue of attorney's fees is an important one. But it \nshould be debated in the context of the global tobacco settlement. My \nfear is that despite the best intentions of the sponsors of this \namendment that passage of the Sessions amendment would jeopardize the \nunderlying Durbin-Collins amendment to repeal the $50 billion tax \ngiveaway to big tobacco. For that reason, I am going to vote to table \nSenator Sessions' amendment.\n  I do want to point out one issue that has become obscured in this \ndebate, and that is that the money that will be paid in attorney's fees \ndoes not come out of the $368.5 billion global settlement. Instead, the \nattorney's fees will be paid by the tobacco industry, separate from the \nsettlement. So the attorney's fees do not diminish the amount of the \n$368.5 billion settlement. I think that is an important point that has \nbeen lost in this debate.\n  I share the concerns of my colleague from Alabama about an attorney's \nfees. I think there are, however, constitutional issues about whether \nCongress can step in and abrogate contracts that were reached between \nthe States attorneys general and private law firms. That is an issue \nthat deserves to be thoroughly explored. But, most of all, I urge my \ncolleagues, whatever their position on the tobacco settlement, whatever \ntheir position on the issue of attorney's fees, to save this debate for \na more appropriate time. And that is when the global tobacco settlement \nis before the Senate. My fear is that the passage of this amendment \nwould jeopardize the underlying amendment to repeal the $50 billion tax \nbreak, and I do not believe we should allow that to happen. For this \nreason, I will support the motion to table, offered by the Senator from \nIllinois.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, could the Chair inform us of the time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 9\\1/2\\ minutes; \nthe Senator from Alabama has 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield some time to my \nfriend, the Senator from New Jersey. I would like to yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois for the courtesy. I will not talk long now. It is my \nunderstanding this is the only vote that has been registered for \nconsideration at this juncture, and I assume that there will be time \nbetween the vote on the Sessions amendment and the underlying Durbin \namendment.\n  Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I just want to register my support for \nthe Durbin-Collins amendment to repeal big tobacco's rebate in the tax \nreconciliation bill that granted a $50 billion giveaway--$50 billion \ngiveaway--to the tobacco industry. The condition that has created so \nmuch suspicion about the tobacco companies and their industry is that \nthere is no time, no time at all when they come forward cleanly, let \nthe smoke clear away, and offer direct and candid explanations about \nwhat it is they have been up to all these years.\n  I will have some comments later about the speech given last night by \nthe distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. \nHe asked for a quick conclusion--let's get going. He asked that the \nPresident send down a bill that we can discuss and vote on, get it done \nwith.\n  Well, Mr. President, this attack on the American people's health has \nbeen going on for decades, more than 50, 60 years. I remember when I \nwas a soldier and part of the ration kit that I got to be used as an \nemergency food supply had some cigarettes stuck in it. It was so much a \npart of our structure, so much a part of our culture that cigarettes \nbecame more valuable than currency in some of the countries during the \nSecond World War.\n  So there is a lot of information that has been accumulated over a lot \nof years, and contrary to the comments of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah last night, I think we ought to take our time. I think we \nought to make sure that we have the most complete review of millions of \npages of information. I think that we can find what we want within a \ngroup of documents about 1.5 million pages long. They are called the \nMinnesota Select Set. There has been a consolidation of information to \nfewer pages than the full 33 million that the court in Minnesota is \ngoing to have for review.\n  Last night, the distinguished Senator from Utah talked about 33 \nmillion pages. He said, what do we need that for? Well, I think it is \nquite clear to people within earshot here and who have been watching \nwhat has been going on in the Capitol when the committee now reviewing \ncampaign expenditures or campaign revenue raising, fundraising, has \nrequested over 10 million documents for review from the AFL-CIO alone, \nby the Senator who is chairman of that committee, Senator Thompson.\n  So, Mr. President, we are talking about a very complicated piece of \nagreement. We have by the most conservative yardstick probably 5 \nmillion people killed as a result of smoking, who died prematurely as a \nresult of smoking. We know that 430,000 die each year from respiratory-\nrelated conditions--lung cancer, you name it, emphysema. We learned \nrecently from a study by the Harvard public health school that 50,000 \nheart attacks per year, fatal heart attacks per year, take place among \nthose who are subjected to passive smoking, not smoking themselves. So \nagain by the most conservative of calculations we say that some 500,000 \npeople have been dying as a result of smoking-related illness.\n  If I might ask, Mr. President, my friend from Illinois for another \nminute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield an additional minute to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So, Mr. President, I hope that we will not be rushed \ninto doing something, get it behind us, get it over with. There is much \ntoo much to be gained by a thorough review of all of the documents, and \nwe should not ask the President of the United States to come down here \npell-mell, willy-nilly with a bill for us to consider and pass. If it \ntakes time, I think that time can be valuably used despite the fact \nthat I would like the assault on our children to stop as quickly as \npossible. I do not want any more seduction of our children to pick up \nsmoking because the tobacco industry knows, in their spurious attempts \nat trying to ensure their marketplace, they have directed their \nmarketing at children, trying to get 3,000 kids a day to pick up the \nsmoking habit so a million a year of new smokers will be there to \nreplace that market which is affected by those who are dying \nprematurely.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to an extended debate. I hope that \nthe\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\nDurbin-Collins amendment will be supported overwhelmingly to show the \nAmerican people that we are not going to knuckle under to the \nmachinations of the tobacco industry. We are not going to let it get \nthrough the front door or the back door. We want to close down what the \ntobacco industry has been doing to our citizens for these many years, \nand it is perhaps going to take more time than would be thought to be \nnecessary to arrive at a proper settlement.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Alabama yield for two very brief \nquestions about his amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to clarify something that has been said during the \ncourse of debate. First, is it the intention of the amendment of the \nSenator that the limitation on attorney's fees would apply in those \ncases where States decide to go forward and prosecute a case as opposed \nto those that are involved in the national settlement agreement?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe that the correct interpretation of this \namendment and the intention of it would be, if a case went on to \nlitigation and was not a part of the global settlement, it would not be \ncovered by this agreement. But any settlements that were entered into \nnow or subsequently that asked to be part of the global settlement by \nCongress would be appropriately covered.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the Senator is saying--I am trying to reconcile his \nsection (b). He applies this limitation to court orders as well as any \nsettlement agreement. It would seem his limitation on attorney's fees \nwould apply in either instance, whether the State decides to prosecute \nthe claim and ignore the possibility of a national settlement or in \nfact reaches a settlement agreement. It would appear that his \nlimitation on the attorney's fees would apply in either case.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't think it would apply if the case went on to \nlitigation because it would not be part of the global settlement. Our \nbill does not take effect unless there is an act of this Congress that \nglobally settles the litigation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator I think his amendment needs to \nbe clarified because that was not clear to me.\n  The second point I would like to raise, in section (e) where you \nprovide for funds for children's health research, if in fact attorney's \nfees are not to be paid out of the $368.5 billion and in fact are to be \npaid separately, from what source is the Senator drawing these funds \nthat would go to the National Institutes of Health?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I don't mind responding to the Senator's \nquestion. I sought the floor. But I choose to have it on his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may decline to yield further time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have some comments that I would like to make and my \ntime is getting short, but I think it would support the National \nInstitutes of Health and that is what we would favor.\n  This is a matter of real seriousness. We are not talking about a \nlittle game or gimmick here. We are talking about huge sums of money. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire talked in the debate on this floor of \nfrom $16 to $20 billion of children's insurance and how $4 billion was \nconsidered carefully before the Congress appropriated that money. We \nare talking about perhaps $40 billion in attorney's fees, and they \nrefuse to tell the American public how much the fees are. They refuse \nto produce their agreements. These are attorneys representing public \nbodies, not private individuals.\n  With regard to contingent fees, I am not against private contingent \nfees. I think in many cases that is an effective and appropriate way to \nhandle litigation for a private party. But I am very concerned about \npublic bodies hiring attorneys to represent them and the people of \ntheir States on a contingent fee basis that could result in awards of \nattorney's fees of tens of billions of dollars. So I would think very \nseriously about that.\n  I was amazed to hear the comment made that this would intimidate and \nhamper the public health community. The public health community will \nbenefit from this because we would see this money go to the National \nInstitutes of Health and not to attorneys, so they could use it for \nresearch and other good things. It will not stop the ongoing \nlitigation. I certainly believe it will continue in every State in the \nNation that chooses to proceed.\n  Finally, I think the Senator from Maine is incorrect in suggesting \nthat this is somehow not money that counts because it was money not \nmade part of the settlement but added on to it by the tobacco industry. \nIf you have been a part of the litigation, before you know it, the \ndefendant, before the award is paid, wants to know the total bill, and \nwhen he finally agrees what his total bill is, he does not care how it \nis spent or how the other side uses it. So he will call it attorney's \nfees, he will call it anything else. He just wants to spend the $386 \nplus billion, and that money is money the tobacco company is prepared \nto spend to end this litigation. Therefore, it is money that ought to \nbe spent, as much as possible, on children and not on lawyers.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Kentucky is here and I will \nyield for a question, or time. I will yield the floor at this time and \nyield my time to the Senator from Kentucky for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Alabama. Again I want to \ncommend him on an outstanding amendment. I have been able to pick up \npart of the debate, and I might ask my friend from Alabama if one of \nthe arguments being made by those who oppose his amendment is that \nsomehow these lawsuits are not likely to be brought if a lawyer could \nonly bill $250 an hour? Is that, I gather from my friend from Alabama, \none of the suggestions being made by the opponents of his amendment, \nthat somehow being restricted to a mere $250 an hour is going to deter \nthe lawyers of America?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct--$5 million is not a sufficient fee for \na lawsuit.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right. That is the other part, I gather, of the \nSenator's amendment, either $250 an hour or $5 million, whichever is--\n--\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Less.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Less. I would ask my friend from Alabama, who has had \na distinguished career over the years, has he ever known a lawyer to be \ndeterred from representing a client when there was a potential $5 \nmillion or $250 an hour fee on the line?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have not, and I consider $5 million to be a very \nsubstantial fee on any market in America, certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do not know how the economy is in Alabama, but I \nwould say to my friend I am not aware of many people in Kentucky that \nmake $5 million over a year, or even 2 or even 3--just a small handful \nof people. Would my friend from Alabama agree with me that this is not \nlikely to be a deterrent to representation of a client if the fee is so \nrestricted?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do not think it is a deterrent, and also I point out \nthat these are attorneys representing the people, the States involved, \nand it is not unusual at all for lawyers to work for less an hour rate \nfor a governmental body than they do for a private individual.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So, further, I ask my friend from Alabama, if I \nunderstand this correctly, whatever fees were proposed to be paid above \nthe $5 million cap would then be diverted to the National Institutes of \nHealth for children's health research; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. We think there are going to be some \nreal jackpot fees awarded here, under the way this case ended so \nabruptly. That really exacerbates the unfairness of it. The litigation \nwas filed. Many people thought it would last for years. Then, all of a \nsudden, there is a settlement entered into with huge sums of money \nbeing paid by the tobacco industry, allowing attorneys, under their \nagreements, to receive huge sums of money for very little work.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So, I say to my friend from Alabama, it seems to me in \nmy 13 years in the Senate, this is one\n\n[[Page S9043]]\n\nof the clearest choices I have ever observed laid before the Senate on \nan amendment.\n  I ask the Senator from Alabama, if the Senator from Kentucky \nunderstands this correctly, if this is a choice between plaintiffs' \nlawyers on the one hand and children's health research on the other? \nDoes the Senator from Kentucky understand this correctly?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Kentucky understands completely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So a Member of the Senate who would vote for the \nSessions amendment would be voting, in effect, for children's health \ncare?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. A vote for the Sessions amendment is a vote to put that \nextra money in the children's health care.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And a Senator who voted against the Sessions amendment \nwould in effect be saying paying legal fees in excess of $250 an hour, \nor more than $5 million a State, is a more important priority than \nchildren's health care research; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is precisely correct, as I see it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So it seems to me that this is about as clear as it \ngets. It is about as clear as it gets. The Senator from Alabama is \ngiving the Senate an opportunity to enhance the ability of NIH to \ndiscover the cure for the diseases that afflict the children of \nAmerica, and he is asking the Senate to pay for that through what most \npeople would consider excessive legal fees for representing various \nState governments around America. Does the Senator from Kentucky have \nthis correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Kentucky has it correct. The fees we \nare talking about in this case would be the largest fees in the history \nof the world.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nAlabama. I think this is a very, very important amendment. It certainly \nrelates not only to the debate currently before us, but to the debate \nyet to be had in the coming months, or maybe even next year, about a \nglobal tobacco settlement, if that should be forthcoming.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alabama has \nexpired. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining under our \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes twelve seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Two minutes twelve seconds I have remaining. And the \nSenator from Alabama?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. His time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let my say in conclusion, I was really \ncaptivated by this closing argument. Now the tobacco companies, after \nall these years of exploiting children, come in with this ``God bless \nTiny Tim'' amendment which says if we can just stop these mendacious \nlawyers, we are going to find money for children's health research. I \nthink the American people have seen through this before and will see \nthrough this amendment. There is no money in here for children's health \nresearch. The $368.5 billion settlement does not include attorneys' \nfees. So, any money saved, according to the Senator from Alabama, is \nnot going to be there for us to appropriate to the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  No, I think this is window dressing on an amendment which is very \nclear. It is late in the ball game. The score is very heavy on the side \nof public health and very heavy against the tobacco companies. So, on \nthe last play, as the quarterback or the State attorney general tries \nto down the ball, in come the tobacco boys trying to sack him. They are \nangry. They hate to lose and they hate to lose big, so they come in \nwith this amendment, this amendment to get even with these plaintiff \nlawyers for having brought these lawsuits to try to limit any State \nattorney general's authority to regulate a fee.\n  I agree with others who have spoken. I am not sure this is \nconstitutional, but it is certainly not fair. It is not fair at this \nmoment in time to presume, on every attorney general who brought this \nlawsuit, that they were, in fact, making a bad bargain for the \ntaxpayers of their State. I think they should be held accountable. My \nsubstitute amendment, when this is defeated, will say there will be a \npublic disclosure and none of the attorney's fees will come out of the \nmoney for the public health aspects of this settlement. But make no \nmistake, the Sessions amendment is an amendment which the tobacco \ncompanies want. It will put a damper on lawsuits. It will give the \ntobacco companies the upper hand in the settlement negotiations. And it \nwill completely discount the sincere and good-faith efforts of 40 \ndifferent States that had the courage to step forward and sue the \ntobacco companies.\n  The Senator from Alabama says their decision to go forward was a \nwrong one; their decision to pay the attorneys was a wrong one. I do \nnot think he should presume to make that decision. It is a decision \nmade by each of them, and we should respect it.\n  At this point, I move to table the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to reconsider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to reconsider was just laid on the \ntable by consent.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, are we ready to vote on the question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sessions \namendment be agreed to, and the Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment, and there \nbe 30 minutes for debate to be equally divided.\n\n[[Page S9044]]\n\n  I further ask that at the conclusion of the debate, the amendment be \nlaid aside and Senator Durbin be recognized to offer an amendment, \nwhich would be in the form of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, with \ndebate limited to 5 minutes, and following that debate the Senate \nproceed to vote on or in relationship to the Wellstone amendment to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the Durbin amendment, to be \nfollowed immediately by a vote on or in relation to the Durbin \namendment No. 1078, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment No. 1125, as modified further, was agreed to\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, therefore, there will be three back-to-back \nvotes beginning in approximately 35 minutes.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation in working out this \narrangement. It will allow us to complete this section of consideration \non the Labor-HHS bill, and hopefully we can go on then with other \namendments that can be agreed to, or accepted, or voted on, and \nhopefully we can complete this very important appropriations bill \nbefore the day is out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me also thank the majority leader for \nhis cooperation in coming to an agreement, and I thank Senator Durbin \nwho waited patiently to present this issue and debated it eloquently \nand forcefully over the last several days. We wanted a way to bring to \nclosure the issue with regard to the deductibility question. And we \nwill now have that opportunity for a final vote within the hour.\n  So I think we have made great progress in the last 30 minutes. I am \npleased now that we are at a point where we can have a final vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the amendment of \nSenator Sessions, No. 1125, was agreed to.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized to offer a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1126 to Amendment No. 1078\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1126 to amendment No. 1078.\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following: ``Nothing \n     in this Act may be construed to interfere with, or abrogate, \n     any agreement previously entered into between any State and \n     any private attorney or attorneys with respect to litigation \n     involving tobacco.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this amendment, there will be 30 minutes of \ntime equally divided.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, I shall be brief.\n  I, too, thank the majority leader, the minority leader, Senator \nSessions, and Senator Durbin for their cooperation.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and straightforward, and \nin a way the context for this is Minnesota. But it really affects all \nof our States.\n  This amendment just says that nothing in the act may be construed to \ninterfere with, or abrogate, any agreement previously entered into \nbetween any State and private attorney with respect to litigation \ninvolving tobacco.\n  For example, in Minnesota the case is in a State court.\n  What are we doing? I am not a lawyer. But what are we doing here in \nthe U.S. Senate telling Minnesota that its contract with lawyers that \nare working with the State of Minnesota could be declared null and \nvoid? What are we doing saying that to the State of Minnesota, or what \nare we doing saying that to any State? I thought we had a States rights \nCongress. This goes just in precisely the opposite direction.\n  Mr. President, again a little bit of information about Minnesota, so \nwe know what is at stake here. I mean I am out here fighting for my \nState of Minnesota. But I think this is important to all of our States.\n  I cannot believe that my colleagues want to be in a position of \narguing against the proposition that we should pass an amendment that \ntells the State it has to abrogate its contract with attorneys that are \nrepresenting that State in State court. That is absolutely \nunbelievable.\n  Mr. President, in Minnesota, against some background, is the first \nState in the Nation to charge the tobacco industry with consumer fraud \nand antitrust violations. It is the second State calling for Medicaid \nreimbursement. It is the only State with a private coplaintiff, Blue \nCross and Blue Shield of Minnesota.\n  The case was launched in August 1994. We have won the majority of \npretrial motions, and all appeals, including the one that went to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. Minnesota secured 30 million pages of documents \nthrough discovery. Minnesota has the largest collection ever of tobacco \ndocuments in the world, housed in two secured depositories in \nMinneapolis and London.\n  The Minnesota case is rated by the top tobacco stock analysts of \nBurnstein Research as the ``biggest threat to the industry.''\n  I want to talk about what that means--``biggest threat to the \nindustry.''\n  We go to trial in January. This trial stands to be important not just \nfor Minnesota but for the whole Nation--not just in terms of financial \ncompensation for my State, for the people in my State, but the \ndiscovery, the information that will come to light about past abuses, \nabout what the tobacco industry has known, about marketing techniques, \nand all of the rest.\n  This amendment, which is an amendment albeit for my State of \nMinnesota but really applies to every single State, just says to \ncolleagues that in whatever action we take let us be clear that nothing \nthat we are doing here can be construed to interfere with or abrogate \nany agreement previously entered into between any State and private \nattorney or attorneys with respect to litigation involving tobacco.\n  We have a case in Minnesota. It is in State court. What are we doing \nin the Congress telling Minnesota that it will have to abrogate its \ncontract with attorneys? The arrangement is made with attorneys so \nthose attorneys can represent the public health community, so those \nattorneys can represent the State of Minnesota and people in Minnesota, \nso those attorneys can represent all of us who would like to see these \ndocuments and this information come to light. I do not think this is \nconstitutional and I certainly think it is inappropriate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I support the Wellstone \namendment. Make no mistake, what Senator Wellstone is proposing before \nthis Senate is the other side of the argument of the Senator from \nAlabama. The Senator from Alabama came before us and basically said, \neven though we are not talking about any Federal dollars here, even \nthough we are not talking about any action in any Federal court, we as \na Federal legislature will dictate to the State of Minnesota, the State \nof Illinois, I suppose even the State of Alabama that they cannot enter \ninto an agreement with any attorneys to proceed with tobacco litigation \nunless it meets the Federal guidelines proposed by the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Well, I am sorry, but I do not believe that that is our \nresponsibility. I think it goes beyond our constitutional \nresponsibility. I think what the Senator from Minnesota has offered is \nreasonable. How can we ever presume to judge what are the appropriate \nattorneys' fees and arrangements in a State like Minnesota where \nAttorney General Humphrey has probably gone to greater lengths than any \nattorney general in the United States bringing these documents \ntogether, filing a creative lawsuit, being assertive, making certain \nthat the people of Minnesota are represented. For any Senator from \nIllinois, Alabama or anywhere to stand up and say, I am sorry, \nMinnesota, this is not yours to decide, this is to be decided by the \nFederal Congress, even though there is no Federal money, no Federal \ncourt. We are dealing in State courts, we are dealing with tobacco \ncompanies making payments. I think it is entirely presumptuous for us \nto go along with the premise that we in the\n\n[[Page S9045]]\n\nSenate will decide attorneys' fees case by case and State by State.\n  I stand in support of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Minnesota yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. Just briefly, what is the percentage \ncontingent fee that has been given to the plaintiff attorneys who are \nrepresenting the State of Minnesota?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My understanding is 25 percent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I think that points out the problem we are dealing \nwith here. This is the first time, in any inquiry that I have made in a \nnumber of different instances, that I have gotten a figure on the \ndetail of the fee agreements that have been entered into in these kinds \nof cases.\n  Twenty-five percent. That sounds fine, but the truth of the matter is \nthe tobacco company has just pleaded guilty. They put $300 billion, \n$400 billion, the Senator from Kentucky says $500-plus billion on the \ntable. Now the lawyers who were saying they were going to trial and \nspent these huge sums of money all over America are not going to trial. \nThey are just collecting the money, and they have agreements like this.\n  Now, I would assume, with regard to Minnesota, that they are an \naverage size State and they probably would be entitled to something \nlike a $10 billion settlement of this matter. If that is true, then \nthis law firm would be entitled to $2 billion--$2 billion, not $2 \nmillion but $2 billion. That would be probably as of this date the \nlargest legal fee ever paid in the history of this country, largest \nlegal fee probably ever paid in the history of the world.\n  So I submit that is exactly what has happened. Many States, I \nunderstand, because less than a year ago I was an attorney general, \nhave entered into contracts of 25 percent. I know of another State \nwhich, I understand, has entered into a settlement for 20 percent of \nthe recovery. These cases are not even going to trial if this body \nacts. If this body does not act and Minnesota goes on and litigates its \nown case, then Minnesota is not covered by our agreement. So only if \nthere is a congressional action that takes over these cases, should we \nquestion attorneys' fees. Otherwise that issue is between the attorneys \ngeneral and the States.\n  But the plaintiff lawyers, the very same ones who are now complaining \nabout their fees through Members of this body, these very same \nplaintiff attorneys are the ones asking this Congress to review this \nsettlement and to take appropriate action that we think is just and \nfair.\n  So, first of all, I want to point out that we are talking about \nincredibly huge attorneys' fees, not just large. These are incredibly \nhuge. Probably as much as, at 20 percent, $40, $50, $60 billion in \nattorneys' fees. Publicly the figure has been floated in the press a \nnumber of times at $14 billion. If the percentages are the same in most \nStates, 20 percent, the figures will be much higher than $14 billion.\n  So the tobacco lawyers who have entered into this private agreement \nwith these plaintiff attorneys to pay them their fee, all these lawyers \nare now coming to us and saying just ratify this matter but don't ask \nus about how much they are paying; don't question these fees because we \nhad a contract. We had a contract.\n  They can't prevail in their cases in an effective way without the \nlegislation of this Congress. So I think it is right for us to question \nit.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we are hearing now States rights, and I have \ntried to be on that side for some 23 years now. But the attorneys \ngeneral are here asking us to approve their pact, to pass a Federal law \nand to have so-called protocols or side agreements that we would wind \ninto the package. So it appears to me that it is no longer a States \nrights agreement. In Minnesota it may be somewhat different. But now \nthey have come to the Congress and said here is our deal; you approve \nit and don't ask any questions.\n  Well, back home we call that a mailbox job. You get a job and go out \nto the mailbox the first of each month and get your check. Am I correct \nit has reached a higher level than it would be under normal \ncircumstances since we are asked to make the judgment? We are \nattempting to make the judgment now, and in making that judgment we say \nwe are trampling on States rights. You can't have it both ways. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Kentucky is precisely correct. These \nparties, both sides--do not forget, the tobacco industry is in here, \ntoo, asking us to approve it, and the tobacco industry also does not \nwant to talk about how much they are paying these plaintiffs' lawyers. \nSo they have asked us to review it. In effect, they have suggested in \ntestimony before my Committee on the Judiciary that we approve it and \nanalyze it fairly and justly, and that is our responsibility.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Certainly.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator has been an attorney general. He is from the \nlegal profession and I am not. Is it kind of unusual for a side \nagreement to be made by a defendant with a plaintiff lawyer?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say the distinguished Senator from Kentucky raises a \nvery important and troubling point. It is, in my opinion, at least \nimproper if not unethical for an attorney representing a party to enter \ninto private negotiations with the person he is suing to establish how \nmuch his fee ought to be. You see, there is a conflict there.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All of a sudden it becomes important to that lawyer \nthat the settlement be approved so he can get his fee. And if the \nperson he sues, the tobacco industry, says: ``You are being too hard on \nthis issue; give up on this issue.'' ``No, I won't.'' ``Well, we will \nsweeten your attorney's fee if you will give up on it.'' That puts them \nin conflict. I am not saying that has happened. But I am saying good \nattorneys should not allow themselves to be put in a position of \ninterest.\n  So we are talking about, if it is 20 percent of a $600 billion \nsettlement, $100 billion in attorney's fees. We fought for weeks on \nthis floor to raise from $16 to $20 billion the amount of money spent \nfor health care for children. We are talking about $100 billion in this \nbill in attorney's fees, and in many cases in many States very little \nlegal work has been done on these cases. It is important and necessary \nfor us to act on this matter, and this amendment as presented by the \nSenator from Minnesota would, in effect, undermine and abrogate the \ntrue effect of the amendment that I have offered, so I strongly oppose \nit.\n  I will yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, it is certainly not true \nthat very little legal work has been done in Minnesota. The tobacco \nindustry has already spent $125 million defending the Minnesota case \nalone--$125 million.\n  Mr. President, it takes a whole lot of resources to uncover a \nmassive, decades-old coverup of fraud and conspiracy. The Sessions \namendment that my amendment speaks to is an attempt to shut down the \ndiscovery process, to perpetuate a coverup and to keep secret documents \nconcealed for a long time. The effect of this amendment, unless the \nsecond-degree amendment passes, is to punish States like Minnesota and \nTexas and Massachusetts and Connecticut and Washington and others that \nhave invested heavily in exposing the coverup and bringing the industry \nto justice.\n  I do not know all the specifics of the arrangement between the State \nof Minnesota or Connectict or Massachusetts\n\n[[Page S9046]]\n\nor any other State and attorneys that are working for the States and \nfor, I might add, the public health community. Without this work, we \nwould not have been able to bring these documents forward. There will \nnot be the discovery. There will not be the information. There will not \nbe the information to people in this country about a whole pattern of \nabuse.\n  But what I do know, one more time, colleagues, is this is in State \ncourt. This is an agreement between my State of Minnesota and \nattorneys. What in the world are we doing interfering and essentially \nsaying to the State of Minnesota you have to abrogate your contract \nwith your attorneys? Whatever you have decided upon, whatever you do in \nState court, State court is null and void. My State is not a party to \nthis global agreement here in Washington. Attorney General Humphrey has \nmade it very clear that we are going forward. This is an agreement in a \nState. This is an agreement between a State and attorneys. This is an \neffort to deal with a very long, unfortunately protracted, period of \ntime of coverup by an industry. This is an effort that takes on a \ntobacco industry that spent $125 million on this case alone with \nlawyers defending it. And you are going to vote against an amendment \nthat says ``nothing in this act may be construed to interfere with or \nabrogate any agreement previously entered into between any State and \nprivate attorney or attorneys with respect to litigation involving \ntobacco''?\n  I do not know how colleagues can vote against that proposition. Have \nwhatever views you want, but we do not have any business telling the \nState of Minnesota that in its best judgment and its best effort, and, \nindeed, what is being called ``the biggest threat to the industry,'' it \nhas no right to enter into an arrangement with lawyers and to represent \nthe people in Minnesota and represent the people in the country. And we \nin the U.S. Senate are going to try to vote against the proposition \nwhere we go on record saying we are certainly not going to tell a State \nit has to tear up its contract?\n  Minnesota gets to decide that. Massachusetts gets to decide that. \nConnecticut gets to decide that. Illinois gets to decide that. Kansas \ngets to decide that. The U.S. Senate doesn't decide that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the remainder of his time. \nThe Senator from Alabama has 6 minutes and 50 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first of all, if Minnesota proceeds to \nlitigate its case and gets a judgment, then Minnesota would not be \ncovered by this act. And I would be willing to consider Minnesota's \ncase, because it is somewhat different than most. Perhaps it is more \nunusual than any of the others. However, I would say this to the \nSenator from Minnesota, his bill covers all States. It doesn't just \ncover Minnesota. It doesn't just cover unusual fact situations. It says \nwe cannot deal with contracts in any of the States.\n  I have to oppose his amendment because it applies to every State \nincluding States bigger than Minnesota that filed lawsuits just a few \nmonths ago. Attorneys have done almost no work on these cases. Yet they \nwould stand to receive billions of dollars in attorney's fees without \nthis legislation.\n  So I would say, first of all, I would be willing to discuss the \nunique problems of Minnesota. But I cannot, and must resist with every \nbit of strength that I have this amendment because it applies \nthroughout the Nation and it will prevent this body from being able to \nstop great windfalls. And that money doesn't need to go to attorneys. \nIt needs to go for the purpose of this lawsuit, which is health care.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand your underlying amendment, which has now \nbeen adopted, in the case where there is a settlement and the \nsettlement has to come to the Congress to be confirmed, your amendment \napplies. But, in the case of Minnesota, where there is litigation going \nforward, and where there is a trial going forward and the matter will \nbe decided by the courts through the litigation process rather than \nthrough a settlement confirmed by the Congress, your amendment would \nnot apply.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. So basically the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota \ndoesn't apply to the Minnesota situation because the Minnesota \nsituation is outside the underlying amendment. The amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota applies to all the other States, except \nMinnesota, that are trying to reach an agreement through negotiation \nwhich has to be confirmed by this Congress.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. To my understanding, Minnesota is the \nonly State that has objected to the global settlement. They are going \nto have to be treated separately in any case.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I might ask a further question, it appears the Senator \nfrom Minnesota has launched an arrow that has missed its mark?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is fair to say.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim what \ntime I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator has 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I might ask my colleague from Illinois \nto comment. I would like to look at the amendment again, the Sessions \namendment, but my understanding from reading that amendment is that if \nthere is a global settlement, it applies to all the States. Otherwise, \nI would have much less difficulty with his amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I might say at this \npoint neither the Senator from Alabama, the Senator from Illinois or \nthe Senator from Minnesota knows how this story is going to end. We \ndon't know what this global settlement will say and how it affects the \nagreements heretofore entered into by other States, whether it's \nMinnesota, Mississippi, or Florida. I think it is presumptuous of us \ntoday to suggest we are going to set the guidelines.\n  The Senator from Alabama stood up repeatedly and said, ``I don't know \nwhat these legal agreements are. They could be awful.'' If the Senator \ndoesn't know what they are, then how can he suggest they are awful? I \ndon't know that some of those agreements might say if a case is settled \neither by global settlement or otherwise, the attorney's fees will be \ndramatically reduced. The Senator doesn't know, but he went forward \nwith his amendment.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has hit the nail on the head. These \nattorneys general who had the courage to come forward in the lawsuits \nbut didn't have the resources to prosecute them, entered into \nagreements to bring in other attorneys to help. They fought a big \nbattle in Minnesota; $125 million spent by the tobacco companies, yet \nthey fought on valiantly and they are going to bring this case on to \ntrial in January. And for us to close the door today and say it's over, \nno more agreements in terms of attorney's fees--I think it's \npresumptuous. It's exactly what the tobacco companies are praying for.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think that is precisely the problem. \nThat is what I am speaking to. I don't think the Senator from Alabama \ncan argue otherwise, in terms of what his amendment does.\n  One more time I will say to colleagues, given this ambiguity, we can \nargue about it over and over again. This amendment is not ambiguous. It \njust simply says that nothing that we do may be construed to interfere \nwith or abrogate any agreement previously entered into.\n  What are we doing, telling the State of Minnesota, which is a State \ncourt, whatever you had to do to get lawyers to represent your State \nand the people of Minnesota and the people in the country, we are now \ngoing to pass something that will tear that agreement up--we have no \nbusiness doing that. I don't think it's constitutional and I certainly \ndon't think it's right. So I'm out here fighting for Minnesota, but for \nother States as well.\n\n[[Page S9047]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How much time have we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized. The \nSenator from Alabama has 2 minutes and 32 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, precisely on the question he raised, \nthis amendment that I have presented, that has been passed by a large \nvote, without objection that I heard, maybe a few--says that it would \nonly include States involved in the national tobacco settlement \nagreement.\n  My view is, if Minnesota wants to opt out of this deal, maybe they \nought to be treated separately. But for the 49 other States who are in \nit, who have asked for this review and legislation by Congress, I think \nit is absolutely critical that we deal with attorney's fees. I repeat, \nI have sought on multiple occasions, and other Senators have, to find \nout what the agreements are that they have with these attorneys. They \nare hiding those agreements. They have been very secret about it. It's \na secret agreement between plaintiffs' attorneys representing the \nStates and the tobacco industry. And only today has the Senator from \nMinnesota indicated that they have a 20-percent contingency fee. That \nmeans that whatever recovery Minnesota has of all these billions that \nwe are looking for and hope that we can recover, of all those billions, \n20 percent of it will go to attorneys.\n  They talk about a lot of records and documents. I have been involved \nin litigation. People always talk about records. But you have \nparalegals, you have clerks, you have statisticians to go through those \ndocuments. They don't have to be read by every attorney involved in the \ncase.\n  So I would say what really exacerbates this problem and makes it so \ncritical is the fact that the tobacco companies, early on, agreed to \nthis settlement. Therefore, a lot of attorneys general entered into \ncontracts, maybe thinking it would be prolonged litigation and these \nfees might be justified, but now they find out that the money is \nalready on the table and we have to work out an agreement to collect \nit. Attorneys do not have to justify these huge billion-dollar fees we \nare hearing talked about.\n  These are reasonable fees, $250 an hour, $5 million per State in \nattorney's fees. That is reasonable and fair. I think generous, in \nfact.\n  I believe that this body needs to send a message, for those people \nwho think they can execute secret side agreements at the expense of the \npeople they are supposed to be representing to divert $14 billion, $40 \nbillion, $60 billion, $100 billion from health care for children and \nfamilies and tobacco victims--taking that money and putting it in their \npockets is not a good way for this Government to be run.\n  I feel very strongly about this. Unfortunately, the Senator from \nMinnesota chose not to limit his amendment to the situation in \nMinnesota but to apply it throughout the Nation, which in effect \npreserves the prerogative of the plaintiff lawyers to make themselves \nrich off of this settlement. Therefore I must oppose it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Under the \nagreement, the Wellstone amendment will be set aside. The Senator from \nIllinois is recognized for purpose of introducing an amendment. The \nSenator from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1127 to Amendment No. 1078\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1127 to amendment No. 1078.\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   . Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that attorneys' fees paid in connection with an action \n     maintained by a State against one or more tobacco companies \n     to recover tobacco-related costs affected by federal tobacco \n     settlement legislation should be publicly disclosed and \n     should not displace spending in the settlement legislation \n     intended for public health.''\n\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask the time, the 5 minutes, be divided \nevenly between those in favor and those in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment gets to the heart of the \nquestion. What are these agreements? Are they generous? Are they \nreasonable? Each attorney general, under my agreement, will be forced \nto put it on the table in front of the people and say, ``Here is what I \nagreed to. If I agreed to pay 25 percent of the settlement then I have \nto explain to the taxpayers of the State why that was a sensible thing \nto do at the time.'' If it is a reasonable agreement, so be it. If not, \nthe public official will be held accountable. And none of the money \npaid in attorney's fees will come out of the amount to be spent for \npublic health purposes. I think this gets to the heart of it.\n  The Senator from Alabama, in his amendment, says $5 million a State \nis more than enough to prosecute the tobacco companies; $5 million a \nState. It sounds like a princely sum until we hear the Senator from \nMinnesota stand up and tell us the tobacco companies spent $125 million \nin that State to defend themselves, 25 times as much. All of a sudden \nyou step back and say maybe $5 million doesn't give you the resources \nfor a fair fight.\n  The Senator from Alabama has repeatedly said he doesn't know what \nthese agreements consist of in other States. I think that is the reason \nwhy his amendment is flawed.\n  Also, I think we should know in a State like Florida, which recently \nentered into an agreement, the question of attorney's fees was \nnecessarily set aside. It is not part of the agreement that was \nannounced. It is another amount to be paid by the tobacco companies, \nseparate and apart from what is going to be paid to the taxpayers of \nFlorida.\n  Finally, let me say in virtually every one of these cases, in every \nState, not only will the court of public opinion decide whether \nattorney's fees are fair, but the courts will decide. Ultimately they \nhave to rule on any order of settlement and any kind of agreement which \nmight, in fact, bring it into a lawsuit. So they will have to \nultimately rule on these attorney's fees.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to correct the Record, the $5 million \nthe amendment of the Senator from Alabama presented is $5 million on \ntop of ordinary and customary expenses. So if it cost $20 million or \n$100 million in the area of expenses to bring this lawsuit, that can be \nadded to the $5 million base cost.\n  My opposition--actually I probably will vote for it--but my position \non the Durbin amendment is this. In concept, it is an excellent idea. \nBut this is a sense of the Senate. A sense of the Senate means nothing. \nIf the Senator from Illinois really means this, then he should have \nmade it a matter of law. That is what it should be, a matter of law. We \nshould be telling the tobacco companies you have to disclose. This \nsense of the Senate is a political document. It will give a lot of \npeople in this body comfort politically, but it is not going to do one \ndarned thing to get to the bottom of the question, which is how much \nare we going to end up paying to attorneys who are basically working \nwith tobacco companies in obtaining their payment? How much is going to \nget paid to them as part of this settlement?\n  The gravamen of this issue--to use the one legal term I remember from \nmy law school days--is the point Senator Sessions made. When you have \nattorneys working against tobacco companies, and the tobacco company \ncomes in and says, ``Well, here's another $1 billion in settlement,'' \nhow long do they work against them? How aggressive are they in opposing \nthem?\n  If there is $40 billion of attorney's fees going out the door here, \nwhich is what is represented in some of the periodicals that have \ndiscussed this issue, how can you say that there is any sort of \nindependence on the part of the plaintiff's counsel in the cases? The \nfact is, there are very few attorneys I know who, if somebody comes \nforward and says, ``Let's make this agreement,'' and they say, ``No, I \ncan't agree\n\n[[Page S9048]]\n\nto that,'' and then the person who says let's make this agreement says, \n``Well, I'll give you another billion dollars in fees''--the attorneys \nare going to say that's pretty hard to turn down.\n  Until we know what these attorneys are getting paid, we can't answer \na lot of these questions. This Durbin amendment, as well-intentioned as \nit may be, accomplishes nothing in obtaining that knowledge. It is a \nsense of the Senate. We all know where those amendments go. This should \nbe a matter of law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Hampshire has \nexpired. The Senator from Illinois has 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. Mr. President, let me say at the outset, we \ndon't have a settlement agreement. We are not talking about legislating \none today. There is a good question, whatever we add to this \nappropriations bill, whether it is going to have an ultimate impact on \nthat agreement.\n  Let me also say, on the question of expenses, I think the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire would acknowledge expenses are specified costs of a \nlawsuit and don't get to attorney's fees. So, I would quarrel with him \non that.\n  Let me end by saying, there is on old poem:\n\n     While I was walking up the stair, I met a man who wasn't \n           there.\n     I saw that man again today.\n     I wish that man would go away.\n\n  The man that many of the people on this floor would wish to go away \nis a $50 billion tax credit. That is the underlying issue, and that is \nthe important part of this debate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1126\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1078, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The question is on the Durbin \namendment, as amended.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nDurbin-Collins amendment to repeal Big Tobacco's rebate in the tax \nreconciliation bill. I will speak about this critical amendment in a \nminute, but first I would like to talk about an issue that was raised \non the floor last night.\n  That issue is whether Congress should subpoena hidden tobacco \ndocuments.\n  Mr. President, we need to know the truth about nicotine and tobacco. \nThat is why I, along with Senator Leahy and many of our colleagues, \nhave asked the chairmen of the various committees with jurisdiction \nover portions of the settlement, to subpoena critical documents that \nthe tobacco industry has conspired to hide from the American people.\n  In debate on the floor yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee raised the issue of whether to subpoena these \ndocuments. The senior Senator from Utah has long been dedicated to \nsaving our children from the dangers of tobacco. He has been outspoken \nabout the critical need to reduce teen smoking rates.\n  Yet, the chairman questioned the necessity of Congress subpoenaing \nthese documents which have been kept from the public because they were \nfalsely stamped attorney-client privilege. The chairman raised some \nvalid concerns, and I would like to respond.\n  Mr. President, we are at a critical juncture in the war between the \ntobacco companies and the public health. The tobacco industry wants the \nAmerican people to disarm. They want to strip Americans of their right \nto seek punitive damages for harm caused by the tobacco industry's \ndeceitful practices. The industry wants Congress to grant it \nunprecedented protections from legal liability.\n  In return, the American people are promised a reform of our public \nhealth laws that will protect loved ones in the future from the dangers \nof tobacco addiction and illness. It would be up to Congress to write \nthese laws. That is a heavy responsibility.\n  In order to properly execute this responsibility, we owe it to the \nAmerican people to collect the most complete information about the \neffects of tobacco and nicotine on human health. Through our subpoena \npower, we have the ability to collect this information. We need \ninformation on whether a safer cigarette could be manufactured, or if \nwe can produce a less addicting form of nicotine.\n  Mr. President, that information is in the hands of the tobacco \nindustry, and they have consistently hidden it from the American people \nfor decades. If we are to enter into a legislative settlement with this \nindustry, then it must come clean with Congress and the American \npeople. Since it has not done so yet, we should start issuing subpoenas \nfor the truth.\n  Mr. President, some have suggested that the document disclosure \nprovisions in the proposed settlement are sufficient. However, I \nstrongly disagree. The proposed settlement would merely set up a \nclearinghouse for documents already produced in court cases. In other \nwords: it discloses nothing new.\n  Mr. President, we have learned more details in recent weeks about how \nthe tobacco companies routinely funneled documents through their \nlawyers in order to fraudulently mark them as attorney-client \nprivileged. In fact, many of these documents relate to health concerns \nand were simply given to the lawyers to cloak them in a false shroud of \nthe attorney-client privilege.\n  These are the most critical documents. They hold the keys to saving \nmillions of lives.\n  Congress has the power to subpoena and examine these documents before \nwe enact a legislative settlement. We need that information to craft \neffective public health policy. The settlement would allow the industry \nto delay court review of these documents for years after a settlement \nis enacted.\n  Now, review of these documents might be time consuming. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in his floor \nstatement yesterday, noted that over 33 million pages have been \ncollected in the State of Minnesota's suit against the tobacco \nindustry. Our estimate is that we'll find the information we need in at \nmost 1\\1/2\\ million pages.\n  The Minnesota attorney general, in preparation for his trial against \nBig Tobacco, has bound, numbered and indexed around 500,000 pages into \na volume called the Minnesota Select Set. This set of documents \ncontains critical information we need in order to draft appropriate \npublic health legislation. We should subpoena this set.\n  In addition, the Minnesota court hearing the case has collected \naround 1 million pages of material that the industry has claimed is \nprivileged. However, we know that the Industry has a history of falsely \nclaiming this privilege in order to hide critical health information.\n  It is unclear how many pages are in the privileged set, but it has \nbeen estimated to be about 1 million pages. Both of these sets are \nbeing held in warehouses in Minneapolis and London under the control of \na Minnesota court.\n  Mr. President, I would like to clarify that my subpoena request is \nfor, at most, about 1\\1/2\\ million pages. Although this is a lot of \nmaterial, one need only watch another child light up a cigarette to \nrealize it is well worth the time.\n  Let me put this into perspective: The Governmental Affairs Committee \nhas subpoenaed over 10 million pages of documents from the AFL-CIO \nalone in its campaign finance investigation.\n  This subpoena request for tobacco industry documents is about the \nlives of American children. Isn't that worth the time needed to \ncarefully review these documents? Why rush into a settlement in 50 days \nwith an industry that has lied to America for 50 years?\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support the request of Senator \nLeahy and myself to the chairmen of relevant Senate committees to \nsubpoena these hidden tobacco industry documents.\n  I hope that this discussion clarified this issue for my colleagues.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to address the Durbin-Collins \namendment to repeal the provision in the tax reconciliation bill that \ngranted a $50 billion giveaway to the tobacco industry. This clause \nshould never have been snuck into that bill and it is time to remove \nit.\n  This provision of the recently enacted tax reconciliation bill would \ndivert $50 billion away from the public health and into the pockets of \nBig Tobacco. If comprehensive tobacco legislation is eventually \nenacted, Big Tobacco will write 50 billion off the top of their payment \nobligations.\n  This shortfall could mean billions of dollars in programs to keep \nkids away from cigarettes will be lost. It could mean billions of \ndollars in smoking cessation programs will not be paid for.\n  In any settlement, the tobacco industry must pay its fair share. If \nthe industry gets a $50 billion break in the settlement, that cost will \nhave to come out of taxpayer's pockets. That is unacceptable.\n  The tobacco companies shouldn't get a rebate. They're not a car \ndealership--they're a drug dealership.\n  There are those who say that this rebate was part of the proposed \nsettlement deal. Well, that's news to the attorneys general who \nnegotiated it. They never signed off on such an arrangement.\n\n[[Page S9050]]\n\n  Mr. President, this is another example of why we can't trust this \nindustry. After claiming to act in good faith, they scheme behind \nclosed doors to undermine the American people. As we embark on public \nhealth legislation for the next century, let's work to keep this \nprocess out in the open and get rid of the smokey back room deals on \ntobacco.\n  Mr. President, I therefore urge my colleagues to support the Durbin-\nCollins Amendment and join us in repealing the $50 billion credit for \nBig Tobacco. The last thing the tobacco industry is entitled to is a \nrebate.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about this \namendment, which will probably sail through the Senate. I spoke to my \ncolleagues, and I know that we don't have the votes now, but we will \nrevisit this issue in the global settlement.\n  It is quite easy to come down to the Senate floor and rail about the \ntobacco companies. Well, Mr. President, let me say something about \nthose tobacco companies. Mr. President, those companies employ more \nthan 20,000 people in North Carolina, and those jobs are in jeopardy if \nwe tax the tobacco companies into bankruptcy.\n  These are hard-working men and women punching the timeclock every \nday. They are raising families on these wages, paying mortgages, just \ntrying to get by. These jobs represent a payroll of more than $1 \nbillion. They are good jobs, well-paying jobs, and I will not be part \nof this attack on their livelihoods.\n  This is just another attack on tobacco carefully staged for the \ntelevision cameras. This is a personal attack on tobacco farmers. The \ncompanies are the front this time. Just a subterfuge for yet another \nattack on the farmers and another potential source of revenues. In \nfact, they're ready to spend money we don't even have, and I think that \nthis is the height of irresponsibility.\n  I hope that my colleagues will resist the lure of easy political \npoints.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will support the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois to repeal section 1604(f)(3) of the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, which purports to credit the increase in tobacco \nexcise taxes against any federally legislated tobacco settlement \nagreement. While I have opposed other amendments that would have opened \nup the balanced budget agreement signed into law on August 5, 1997, a \nmere 5 legislative days ago, there are good reasons to support the \namendment offered by Senator Durbin. Unlike the other provisions of the \nreconciliation legislation that have been the subject of amendments, \nthe provision at issue in the Durbin amendment is an orphan. No one is \nwilling publicly to take credit for having written it and securing its \ninclusion in the tax bill--which was done at the last minute, without \nanalysis or debate by the Members of either the House or Senate.\n  On July 31, 1997, during the debate on the conference report to the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Senator from Illinois sought to raise \na point of order against the provision he now seeks to repeal. I voted, \nwith 77 other Senators to waive all points of order against the \nconference report. I said at the time that the provision was \nmeaningless and had no binding effect. I continue to hold this view, as \nthe tobacco settlement is far from completed, and it is still subject \nto approval by the President and Congress. Yesterday's New York Times \nreported that President Clinton will not offer an opinion on the \nproposed tobacco deal until next week at the earliest, and that the \nWhite House will not endorse a settlement without significant changes. \nIn fact, it is beginning to appear unlikely that Congress will complete \naction on the matter before adjourning for the year. In addition to any \nchanges that the administration proposes, the Congress will want to \nexercise its independent judgment on the proposed agreement. The June \n20, 1997, agreement does not contain all of the details necessary to \neffectuate a settlement. There are a number of areas where the \nagreement provides no guidance, the most striking of which is the lack \nof a mechanism to govern the payment and distribution of the $368.5 \nbillion by the cigarette manufacturers.\n  A White House spokesman has indicated that President Clinton supports \nthis amendment, and if Congress does not act to rescind this credit, \nthe President will insist that $50 billion be added to any final \nsettlement amount.\n  And so, although the provision has no real impact on legislation that \nthis Senate may take up at some future date, I agree with Senator \nDurbin that the mere existence of the provision, and the process by \nwhich it found its way into the statute, is troubling. Let us strike it \nand eliminate any concern that the tobacco companies are getting away \nwith something.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might have the attention of all \nSenators to discuss sequencing. It might be possible, realistically, to \nfinish the bill this evening. The next amendment, following the vote, \nwill be the Murray amendment, where there is 1 hour equally divided. \nBut it is my anticipation that Senator Murray will use her 30 minutes, \nbut there will not be a reply. The next amendment will be the Wellstone \namendment, 40 minutes equally divided. Here again, I think that will be \ndisposed of in less than 40 minutes. Then we have the Daschle \namendment, which is 20 minutes equally divided, and then the Coverdell \namendment, 10 minutes equally divided.\n  It is the manager's intention to have votes on these four amendments \nlater this afternoon, but it is impossible to say when because of the \nimpossibility of determining the amount of time. But the votes will \noccur as soon as the arguments are finished on those four amendments. \nWe will then go to the Gorton amendment, where we don't have a time \nagreement. But the Senator from Washington says he may be able to enter \ninto one shortly after that discussion starts. That would leave us with \nonly two amendments outstanding on school testing, where the parties \nare reasonably close to an agreement on the Teamsters issue, which we \nwill, I think, be able to resolve. But that is yet uncertain. That will \nbe the sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Durbin \namendment, as amended.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9051]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1118\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 1118.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment \nNo. 1118 is the pending business.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLandrieu be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this amendment that is being offered today by myself, \nSenator Wellstone, and Senator Landrieu is not unfamiliar to this body. \nIn fact, the U.S. Senate has voted three times on the amendment that is \nnow before us. Three times we have passed this amendment unanimously--\nonce in the welfare bill, once in the budget bill, and once in the \nbudget reconciliation bill. All three times when this amendment was \nbrought before this body, not one Senator spoke against it. It was \nvoted on and passed and sent to conference committee. Without one \nsingle voice of opposition and without one single vote of opposition, \nthis amendment was stripped in the conference. Perhaps it is no \nsurprise when you hear the subject of this amendment. It is regarding \ndomestic violence.\n  Too often women in our country when it is in the light of day have \neveryone behind them and support them when it comes to domestic abuse. \nBut these women know where abuse occurs. It occurs behind closed doors \nwhen no one is watching.\n  This Senate should not approve of that kind of action. This amendment \nis one that is absolutely vital to the health and welfare of women, \ntheir families, and the communities that surround them. The policemen \nare too often called to situations where a domestic violence incident \nis occurring, and their lives are then put on the line.\n  The amendment that we are offering today does a simple thing. It \nallows a temporary waiver of the work requirement for a victim of \ndomestic violence in order for them to take care of their medical \nneeds, to change their Social Security number, to take care to make \nsure that their children are in a safe place and that their family is \nsecure before they are required to be at work. We know that, if a woman \nis being abused and she is required to be at work, her abuser will \noften go there to find her or put up barriers so she can't be there. \nShe knows that her life is insecure if her abuser can find her at a \nworkplace where she has to give her Social Security number, where she \nhas to let them know where she is going to be. Where her children are \nin day care, she can't take care of them to make sure they are safe and \nsecure.\n  That is why this humane and compassionate Senate three times has \npassed this amendment. It is a temporary waiver. We are not asking for \na permanent waiver of the work requirements. In fact, we want women who \nare victims of domestic violence to be at work. Being economically able \nto take care of themselves is the security they need in order to leave \na domestic violence situation. But we want to make sure that they \naren't at work with bruises and don't show up at work and are afraid to \nshow up at work with bruises. We want to be sure that their children \nare in a safe place, if they are victims of domestic violence, before \nwe require them to be at work. We want them to be able to change their \nSocial Security number so they can't be followed before we require them \nto be at work. Too often these things take months. Changing your Social \nSecurity number can often take months.\n  We in this Congress don't want to put these women in abusive \nsituations inadvertently. This amendment simply is going to remove a \nbarrier for women so that they can get out of the domestic violence \nsituation. When a woman decides to get out of a situation, she has to \nknow, ``Can I have the money? Can I have the ability to take care of my \nchildren, to take care of myself?''\n  Welfare allows her the ability to get out of that situation, to get \nherself back on her feet, and to get into the work force, which is \nexactly what she wants to do so she can be economically secure.\n  The way the welfare bill is written today, it does not allow her to \ndo that.\n  When we passed this temporary waiver, we said to these women that we \nwould give to States the ability to screen for domestic violence so \nthat they will be allowed to help these women get on their feet and get \nback into the work force. We did that intelligently here in the Senate. \nIn fact, it passed unanimously in the House as well. But when this \namendment got behind closed doors, women were once again abused, and it \nwas stripped from the bill.\n  It is absolutely essential that we put this law into the books so \nthat the States across the Nation who are waiting to see what our \naction is can make sure that women who are abused are taken care of.\n  Today, the Children's Defense Fund has come out in support of this \namendment, and I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                                                September 9, 1997.\n\n              CDF Supports Anti-Family Violence Amendment\n\n       Washington, DC.--The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) \n     announced its support today for the Victims of Family \n     Violence provision proposed by Senators Patty Murray (D-\n     Wash.) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) as an amendment to the \n     Senate Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education \n     Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1998.\n       The amendment allows states to temporarily waive certain \n     requirements of the 1996 welfare law for families that are \n     victims of domestic violence, even if their number exceeds \n     the law's 20 percent cap on exemptions to the time limit.\n       ``Mothers who have been threatened or battered need a safe \n     place for themselves and their children, and need support to \n     reenter the work force. The Victims of Family Violence \n     amendment makes it possible for states to offer that \n     protection and help to mothers and children,'' said Grace \n     Reef, Director of Intergovernmental Relations of the \n     Children's Defense Fund. ``Twenty-eight states have opted \n     under the 1996 welfare law to screen for family violence and \n     offer services to families affected. These and other states \n     need the clarification that this amendment provides to ensure \n     that families receive the help they need to escape immediate \n     danger and plan for their return to work.''\n       Studies by the Better Homes Fund and the University of \n     Massachusetts Medical Center and by the Taylor Institute in \n     Chicago have documented the prevalence of domestic violence \n     in the lives of women and children receiving public \n     assistance. Another study found that 55 percent of battered \n     women surveyed had been prevented from working by their \n     batterer (Shepard and Pence, 1988). More than half of \n     battered women responding to a survey said that they stayed \n     with their batterer because they did not feel they could \n     support themselves and their children (Sullivan, 1992).\n       ``The Victims of Family Violence amendment means safety for \n     children and their mothers while they take the steps \n     necessary to move on with their lives,'' said Reef.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, they know what far too often happens to \nchildren who are in abusive situations if there are barriers to that \nwoman getting to work. We want to make sure that there are no barriers. \nThe CDF explicitly outlines this in their statement today, and I thank \nthem for their support.\n  Mr. President, I have worked on this issue for a number of months--in \nfact, for a number of years. It has become more critical to me in the \nlast few weeks because of events that happened in my home State.\n  About a week ago a young officer in Takoma, WA, was called to a home \nwhere a domestic violence situation had occurred. Unfortunately, he was \nshot and killed. He has a 1-year-old child. He is gone. I heard from \nmany police officers who tell me how risky it is for them to go to \nhomes where domestic violence calls have been placed. We need to make \nsure that we allow these women to get out of those situations so we \ndon't have the increased numbers that we today have of domestic \nviolence calls. I am amazed at the increased number. In fact, in the \nSeattle Times just a few days ago was an\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\narticle, that I will submit in a minute, which says that in Seattle in \n1995--which is the latest year for which any data are available--there \nwere over 16,000 calls to 911 related to domestic violence.\n  It was just reported that there is an epidemic, an increase in the \nviolence in Spokane County with more than 6,400 cases reported last \nyear, which is a big increase over prior years.\n  In Tacoma, where a young police officer was just killed, it is \nreported that during the past 15 years 11 police officers in the Puget \nSound area have been killed in the line of duty. Four of those officers \nwere slain while responding to calls to help settle domestic disputes, \na huge portion of them.\n  We need to make sure that as a body we do everything we can to help \nwomen get out of domestic violence situations in a safe and responsible \nmanner, to get them back to work in a way that economically works, that \ntheir health care is taken care of, that their children are taken care \nof so that they get out of these situations. If the work requirement \nremains in place, women will be forced to stay at home with their \nabuser. They will not be able to go out and get themselves economically \nindependent in a responsible way.\n  Mr. President, 27 States have asked for a waiver on family violence. \nUntil we clarify the language here in the Senate and approve it in \nconference, these States will not be able to move forward without being \npenalized under the work requirements of the welfare bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment with a recorded vote \nthis time so that we can send it to conference and do the responsible \nthing that is required of all of us when we care in a humane way about \nwomen who are in a situation in which none of us ever wants to be.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Landrieu, a cosponsor of the amendment, \nis here, and I yield her time to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to thank my colleague from Washington State for her admirable \nwork in this area and for her persistence in year after year presenting \nthis amendment that so clearly is deserving on its merits, and coming \nback again for the third time to this body, which has already expressed \nstrong support for this clarification of this waiver because this body, \non both sides of the aisle, Mr. President, I think, understands the \ngreat trauma and pain of families experiencing violence, both to the \nwoman primarily and also to the children.\n  I rise because I supported the welfare reform effort. I was not here \nas a new Senator, so I was not able to vote. But I want to say for the \nrecord that I support our efforts to change the welfare system in \nAmerica, as long as those changes allow for job training and day care \nopportunities and transition. We do need to do a better job in this \ncountry of moving people from welfare to work. We need to do a better \njob of honoring work, particularly for those working at the minimum \nwage. So I support the changes.\n  My colleague from Washington has expressed beautifully that there are \nsome modifications and clarifications that are essential. This one is \nessential.\n  With the suffering that is incurred by millions of children --and I \nsay millions of children--who are in homes where this violence is \noccurring, the screams in the night, the begging for someone to help, \nthe years of torture and abuse that many children suffer and many \nspouses suffer, we have to do more. Let us not add to their pain and \nsuffering by letting this remain unclear in the law, when it is so \nclear that we want to say that the States simply have the right to \ndesign temporary relief for them so that they do not have to give \ncertain information that would put them in jeopardy and put their \nchildren's lives at risk.\n  I can only say how hopeful I am that when we pass this amendment, \nwhich looks as if it will pass by a large margin, it will this time \nstay in this bill for the children of the Nation, who literally--and I \nwish I could play a tape that I heard just this week by a chief of \npolice who stood up before a group of us and said, ``This is a tape \nthat I use for training my officers.'' It was horrifying to listen to \nthis child scream in the night for a dispatcher, an operator to send \nhelp quickly to the home where a male--I do not know if it was the \nfather or a friend--was beating this child's mother. To close your eyes \nand listen to this tape and this child's screams was almost more than I \nand others in the room could stand.\n  So let us not add to the suffering. Let us be clear. Let us give the \nStates a chance to do the humane thing.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington and I urge our colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, \nfor her excellent statement and for all of her support and her help on \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  I know that Senator Wellstone also wants to speak on behalf of our \namendment today, and I believe he is on his way to the floor. While we \nare waiting for him, let me read a paragraph or two from a press \nrelease put out by the Children's Defense Fund today, who, as I spoke \nabout before, know firsthand what happens to children in violent \nsituations. I quote:\n\n       Mothers who have been threatened or battered need a safe \n     place for themselves and their children and they need support \n     to reenter the work force. Passage of the family violence \n     amendment makes it possible for States to offer that \n     protection and to help mothers with children.\n       There are studies by the Better Homes Fund and the \n     University of Massachusetts Medical Center and by the Taylor \n     Institute in Chicago that have documented the prevalence of \n     domestic violence in the lives of women and children \n     receiving public assistance. It is important that we pass \n     this amendment today so that we can make sure these women and \n     these children are taken care of in this country and live in \n     safe environments.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield time now to Senator Wellstone, who \nhas been instrumental in this battle. I thank him for all of his work \non behalf of the many women and children across this country who will \nbe able to feel much safer when we finally get this passed and put into \nthe law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank Senator Murray. This has been a labor of love, \nworking with her on this, from the very beginning. I do think it is \nvery, very important. We have had voice votes on this, but we now need \nto get the Senate on record, and this is an extremely important \namendment.\n  It is interesting; this amendment essentially says--and I know \nSenator Murray and I are so pleased that Senator Landrieu has also \njoined us--to States, look, Arkansas, Minnesota, if you decide what you \nwant to do is request a good-faith waiver, not a total exemption, so \nthat you can as a State such as Minnesota in dealing with a family, a \nwoman who has been battered, has been beaten up over and over again and \nalso dealing with her children, say, look, from the point of view of \nour work force participation requirements of the welfare bill or \nultimately from the point of view of how many people there are going to \nbe in terms of what percentage of people have to be off the rolls, we \nmay need a little more time to give support to these families. We may \nneed a little bit more time. One size does not fit all.\n\n  I would like to thank my wife, Sheila. I said to Senator Murray, she \nhas worked so hard on this. I would like to thank her and also the \ncommunity in Minnesota that has provided us with a lot of support. The \nfact is when you meet with families, you realize that all too often a \nwoman has been battered over and over again, her children have seen it, \nand it just may be that she is not able right away to move into a job.\n  I just want to thank Jody Raphael at the Taylor Institute in Chicago, \nwho does rather magnificent work. I would also like to thank Pat Reuss, \nof the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, who has been great.\n  Jody pointed out--I am not going to quibble on statistics --in some \nof her work that a real high percentage, maybe 20 percent or more, of \nthese mothers, welfare mothers who have in fact been beaten, are, in \nfact, if you will, victims of abuse in their homes.\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\n This also affects the children who see it.\n  So the reason for this amendment is we just want to make crystal \nclear to our States, all of our States, that they do have clear \ndirection and support from the Federal Government, from the Congress \nand the White House and Health and Human Services, that Minnesota, \nWashington, if you want to provide additional support services and you \nwant to make sure that a woman gets those support services, you can ask \nfor a good-faith waiver to make sure you can do that.\n  Otherwise--and colleagues need to understand this, and that is why \nSenator Murray and I come back to the floor again--we are talking about \na very dangerous situation. We talk in this Chamber, the words are \nspoken and we mean it, but sometimes we forget the connection to \npeople's lives.\n  If you do not do this, what is going to happen to all too many women \nis they are going to be in a situation where they are going to be \nforced into a work situation. They are not able to do it. They are \nstalked by a former boyfriend or former husband or whatever the case \nis. They have been beaten up and maybe they can't even come that day \nfor job training. Maybe physically they cannot come. Maybe they are \njust ashamed to show up. All of a sudden, because women cannot work, \ngiven what is going on, given what is happening to them, given what \ntheir children are seeing, we are going to say to these women, ``You \nare off of any AFDC assistance. You do not get any assistance at all.''\n  Then what happens, colleagues, is they have one choice for their \nchildren. They have to go back into that very dangerous home. They have \nto go back and be with that batterer.\n  Now, Mr. President, the shame of it is--and this is why we come to \nthe floor--the Senate has gone on record, what, three times, I ask the \nSenator, and then every time--I have heard Senator Murray speak about \nthis eloquently so I do not need to repeat her words--and then every \nsingle time in conference this just gets knocked out. That is really \noutrageous. That is really outrageous.\n  It is time that we pass this with a strong recorded vote, and this \nshould be a message to the Congress and a message to the White House \nand a message to Health and Human Services: Please, get the directive \nout to the States making it clear to States--right now we have, what, I \nask the Senator, 26 States?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Twenty-seven.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Twenty-seven States that have been able to go forward. \nBut even Minnesota, which has gone forward, on the basis of talking to \nthe Senator and Sheila, they have still gone ahead with clear \ndirection. They know the amendment has been passed. They know what it \nis they are supposed to be doing, but they have not really seen it in \nwriting from the White House, from Health and Human Services. We need \nthat to happen. This is what this amendment is all about.\n  I conclude by thanking my colleague, Senator Murray. I think it is \nextremely important that not only women and not only their children, \nbut there are a lot of men who care about this issue in the State of \nWashington, Arkansas, and all across the country--I think it is very \nimportant that people in our country realize you need a strong voice on \nthis issue.\n  Senator Murray has been that kind of Senator. I really would like to \nthank her for all of her leadership and, for that matter, for just her \ntenaciousness in coming back over and over and over again and not \nletting up on this, because this is about people's lives, it is about a \nlot of women who have had to deal with something that we hope and pray \nnone of our daughters and none of our sisters ever have to deal with. \nWe ought to make sure that we provide them with the assistance they \nneed.\n  I will tell you, as a Senator from Minnesota, a State which has done \na lot of good work in trying to provide support for women and children, \nand as the husband of my wife, Sheila, who cares so much about this, I \nam honored to be in this struggle with Senator Murray, and I know we \nwill prevail with a strong vote.\n  I yield back the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his strong words \nand his support of this amendment and all of his work on behalf of this \nas well as that of his wife, Sheila.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am going to ask shortly for a rollcall \nvote on this amendment. It is imperative we have a strong rollcall vote \non the underlying amendment so we can move it to conference with a very \nstrong message from the U.S. Senate that we are going to support this \nwith our voices, with our votes, and that we are going to watch it in \nthe conference committee so it remains in this time.\n  We are going to send a strong message to the White House that this \nbody is not just doing this as some kind of political maneuver, we are \ndoing it because we mean it and our votes are going to back it up. We \nare not just going to talk about domestic violence, we are going to be \nthere to make sure the action takes place to take care of the women who \nare abused and are put in this horrendous situation that each of us \nhopes never to be in. It is imperative we do this for the women who are \nbeing abused. It is also imperative we do it for the neighborhoods and \ncommunities they live in. And it is imperative we do it for our police \nofficers across this country who are put in these violent situations \nfar too often today. We need to do our part to prevent that from \nhappening as well.\n  Mr. President, I am ready to yield the remainder of my time if there \nis no one going to speak in opposition, and to ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking the yeas and nays?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we yield \nback all time on amendment No. 1118 and set it aside so Senator \nWellstone can move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be ready in just a moment. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1087, As Modified\n\n         (Purpose: To increase funding for the Head Start Act)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I modify \nmy amendment and I send the modified amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1087), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 61, after line 25, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (1) The total amount appropriated under this Act \n     to carry out the Head Start Act shall be $4,830,000,000, and \n     such amount shall not be subject to the nondefense \n     discretionary cap provided in section 251 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and shall \n     not count toward the Committee and Subcommittee allocation \n     pursuant to that Act; and\n       (2) the amount appropriated for the Department of Defense \n     for fiscal year 1998 is hereby reduced by $525,000,000.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment would add $525 million \nto the budget for Head Start. I thank my colleagues, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter, for their fine work. This bill already provides Head \nStart with a $324 million increase in funding for 1997. The President, \nthe Clinton administration, claims this will allow\n\n[[Page S9054]]\n\nHead Start to serve 1 million students by the year 2002.\n  The Head Start Association has said rather loudly and clearly that, \nin order for Head Start to actually serve 1 million students by the \nyear 2002, it would need another $525 million this year and every year \nuntil 2002. Therefore, I offer this amendment to increase Head Start's \nfunding by an additional $525 million to reach that goal of 1 million. \nWe ought not say we will reach that goal unless we make the commitment.\n  In order to reach this goal, the offset that I propose would be by a \nrescission from this year's appropriation for the Department of \nDefense. I could talk about a whole lot of different waste in the \ndefense bill, but just to give but one example, the B-2 bomber most \nrecently has been reported to be unable to fly in the rain and the snow \nby the General Accounting Office. It, itself, is slated to receive $586 \nmillion from the Senate, and $928 million from the House. Though this \namendment is not about the debate on the B-2, I understand the Senate \nhas basically said no more B-2's; I think on the House side they have \ntalked about moving forward.\n  The Head Start Program currently serves 740,000 students. Head Start, \nroughly speaking, serves 30 percent of the eligible population of 4- to \n5-year-olds; and only 18 percent, if we were going to talk about right \nafter birth until age 5. That means Head Start does not have the money \nto serve more than 2 million eligible 4- and 5-year-olds and roughly 4 \nmillion children from right after birth to age 5. There is no way that \nthis amendment does enough, but it would make a difference. In my State \nof Minnesota, the money for Head Start covers 9,000 Minnesota children \nwho are eligible out of a population of, roughly speaking, 25 million \nchildren.\n  I want to be clear about this. I know I will be up against a point of \norder and I do not expect to win on this amendment. This amendment says \nthat there is still plenty of waste in the Pentagon budget--the B-2 \nbomber is one good example. On the House side it barely passed any \nincreased funding, a plane that cannot fly in the snow or in the rain, \nbut there are other examples as well. I am just saying, when we look at \nhundreds of billions of dollars for the Pentagon, couldn't we transfer \n$525 million to make sure we reach our goal of covering 1 million \nchildren?\n  But there are two parts to this amendment. The first part is, if we \nare going to say White House, or we are going to say U.S. Senate, that \nwe are going to make sure that 1 million children are covered, let's \nnot make it symbolic.\n  Let's do what the Head Start Association itself says we have to do to \nmake sure we at least cover 1 million children. That is what this \namendment says.\n  Mr. President, let me go on and say one more time that Head Start \naltogether leaves out 4 million children-plus who could receive a head \nstart.\n  Just to focus on what this amendment is about, there are plenty of \npeople who have said there is more than enough waste in the Pentagon \nbudget--administrative waste, going forward with some weapons systems \nthat make no sense whatsoever--but I hardly hear anybody on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate say that we should make a commitment to Head Start, \nwhich is just about that, giving children from families with really \ndifficult circumstances a head start.\n  But we are not even going to reach our goal of 1 million children \nunless we provide this additional $525 million. We can do better, I say \nto my colleagues. We can do better for children in this country. We can \ndo better for poor children in this country.\n  The scandal to all this is that we are not even coming close to \ncovering 30 percent of the overall population that is eligible. On the \none hand, we say we are committed to small children. On the one hand, \nwe have all of this research that is coming out about the development \nof the brain, talking about how the early years are most critical--\nright after birth to age 3, actually before birth, that a woman \nexpecting a child should get good care. But at the same time, when you \nlook at just not the 4 and 5 year olds, but when you look at early Head \nStart, which is right after birth to age 3, we are covering just a \nsmall, tiny fraction of the children who could really benefit from this \nhelp. What my amendment does is try to appeal to the goodness of the \nSenate and try and say that we can do better.\n  Mr. President, I have been honored as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota \nto have the opportunity to travel in the country and to be in \ncommunities where people are really struggling against some pretty \ndifficult odds, I will just tell you, whether it be in Chicago, in a \nheavily Latino neighborhood on the south side of Chicago and visit with \nthe Head Start Program and you see these beautiful programs and you \nmeet with the staff.\n  Mr. President, the men and women who are the Head Start teachers and \nteachers' assistants barely make above poverty wages, but you see the \ngood work they are doing and you see all the ways in which children in \nHead Start receive some intellectual stimulation, they get referred to \nhealth care clinics so that they can get the health care that they \nneed, so that they can get the dental care that they need. You see the \nway in which these programs, at their best, give children \nencouragement. It breaks my heart that we cover such a tiny percentage \nof children who could really use this help.\n  This really can make a huge difference in young children's lives. I \nhave gone to east Kentucky and have spent time in Appalachia and, \nagain, I met, first of all, mainly women who are Head Start teachers. \nThey should be heroines. I asked a woman who has been with Head Start \nfrom the beginning, ``Why do you do this? You certainly don't make much \nmoney.''\n  She said, ``I do this because I know what I can do for children. I \nget so much satisfaction from giving these children this encouragement, \nfrom making sure I can help these children at a very young age.''\n  We know that. We say we are committed to early childhood development. \nWe say we are committed to covering. We say we are committed to \ncovering that. The administration says we have to make sure 1 million \nchildren are covered. We don't have enough funding. The Head Start \nAssociation tells us we don't have enough funding for actually 1 \nmillion students by the year 2002--1 million children--which is just a \ntiny percentage of the number of children who are eligible.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is pretty simple and straightforward. It \nsays let's live up to our words. We have more than enough waste in the \nPentagon budget. We ought to be able to transfer $525 million to make \nsure we live up to our word and/or contract with these children and at \nleast 1 million children by 2002 receive this Head Start assistance.\n  I don't know whether or not we are or are not going to have a \ndiscussion about the testing and whether or not the Federal Government \nor an independent group develops tests, but I want to speak about that \nfor a moment because I think it is directly related.\n  I want to say two things by way of conclusion. I say to my \ncolleagues, I don't expect to win. I don't expect to get a huge vote \nbecause this is a transfer amendment, and I have seen what happens to \ntransfer amendments from the Pentagon to these kinds of needs. But you \ncan travel in this country, go to Chicago, or go to Minnesota, or go to \ndelta Mississippi or go to Kentucky and meet with children and meet \nwith families and see the good work that is being done by people who \nshould be famous and then see how little they have to work with and \nhow, if we would just invest a little more and not come to the floor \nand fight, more of these children would have a head start. So win or \nlose, I am going to speak out on this, and I am going to fight for it.\n  Mr. President, I also want to say to the President, to the White \nHouse and to the administration, I have been thinking long and hard, if \nwe actually have a vote on this in the Senate, about this whole \nquestion of testing. I just want to say that I have a certain amount of \nsympathy, as someone who was a teacher for 20 years, with those who \nkind of wonder about the standardized tests. Yes, we want \naccountability and, yes, it is voluntary.\n  I will tell you, I have a real concern about the focus on tests as \nthe way we measure accountability when I think that what it could very \nwell lead to is standardized teaching to standardized tests, worksheets \nwhich are educationally deadening.\n\n[[Page S9055]]\n\n  I will tell you, in Minnesota, every year I read very carefully the \nprofiles of the teachers of the year. Not a one uses those worksheets. \nThey get kids or young people to connect themselves personally to what \nis being discussed in the classroom.\n  I really worry about the direction we are heading in the name of \nreform. I also have quite a bit of sympathy with those who are saying \nto the White House and the administration, in all due respect, if you \nare going to talk about education and you find that people in the \ncountry are with you, if you are going to talk about each and every \nchild should have the same opportunity to reach his or her full \npotential and people in the country are with you, and if you are going \nto talk about the need for us as a country to renew and reinvigorate \nour vow of equal opportunity for every child and you see that the \npeople in the country are with you, well, then, do you know what? Make \na commitment to do something about it.\n\n  In all due respect, just to have some more tests doesn't do a whole \nlot. If you don't change the concerns and circumstances of children's \nlives, starting with more of a commitment to Head Start, then we \nalready know who is going to fail those tests. We have a huge learning \ngap in this country. We know the children who are going to do well, and \nwe know the children who are not going to do well. What good is it to \njust fail those children again this time on a test?\n  If we don't make sure there is a commitment to Head Start and good \nchild care so that children come to kindergarten ready to learn, and if \nwe don't make a commitment to make sure these schools are inviting \nplaces for our children as opposed to being so dilapidated and dreary, \ninvestment in school infrastructure, of which we have done hardly \nanything, and if we don't make a commitment to making sure that these \nchildren have hope and have opportunity and that there is the necessary \nfunding, then these tests don't do anything at l. They don't do \nanything at all. They amount to little more than a technical fix.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, on the other hand, I think that I \nwill support this initiative. I have had a chance to talk with \nSecretary Riley. He is about as gentle a person as there is in \nWashington, DC. He is so committed to children, and I guess since it is \nvoluntary and we are trying to develop good tests, it can't really hurt \na lot. I guess it would represent a very small step forward and, as a \ncollege teacher for 20 years, I don't think I am prepared to just sort \nof say no, thumbs down.\n  But I would like to say to the White House, I would like to say to \nthe President and I would like to say to my party, the Democratic \nParty, we are going to have to do much better. We cannot say that a \nmillion children are going to be in Head Start and then not appropriate \nenough money to make sure that happens.\n  We can't say that we are committed to equal opportunity for every \nchild and not adequately fund Head Start and not adequately fund good \ndevelopmental child care.\n  We can't say that we are for children doing much better in the \nschools and not invest hardly anything. We have invested hardly \nanything in rebuilding crumbling schools all across America. We cannot \nmake that case.\n  If we are not willing to do what is necessary by way of changing the \nconcerns and circumstances of children's lives before they go to school \nand when they go home and to make sure that these schools have the \nresources to work with and have the support services to work with, then \nthese tests are just going to fail the same children who are already \nfailing, in which case it is just absolutely outrageous.\n  This amendment that I have offered isn't going to win. Maybe this is \nwhat you call a message amendment. But I am telling you something, just \nas Fannie Lou Hamer, the great civil rights leader, said, ``I'm sick \nand tired of being sick and tired.'' I get a little sick and tired of \nour not following through the words we speak with some investment. \nEverybody is for the children except when it comes to digging in the \npocket and making the necessary investment. It doesn't seem to me to \nask too much to say an additional $525 million to go into Head Start \nso, as the Head Start Association says, we can at least serve 1 million \nchildren.\n  Madam President, I just want to make one other point, and then I will \nreserve the remainder of my time. Again, if I do this the wrong way, it \nis not going to come across well, and maybe a lot of Senators do this \nalready. I am telling you, I have learned so much from traveling to \ncommunities around the country, just looking, learning from people who \nare in these struggles of trying to earn a decent living, trying to \nraise their children well, people struggling economically, looking at \nthe poverty in this country and meeting women and men who should be \nheroines and heroes who are doing great work. It just reminds you of \nwhat being a U.S. Senator is all about.\n  Today on the floor of the Senate, I am hoping, even if I don't win, \nto at least push this debate forward. I just get a little bit indignant \nthat the sole focus becomes testing, and we don't put the money into \nearly childhood development. We don't make sure children come to \nkindergarten ready to learn. We don't do much of anything about \ninvesting in crumbling schools. We don't do much of anything about the \nhuge disparity in resources that different schools have to work with. \nWe don't do much by way of encouraging the teachers.\n  I will tell you something, some of the harshest critics of public \nschoolteachers couldn't last 1 hour in the classrooms they condemn. I \nam just asking my colleagues today to vote for a small transfer from \nthe Pentagon budget to Head Start. There is no reason to spend a whole \nlot of more money on planes that can't fly in the snow or the rain. I \nthink we can spend the money trying to provide help and support for \nchildren right here in our own country.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yield time, \ntime will be charged equally against both sides.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 10 minutes and \n45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, while I am waiting, just some facts by the National \nCommission on Children.\n  The first 3 years of a child's life are a time of unparalleled \ndevelopment: physical, intellectual, linguistic, social, and emotional.\n  I do not need to use a commission. Let me use my expertise as a \ngrandpa. I mean, we know this as parents and grandparents. We know now \nwhat all of this scientific evidence tells us, which is, these early \nyears are critical years. You have to get it right for children. In \nfact, if we don't get it right for children in our country, all these \nchildren--they are all God's children--then by age 3 many of them may \nnever be ready for school or never ready for life.\n  The fact of the matter is, I am just saying, take $500 million for \nHead Start and at least make sure we cover 1 million children. If we \nwere to consider not just the 4- to 5-year-olds, but the 3-year-olds \nand the 2-year-olds and the 1-year-olds, where it is probably even more \nimportant they get that additional help and families that additional \nsupport--we are covering maybe 15, 18, 20 percent of the overall number \nof children that need this help.\n  I find it very difficult, frankly, to explain, why don't we fully \nfund the Head Start program? If we are going to argue the Head Start \nprogram gives children--special children; all children--a special head \nstart, and we are going to argue we know these are the critical years, \nthen why in the world are we not investing the money? Why are we not \nmatching our rhetoric with the resources?\n  Madam President, I will say it one more time, and then I will reserve \nthe balance of my time. It is just on a personal note. I love the work \nthat the\n\n[[Page S9056]]\n\nmen and women and women and men in Head Start are doing.\n  Thank you for your work in eastern Kentucky, thank you for your work \nin Chicago, in Minnesota, thank you for your work in delta Mississippi; \nand I am sure it would apply to Maine and every other State in the \ncountry.\n  There is nothing more important you can do, because I just tell you \nthat when I spend time with my 20-month-old grandson, the youngest, \nJoshua, I can't believe it--I have said on the floor before--every 5 or \n10 seconds he is interested in something new. We are not, but these \nchildren are. They are experiencing all the unnamed magic of the world \nthat is before them.\n  You can take that spark of learning, and you can ignite it. And if \nyou ignite it in our Head Start programs--some of them do that; many of \nthem do that--then you can take a child from any background to a life \nof creativity and accomplishment, or you can pour cold water on that \nspark of learning. And we do that to too many children.\n  In the State of Minnesota we could do so much more. We cover 9,000 \nout of 25,000 eligible children in Minnesota--9,000 out of 25,000.\n  Madam President, this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. We \ncannot keep saying that we are for the children, we cannot keep saying \nwe are for equal opportunity for every child, we cannot keep saying we \nare for education, Democrats we cannot keep saying we are for expanding \nopportunities and just focus on testing. We have to do much more.\n  Where is the investment to rebuild the crumbling schools all across \nthe country? Where is the investment in Head Start? Where is the \ninvestment in early childhood development? Where is the investment in \nmaking sure that standards are met and that all of the children that \nare in our child care, whether they be centers or whether they be \nfamily child care or home-based child care, that standards are met and \nchildren are safe and children are receiving not custodial but \ndevelopmental care? Where are the standards? Where are the resources? \nWhere is the commitment?\n  I do not know if anybody is going to debate me today on this. My \nguess is it would be just to table the amendment or a point of order. \nBut I would like to debate colleagues, whether they be Democrats or \nRepublicans, about why it is we can't do better.\n  We just had this budget agreement. And everybody said that the budget \nagreement was so successful in dealing with the budget deficit. What \nabout the spiritual deficit? What about the children deficit? What \nabout the education deficit? What about the community deficit? We have \nnot dealt with any of those deficits.\n  I just suggest that if we cannot put a little bit more money, at \nleast into Head Start as a start, then we are not doing as good as we \ncould be doing for children in this Nation.\n  Now, I grant you, the children who we are talking about in Head \nStart, these are children that are low income, these are children whose \nmothers and fathers do not have much by way of economic resources, and \nthey do not have much by way of economic or political clout, but we \nought to do better.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If time is not yielded, it will be charged equally against both \nsides.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The Senator's amendment is simple. It would shift $525 from the \nPentagon budget to Head Start, a very worthy program under the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. The \namendment does not specify where in the Pentagon budget the funds would \ncome from, we leave that for a later time and for input from our \nmilitary leaders.\n  The first National Education Goal states that by the year 2000, all \nchildren will start school ready to learn. Earlier this year, \nscientific research provided irrefutable evidence that the best way to \nachieve this goal was in a child's first three years of life.\n  The release of this research was followed by a White House \nconference, television specials, magazine articles and a lot of talk \nabout the need to improve activities to promote the development and \neducation of young children.\n  The pending legislation made some very modest efforts to seize the \nmomentum created by these activities, but were limited by the \nconstraints of the budget agreement. The bill does make some \nimprovements, such as:\n  Head Start is increased by $324 million with 10 percent dedicated to \nthe Early Head Start program. This action doubles the set-aside for the \nprograms which serve children up to the age of three.\n  The early intervention program for infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities is increased by 11 percent to $351 million.\n  The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is \ndirected to examine the quality of child care funded by federal \nresources to determine to what extent recent research on the brain \ndevelopment of young children is being applied by recipients.\n  In addition, the bill provides more resources for other programs to \nenhance the education and development of young children such as the \nParents as Teachers Program, child care block grant and the Healthy \nStart Program.\n  While I am pleased with these investments in the education of young \nchildren and appreciate Senator Specter's support, however, we need to \ndo more--much more.\n  That's why I am pleased to support Senator Wellstone's amendment to \nprovide additional funding for Head Start. At the present time, Head \nStart is serving only a fraction of the number of children eligible for \nthese services. The additional funding would expand the number of \nchildren receiving the education and health services that will enable \nthem to start school ready to learn.\n  The key to our economic security requires a well-educated, highly \nskilled and healthy work force and the strong foundation for this \nskilled work force is formed during the first years of a child's life. \nTo achieve this goal however, it is critical that children start school \nready to learn so that they will leave school able to earn.\n  The amendment would reduce funds for the Department of Defense so I \nwould like to take a few moments talking about the Pentagon spending.\n  A perfect example of unnecessary spending is the plan by the other \nbody to spend $331 million for additional B-2 bombers. The Department \nof Defense has spent $44.4 billion to develop and purchase 21 planes. \nNow B-2 bomber advocates want to purchase an additional 20 planes at a \ncost of $35.9 billion for procurement and operations. This works out to \nmore than $1.7 billion per plane. In fact, this means that the B-2 \nbomber costs more than three times its weight in gold. Both the House \nDefense authorization and Defense appropriations bills include $331 \nmillion as a down payment for an additional nine planes, with the hopes \nof building even more later on.\n  The list of folks who oppose additional B-2 bombers has become \nnoteworthy. The Air Force doesn't want more B-2 bombers. This has been \nwell know for quite some time. Now, other parts of the defense \nestablishment oppose additional planes. In August, Defense News--hardly \na bastion of the liberal press--published an editorial entitled, ``Time \nto Pause on B-2.'' To quote the editorial, ``the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives should pause for reflection before it takes one more \nstep to resuscitate the B-2 bomber program and buy nine more planes.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Defense News \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Defense News, Aug. 11-17, 1997]\n\n                          Time To Pause on B-2\n\n       The U.S. House of Representatives should pause for \n     reflection before it takes one more step to resuscitate the \n     B-2 bomber program and buy nine more planes. The \n     extraordinary cost will far exceed the sticker price, \n     estimated at $1.4 billion per plane.\n       The level of funding for defense during the next five to 10 \n     years means that money for the planes would be taken from \n     other weapon systems, such as the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft, \n     the Comanche helicopter and various warships. It probably \n     would adversely affect theater missile defense projects, a \n     top national security priority, and even the purchase of \n     basic munitions for operational units.\n       That is a lot to pay for a bomber the Air Force says is not \n     a top priority.\n       In addition, serious questions recently have been raised \n     about the viability of the\n\n[[Page S9057]]\n\n     airplane itself. In a preliminary report, the Pentagon's \n     director of operational testing concludes that only 22 \n     percent of the fleet is available to meet wartime \n     requirements when the B-2's low-observable systems are in \n     use.\n       In addition, the amount of time spent on repair of the \n     airplane's radar-evading devices was found to be excessive.\n       Though tentative, these are substantial criticisms because \n     the low-observable, or stealth, characteristics are central \n     to the value of the airplane.\n       The Air Force paid a premium price for the B-2 because it \n     is supposed to be able to evade most radar systems.\n       These and other conclusions in the report should prompt a \n     full-scale assessment of the B-2 fleet's readiness.\n       The testing director's findings are preliminary. But they \n     are reason enough for the House to delay even initial funding \n     for an expensive airplane that may not work very well.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the latest bad news for the B-2 bomber \nprogram is a GAO report that describes some serious shortfalls with the \nplanes stealth features. Specifically, the aircraft is more sensitive \nto climate and exposure than expected. The B-2 requires special \nshelters to maintain its stealthiness or prolonged exposure to the rain \nand other common weather problems can negate the planes' ability to \navoid radar.\n  This is not the first time that the B-2 bomber has faced problems \nwith rain. Two years ago, we heard how the bomber's radar had trouble \ntelling the difference between a rain cloud and a mountain.\n  In fact, the Air Force hinted at the stealth problems back in 1990, \nwhen they sought approval for a series of special hangars for the B-2 \nbomber at a cost of $4.7 million each. I am sure the cost has gone up \nin the past 7 years, but even then, the problem of maintaining the \nsensitive stealth skin of the B-2 bomber was talked about. And now the \nGAO has shed more light on the B-2 bomber stealth problems. According \nto the GAO, the B-2 bomber must be kept in shelters because of their \nsensitivity to moisture, water or other severe climatic conditions. \nUnless flown in only the most benign environments--low humidity, no \nprecipitation, moderate temperature--the plane requires extensive \nmaintenance or it will not be ready for use. I think modern warfare \nwill included conditions that aren't exactly the most benign \nenvironment.\n  Here is how some newspapers are now describing the bomber.\n\n       The New York Times has said: ``The $2 billion Stealth \n     Bomber Can't Go out in the Rain.''\n       The St. Peterburg Times used the headline: ``Not so \n     stealthy when wet.''\n       And Robert Scheer of the Los Angeles Times said ``Let's \n     hope it rains on the B-2's parade.''\n\n  No one disputes that the Cold War is now over, but some in this body \nwould like to continue funding the Department of Defense as if it had \nnever ended. The B-2 bomber is the perfect example of that view.\n  The world today is not the world of 1985. True, there are dangers to \nthe United States, but they are not the kind of dangers which justify a \nmilitary budget that swallows discretionary spending and harms the very \ncitizens it seeks to protect. They are not the kind of dangers that \nrequire more B-2 bombers at a price we cannot afford.\n  Even with the elimination of the Soviet Union, our defense spending \nis still over 80 percent of United States cold war spending levels.\n  The United States will spend nearly three times what any other \ncountry on the face of the Earth will spend on defense. In fact, if you \nadded up the military expenses of all of Europe and South America \ncombined, that is to say every country in Europe and South America \ntogether, you would find that the United States still out spends them \non defense.\n  I ask you Madam President, what is all of this money for? What enemy \nare we going to fight? Cuba, who spends less then 1 percent of our \nmilitary budget? Or Lybia or Iraq or Iran or North Korea or Syria? Or \nare we spending $266 billion a year simply to have a large military.\n  Let's look at some more figures. United States military spending is \nthree times more than China, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Vietnam \ncombined. It is more than double all of our NATO allies combined and it \nis larger than the next eight largest military budgets combined.\n  As it stands now, such a large portion of our discretionary budget \ngoes toward defense spending, that the security of our citizens is \nthreatened. Yes, Madam President, you heard me correctly, they are \nthreatened by increased defense spending. Why? Because every extra \ndollar we spend on defense is a dollar less for education, for putting \npolice on the streets, for stopping the drug epidemic and feeding our \nchildren.\n  The amount of discretionary funding spent on defense totals over 50 \npercent of the discretionary budget. That means that the portion of the \ntotal budget that Congress actually decides where it will get spent, or \nthe discretionary budget, goes overwhelmingly toward defense. For every \ndiscretionary dollar, 50 cents goes to defense. Not education, not \nhealth care for children, but defense.\n  Every dollar we spend on defense has to come from somewhere. My \nquestion is, Where does the funds for defense come from? Does it mean \none less school gets connected to the Internet? One more child can't \nread, or one more child goes hungry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I assume I am recognized as being the \nperson in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is so recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes forty two seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I surely will not use the entire time, and whatever \ntime I do not use I will yield back.\n  In a couple minutes I will make a point of order against the pending \namendment. It is a clear violation of section 306 of the Congressional \nBudget Act. I understand the sponsor of the amendment will move to \nwaive the point of order, and I in no way want to infringe upon that \nprivilege.\n  Let me just say this is a very simple proposition. Everybody should \nunderstand that in the budget agreement there were a lot of priority \nitems. That meant, literally, that the Congress and the President \nagreed that certain programs would be funded at the President's \nrequest.\n  Anyway, it is pretty interesting because we indeed funded Head Start \nat the exact amount the President asked for in his budget. Head Start \nfunding is increased substantially in this bill, $324 million above the \n1997 level for total funding of $4.3 billion.\n  It just seems like enough is never enough, despite the fact that we \nadopted the President's request and increased funding for Head Start \n$324 million over last year.\n  My good friend, Senator Wellstone, wants to add an additional $525 \nmillion. Now, you understand I am not that quick with arithmetic, but \n$525 million versus an already existing increase of $324 does permit \none to wonder what is the reason for this vote. It seems like it is a \nvote to vote, because we have already increased Head Start dramatically \nand in fact provided for this program exactly what the President \nrequested.\n  Having said that, for those who are concerned about military \nspending, and there are many, we are struggling mightily on various \ndefense measures that we are hoping the President will sign, and the \narguments are essentially over money. What we have agreed on with the \nPresident in the bipartisan budget agreement is that we will provide a \ncertain amount of money for all of defense. Then we say for the next 2 \nyears you cannot spend any defense money for domestic programs. That is \ncalled a wall between defense and domestic spending.\n  When we did not have this wall between defense and domestic spending, \ndefense never knew how much money they would receive because they had \nto wait for the completion of all the appropriations bills to see if \nmoney would be transferred from defense to domestic spending.\n  Again, Senator Wellstone did not want to confront the wall and tear \nit down so he went around it. He just established his amendment and \nthen he said the amount appropriated for the Department of Defense \nshall be reduced by $525 million and the Head Start Act would be \nincreased by the same\n\n[[Page S9058]]\n\namount. However, his amendment would direct the Budget Committee not to \nshow an increase in domestic spending so as not to bump up against the \noverall nondefense discretionary spending cap nor would it count \nagainst the committee and subcommittee allocations.\n  Therein lies the Budget Act point of order. By directing the Budget \nCommittee not to follow the scoring rules established by the \nCongressional Budget Act, the Wellstone amendment is subject to a 60 \nvote point of order pursuant to section 306 of the Budget Act.\n  Madam President, the pending amendment contains matter within the \njurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget in that it provides that \nthe spending associated with this amendment will not be counted against \nnondefense discretionary spending caps. I therefore raise a point of \norder against the amendment pursuant to section 306 of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  Now, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I, prior to \nreading that and making that point of order, be deemed to have yielded \nback any time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I be recognized for an observation, Madam \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator Wellstone has time and clearly we \nwould not vote until he uses his time or the leadership agrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of Senator Wellstone has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not intend to move ahead until the leadership has \nagreed on the time, and that Senator Wellstone be given time to make \nhis waiver motion prior thereto. I hope that is the game plan we are \noperating under.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be set \naside temporarily.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, what is the matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment currently pending.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1116, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see. Well, I understand from the discussion of the \nleaders that we will be addressing the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nas proposed by Senator Daschle and cosponsored by myself.\n  I send a modification to the desk on behalf of Senator Daschle to \namendment No. 1116, a sense of the Senate regarding Pell grants and \nchild literacy funding. The modification is technical and it has been \ncleared on the other side. I ask that it might be in order. If it is \nthe desire of the Chair, I will withhold making that request for a \nmoment or two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking immediate consideration \nof the amendment, or is he merely seeking to modify the amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am merely seeking to modify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 1116), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 61, after line 25, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal Pell Grants are a crucial source of college aid \n     for low- and middle-income students;\n       (2) in addition to the increase in the maximum Federal Pell \n     Grant from $2,700 to $3,000, which will increase aid to more \n     than 3,000,000 low- and middle-income students, our Nation \n     should provide additional funds to help more than 250,000 \n     independent and dependent students obtain crucial aid in \n     order to help the students obtain the education, training, or \n     retraining the students need to obtain good jobs;\n       (3) our Nation needs to help children learn to read well in \n     fiscal year 1998, as 40 percent of the Nation's young \n     children cannot read at the basic level; and\n       (4) the Bipartisan Budget Agreement includes a total \n     funding level for fiscal year 1998 of $7,600,000,000 for \n     Federal Pell Grants, and of $260,000,000 for a child literacy \n     initiative.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that prompt action should \n     be taken by the authorizing committee to--\n       (1) make the change in the needs analysis for Federal Pell \n     Grants for independent and for dependent students; and\n       (2) enact legislation and authorize funds needed to cover \n     the costs of the changes for a $260,000,000 child literacy \n     initiative.\n       (c) It is the sense of the Senate that the maximum level \n     possible of fiscal year 1998 funding should be achieved in \n     the appropriations conference committee.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending business be set aside so that we might go to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1098\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I understand we have 10 minutes equally \ndivided, and I would like to begin by thanking Senators Abraham, Levin, \nHarkin, and McConnell for joining me in the amendment. The amendment is \nin response to the E. coli problems we have experienced. The amendment \ncalls for $5 million in funds to be distributed at the discretion of \nthe Secretary of HHS, and there is no offset. CBO reports that there \nare no budgetary problems with this amendment. Its score would not \nresult in a budget point of order.\n  This amendment, the first section of the amendment provides funding \nfor research on the development of improved medical treatment for \npatients infected with E. coli. The most vulnerable members of society \nsusceptible to the chronic effects of E. coli infection are children \nand the elderly. Funding should focus on helping these individuals to \nrecover fully.\n  Another section provides funding to help detect and prevent \ncolonization of E. coli in live cattle. Research should focus on \ndetermining the host-pathogen relationship between cattle and the E. \ncoli microbe and explore which factors contribute to its incidence in \ncattle.\n  Another section provides funding for the administration's food safety \ninitiative, more directly for the important consumer education \ncomponent. This national consumer education campaign on food safety \nrepresents a partnership between Government, industry and consumer \ngroups. This is an important link in the food safety chain and a \ncritical initiative endorsed last year by former U.S. Surgeon General \nC. Everett Koop, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of \nEducation as well.\n  Another section would implement a much needed study on the \nfeasibility of irradiating raw red meat to eliminate the E. coli \npathogen and to develop a consumer education program on the process of \nsafety. Currently available for poultry products, irradiation is a \nproven method of confronting this disease, and its feasibility on red \nmeat needs to be explored.\n  Finally, a section requires the Department of Health and Human \nServices to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to determine \nthe effectiveness of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's zero \ntolerance standard for E. coli in raw ground beef products and the \neffectiveness of its current microbiological testing program. An \nupdated report on this testing will be helpful to the Congress, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, consumers and the industry in their \nsearch for tools to effectively identify and irradiate E. coli in raw \nground beef products.\n  Mr. President, this is a very good amendment. It is directed at the \nlong-term and short-term health of every American, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask how much time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used about 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I heard the distinguished Senator from Georgia say that \nthis $5 million would be spent at the discretion of the Secretary. Is \nthat correct?\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does that not mean then that the language of the \namendment would be changed to say, on line 4, ``of Health and Human \nServices may carry out activities'' and then on line 9 would say, ``The \nSecretary of Health and Human Services may carry out the following''? \nWould that not be the change that would provide this to be done at the \ndiscretion of the Secretary, because presently the copy of the \namendment I have says ``shall,'' which does not provide discretion for \nthe Secretary. It just says ``shall.''\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It does not have to. She doesn't have the discretion \nnot to spend it. They are directed to perform these activities.\n  Mr. McCAIN. OK. Then the fact is it is not at the discretion of the \nSecretary when it says ``shall.'' The reality is that when it says \n``shall'' in the amendment, it means there is no discretion involved.\n  In fact, $1 million goes to Atlanta, GA, is exactly what this \namendment means. The Senator from Georgia knows very well that I have \nfor 11 years opposed this kind of earmarking, and I intend to oppose it \nnow. But let us not have the Senate be deceived by what the Senator \nfrom Georgia just said. The discretion of the Secretary is not the \ncase. There is no discretion when the amendment says ``shall.''\n  If the Senator from Georgia would be willing to change that word to \n``may,'' then I would be more than happy not only to agree with the \namendment but support it. The fact is that now it means that $1 million \nto fund ongoing research to detect E. coli, or prevent E. coli in live \ncattle only goes to one place and that happens to be, by coincidence, \nin Atlanta, GA, which is something I strongly object to. If this kind \nof practice goes on and continues, we will see the unbridled earmarking \nof funds for specific projects in specific places, which the American \npeople rejected in concept. There is an authorization process and there \nis an appropriations process. This meets neither one of those criteria.\n\n  I understand that the Senator from Georgia will carry this amendment \noverwhelmingly. I also support the research for detection and \nprevention of E. coli and infections. It is a worthy cause. There is a \nsystem and procedure that we go through, which the Senator from Georgia \nis violating grossly with this amendment, and therefore I will ask for \na rollcall on this amendment. I fully expect it to carry overwhelmingly \nin his favor, but I wanted the Senator to know that I am deeply \ndisappointed that he will not change the language of this amendment to \nthe proper form which is ``may'' rather than ``shall.''\n  So, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We do have a management problem here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair did not understand the Senator from \nArizona to ask for a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think the Senator from Arizona is asking for the \nyeas and nays, for a rollcall vote at the appropriate time later in the \nday. I believe that is his motion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My motion is, Mr. President, that I ask for the yeas and \nnays now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second at the moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask further unanimous consent that the \nyeas and nays be set aside until such time as the managers of the bill \ndecide the sequence of the votes that will take place later this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in response to the good Senator from \nArizona, I know he has been long an advocate of nonearmarking, but we \njust simply disagree on the substance of the amendment. There is no \ndiscretion about whether this research will be engaged in or the \nconsumer studies, that is correct, but it is up to the discretion of \nthe Secretary as to how and where that is funded. And that is the \ndifference between us.\n  The Senator is wrong in his assertion that $1 million of this would \ngo to Atlanta, GA. It is possible that some of these funds would go to \nthe University of Georgia, although it is not directed. The reason that \nit is possible, I would say probable, is that unbeknownst to me until \nvery recently but long known in the industry, the University of Georgia \nhas been among the several isolated universities that has advanced \nresearch on how to deal with E. coli in the live herds versus the \ncontemporary process of trying to somehow spot this disease and \nirradiate it in the processing of the meat itself. Indeed, a discovery \non this would be at the level of discovering penicillin, and it just \nhappens that that research is highly advanced at this university at a \ntime when this problem is such a focus of the attention of health \nconcerns in the United States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator \nCoverdell's amendment. Americans need to have the cleanest and safest \nmeat and other foods. The emergency of E. coli:0157H7 is a real threat \nwhich we must quickly respond to. The Coverdell amendment provides \nfunding to address this important issue.\n  There are several ways to reduce E. coli and other microbial \ncontamination and we need to take a multifaceted approach. More \nresearch is one of those. The new hazard analysis and critical control \npoint inspection system will start to be implemented on January 1, \n1998. That will be a considerable benefit. I believe that an additional \nimprovement that can be made is the use of electronic pasteurization. \nThrough that means, we can kill a wide variety of pathogens that may \ncome into accidental contact with foods with no downside to the \nconsumer other than a very small cost.\n  I would expect that the Department should coordinate its research \nefforts with USDA in those areas where the Department of Agriculture \nhas expertise.\n  I am hopeful that we will move along all of these paths in order to \nprovide the safest and most reliable possible food supply.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, if \nany is left.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed for 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9033-6", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9059-S9062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, a generation ago, President John F. Kennedy \ncalled for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. President Kennedy's \nvisionary appeal met with modest but important success: the treaty \nbanning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and \nunderwater.\n  One year ago today, the world community took a major step toward \nfulfilling President Kennedy's vision.\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\n With the United States once again in the lead, the U.N. General \nAssembly voted 158 to 3, with 5 abstentions, to endorse the so-called \nCTBT, drafted by the U.N. Conference On Disarmament. Two weeks later, \nall the declared nuclear powers signed that treaty.\n  Soon this treaty will be submitted to the U.S. Senate for our advice \nand our consent to ratification. Much work is needed to educate this \nbody and to assure us that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will be \neffectively verifiable and will not undermine nuclear deterrence. But \nit is time to begin that effort, and I welcome the administration's \ncommitment to do so.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not enter into force for some \ntime. This is because all nuclear-capable States must ratify this \ntreaty before it can enter into force, at least during the next 3 \nyears, and India has refused to do that--although I am given to \nunderstand that the President will be traveling there, to try to change \nthat view on the part of the Indian Government.\n  Timely U.S. ratification is still needed, however, to prevent the \nCTBT from becoming a dead letter and to maintain the pressure on all \nstates not to test a nuclear device. The 144 states that signed the \nCTBT are largely bound not to undermine it, even before it enters into \nforce. But nonnuclear states will feel little obligation to ratify or \nobey a test ban if the powers with admitted nuclear weapons programs \nfail to ratify it themselves.\n  A comprehensive ban on nuclear testing is no minor matter. This is \nnot your father's arms control agreement, Mr. President. You remember \nthat old commercial--I know, the old automobile man that my father \nwas--``this isn't your father's Oldsmobile.'' This is not your standard \narms control agreement, merely codifying actions already planned by the \ntwo superpowers, which most of our arms control agreements were. This \ntreaty will pinch, it will hurt; but the CTBT will pinch other \ncountries far more than it pinches us, and the world will be a safer \nplace for that.\n  There is always a risk, of course, that a State Party--a fancy \nforeign policy phrase for another country--will violate this test ban \ntreaty rather than do without nuclear testing. Last month's so-called--\nit's amazing the phrases we use--``seismic event'' at or near the \nRussian nuclear test site of Novaya Zemlya is a timely reminder that \narms control compliance can be assured only through effective \nverification.\n  Article 4 of the test ban treaty and the treaty's accompanying \nprotocol do include, in fact, some very welcome verification \nprovisions. An international monitoring system will combine seismic, \nradionuclide, hydroacoustic and infrasound monitoring. This monitoring \nsystem will provide States Parties with both raw and processed data, as \nwell as with analyses of those data.\n  Article 4 requires prompt clarification by States Parties in ``any \nmatter which may cause concern about possible noncompliance with the \nbasic obligations of the treaty.''\n  In addition, the United States, if supported by 29 of the 50 other \nmembers of the Organization's Executive Council, will be able to force \na truly extensive onsite inspection by the CTBT Organization's \nTechnical Secretariat. We would be in a much stronger position to \ninvestigate last month's possible Russian explosion if the CTBT were in \neffect and Russia were required, as a consequence of that, to accept \nonsite inspections.\n  Verification of this treaty will not be cheap, and the United States \nwill be expected to help other countries participate in seismic \nmonitoring, in particular. We have provided such assistance for many \nyears, for a simple reason: not out of our generosity and our \ncharitable instinct, but because it is in our naked self-interest, it \nis in our national interest, both to monitor nuclear tests by other \ncountries and to obtain timely and accurate data on earthquakes.\n  It is important to keep up this effort, whether we eventually ratify \nthe CTBT or not, and I urge my colleagues, as an afterthought here, to \nsupport full funding of the international monitoring systems that I am \ntalking about.\n  How will this treaty really pinch--I mentioned that at the outset--\nassuming that the verification provisions deter any violations? For the \nfive countries with a history of nuclear testing, among which we are \none, the CTBT will mean an end to that testing. We, and other declared \nnuclear powers, will need to use other means in order to ensure that \nour nuclear weapons are safe and are in working order, or to modify \nthose weapons in any way.\n  Let me explain the meaning of that. Most people say, ``Why don't you \nhave to worry about testing anymore? A nation like ours wouldn't want \nto test in any circumstance.'' To raise a legitimate point raised by \nothers who don't support this treaty, however, in order to ensure that \nour nuclear arsenal is accurate and working and functioning, you \noccasionally have to test it, you occasionally have to know what you \nhave. You can't just let it sit there and let the components of it sit \nthere for 20, 30, 40, 50 years and not test it, and still have \nconfidence in its deterrent capacity. That is the reason why even \nnations like ours that do not have any desire to increase their nuclear \ncapacity, that want to reduce nuclear weapons, might still want to be \nable to test.\n  In our country, the Department of Energy plans to use tests that do \nnot actually cause a nuclear explosion, known as subcritical \nexperiments, as well as computer analyses and simulations to assure the \nsafety, reliability, and effectiveness of U.S. nuclear weapons. Ground \nwas broken just last month for a billion-dollar National Ignition \nFacility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to \ndo some of that very work. One hoped-for side benefit is further \nprogress toward controlled fusion, an important potential power source \nfor the next century.\n  Many of my colleagues question whether this Stockpile Stewardship and \nManagement Program, as it is referred to, will suffice in the absence \nof nuclear testing. The Energy Department, where the scientists and \nexperts are, says ``yes,'' while opponents of arms control say ``no.''\n  I say nobody knows for sure. We can't guarantee that stockpile \nstewardship will work because this is a new scientific frontier. But \nthe executive branch must take stockpile stewardship--that is, those \ntests other than actually exploding nuclear devices--seriously, and we \nmust--we must--fund it appropriately, in my view. Senator Domenici has \nwarned that the current funding plan is insufficient for that job. I \nhope and expect that the administration will take that concern to heart \nand not just blow smoke at it.\n  Mr. President, even if we were not going to sign a test ban treaty, \nit should be very much in America's interest for us not to test nuclear \nweapons if we have an alternative that can guarantee the safety, \nstability, security, and usability of our nuclear stockpile. So, for \nwhatever the reasons, even unrelated to this treaty, it makes sense to \nfollow the admonition of Senator Domenici and give the Energy \nDepartment the resources it needs to maximize the chances that the \nStockpile Stewardship and Management Program will suffice in the \nabsence of nuclear testing.\n  Stockpile stewardship, Mr. President, is an opportunity, however, not \njust a challenge. It is precisely this sort of high-technology activity \nat which the United States excels. Recent press stories on our improved \nearth-penetrating nuclear bomb make clear that the United States is \ncapable of maintaining nuclear capabilities, even without nuclear \ntesting, that other countries can only dream of. The truth is that we \nmay well extend our nuclear advantage in a test-free world.\n  So let me be clear about this. I do not think we are seeking any \ngreater advantage in nuclear weapons, over other countries in the \nworld, but if we, in fact, move all the acknowledged nations and those \nwe think have nuclear capacity and nuclear weapons to enter into this \ntreaty, then there will be no more testing.\n  You hear opponents say, ``Well, that will put us at a competitive \ndisadvantage in terms of our nuclear capacity.'' My argument would be \nif the verification is real, which it is in this treaty, we are \npotentially at a competitive advantage because we would be able to \ncontinue to develop and assure the capacity of our nuclear stockpiles \nand capabilities--thanks to our testing capacity, our ability to \nmeasure their utility absent an actual nuclear explosion.\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\n  So this is an argument that I know we will engage in, but I would \njust like to lay a marker down now. I think our security is enhanced \nand our capability can be enhanced with this treaty in place.\n  But we will not be so likely to develop a whole new generation of \nnuclear weapons, and that is important. Why? Because there is a deal \nhere between the nuclear weapons ``haves'' and the nuclear weapons \n``have-not'' states. For the vast majority of countries, those that \nhave never tested nuclear weapons, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nwill greatly impede any efforts on their part to develop nuclear \nweapons, but it will also reassure those countries that the nuclear \npowers will be much more limited in their development of still newer \nweapon designs.\n  Mr. President, think about it. If you are a developing country and \nyou are late into the game of nuclear weapons, you are asked to say, \n``OK, these other guys got theirs, we don't have ours yet, but let's \nmake sure no one can test any more so that we, in fact, can never \ndevelop nuclear weapons.'' Well, you sit there and say, ``Wait a \nminute, the other guys have these things, they have these weapons and \nthe only way they developed them is they tested them. Now you are \ntelling us we can never test them, which is synonymous to saying we can \nnever have them.''\n  OK, in order for them to give up that, because they then are locked \ninto this inferior status in terms of nuclear capability, we have to \ngive something to them. What they get in return for this is that, \nalthough we will maintain that capacity and be able to maintain it \nwithout testing, none of the nations of the world will be able to move \nto whole new generations of those nuclear weapons, which is some \nreassurance to a nation that knows the argument that I made to such \ncountries and their leaders, which is, ``Look, you can never catch up, \nyou can never get ahead of the curve; you may get nuclear weapons, but \nyou're never going to get to the point in your lifetime or the lifetime \nof your children where you are going to be able to match the capacity \nof the nuclear powers. So isn't it better for us to freeze or to \nbuilddown, in effect, to use an expression that Bill Cohen used to push \nyears ago during the arms control debates of the late seventies and \nearly eighties?''\n  How will this test ban impede other countries' nuclear weapons \nprograms? We hope to maintain our nuclear weapons without further \ntesting and non-nuclear powers might hope similarly to develop or \nobtain nuclear weapons without ever testing them. But developing a new \nweapon without testing is risky, especially for a country with no \nexperience in nuclear weapons; after all, even the advanced nuclear \npowers have test failures.\n  Military leaders are hardly eager to go into battle with untested \nweapons, Mr. President. In fact, they get downright cranky about that, \nand once they start questioning the reliability of their weapons, they \nbegin to think more about the dangers that come with war than about the \nglory of it all. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty thus may limit the \nprogress that we and other nuclear powers can make in further \ndevelopments of nuclear weapons, but its greatest benefit will be in \nnonproliferation by foreclosing nuclear weapons from many countries and \nmaking it difficult for new entrants even to approach the \nsophistication of our existing nuclear weapons.\n  The power of the CTBT as a nonproliferation tool explains why \nPakistan was unwilling to sign the CTBT if it could enter into force \nwithout India's ratification. If their nuclear weapons program is going \nto be hobbled, they want India to be hobbled as well. And the CTBT's \nlikely effectiveness is probably also a real reason why India has been \nunwilling to sign the treaty at all. Both of those countries have \nrudimentary nuclear weapons capabilities, but they know that a ban on \ntesting, which may eventually come into force despite India's \nobjections, will severely hamper their ability to develop those devices \ninto a stable of weapons that they can count on in a real war.\n  Just as India and Pakistan appreciate CTBT's power to hamper the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, so should we. We rightly value the \nstability that mutual deterrence has brought us over the last 50 years. \nThat is why we want reassurance that ``stockpile stewardship'' will be \nadequately funded and that the experts expect it to succeed.\n  But the gravest threat to security of our Nation, Mr. President, may \nnot be from Russian or Chinese missiles, but rather from nuclear \nweapons in the hands of others--Iraq, Iran, Libya, or North Korea, just \nto name a few, or even terrorist groups that a rogue state might \nbefriend.\n  The biggest risk of nuclear weapons actually being used may not be \nagainst us, against Russia or even against Taiwan, but rather by India \nand Pakistan against innocent civilians in the teeming cities which are \nwithin range of each country's bombers or shorter range missiles.\n  With U.S. leadership in ratifying this treaty, the CTBT will gain \nnear unanimous international support and keep pressure on India and any \nlike-minded countries to ratify it--or at least to refrain from \ntesting. A comprehensive test ban, once in force, will reduce \nsubstantially the threats of regional nuclear wars or terrorist \nacquisition of nuclear weapons. And that is reason enough, Mr. \nPresident, in my view, to support ratification.\n  But, Mr. President, as I have said, serious observers are sincerely \ndivided over whether the United States will be able to maintain nuclear \ndeterrence without nuclear testing. Achieving the Senate's advice and \nconsent to ratification depends, therefore, in my opinion, upon careful \nand intensive education both of the public and of this body, myself \nincluded. It is time for the administration to begin the sustained \neffort that will be required to assure that 67 U.S. Senators will feel \nthat this CTBT is in our national interest.\n  The world in which we live today, Mr. President, is, as I said \nbefore, not your father's cold war. But there has been no end of \nhistory as has been prophesied. Neither will there be any end of arms \ncontrol. Already this year the Senate has acted on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and the ``Flank Document'' to the Treaty on Conventional \nForces in Europe, referred to as CFE. Measures awaiting Senate action \ninclude: the Convention on Nuclear Safety; protocols to the Convention \non Conventional Weapons on undetectable landmines, blinding lasers, and \nincendiaries; and two treaties to establish nuclear-free zones.\n  Over the next 2 years, the executive branch will likely submit to the \nSenate a START III treaty, an extension of the START II weapons \ndestruction deadlines, an amendment or protocol making START I a \npermanent treaty, a CFE adaptation agreement, a succession memorandum \nand demarcation agreement regarding the ABM treaty, a new safeguards \nprotocol between the United States and the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, a nuclear liability convention, a nuclear waste convention, and \na verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention.\n  Given that lengthy agenda, Mr. President, I am not in a position to \nsay that the CTBT must be taken up as the next item for the Senate's \nattention. Indeed, I hope we will approve some of these less \ncontroversial measures--such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the \nprotocols to the Convention on Conventional Weapons, and a new \nsafeguards protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency--before \nwe bring this issue to the floor.\n  But that need not stop the administration from submitting this treaty \nand beginning the work of educating us as to its merits. Chairman Helms \nand I have shown that the Foreign Relations Committee can get things \ndone, and I am confident that we will secure agreement on many more \nissues, hard ones as well as the easier ones.\n  The time has come, Mr. President, to move ahead on the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty, as well as other arms control initiatives and NATO \nenlargement. The end of the cold war has made all these both possible \nand--I would emphasize--also necessary. This is an ambitious agenda for \nthe Senate in the field of foreign relations, and the issues will be \ndifficult.\n  But we represent the citizens of the world's greatest country. Or, \nthe best phrase I have heard in my 25 years here to describe us is \nPresident Clinton's phrase. He said, we are the ``essential nation.'' \nWe are the ``essential nation.'' We represent the citizens of the \nessential nation. We are charged with the\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\nhistoric task of making the world a safer place for coming \ngenerations--not through war, but through fashioning of durable \nagreements and institutions. We must not--and I am sure we will not--\nflinch at that challenge.\n  This is a rare opportunity that you and I have, to serve at a time \nwhen we are setting down a whole new institutional framework for the \nconduct of world affairs. It has not happened in 50 years; it is \nhappening now. I pray we are as wise as our fathers and grandfathers \nand grandmothers and mothers were when they did the job at the end of \nWorld War II.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence and for listening to me. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are, for the information of our \ncolleagues, in a position soon to vote on three pending amendments, and \nI think a fourth amendment which will be offered by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle. And we expect to proceed soon to \nthe amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle. And as soon as that is \ndone, we will be proceeding to rollcall votes on four amendments. The \ntime should not be too extensive. I just give notice to my colleagues \nthat that will be occurring in relatively short order.\n  Then following the votes we will proceed to debate on the Gorton \namendment, and that will leave then two principal outstanding issues--\nthe issue of school testing, where the parties have been negotiating \nand may be in a position to give us a final answer soon whether they \ncould come to agreement or whether we will have to move ahead with \nSenate debate on that, and the issue with respect to the pending \nNickles amendment. We will see what will happen on that, if we are in a \nposition to move ahead there. I am not sure exactly what will occur \nthere.\n  Mr. President, I have just been advised that Senator Daschle is \nengaged in a meeting that he cannot leave at the moment. So we will \nhave to defer action on his amendment.\n  On behalf of the leader, I have been asked by staff, at the request \nof the majority leader, to propound this unanimous consent request. I \nask unanimous consent that at the hour of 5 o'clock today, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on or in relation to the Murray amendment, No. 1118; \nto be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment, \nNo. 1087; to be followed by a vote on the Coverdell amendment, No. \n1098. And I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided prior to each vote. I ask, finally, unanimous \nconsent that no amendments be in order to any of the previous \namendments prior to the vote, and that the first vote be with the \ncustomary 20 minutes, and that each additional vote be--the first vote \nbe 15 minutes, but we have the automatic extension of 5 minutes, and \neach subsequent vote be limited to 10 minutes, with the extension of 5 \nminutes, so they can expedite the vote process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the submission of Senate \nResolution 121 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Seeing the hour of 5 o'clock having arrived, I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1118\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am advised, Mr. President, that Senator Murray is on \nher way. We do not want to use up her 2 minutes. She is on her way.\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the Murray \namendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this body is about to go to a vote that \nis not one that is unknown to this Senate. It is regarding the welfare \nbill that was passed a year or so ago, an amendment that we offered at \nthat time that was unanimously approved by this body and sent to the \nconference committee that merely allows a woman who is a victim of \ndomestic violence a temporary waiver from the work requirements if she \nneeds to get medical care or she needs to change her Social Security \nnumber so that she is not pursued by her abuser, or to put her children \nin a safe place so she is not worried about them and can work without \nbeing concerned about what happens to her children while she is at \nwork.\n  It is a temporary waiver. It has been passed by the Senate three \ntimes. Not one Senator has spoken against it. Not one Senator has voted \nagainst it. But every time it goes behind closed doors in a conference \ncommittee it is pulled out.\n  That is what happens to abused women constantly. In the light of day, \neveryone is there to say, ``I support you,'' but when they go behind \nclosed doors they are abused.\n  I call on the Senate to vote with a strong voice to the members of \nthe conference committee. We want this amendment to remain in so women \nacross this country, children across this country, communities across \nthis country, and police who are required to come to the scenes of \ndomestic violence incidents are safe once again.\n  I yield my remaining time to Senator Wellstone, who has been helpful \nin this debate and has been very good at working through this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired so the \nSenator must seek unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am very pleased to have worked on this with Senator \nMurray going way back when. I think it is extremely important for the \nprotection of many women and many children in all of our States. Our \nStates are looking for clear direction from the Congress, from the \nWhite House, and from Health and Human Services.\n  This amendment is very important. I hope we will have a resounding, \nstrong vote.\n  The Murray-Wellstone amendment is an amendment I think the Senate \nwill be proud to support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1118 of the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of scheduling, to inform Senators \nas to what we anticipate, as previously ordered, we have two more \nvotes. We then intend to go to the amendment by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader. And then we intend to go to an amendment by Senator \nGorton. It is our hope that we will vote on those two amendments this \nevening, not too late. That will leave us with only two major matters \nremaining--the issue of testing, where we may be able to have an \nagreement, and the Nickles amendment.\n  The majority leader earlier said we would like to go to final passage \ntomorrow morning at 9:30, if we can clear those matters and after we \nhave these two votes, and perhaps two more votes, so that we will \nconclude the rollcall votes not too late. And if there is any argument \non the remaining matters, we will try to vote on them tomorrow morning \nat 9:30 and go to final passage at that time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1087\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes, equally divided, on \nthe Wellstone amendment No. 1087.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank both managers of the bill for \ntheir fine work on Head Start. But I think we can do better. If we \nreach the goal the President set forth, and we say that we are for \nreally serving 1 million children, then the Head Start Association says \nwe need an additional $535 million to do that. That would be 1 million \nchildren. I might add that if we are talking about the early years, 1 \nmillion children is but a tiny percentage of the children that could be \nserved by this program.\n  So I think we could do better. This just says let's get it up to what \nthe Head Start Association says they need to make sure that we cover \nthe 1 million children that we say we are committed to covering. This \n$535 million would come from the Pentagon budget. There is plenty of \nwaste in that budget that we can talk about.\n  I hope that this amendment will get a good strong vote.\n\n\n                       Motion to Waive Budget Act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also move to waive the Budget Act. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I made a point of order \nbecause the Wellstone amendment seeks to add $535 million to the Head \nStart Program. We have already added $325 million in agreement with the \nPresident of the United States. This is a priority item. We filled \nevery priority the President sought. And we have increased it by a \ntotal of $325 million. That is one point.\n  Second, Senator Wellstone would like to take the wall that separates \ndefense and domestic, and he would say the appropriators can \nappropriate $535 million less in defense by virtue of this amendment, \nwhich essentially takes the wall and spends $535 million of defense \nmoney for Head Start, which we have already fully funded as requested \nby the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the Budget Act in relation to the Wellstone amendment No. \n1087. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Therefore, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to change \nmy vote. This will in no way change the outcome of that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1098\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate under \nthe previous order equally divided in relation to the Coverdell \namendment No. 1098.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. The Chair requests \nthe Senate to please come to order so the Senator from Arizona may be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the regular order the proponent or the opponent of the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has 1 minute.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the amendment upon which we are about \nto vote--incidentally, I ask unanimous consent Senator Santorum be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senate will please come to order so the Senator from Georgia may \nbe recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this amendment is endorsed by the \nAmerican Meat Institute, the National Pathological Association and the \nNational Cattlemen's Association. It deals with E. coli, it deals with \nresearch, it deals with education, and it deals with health.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment if carefully read directs \n``the Secretary shall.''

Madam President, I was absent on the recent vote on the \nmotion to table the Sessions amendment. Had I been present, I would \nhave voted aye to table the Sessions second-degree amendment No. 1125. \nMy vote would not have changed the outcome of the vote. This morning I \nwas issued a new legislative pager to announce rollcall votes. \nUnfortunately, the pager was not properly programmed and did not \nfunction when the vote was called.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I think we are making some good progress \nnow. Those three votes move us much closer to being able to get to \nfinal passage.\n  I see the manager of the bill is here. I have been talking to the \nDemocratic leader and I need to converse a few moments more with the \nmanager of the bill. We are hoping maybe we can take up another \namendment and get a vote in a relatively short period of time, and then \nafter that we are working on getting some time agreement on a couple of \nissues. Depending on how much time is needed, then we would probably--\nif it is going to be a lengthy period of time, we would probably have \nthose votes in the morning, at 9:30, one or two of them, as we come in. \nBut we are still working through how much time is needed for debate and \nthe time agreements. As soon as we get that all worked out we will \nnotify the Members.\n  It is our plan now, I think it is safe to say, that the next major \namendment we would like to take up is Senator Daschle's amendment and \nhave a vote. I assume that would not take too long. At that point we \nhope to be able to give the Members an idea about what the remainder of \nthe night would be and what would be the votes, if any, tonight or the \nfirst votes in the morning.\n  I believe we have a 20-minute time agreement on the amendment of \nSenator Daschle.\n  Before we begin on that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1116, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1116, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to commend Senators Specter and \nHarkin for the commitment they have made to educational funding levels \nthat are represented in this bill. They certainly have demonstrated, I \nthink, the extraordinary need for investment in education in ways that \nwe have not seen in recent years. I am very grateful for their \nleadership and their responsiveness to many of these issues. The \noverall funding level for education is now well over the level \nrequested by the President.\n  There still is some unfinished business that needs to be addressed, \nand this amendment addresses two very significant concerns. I am \nintroducing, with Senator Kennedy, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nto draw attention to two places where, in our view, more action is \nneeded to fulfill the budget agreement agreed to earlier this year.\n  This amendment will call on Congress in the form of a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to authorize and increase Pell grant funding to \nsupport both independent and dependent students and, second, to fund a \nchild literacy initiative at $260 million for this fiscal year.\n  I don't think there is much disagreement that Pell grants are an \nindispensable source of college aid for low- and middle-income \nstudents, but the current eligibility rule shortchanges too many \nstudents today. The current needs analysis system expects independent \nstudents, those whose eligibility is not linked to their parents' \nincome, with incomes of $10,000 or higher to make such a large \ncontribution that they receive little or virtually no help at all from \nthe Pell Grant Program today.\n  Furthermore, many of these students will not be helped by the tax \ncredits enacted earlier this year. So the rules need to be changed so \nthat students with low incomes can get help if they need it, students \nthat don't have families, students that are working, students that have \na marginal level of income that put them right in the middle between \nthose eligibility criteria that would favorably affect them at the low \nend and those eligibility criteria having to do with tax credits at the \nhigh end.\n  Similarly, the current rules governing the Pell Grant Program are \ndiscouraging dependent students, those whose parents' income are \nconsidered in determining eligibility, from getting part-time work. \nStudents who have low incomes and who try to help out with their \ncollege expenses should still be eligible for some level of assistance.\n  The President has proposed that we modify the rules to ensure that \nmore of the students in these circumstances have the opportunity to \nqualify for\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\nPell grants. As many as 250,000 students will be helped if the \nPresident's proposal is enacted as he proposed it. These are young \npeople who are just getting started in life who want an education, but \nnow their Government is denying them assistance. That simply isn't \nright, and we should resolve to fix it.\n  So I hope this amendment will send a message to the authorizing \ncommittee and the conferees to this bill that we think this provision \nis important and worth reconsideration. I hope that we will closely \nconsider the issues facing these students and act on it in this bill, \nand in a more substantive way in other legislation as it presents \nitself to the Senate.\n  The second part of the amendment addresses a vital issue for the \ncountry, and that is literacy. We have an undeniable problem in this \ncountry. Forty percent of the Nation's fourth-grade children cannot \nread today at the basic level. Low achievement in reading is a national \ncrisis, and it demands immediate attention. Children are at higher risk \nof falling behind in school and eventually dropping out because of it. \nIt is important not only to these children, but for the future of this \ncountry that we address this problem head on. We can't afford to leave \nany child behind as we head into the next century. That is why we have \nto provide the full amount, the $260 million agreed to in the budget, \nand live up to our commitment if, to address this critical issue of \nchild literacy. We must show that we are willing to respond to what we \nhave said is our commitment this year.\n  We are falling short in that regard and this is our only opportunity \nto revisit the question and really ask ourselves if, indeed, we are \nfacing up to this challenge, to this crisis, if, indeed, we want to see \nliteracy to be a higher priority as we consider education. What will we \ndo to address it budgetarily? We can only hope that we live up to the \nbudget agreement we passed just a month ago.\n  So I hope that, on an overwhelming basis, we can support this \namendment and send the message both on literacy, as well as on \nassisting those independent college students that we are going to live \nup to our words and our expectations with regard to the budget and the \ncommitment we have made to them to give them the kind of education they \ndeserve and need in society today.\n  I am asking for a rollcall vote simply because I think it is \nimperative that we be forceful and as certain about this issue and \ndemonstrate the broad bipartisan commitment about these issues that I \nbelieve exists within the Chamber tonight.\n  So, Madam President, with that, I reserve the remainder of my time \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support Senator Daschle's \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment and its two key provisions--that Pell \ngrants should be funded at a total of $7.6 billion, and that a child \nliteracy initiative should be funded at $260 million in the 1998 fiscal \nyear.\n  I also congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for their \nleadership in making education a priority in the bill. Education is a \nnational priority and we need to do all we can to make sure that \neducation is accessible and affordable for all Americans of all ages \nand all income levels. This amount is a significant step toward \nachieving that goal.\n  Pell grants are an indispensable source of college aid for low- and \nmiddle-income students. But too often, the current eligibility rules \nshortchange too many students.\n  Single, independent students at public 4-year institutions are not \neligible for a Pell grant if their annual income is over $10,000. At \nthat low-income level, many of them will not benefit from the tax \ncredit for college expenses recently enacted in the budget law. So fair \neligibility standards for Pell grants are especially important for \nthese students.\n  A similar problem faces parents trying to pay for college for their \nchildren. Current law penalizes college students who work part time to \nhelp pay the cost of their education, by reducing their eligibility for \nPell grants. We should be encouraging students to work, not take out \nadditional loans, so that they do not graduate under a mountain of \ndebt.\n  The budget agreement contained a clear commitment to allocate $700 \nmillion to improve the needs analysis formula for Pell grants. The \nHouse bill provides only $500 million to meet this commitment, and the \nSenate bill contains no funds at all for this needed change. A strong, \nbipartisan vote in favor of the Daschle amendment is our best hope of \nachieving the reform we need in the conference because the House of \nRepresentatives, with their figures, have some disposable resources \nthat will be available. A strong vote in the Senate will be a clear \nindication of a strong, bipartisan effort to channel those funds into \nthis needed area.\n  The second provision of the amendment reiterates the budget \nagreement's promise to provide $260 million for a child literacy \ninitiative this year. The Senate should be strongly committed to seeing \nthat legislation authorizing the initiative is enacted as soon as \npossible.\n  Forty percent of the Nation's fourth grade children cannot read at \nthe basic level. Low achievement in reading is a national crisis, and \nit demands immediate attention. President Clinton is right to focus on \nthis critical problem, and Congress should respond. It makes no sense \nto delay the appropriation.\n  Both of these items have been considered over a considerable period \nof time in the discussion on the budget resolution and, basically, we \nare conforming this appropriation bill to what was agreed on in the \nbudget resolution by Republicans and Democrats. We believe that there \nis a very, very important reason and justification in prioritizing \nthese funds, in these two very particular areas, when this legislation \ngoes to conference.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I hope we will have \nan overwhelming vote of approval to insist that the conferees find a \nway to pay for these two essential reforms in education. It will be a \nclear indication that education, and particularly for the independent \nstudents and also in the area of reading, have the wholehearted support \nof the Senate, and it will be a clear instruction that those functions \nshould be given the priorities that I think all of us in this body and \nthe American people think they should receive.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Daschle amendment \nexpressing the sense of the Senate in support of Pell grants. I would \nsay to my colleagues, however, that I think we have already achieved \nwhat is intended here when the Senate considered my amendment last \nweek.\n  Even though my amendment to increase Pell grant funding was not \nadopted, the Senator from Pennsylvania, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee, assured the Senate that, to \nthe extent the committee could yield to the Pell grant number in my \namendment and the House bill--a figure that was $528 million higher \nthan in the Senate's Labor-HHS bill--Senate conferees would do so.\n  Let me read back Chairman Specter's remarks from the Record:\n\n       I might say to my colleague from Arizona that with the \n     additional arguments he has advanced today in a very cogent \n     way, to the extent we can yield to the House figure, we will \n     try to do so when we get to conference.\n\n  Mr. President, in many ways, the vote on the Daschle amendment should \nbe an easy vote for Members of the Senate. It expresses support for the \nvery important Pell Grant Program, but does not say where the increased \nfunding will come from. It is not binding on the Senate.\n  By contrast, it was my amendment last week that expressed more than \nnon-binding support. It would have provided the actual dollars to \nextend Pell grant eligibility to additional categories of needy \nstudents, including independent students without dependents.\n  I am sure it is not the minority leader's intent to merely add the \ncost of that expansion to the budget deficit--to the debt that our \nchildren and grandchildren will ultimately have to repay. But if \neducation is as high a priority as we all believe it is, we ought to be \nwilling to put funding for Pell grants ahead of other programs. That is \nwhat I attempted to do last week\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\nwith my amendment to fund Pell grants with offsets from the LIHEAP \nProgram.\n  I can understand that some people did not agree that LIHEAP should be \ncut. Those who believed LIHEAP was a higher priority than education and \nPell grants voted against my amendment. But then why not identify some \nalternative source of funding?\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the chairman and ranking member \nof the authorizing committee--a letter that was sent to Chairman \nSpecter and Senator Harkin--pledging that, if the additional Pell grant \nmoney were provided, the Labor and Human Resources Committee would work \nto authorize the increase in assistance for independent students. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Labor and Human Resources,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services \n         and Education.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \n         Services and Education.\n       Dear Arlen and Tom: We are writing to express our strong \n     support for increased funding for the Pell Grant Program. \n     Increasing the maximum Pell Grant to $3,000 should be the top \n     funding priority for all of the higher education programs. It \n     is also very important to increase assistance for certain \n     categories of independent and dependent students \n     participating in the Pell Grant Program.\n       The 1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act established \n     a new Federal Needs Analysis Methodology to be used for the \n     Pell Grant Program. The new methodology resulted from the \n     integration of two existing formulas. In reconciling the \n     differences, Congress attempted to minimize the impact on the \n     current distribution of Pell Grant recipients and award \n     amounts.\n       Unfortunately, single, independent students without \n     dependents and dependent students with earnings have been \n     hurt by the new formula. We believe some modest changes to \n     the needs analysis formula would significantly improve the \n     Pell Grant Program. Specifically, the income protection \n     allowance provided for these two groups of students needs to \n     be increased. The income protection allowance for single, \n     independent students without dependents is too low to reflect \n     actual living expreses. With regard to dependent students, we \n     believe an increase in the income protection allowance will \n     provide an incentive for students to work, rather than borrow \n     to finance their education.\n       Concerns about the eligibility for these two groups of \n     students for Pell Grant awards have been raised both at \n     Higher Education reauthorization hearings as well as through \n     letters from students across the country. At many campuses, \n     the average age of the student population is over twenty-\n     five. These students are studying to improve their skills for \n     the job market or are starting in new fields as a result of \n     business closures and downsizing. Pell Grant assistance is \n     often vital to their ability to pursue a new career.\n       The current House Appropriations Subcommittee mark for \n     independent students is about $500 million, subject to \n     authorization. The amounts provided for the Pell Grant \n     program by the House fall below the levels included in the \n     bi-partisan budget agreement. We urge that the Senate \n     subcommittee provide the full amount of approximately $700 \n     million so that needs analysis adjustments for independent \n     students without dependents and for dependent student with \n     earnings can be made. We are aware that there are difficult \n     decisions to be made, and addressing these needs should not \n     be done at the expense of an increase in the Pell Grant \n     maximum or other education programs.\n       We believe that we need to continue our investment in \n     education at all levels in order to strengthen our economic \n     and technological competitiveness. Our support for students \n     today through the increase in the income protection allowance \n     for independent students without dependents and for dependent \n     students with earnings will lead to a stronger economy and a \n     better future for the country.\n       If this request for funding is granted, we will work to \n     ensure that our Committee makes the necessary changes to \n     authorize this increase in assistance for these students. \n     Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     James M. Jeffords,\n                                                         Chairman,\n                           Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n                                                   Ranking Member,\n                           Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n  Mr. KYL. As I noted before, Chairman Specter has already indicated \nthat he will move toward the higher numbers for Pell grants in \nconference. And the Labor Committee has indicated that it will act on \nthe necessary authorization. So I think we have already accomplished \nwhat is intended here in the Daschle amendment. Nevertheless, since \nthis represents another opportunity to express support for Pell grants, \nI will support it. However, I do hope that the conference committee \nwill offset the increase from savings in other programs, and not just \nadd the cost to the deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if there is no other Senator seeking to \ndebate the matter, I suggest we yield back all remaining time, and I \nask for the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, I am sending a modified amendment to the \ndesk, and I ask unanimous consent it be considered in place of the \namendment that is before the Senate now.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if the Senator \nwould be so good as to explain what the modifications are.\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. This amendment changes the one we talked about \nyesterday only in that it has the distribution of the amount of money \ngoing to title I based on the total number of eligible title I students \nin each district rather than the total of all students in each \ndistrict.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1122), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, after line 23, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of Education shall award the total amount of \n     funds described in subsection (b) directly to local \n     educational agencies in accordance with subsection (d) to \n     enable the local educational agencies to support programs or \n     activities for kindergarten through grade 12 students that \n     the local educational agencies deem appropriate.\n       (b) The total amount of funds referred to in subsection (a) \n     are all funds that are appropriated for the Department of \n     Education under this Act to support programs or activities \n     for kindergarten through grade 12 students, other than--\n       (1) amounts appropriated under this Act--\n       (A) to carry out title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965;\n       (B) to carry out the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act;\n       (C) to carry out the Adult Education Act;\n       (D) to carry out the Museum and Library Services Act;\n       (E) for departmental management expenses of the Department \n     of Education; or\n       (F) to carry out the Educational Research, Development, \n     Dissemination, and Improvement Act;\n       (G) to carry out the National Education Statistics Act of \n     1994;\n       (H) to carry out section 10601 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (I) to carry out section 2102 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (J) to carry out part K of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965;\n       (K) to carry out subpart 5 of part A of title IV of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965; or\n       (L) to carry out title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965; or\n       (2) 50 percent of the amount appropriated under title III \n     under the headings ``Rehabilitation Services and Disability \n     Research'' and ``Vocational and Adult Education''.\n       (c) Each local educational agency shall conduct a census to \n     determine the number of kindergarten through grade 12 \n     students served by the local educational agency not later \n     than 21 days after the beginning of the school year. Each \n     local educational agency shall submit the number to the \n     Secretary.\n       (d) The Secretary shall determine the amount awarded to \n     each local educational agency under subsection (a) as \n     follows:\n       (1) First, the Secretary, using the information provided \n     under subsection (c), shall determine a per child amount by \n     dividing the total amount of funds described in subsection \n     (b), by the total number of kindergarten through grade 12 \n     students in all States.\n       (2) Second, the Secretary, using the information provided \n     under subsection (c), shall determine the baseline amount for \n     each local educational agency by multiplying the per child \n     amount determined under paragraph (1) by the number of \n     kindergarten through grade 12 students that are served by the \n     local educational agency.\n       (3) Lastly, the Secretary shall compute the amount awarded \n     to each local educational agency as follows:\n       (A) Multiply the baseline amount determined under paragraph \n     (2) by a factor of 1.1 for local educational agencies serving \n     States that are in the least wealthy quintile of all States \n     as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the per capita \n     income of individuals in the States.\n       (B) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of 1.05 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     second least wealthy such quintile.\n       (C) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of 1.00 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     third least wealthy such quintile.\n       (D) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of .95 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     fourth least wealthy such quintile.\n       (E) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of .90 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     wealthiest such quintile.\n       (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the Secretary shall \n     compute the amount awarded to each local educational agency \n     serving the State of Alaska or Hawaii by multiplying the base \n     line amount determined under paragraph (2) for the local \n     educational agency by a factor of 1.00.\n       (e) If the total amount of funds described in subsection \n     (b) that are made available to carry out subsection (a) is \n     insufficient to pay in full all amounts awarded under \n     subsection (d), then the Secretary shall ratably reduce each \n     such amount.\n       (f) If the Secretary determines that a local educational \n     agency has knowingly submitted false information under \n     subsection (c) for the purpose of gaining additional funds \n     under subsection (a), then the local educational agency shall \n     be fined an amount equal to twice the difference between the \n     amount the local educational agency received under subsection \n     (d), and the correct amount the local educational agency \n     would have received if the agency had submitted accurate \n     information under subsection (c).\n       (g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Education shall award the total amount of funds \n     made available under this Act to carry out title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for fiscal \n     year 1998 directly to local educational agencies in \n     accordance with paragraph (2) to enable the local educational \n     agencies to support programs or activities for kindergarten \n     through grade 12 students that the local educational agencies \n     deem appropriate.\n       (2) Each local educational agency shall receive an amount \n     awarded under this subsection that bears the same relation to \n     the total amount of funds made available under this Act to \n     carry out title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 for fiscal year 1998 as the number of children \n     counted under section 1124(c) of such Act for the local \n     educational agency for fiscal year 1997 bears to the total \n     number of students so counted for all local educational \n     agencies for fiscal year 1997.\n       (h) In this section--\n       (1) the term ``local educational agency'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Education; and\n       (3) the term ``State'' means each of the several States of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, \n     the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I spoke to this amendment at length on \ntwo occasions and intend to do so again tonight, but as a matter of \ndeference to my many friends on this side who want to speak on the \namendment and to many of those on the other side who wish to do so and \nto go on to other business, I will reserve my principal argument until \nthe end.\n  Suffice it to say this is an amendment designed to see to it that the \nindividual school districts in the United States be permitted to spend \nthe great bulk of the money that we appropriate, in this case somewhat \nover $11 million, as they see fit rather than with respect to hundreds \nand thousands of pages of detailed regulations that are the bane of \nalmost every school district in the country.\n  The fundamental philosophical question is just this: Do we believe \nthat individual school districts and parents and teachers know best how \nto handle education in their own communities, or do we believe those \nfundamental decisions are best left to bureaucrats here in Washington, \nDC? I believe the former. The opponents to this amendment believe the \nlatter.\n  With that, I yield the floor to allow other Members who wish to speak \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I am pleased to rise as one of \nthe cosponsors of Senator Gorton's amendment. Many here, including the \nPresiding Officer, spent the last year campaigning, and, frankly, I \nmade education one of the cornerstones of my campaign.\n  Everywhere I went there was frustration at the local level about \nFederal redtape, bureaucracy, burdens and costs that were imposed upon \nour common desire to educate our children. I said over and over again \nthat I believed in local control. Now it is time to put to the truth \nwhat we said in how we will vote.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this with Senator Gorton because it does \nexactly what we ought to be doing.\n  Madam President, this amendment focuses the area of education on \nreform, returning the control of our education dollars back to where it \nbelongs, at the local level. This amendment simply block grants the \nfunds from the Department of Education for K through 12 and gives it to \nlocal schools.\n  As my colleague, Senator Domenici, stated, we keep adding \nregulations, adding programs, adding money. But when we get to the end \nof the equation, we end with a negative result and subtracting from \neducation.\n\n  This amendment gives us the opportunity to give schools the \nflexibility to improve the quality of education at the local level, to \nimprove the basic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic.\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\n  Madam President, this is an opportunity for us to do the right thing, \nnot only by reducing the bureaucracy that exists in our school \neducation system, but to provide our schools with the flexibility and \nthe funding to achieve a higher standard.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this. I urge government at all \nlevels, who care about education, to do so by showing, in an \naffirmative way, that our interest is in an educated child, our \ninterest is not in adding to well-funded bureaucracies. I urge support \nof this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have listened with considerable \ninterest to the comments of my friend and colleague from Washington \nwith regard to his amendment. I would like to make certain that I \nunderstand what he seeks to do.\n  I say to my friend from Washington, is the Senator from Kentucky \ncorrect that the Gorton amendment, with the exception of IDEA, I \ngather--or is that still excepted?\n  Mr. GORTON. With the exception of IDEA impact aid, and a few other \nsmaller categoric aid programs.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would it essentially distribute the balance of Federal \neducational funds for elementary and secondary education to the school \ndistricts of America?\n  Mr. GORTON. It would.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And would it be safe to say that, in all likelihood, \nthe school districts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky would receive more \nFederal assistance under the amendment of the Senator from Washington \nthan they currently receive?\n  Mr. GORTON. I cannot answer that question categorically. I can say \nthat we have something over $11 billion in this appropriations bill, \nwhich would be distributed pursuant to this amendment. Because at the \npresent time the administrative costs --the sand in the wheels--amounts \nto about 15 percent of all of the money that we as taxpayers send to \nWashington, DC, that goes to the Department of Education, before it \ngets back, the total distribution to the school districts of the United \nStates will be more than a billion and a half dollars more than it is \nat the present time, which means--just in simple mathematics--that a \ngreat bulk of school districts will end up getting more money. \nMoreover, that 15 percent doesn't include the amount that the State \nsuperintendents of public schools take out of most of these categorical \naid programs for their part of the administration at the present time, \nfurther enhancing the amount of money that will get to each individual \nschool district.\n  Even having said that, I say to my friend from Kentucky, I believe \nthe most important single element in this bill, from the point of view \nof having money spent on children's education, is the removal of the \nhuge numbers of requirements to meet the qualifications for hundreds of \ndifferent categorical aid programs, which now come out of even the \nmoney that gets to the school districts, who must hire all kinds of \nadministrators to see to it that the money is spent in this federally \ndetermined, uniform category. One school district superintendent, \nreported to me by one of my friends, has said something that is \nconsistent with what I hear from my own State: ``We get about 10 \npercent of all of the money we spend on schools from the Federal \nGovernment, but 60 percent of all of the forms we have to fill out, 60 \npercent of all the time we have to use, is spent accounting for that 10 \npercent.''\n  So it is hard for me to imagine a school district anywhere in the \ncountry that is going to have less money to spend on the education of \nits children under this amendment than it does at the present time, and \nthe overwhelming majority of them will have far more.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Further, I ask my friend from Washington, a State like \nKentucky, which frequently is ranked among the lowest 10 States in \nvariety of categories, including poverty, would a State like that under \nthe distribution formula in the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington also be likely to gain additional assistance over and above \nwhat is anticipated would be saved by a reduction in administrative \ncosts here in Washington?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. I am quite certain that Kentucky would--with the \nexception of the modification that we made with respect to title I, \nwhere the proportions will be identical next year to what they are in \nthe present year. We have a slight poverty-based preference in this \nbill. We divide the 50 States --or the 48 States other than Alaska and \nHawaii--into five categories, and the 10 richest States have their \nallocation multiplied by .9, the 10 poorest States by 1.1, and the \nStates in between by 1.05, 1.0, or .95, respectively, so that the \nstudent in the poor State gets a greater degree of aid than the student \nin a rich State.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Washington.\n  Madam President, I think the explanation of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington makes it quite clear that support for his amendment \nwould mean more money for the school districts of my State of Kentucky \nand substantially fewer regulations with which they would have to \ncomply.\n  It seems to me, Madam President, as education moves into the position \nof No. 1 on the interest chart of the American people, it is our \nresponsibility here at the Federal level to think of ways that we can \nfurther enhance American education and help those who are really doing \nthe job, which are obviously the local school districts and the parents \nof our country.\n  So I commend the Senator from Washington for a superb amendment and \nindicate my enthusiastic support for the Gorton amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues, when we finally have a vote, to resoundingly support a \nproposal that clearly will benefit the school districts and the \nchildren of America.\n  Madam President, few would dispute that one of the primary concerns \nof American families today is the quality of education that our \nchildren receive. I am sure that other Members of the Senate have heard \nfrom concerned parents as I have. They don't understand why instruction \nin the most basic skills has fallen to the wayside, and they fear that \na rudderless education will leave their children adrift and unprepared \nfor the future.\n  Nearly everyone involved in education today--parents, teachers, \nadministrators, and legislators--wants to improve the quality of \nlearning in America. But the quest for education reform will only be \nsuccessful if the classrooms--the classrooms--have the money they need \nto implement change and follow-through on the academic programming our \nchildren need.\n  When the Senate approves funding for education, most of our \nconstituents believe--and trust--that those moneys are going directly \nto their child's school. But, the numbers show that this is not the \ncase. An examination reveals that out of $100 billion in Federal \neducation support, local schools received only $13 billion. Let me \nrepeat--$13 billion of $100 billion. Where is this money going? It's \nsupporting paper-pushing and concept discussions in the Washington, DC \neducation offices of adults while our children starve for learning \naides and chalk at home.\n  Senator Gorton's amendment to S. 1061 seeks to help our children by \nactually providing their schools with the funds we assign to them. This \namendment consolidates selected Federal education funds for \nkindergarten through 12th grade and sends the money directly to school \ndistricts. State and local education agencies can then use these \nadditional funds to design and operate the quality education programs \nfamilies are begging for. It does not change the administration of \nfunds for special education, professional development for teachers, \nadult education, education research, the national writing project, \nimpact aid, and other similar programs.\n  This amendment will not undermine education in America. It seeks to \nstrengthen a teetering educational system by focusing our resources on \nthe construction of a firm foundation--strong schools. I am confident \nthat Kentucky communities can use these funds to better their future. \nLocal educators must negotiate through a teeming swamp of \nadministrative rules and regulations in order to meet the day-to-day \nneeds of their students. They need flexibility to implement change and \ndetermine what works. The Gorton\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\namendment provides the first key step to stronger schools across \nAmerica--funding children's education not layers of repetitive \nbureaucracy. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Gorton \namendment and its promise to help our Nation's schools fulfill their \ncommitment to our children and communities.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I take the floor this afternoon to talk \nabout an issue that we have debated in this body all week, an issue \nthat is as important to our Nation as these young pages who sit among \nus today and the future of this country, as any issue that we debate.\n  The issue of education is the foundation of the future of our \ncountry. At a time when our schoolchildren--over 50 million--across \nAmerica are returning to school, including my 6-year-old daughter, \nAllyn, who started first grade last week at Great Falls, VA, elementary \nschool, it is appropriate that we talk about education not just in \nterms of amendments to the appropriations bill, but we talk about \neducation in a way that is relevant to our young people and to our \nfuture. We will continue to debate education, as we should, because not \nonly does every home in America show, as it has shown over the years, \nthat education is the No. 1 issue on the minds of our citizens--and \nwell it should be--but because we spend billions of dollars on \neducation, K through 12 and beyond.\n  This morning's Washington Times had two very interesting articles, \none talking about the American Federation of Teachers and President \nSandra Feldman discussing why our young people are not being educated.\n  If I might, Madam President, allow me to read the first paragraph of \na story that appeared in the Washington Times this morning.\n\n       The practice of promoting students to the next grade before \n     they are ready is ``rampant across the country,'' according \n     to American Federation of Teachers President Sandra Feldman.\n\n  It is a very lengthy article. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 10, 1997]\n\n  Schools Promote Regardless of Merit--Teachers Federation Calls for \n                               Standards\n\n                           (By Carol Innerst)\n\n       The practice of promoting students to the next grade before \n     they are ready is ``rampant across the country,'' American \n     Federation of Teachers President Sandra Feldman said \n     yesterday.\n       While no school district explicitly endorses social \n     promotion, most have an ``implicit policy'' encouraging it \n     because they place limits on holding students back, she said.\n       ``That is a clear message to promote socially,'' Miss \n     Feldman said at a newsmaker luncheon at the National Press \n     Club, where the teachers federation released a national study \n     on student promotion policies.\n       Citing examples, she noted that students in Orange County, \n     Fla., can be held back only once in elementary school, and in \n     New Orleans they can be retained only twice. Houston \n     restricts retention to once in kindergarten through fourth \n     grade and once in fifth through eighth. Other districts \n     forbid holding back students with limited English or learning \n     disabilities.\n       Simply holding students back isn't the answer either, she \n     said. Many students are retained each year, and most do not \n     receive the special help they need to catch up.\n       An estimated 15 to 19 percent of U.S. students are retained \n     each year. In many large, urban districts, more than 50 \n     percent of the students who enter kindergarten are likely to \n     be retained at least once before they graduate or drop out.\n       The report, ``Passing on Failure: District Promotion \n     Policies and Practices,'' examined promotion policies at 85 \n     school districts, including the 40 largest districts \n     nationwide.\n       Locally, the study looked at public schools in the District \n     and Montgomery, Prince Georges, Anne Arundel and Fairfax \n     counties.\n       D.C. policy is ``unclear as to who has the final authority \n     for promotion decisions in all grades,'' the report says. It \n     states that a student may be retained for a maximum of two \n     years.\n       Prince Georges has no formal promotion policy. In \n     Montgomery County, the principal has the final authority in \n     promotion decisions in all grades, but there are limits on \n     retention and for special education students.\n       Parents are the final authority on promotion decisions for \n     elementary students in Anne Arundel County, the principal has \n     the final say for junior high students and the policy is not \n     clear at the high school level.\n       Fairfax County policy does not specify limitations on \n     student retention. Promotion is based on grades for \n     elementary and junior high students. The criteria is not \n     clear for high school students.\n       Among the study's general findings:\n        Some districts limit the number of times a student \n     can be retained, prohibit retention in specific grades or set \n     age limits to move older students along.\n        Student progress often is judged according to \n     vague and varying criteria, as in Nevada's Clark County \n     schools where a promotion requires only that a student's \n     ``progress should be continuous and student advancement \n     through the curriculum should be according to the student's \n     demonstrated ability.''\n        Teachers play only an advisory role in promotion \n     decisions.\n        Only 15 percent of the districts mention tutoring, \n     and 13 percent call for alternative programs and strategies \n     such as transitional classes or extended instructional time \n     for students who are held back. Half the policies mention \n     summer school.\n       Solutions to the problem, according to Miss Feldman, \n     involve creating rigorous grade-by-grade standards for \n     students and ensuring that all elementary teachers are \n     proficient in teaching reading, catching and helping \n     struggling students early in their school careers.\n       ``Without common standards, teachers' grades appear \n     arbitrary--and therefore negotiable,'' she said. ``This \n     undermines students' motiviation to work hard in school. \n     Teachers who uphold high standards can find themselves under \n     a lot of pressure to change grades or just pass kids on.''\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, another story in the Washington Times \nthis morning talks about the Governor of Minnesota, Arne Carlson, who \nwas in town yesterday, it says:\n\n       . . . to spread the word on how he finally made school \n     choice a reality in his State by finding an alternative to \n     politically unpopular vouchers.\n\n  It goes on. I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 10, 1997]\n\n  Carlson Shares School-Choice Success Story--Minnesota Governor Lost \n           Battle for Vouchers but Won Support for Tax Breaks\n\n                   (By Nancy Roman and Carol Innerst)\n\n       Gov. Arne Carlson was in town to spread the word on how he \n     finally made school choice a reality in his state by finding \n     an alternative to politically unpopular vouchers.\n       Mr. Carlson said yesterday that vouchers--government \n     education dollars that follow children to public or private \n     schools--are the best route to school choice, but he stressed \n     that tuition tax credits and deductions are achievable now.\n       At several gatherings, he told GOP policy-makers and \n     reporters how the Minnesota Legislature, controlled by \n     Democrats, overwhelmingly defeated his voucher proposal in \n     1995, so he put together a $150 million package of tax \n     incentives for Minnesota parents seeking alternatives to \n     public schools.\n       ``Vouchers were a lost battle, so we revamped, went to the \n     tax side and put together a plan,'' Mr. Carlson said in a \n     message he hopes will resonate with the public and policy-\n     makers as Congress prepares to debate several school-choice \n     measures.\n       The results in Minnesota was overwhelming support for \n     Democrats, Republicans, rich, poor, blacks and whites for a \n     dollar-for-dollar tax credit for families earning less than \n     $33,500 and a tax deduction for educational expenses of up to \n     $2,500 for families earning more than that.\n       Mr. Carlson said the trick was making sure to offer \n     something for everyone, including suburban and rural voters \n     and the parents of public school students.\n       The strategy confounded the teachers unions, which \n     historically ``opposed virtually everything'' having to do \n     with school choice, he said at a luncheon at the Heritage \n     Foundation. ``A lot of people, including Democrats, got very \n     tired of this `no, no, no' position of the unions.''\n       The Minnesota plan, which goes into effect next year, \n     allows a family to use the money for educational efforts \n     ranging from a summer language program to a math tutor to the \n     purchase of a home computer.\n       Technically, the education credit cannot be used to pay for \n     private school tuition, but private schools can easily shift \n     their accounting to use the credits for approved expenses \n     such as books and transportation.\n       ``It's a tantalizing strategy,'' said Jeanne Allen, the \n     president of the Center for Education Reform, a clearinghouse \n     on national choice issues. ``But each state has to figure out \n     its own political realities.\n       ``There's no correlation for the District. In places with \n     no history of tax credits, it's a tough call. In many areas, \n     there's a need for full tuition to follow children, and the \n     District would be one.''\n       Paul Steidler, senior fellow at the Alexis de Tocqueville \n     Institution, regretted that Mr. Carlson had to ``back off'' \n     on vouchers but found the governor ``inspiring'' for his \n     tenacity against Democratic lawmakers and the vast resources \n     of the teachers unions.\n       Equally impressed, house majority Leader Dick Armey of \n     Texas invited the governor to Washington this week to talk to \n     fellow Republicans.\n       ``All too often school vouchers can be thought of as a \n     conservative notion,'' Mr.\n\n[[Page S9070]]\n\n     Armey said. ``We are finding that the idea has great appeal \n     across the political spectrum.''\n       Mr. Carlson said that after his defeat on vouchers he \n     assigned two staff members to work full time on a plan \n     offering educational choices to parents and having the \n     political support to make it viable.\n       Tax breaks across the economic spectrum were the answer.\n       ``The bulk of the public raised their eyebrows,'' Mr. \n     Carlson said.\n       But as tests revealed that half the children in Minneapolis \n     and St. Paul were dropping out, a third of the state's eight-\n     graders failed a basic reading test and a fourth failed a \n     math test, he said, the public realized something had to \n     change.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, as we pick up newspapers daily across \nthis country we don't talk of great success stories for the most part \nabout our American education system. We talk about failures. That will \nbe a self-fulfilling prophecy if we allow our newspapers to be consumed \nwith what is wrong with our public educational system without focusing \non not only what is right, because there are many things right with our \nsystem, but how we fix them. How do we make American education better? \nIt is easy to criticize. But how do we make it better? It is not just \nmoney. We know that. Quite honestly, it is more important than money. \nThere is not a parent in this country who doesn't understand that.\n  We need to look beyond the technicalities and the small details of \nthe Gorton amendment, or any other amendment to the appropriations \nbill. We need, and we will continue, to debate a much bigger question \nthat gets to our Nation's philosophy, our basic philosophy on \neducation.\n  Who should control what our children learn and what our teachers \nteach? The Federal Government? I don't think so. No, I don't think so. \nThat is not the role of the Federal Government. Our Founding Fathers \ngave us the answer very clearly. We need to look no further than \narticle I and amendment 10 of the U.S. Constitution, which reserve the \nauthority for education to the States, to the people--not to the \nFederal Government.\n  Education should be between parents, teachers, and local school \nboards--not the Department of Education, not the President, not the \nCongress, but the school boards, the teachers, the parents.\n  I am one Senator who wants to stop the flow of taxpayers' money, \nparents' money, coming to Washington, and it resides here, and all the \nsmart people in Washington sort out for all the children of America--\nmore than 50 million--what they should know and what teachers should \nteach. I want to stop that.\n  One, among many, reasons why I support the Gorton amendment is that I \nwant to give the money back to the States, back to the people, back to \nthe local school boards and the teachers. They can better spend it. \nThey can reward teachers. They can improve our schools. They can help \nour students. Who understands it better than the people who are there? \nI trust the people. I trust our teachers. I trust our school boards. I \ndon't trust Government. I don't trust Government to educate our young \npeople. Who cares most about making sure that children get a good \neducation? Who cares most? Well, of course, the parents care most, and \nthe teachers care most.\n  All parents--all parents--should have the opportunity to choose where \ntheir children go to school. It shouldn't be just for rich people. The \nparents pay the bills. We seem to forget that dynamic in Washington. \nThe taxpayers, the parents of the children, pay the bill for education; \nfor everything. Why then do we take the opportunity away from the \npeople who pay the bill from applying their money where they think \ntheir children can get the best education? That makes sense to me.\n  Another reason is that I support efforts by my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Paul Coverdell, to allow parents to use money they \nhave saved in educational savings accounts for K through 12 education. \nWhat in the world is wrong with that? Not only does logic dictate that \nthat makes sense, but it seems to me that it is fundamental to America. \nEducation standards should be set locally, not imposed by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We need to motivate our children to learn. We need to motivate our \nchildren to learn, not just take tests. There has been some debate \nlately on national testing and school standards. We are confusing the \nissue here by shifting the emphasis from learning to testing. We have \nit backward. The emphasis should not be on testing; it should be on \nlearning. The motivation should be learning and not testing. If we \ninstitute national testing, our teachers will teach to the test. Of \ncourse, they will. Who wants to be a teacher in a school with a low \nstandard on national testing? So if you figure out what the test is and \nwhat the testing process is and what the questions are, then you teach \nto the test. That is wrong. That doesn't prepare our young people.\n  It is time that we stop making our teachers jump through the hoops \nthat they have been jumping through with these senseless and burdensome \npaperwork responsibilities and free them up to do what they can do \nbetter than anybody, and that is teach our children. Let's help our \nteachers teach our children. It is a novel idea. Anyone who has talked \nto teachers in any State, in any town, or in any community has heard \nall the horror stories of amounts of time they spend on wasteful, \nunproductive paperwork. That is time that could be spent teaching our \nchildren. We need to prepare our children to compete in a global \neconomy in the 21st century. Just preparing them to pass a test will do \nnothing to ensure they have the knowledge and the skills, the \nabilities, to compete in a very competitive new century.\n  For example, if we let students off the hook in math by letting them \nuse calculators for the most basic of problems, they will never learn, \nthey will never grasp the logic and discipline gained through \nexercising good mathematics skills.\n  There is nothing wrong with calculators, but let us start with the \nbasics first. Everybody knows why we have trigonometry and geometry and \nthe advanced mathematical courses. Very few will ever use that in their \nprofessions, but it is about discipline. It is about learning. It is \nabout pain in your mind and using your brain. Any fool can pick up a \ncalculator. That is not what education is about. That kind of thinking, \nthat kind of training will be vital, if we do it right, throughout the \nlives of our young people for what they will need to succeed in a very \ncompetitive global economy.\n  Where I am from in Nebraska, we call that thinking. We call that \nthinking. If our young people cannot read and write, they do not know \nmuch about science and math and have limited knowledge of history, \neconomics, and geography, what chance do they have to succeed in the \nnext century? Very little.\n  Preparing our children for the next century is not the job of the \nFederal Government. My goodness, we have not been able to balance our \nbudget for over 30 years. That is not our job. It is the job of parents \nand teachers and local school boards working together to ensure that \nall of our children have the very best education possible and ensuring \nthat all of our children have an opportunity to attend the school of \ntheir choice.\n  That is what this is about. Our Founding Fathers knew very clearly \nwhat they were doing when they determined that education should be a \nlocal issue.\n  It is time we get back to the fundamental principles and basics that \nmade this a great nation. We are a great nation today not because of \nour Government, not because of our systems, but because of our people. \nOur people have, through their wisdom, through their common sense, \nthrough their hard work, their discipline, made the right choices for \nover 200 years. And basic to all those choices has been how you educate \nyour children. There will be much debate, as there should be, in this \nChamber over the next few days, weeks, months, and years on our \nphilosophy about education, but let us not forget where it all resides. \nIt resides at the local level with the parents, with the teachers, with \nthe schools.\n  I wish to go on record supporting the Gorton amendment. I wish to \nalso go on record supporting the Coverdell bill and the philosophy of \nlocal control for education.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to join my \ncolleague from the State of Washington this evening in support of and \nas a cosponsor of his amendment to allow resources, money, tax dollars \nto get to the young people of this country in a way that seems so easy \nand so simplistic and, yet, so right, because I suspect that the \nPresiding Officer, myself, and everyone on this floor believes in, and \nwe are collectively supporters of, public education.\n  I happen to be a member of the Republican leadership, and I have \nworked hard over the last several years to make sure that education \nfunding is one of our party's top priorities and that we, along with \neveryone else who serves here, are seen to be strong supporters of \npublic education. And we do that by expanding programs where the need \nis, by increasing dollars, by looking at priorities. That is what we \nshould be doing.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Education \nand Human Services, I have worked to make sure that that kind of \nrhetoric gets translated into increases in Federal funding for \neducation, and I am pleased that this year's bill--the one that we are \ncurrently debating--has such increases in it.\n  In other words, what we are doing here in the Senate is something we \nshould be doing because the American public has asked us to do it--to \nexamine our priorities, balance the budget, and redirect our resources \nand, in doing so, placing education as one of those enhanced \npriorities. Yet, despite all of the increases in spending, I find that \nteachers and parents in my State and across the Nation have not yet \nbeen able to see an improvement in their schools. There is still a high \nlevel of frustration, especially at the parental level, with the \nquality of education that our young people get, the method by which \nthey are educated, and the whole combination of the environment that we \ncall our public school system. They want to know--and I want to know--\nwhere the money goes, how the money gets spent. Why do we have a lot of \npeople at different levels of the administrative process making \ndecisions when, in fact, we have elected officials at the local level \nand professional educators who should be allowed to make the largest \nblock of those decisions?\n  Now, in many instances, the Department of Education can't tell you \nwhere the money went. It doesn't get lost, it just gets administered. \nThe fact is that between the time we appropriate it and the time a \nstudent feels the impact of it, anywhere from 15 percent up to 25 \npercent of the money gets lost at the Federal and State administrative \nlevels. The Gorton amendment cuts to the chase. It basically asks us to \nbe true to the very arguments we have placed time and again in our town \nmeetings and in our citizen gatherings in every State, and that is, we \nwant local control and we want the money to get to the local level. \nYet, in our desire to fund public education, we are constantly working \nat--if I can use the word--new schemes, new processes by which the \nmoney moves through. And in the end, as I say, as much as 25 percent \ndoesn't get there.\n  As the Senator from Washington was mentioning a moment ago--and he \ndidn't mention my name, but I was the one visiting with him the other \nevening in relationship to an administrator in my State. After I toured \nhis school, he said, ``You know, Larry, the Federal programs that we \nhave just seen, some of them are very good and well meaning and are \nproviding very valuable service to our young people, but there is a \nproblem.'' I said, ``What is that problem?'' He said, ``Well, 60 \npercent of the paperwork that my school has to do . . .''--and he means \nall of the paperwork--``. . . is spent on approximately 10 percent of \nthe money we get, and that 10 percent is Federal money. That is about \none-and-a-half staff people in time involved in the paper shuffle to \nget 10 percent of the money, because the programs are there and the \nprojects are there. So they are bound to go after them.''\n  By the way, that individual is not in the classroom teaching. That \nindividual is sitting in an office filling out forms to identify with \nthe Federal dollar. We all support education, but how will increases in \nspending make a difference if the money gets lost in the process or \ngets diminished dramatically in the process, at a time when we are \ntrying to balance the budget and sort out the differences in very \nlimited resources, trying to empower our taxpayers by letting them keep \nmore of their hard-earned money, and still wanting to spend more on \neducation because the public believes it is necessary, and so do we? So \nwhy can't we think of a better way to do it, instead of the schemes and \nthe systems and the bureaucracies, when we have people who are elected \nat the local level, charged and empowered with the responsibility of \neducating young people and professionally trained educators who are \nthere to do it, and yet the Federal system and the State systems tells \nthem how to do it, where to do it, why to do it, and when to do it. The \nGorton amendment says in a very clear way that there is a better way. \nTitle I has been corrected, and it is important that it be corrected. \nThe idea of funding has been exempt. Impact aid should be exempt \nbecause that speaks to the Federal presence in a given school district, \na Federal presence of employees that oftentimes don't pay tax dollars \nby the nature of Federal property they might be on, be it a military \nbase or an Indian reservation. And because there is a Federal presence \nit is important that that money be selected.\n\n  Senator Gorton has exempted that. But what he has said--and \nimportantly so for the rest of it--is create an equitable formula, \nallow the Secretary of Education to be the administrator of that \nformula, and pass the Federal dollars straight through to the local \nschool districts, and each school might choose how to spend that money \njust a little bit differently. But they would choose it on a priority \nbased on what was needed in that community and in that school district \ninstead of pursuing the paper chase because there was a Federal \nprogram. And, we can get the money, but we really do not need that \nparticular project in this district. But it is there, and we ought to \napply for it because it will help fund a piece of this teacher's \nsalary, and we can have them educate in the standard curriculum program \nalong with the special program.\n  That is, of course, exactly what happens. And those are the dynamics \ninvolved. That is why Senator Gorton has brought to the floor what I \nthink is a very clean and simple idea. We are all for public education. \nThis amendment is about public education. It is for public education. \nIt dramatically increases the ability to get the $11 billion that we \nspend in public education to the teacher, to the school board member, \nand to the administrator but, most importantly, directly to the \nstudent.\n  In fact, the Senator, who is the primary sponsor of this, believes \nthat it increases the amount that goes to the students by well over $1 \nbillion. I suspect we are going to hear arguments tonight: Well, but, \nbut; How about; maybe, and This program is so valuable. Of course, that \nis the standard argument because that is the bureaucracy that has built \nup over the years, and we become defensive about it, if we are a \ncreator of it, or an administrator of it.\n  But what we are saying here tonight is let us pass the money through \nthe Department of Education directly to the schools, to the students, \nto the educators, and to the administrators, and save 15 percent in \nadministrative costs at the Federal and the State level, increase the \nfinite resource dollar spent by well over $1 billion to the student, \nand be proud of the fact that we are strong supporters of public \neducation but recognizing the fact that there are the professionals at \nthe local level who know what they are doing and we are simply \nempowering them with more resources to do it.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Gorton education amendment. I \nhope my colleagues will join with us at the time of passage in voting \nfor it.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there has been a concerted effort on all \nsides to work out a unanimous-consent agreement. I think it is a fair \none in view of the time--and the amendments--that we have spent on this \nimportant appropriations bill, the Labor-Health and Human Services and \nEducation bill.\n\n[[Page S9072]]\n\n  We have an agreement here now that I think will allow us to complete \nall action on the bill before noon tomorrow. Then it would be our \nintent at that time to go to the Interior appropriations bill. In the \nmiddle of the afternoon we would probably go to FDA reform. There would \nbe at least an hour of debate by Senator Kennedy, followed by others \ncertainly, and then we would have probably a cloture motion, and we \nwould return to Interior appropriations.\n  That is not a part of the UC. There are a lot of contacts still being \nmade on behalf of Senators on both sides of the issues involved in \nInterior appropriations. But I believe we have the FDA reform time, and \ngeneral understanding of what we will do there.\n  But I just wanted to give Members some idea of what we hope our \nschedule will be tomorrow beyond this agreement.\n  I ask unanimous-consent that time on the Nickles amendment, No. 1081, \nbe limited to 30 minutes equally divided in the usual form, and \nfollowing the debate the Craig second-degree amendment, No. 1083, be \nagreed to, and that no other second-degree amendments be in order.\n  I further ask that the time on the Gregg amendment, No. 1070, as \nmodified, be limited to 30 minutes, equally divided in the usual form, \nand, following the debate, the second-degree amendment, No. 1071, be \nwithdrawn, and no other second-degree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that following the debate on the \nGorton amendment, No. 1122, the amendment be laid aside, and, at 10 \na.m. on Thursday, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the \nGorton amendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the \nNickles amendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the \nGregg amendment, to be followed by third reading and final passage of \nS. 1061.\n  So we have stacked votes beginning in the morning at 10 on the \namendments that are listed here, and on final passage.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nconsider the 2 minutes equally divided for debate just prior to the \nvote?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, certainly we should do that. I should have \nincluded that in our unanimous consent, as is always the case when we \nstack votes like that. We will have 2 minutes equally divided before \neach vote so that Members will know exactly what the substance is.\n  Mr. FORD. The majority leader has always been generous with that \nportion of it. I apologize for bringing it up.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is fine.\n  Mr. FORD. We want to be sure. So that is part of the UC agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that, following the passage of S. 1061, on \nThursday the Senate begin consideration of S. 830, and there be 1 hour \nunder the control of Senator Kennedy and 1 hour under the control of \nSenator Jeffords, and, following the filing of a cloture motion by the \nmajority leader, S. 830 be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I wonder if \nthe leader has the language of the modification on testing? If not, I \nwould be constrained to object unless he could modify his agreement \nwith respect to the modification.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in response to that reservation, I \nunderstand that the efforts are still underway to get agreement on the \nexact language. It is hoped that we will be able to get some agreement. \nI understand the White House is involved in that discussion, and \nSenators from both sides of the aisle are I think making some progress. \nBut if that does not come to a head, I would modify then--let me put \nthis part of the consent.\n  I modify the consent to reflect that, if the Gregg amendment, as \nmodified, is not the agreed-upon text between the two leaders, then \nthis consent agreement will be null and void.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have no objection under those \ncircumstances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, then in light of this agreement, there will \nbe no further votes this evening, and at 10 a.m. on Thursday, four \nback-to-back votes will occur. Also, for those Senators interested in \nthe Gorton education amendment, that debate will be occurring this \nevening. The debate on the Teamsters issue and the testing issue will \noccur between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. followed by, of course, the stacked \nvotes.\n\n  I do want to say, Mr. President, that I appreciate the effort by \nSenator Gorton. I agree with the statements I heard being made by \nSenator Craig. And the idea is to get education back to the people, \nback to the local level, back to the parents, and the children, the \nteachers and administrators. Let them make the decisions of how best to \nspend their allocation of these Federal funds. I believe they will make \nthe right decisions, and it will be a way to help improve education in \nAmerica. It is one thing to test. But we know that our children are not \ndoing as well as they should be. What we should be focusing on is \ngreater parental involvement in education, and in the decisions \naffecting that education at the local level. This amendment would do \nit.\n  I heartily endorse the Gorton amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add my name as a \ncosponsor of the Gorton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, every once in a while a vote comes along \nthat is a defining vote. I am sure that to a lot of people the Gorton \namendment looks like a fairly simple, straightforward concept. And that \nconcept is that we are spending a lot of money on education at the \nFederal level. Yet, if one looks at the 30-year history of that \nexpenditure, Federal spending and Federal control have expanded and we \nhave crowded out parental involvement, and the quality of American \neducation by almost any measure has declined.\n  This has created a dilemma on the part of many Members of Congress. \nCongress and bureaucrats dictating local education priorities and \nprograms is failing. Yet those who are concerned about education have \nloathed the idea of reducing the amount of resources committed by the \nFederal Government for a purpose that they support.\n  So we have been in an endless debate where everybody admits that what \nwe are doing is failing. And, yet, we continue year after year adding \nmore money for the very programs that we have all concluded are failing \nbecause we want to show that we support education.\n  For example, one of the provisions of the bill before us that I \nstrongly oppose is bilingual education. This program has become a \nvehicle to keep people dependent on a language other than the language \nof opportunity and commerce in America. It begins to produce a society \nwhere people who do not learn English are isolated. Yet, in this bill \nwe have a 36-percent increase in funding for bilingual education. That \nis the dilemma.\n  How can we see the money is spent efficiently, if, in fact, we want \nto improve the quality of education? The Gorton amendment solves the \nproblem by eliminating the dilemma.\n  The Gorton amendment will spend every penny on education that this \nbill calls for. For poor students, it maintains the same allocation for \ntitle I.\n  We have already dealt with the education of disabled persons. That is \noutside the purview of this debate. We have recently reformed that \nprogram. It is not included.\n  Impact aid is given on the basis of the number of Federal employees \nwho are working in facilities that do not pay local taxes. That is a \nproperty tax supplement. Impact Aid is not included. But nearly all \nother K-12 educational funding at the Federal level is included in the \nGorton amendment.\n  So what the Gorton amendment essentially says is this: Take the \namount of money that is currently being spent by Washington bureaucrats \nand congressional politicians and give it to the school systems. But \ntake away all of the mandates as to how it is to be spent, and let \nlocal teachers, local parents, and locally elected school board members \ndecide how this money is spent.\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\n  I think conservatively it has been estimated that over $1 billion of \nadditional spending will get through the massive web of bureaucracy, \nthrough that maze of grants and applications and bureaucratic \noversight, and get to the students. I think that number is a gross \nunderestimation.\n  So this is one of those votes that really defines where we stand.\n  Those who vote against this amendment are voting to continue a system \nthat for 30 years has failed the children of this country, that has \nincreasingly dictated education policy in Washington, DC, where \nbureaucrats and Congressmen set priorities in education and where \nparents are basically excluded from having a real voice in how their \nFederal tax money is spent and often how their State and local tax \nmoney is spent. Those who oppose the Gorton amendment are saying let's \nprotect the status quo. Let's continue a program where Washington knows \nbest.\n  Those who support the Gorton amendment are saying, look, we want to \ncommit the money, but rather than letting Washington bureaucrats and \nWashington politicians decide how it is being spent, let's let local \nteachers, local parents, local administrators, and locally elected \nschool board members take this money and use it in a way that maximizes \nthe rate of return in terms of quality education that we get.\n  I think for years to come, people will be able to look at this vote \nand determine where people stand on this fundamental issue. Do you \nbelieve Washington knows best on education? Well, obviously many do. \nBut if they do, they believe it is in spite of 30 years where the \nrecord has shown a clear failure as Washington has dictated more and \nmore of the spending on primary and secondary education in America.\n  It seems to me it is very difficult based on empirical evidence to \nsuggest that the current program really works. What the Gorton \namendment says is let local people set priorities in education. The \nAmerican people overwhelmingly in poll after poll believe that. I am \nconfident that local parents in my hometown of College Station, TX, \nlocal teachers, locally elected school board members love their \nchildren at least as much as we do.\n  I remember once engaging in a debate with someone from the Department \nof Education in the early 1980's, and I made what I thought was the \nconvincing point. I said I may be ignorant, I may not know curriculum, \nI may not have a Ph.D. in education, but I do love my children more \nthan you do, to which this very sweet lady said, ``No, you don't.'' And \nI said, ``Then what are their names?'' She loved them but not enough to \nknow their names.\n  So I am confident that people in my hometown care more about the \nquality of education their children receive than we do. I am convinced \nthat if we give them the same money we are giving them now but we let \nthem decide how to spend it, they will do a better job.\n  It is not going to do us much good to have the Department of \nEducation or some surrogate create a test to give students, then \ndiscover that our schools are failing to teach our children. We already \nknow that. Nothing is more documented in the country than the fact that \npublic education is failing, especially in the big cities. The question \nis what are we going to do about it?\n  The Gorton amendment says let us in a very simple way fundamentally \nbegin to change the equation. It is only the first step. If we give the \nmoney directly to the school system, then you have to ask, what do we \nneed all these bureaucrats for? Perhaps next year we can go back and \ntake the money we are spending on all the people who administer these \nprograms and give that money to the school system and thereby greatly \nmultiply our efforts.\n  So I am proud of this amendment. I think this is a defining \namendment. I think how you stand on this amendment basically says \nwhether you believe that Washington knows best or whether you believe \nthat local parents, local teachers, locally elected school board \nmembers know best and care most. I do not have any doubt about the \nanswer to that question. That is why I am for the Gorton amendment. I \nhope it will pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise in order to offer support for the \nprinciples outlined in the legislation submitted by my friend from the \nState of Washington, Senator Gorton. This amendment begins to bring \nabout some very needed reform to give youngsters in our public \neducation institutions, particularly so many in our large metropolitan \nareas and our inner core cities, the needed reforms that are long \noverdue.\n  What we are saying is that we want to see to it that the money gets \ninto the classroom, that we empower good teachers to teach, that we \ngive to the local districts the opportunity to direct the resources \nthey need.\n  The amendment combines all of the Federal funds devoted to education, \nwith several large exceptions, into block grants. The Secretary of \nEducation is then required to distribute the consolidated funds \ndirectly to each school district through a formula outlined in the \nbill. Now, under this innovative approach, the Federal funds will be \ndistributed directly to school districts, and it will be used in \nclassrooms and no longer will Washington bureaucrats be dictating how \nschools use scarce resources. We need to empower local educators, and \nmore importantly, parents and teachers, with the ability to bring the \nkind of education to youngsters that has been lost to many for so long.\n  I feel very strongly that we have to maximize resources and to return \nto citizens the ability to give educational opportunity to their \nchildren. It is clear that this country has now begun a long overdue \ndebate on the future of public education, and I strongly believe that \nwe need fundamental reforms that will give to our children what they \nneed and deserve.\n  I have proposed five fundamental reforms which I hope we can make \npart of our educational mission, not necessarily by legislation, but as \nguiding principles.\n  First, you cannot give youngsters an educational opportunity unless \nwe get violent and disruptive juveniles out of the classrooms so that \nteachers can teach and good students can learn.\n  A little over a week ago there was an article in the New York Times \nabout crime in the schools, and according to New York City Chancellor \nRudy Crew, last year there was a total of 22,615 reported--I say \n``reported'' because we don't know how many were unreported--incidents \nincluding one murder, 221 sexual assaults including rape, and nearly \n1,000 other physical assaults. That is outrageous. We are talking about \nschools that are supposed to be sanctuaries and havens for our \nchildren. How can teachers teach good youngsters with that taking \nplace? Yet in district after district, State after State, we find \nparents unable to secure for their children a safe environment. \nDisruptive juveniles are permitted to stay in the classroom and create \nchaos to keep others from getting the education that they deserve. How \ncan good teachers teach in those kinds of circumstances?\n  Second, talking about good teachers--and there are many, many--how do \nwe reward good teachers when they are all treated the same? It is about \ntime we rewarded outstanding teachers for their good performance with \nmerit pay. What do we hear in response to that? I hear the president of \nthe teachers' union say, ``We are opposed to merit pay.'' Imagine, \nopposed to giving merit pay to good teachers.\n  Instead, what the union does is protect its own perks without making \ndeterminations about rewarding good teachers. We have outmoded tenure \nsystems in State after State. In my State, the teachers' union protects \nincompetence, notwithstanding that the school board associations have \nbegged, have pleaded, have said give us renewable tenure, tenure for 5 \nyears so that we can review someone's performance. Now we lock in \nincompetence. We reward it. You have unions that are more interested in \nprotecting the perks and the privileges of their members, not rewarding \noutstanding teachers, those teachers who come in early, those teachers \nwho work with our youngsters, those teachers who stay after school, who \ngive additional thought, who are inspirations--and there are so many. \nNo, they are not rewarded with merit pay, but incompetents are \nprotected.\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\n  We need to give parents more control over their children's education, \nand that means letting parents choose which public school in their own \nschool districts their children can attend. Bring about competition. Do \nnot assign, particularly working poor families, to the worst of public \neducation systems without the choice or without the ability or without \nthe financial means to give their children an educational opportunity, \nbut give them choice.\n\n  By the way, in areas where this has been effected, it has worked. It \nhas worked in East Harlem, and it can work elsewhere. In fact, there \nare at least four other examples of New York districts that are \nexperimenting with similar interdistrict programs, and they work. It \nwill let us empower parents to make educational choices for their \nchildren, and particularly those who are not of great affluence.\n  Finally, we need to put our children first and stand up to those \nspecial interests, which are teachers unions that are more interested \nin pay and perks than they are in good education for our children, and \nreward those teachers who are excellent and should deserve that \nrecognition. I am strongly supportive of the principles of this \namendment.\n  I have to ask my good friend and colleague, though, Senator Gorton, \nwhat, if anything, in the bill will see to it that the districts that \nwill be receiving these moneys will not be impaired and that they will \nget at least as much in terms of funding under this proposal as they \nreceived in the past? I think that is a very important element.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the statement by my friend and colleague \nfrom New York on educational policy is greatly to be commended. He set \nout a vision that I think is a magnificent one for parents and students \nand teachers and all interested in education all across the United \nStates.\n  As he pointed out, this amendment is not directed at all of those \ngoals by any stretch of the imagination but is focused on the goal of \ntrusting to a far greater extent than we have in the past the wisdom of \nthe parents and the teachers and the administrators and local school \nboard members in each of the thousands of school districts in the \nUnited States with respect to what best can advance the education of \nthe students for which they are responsible.\n  The principal goal of my amendment is to remove these thousands of \npages of regulations and detailed supervision, frequently on a one-\nsize-fits-all basis, directed from on high here in Washington, DC, at \nurban, rural and suburban school districts all across the United \nStates.\n  Already, this amendment has been improved by suggestions by the \nSenator from New York and others with respect to title I. And he has \nnow asked the question that was asked by the Senator from Kentucky in a \nslightly different form--each Senator, while he or she has strong \ngeneral ideas, also represents particular constituencies in the \nparticular State--as to whether or not it is possible to see to it that \nas we move into this situation we do not have States that are huge \nlosers as well as winners.\n  It is my opinion--it is the reason that I introduced this amendment--\nthat every school district in every State in the United States should \nbe a winner in two ways. First, because so much less money has to be \nspent on administration that more dollars would actually get down to \nindividual students; but, second, because these mountains of \nregulations and impositions from the Federal Government on local school \ndistricts will be removed, the use of the same number of dollars would \nbe far more effective in the ultimate educational result.\n  But, since that is much more important than the formula, the Senator \nfrom New York has said, ``Can't we hold harmless each of the States, at \nleast?'' I think we can only do it by States, because now so much of \nthis money doesn't go to school districts, it goes to the States. The \nStates distribute it. And, on reflection, I think he is right. I think \nhe is correct in that.\n  So, I will ask the indulgence of my colleagues to send one more \nmodification to the desk. Before I send it to the desk I think I just \nsimply ought to read it for their approval. It would be that:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the \n     total amount awarded to local education agencies in each \n     State under this section shall not be less than the net \n     dollars that State would have received absent the provisions \n     of this section.\n\n  What does that mean? That means that roughly 85 percent of the money, \nthe money that now gets out of Washington, DC, would be distributed \njust as it is at the present time. The other 15 percent, or the great \nbulk of that 15 percent that is no longer needed for all of the \nbureaucrats writing and enforcing these regulations here, would go in \nthe way in which the rest of the amendment describes.\n  I think probably that makes even more forceful the point that I have \nmade from the very beginning of this debate, that its primary goal is \nto see to it that we allow the decisions about the way the money is \nspent to be made by the people who are actually spending it and \nactually providing the education. My own opinion is that's far more \nimportant, even, than the billion-plus dollars that would be \ndistributed to the various States because of the smaller expenses of \nadministration. I think this meets with the suggestion the Senator from \nNew York made, and I would like to ask for his comments on it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It certainly does. Mr. President, once again, I want to \ncommend Senator Gorton for his willingness to look at a problem that he \nhas worked on for a long time, in terms of solving it, and having that \nflexibility of recognizing that there are complexities and ways to deal \nwith this. I applaud the modification that the Senator has indicated he \nis willing to make because we now assure against the argument that, \n``Oh, this may cost us money.'' Indeed, I think what the implementation \nof his legislative proposals will demonstrate is that not only do you \nget at least the amount of money that we are talking about now, but \nabsent the red tape, absent the administration--both from Washington \nand at the local levels, that schools are burdened with, hours and \nhours, and thousands of people nationwide who are just working on \nfilling out forms and sending them back and forth --those wasted hours \nand resources can be used and directed much better to meet the \neducational needs that our youngsters have. We are talking about \nempowering the local districts, parents, and good teachers to utilize \nthese scarce resources.\n  It is literally finding over $1.5 billion. That is what the import of \nthe Senator's message is here, giving that kind of resource; and, more \nimportant than just the money, is the tools to direct how these moneys \nwill best be used, the resources to give the best education to \nyoungsters--maybe determine in certain areas they need more computers, \nmaybe in another area they need more books, maybe in another area there \nare some remedial requirements that are necessary. Whatever it is, \nthose decisions should be made by the parents, by the educators, by the \nlocal superintendents, by the local districts, and not on high from \nWashington and not burdened with all kinds of reporting requirements \nthat do nothing to educate our kids.\n  So, if the Senator goes forward with that, I commend him for his \ninitial undertaking and for the fact that he has demonstrated that he \nhas a willingness to meet the needs of the entire educational community \nand see to it that the resources get there, and that no one can make \nthe argument, ``Oh, in my school district our children will not get the \nresources that they are entitled to, or they will get less.'' This \nmodification that he suggests will assure that. I am deeply \nappreciative of his sensitivity; more important, of his leadership in \nthis important area.\n  There is no area more vital. Our public educational institutions, on \nthe elementary level, have been suffering mightily throughout this \ncountry, particularly in the large metropolitan areas and our inner \ncore cities, since so many working families are deprived of choice, are \ndeprived of opportunity, are deprived of giving their youngsters a good \neducation that we have had in the past.\n  I might make one comment. I am struck by the deterioration in our \npublic schools, again: Because of disruptive students--you can't get \nthem out\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nof class; you should be able to get them out of class--because we have \nnot given and empowered good teachers with the kind of recognition and \ngood pay that they need, because we have protected incompetents with \noutmoded tenure laws, because we stripped away the ability to make \nchoices.\n  When my dad was in elementary school 75 years ago, when he first \nentered elementary school--and it was even a little more than that, \nalmost 80 years ago--he didn't speak a word of English. His mom and pop \nhad just come to this country. They lived in a ghetto, in a poor \ncommunity. No one spoke English there. When he went to grammar school \nhe flunked English right throughout. But he had teachers who were \ndedicated, willing, who persevered. And they were interested in giving \nthose youngsters who came from all kinds of diverse backgrounds the \nbest education. Let me tell you, disruptive kids--and they had \ndisruptive kids--were not tolerated, nor their conduct.\n  As a result of that, over a period of time, going to summer school \nand with help, he graduated, went on to a State teachers college. He \nmajored in English because the people who worked with him were an \ninspiration to him. That is the story of so many of our grandparents \nand parents, who had that great educational opportunity in our public \nschools. That is an opportunity that all too often, in too many of our \ncommunities, is lacking. It is one that we have an obligation to fight \nfor and to bring about. We have to empower local educators, local \ndecisions, parents, so the good children can get that opportunity that \nwas available many years ago and unfortunately, in too many cases, is \nnot available now.\n  So I commend the Senator for his excellent amendment and his \ninitiatives and look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Gorton amendment \nbecause it hurts students and goes against the Nation's commitment to \nhelping poor and educationally disadvantaged students who need our \nstrong support. It also undermines the partnerships that have been \ncreated by Federal, State, and local education agencies to improve all \nschools for all children.\n  We all agree that education is a local responsibility. But the States \nand the Federal Government are important partners in helping to improve \neducation for all children. We all need to work together to improve the \nNation's public schools.\n  This amendment rejects that basic principle. It shifts Federal \ndollars away from the neediest communities to the wealthier ones. It \ndestroys carefully crafted and widely supported Federal programs. And \nit undermines the States' roles as vital partners in improving the \nachievement of all students.\n  This amendment would strip the States of their ability to integrate \nFederal funds with innovative State programs and State standards. Most \nof the small portion of Federal funding that is retained by the States \nunder current law--only 6 percent--supports technical assistance and \ntraining for local school districts that do not have the expertise, \nresources, or desire to conduct such training themselves.\n  Currently, Federal funds are offering a helping hand to local school \ndistricts in meeting high priority responsibilities important to the \nNation as whole. The funds help schools and school districts improve \nreading and math skills of disadvantaged students, help teachers get \nthe extra skills they need to teach all children to higher standards, \nhelp communities create safe and drug-free schools, and help \ncommunities modernize their schools. This amendment would take away \nFederal funding for these crucial, targeted purposes to help children \nwho need it most, but who are often short-changed under current State \nand local law.\n  Contrary to arguments made by proponents of the amendment, Federal \neducation laws are more flexible and school-friendly than ever before. \nStates and local education agencies are working in closer and more \neffective cooperation. The result is that schools are doing a better \njob of helping all children meet higher standards of achievement. The \nFederal-State-local partnership in education isn't broken and the \namendment can't fix it. Congress should be doing all it can to \nstrengthen that partnership, not destroy it.\n  As a nation, we have made a commitment to help all students have the \nopportunity to get a good education. We have a responsibility to make \nsure that public tax dollars are well spent. This amendment provides no \naccountability for how these dollars are spent. Reforming the Federal \nrole in education does not mean abdicating that role.\n  This amendment is the wrong direction for the Nation's children and \nthe wrong direction for education. It is not an attempt to offer a \nhelping hand to local schools. It is simply a thinly veiled attempt to \ndismantle the Federal role in education.\n  We should support efforts to improve education for all students, not \nundermine them. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gorton amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment fundamentally alters the \ndistribution of Federal education funds by converting a poverty based \nformula to a general aid formula. This is major change in Federal \neducation policy and there has not been a single hearing on the impact \nor advisability of such a change.\n  The Senator from Washington said it is his goal to get more money \ninto the classroom. However, I wonder how there can be any such \nassurance since his amendment eliminates the requirement that Federal \nfunds must supplement and not supplant existing education funds. We all \nknow that dollars are fungible and there is nothing to prevent a state \nfrom merely reducing State Support for education and spending more \nmoney for other worthy things like roads and bridges.\n  The 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct provided schools with greater flexibility, especially with respect \nto title I. These changes are working.\n  As Federal lawmakers, we have a responsibility to make sure the \nFederal dollar is well spent. This amendment undermines the provisions \nof the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct to improve accountability of Federal education programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Two mechanical matters. First of all, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senators Domenici, Abraham, Craig, and Smith of Oregon be \nadded as cosponsors, if they are not already cosponsors of the modified \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 1122\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Second, I send the modification I just discussed to the \ndesk and ask unanimous consent it be included.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The modification to the amendment (No. 1122) is as follows:\n\n       Insert between lines 22 and 23 on page 6: (h) \n     notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the \n     total amount awarded to local education agencies in each \n     state under this section shall not be less than the net \n     dollars that state would have received absent the provisions \n     of this section. Old subsection (h) relettered subsection \n     (i).\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Might I ask I be also included as an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. GORTON. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, for an outstanding amendment. Every once in \na while we will vote on an amendment that will make a significant \ndifference in our lives and the lives our families, and this is just \nsuch an amendment. This is an amendment that says local school boards, \nlocal school districts and parents will be making decisions instead of \nWashington, DC.\n  I remember when we debated welfare reform and I asked my staff: How \nmany Federal welfare programs do we have? I was thinking maybe we had \n60 or something. It turned out we had 350-some Federal welfare \nprograms. They were stacked on top of each other and, frankly, people \ncould qualify for any number of programs, multiple programs.\n  Then I remember we started talking about education. I asked somebody \nhow\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\nmany programs do we have and how much money are we spending in \neducation? And my staff sent me back: Well, there's hundreds of \nprograms and we spend almost $100 billion.\n  I thought, ``Well, I don't really think that's the case. We don't \nspend that much in the Department of Education. And we don't spend that \nmuch--I know we have other education programs in other agencies, but \nsurely that is an exaggeration. Maybe that was something that some \nright-wing Rush Limbaugh group or somebody made up.'' So I asked the \nquestion and we did some homework and we got some information from CRS.\n  This is a listing of all the Federal education programs. It is a big \nlist. There are 788 Federal education programs. I don't care how bright \nanyone is, there is no one person who can keep track of all these \nprograms. These are all Federal education programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this point--not this lengthy list, because I don't want to charge \nthe Government that much--but a little summary of the list by \ndepartments, programs, and funding; and also by category; the listing \nand the amount of money spent on Federal education programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these printed in the Record at the \nclose of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. To outline just a little bit, the Department of \nEducation has 307 education programs and spends a little over $59 \nbillion. The Department of Health and Human Services has 172 Federal \neducation programs, that costs $8.6 billion. The Department of Labor \nhas 21 at a cost of $5.4 billion, and I can go on down the list but we \nhave had it printed in the Record. It is a total of 788 programs; a \ntotal cost of almost $97 billion a year. I found that hard to believe, \nand I served on the Budget Committee for years and thought I knew a \nlittle bit about Federal budgeting. But I started looking at these \nfigures, and they are astronomical.\n  Mr. President, we have had this information printed in the Record. I \nhope my colleagues will pay a little attention to it. I hope as a \nresult of that they will realize there is no way in the world that we, \non the Federal level, from Washington, DC, can micromanage 788 \nprograms.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Washington says let's let the local \nschool boards do it. Let's put this money, with a few exemptions--\nimpact aid and a couple of other exceptions that maybe really have \nFederal cause--let's exempt them. But for the most part, let's take the \nbalance of them, 788 programs, and put that money together and turn it \nover to the local school boards and to the parents and to the teachers \nwhere they can really do some quality education. They know what works. \nFrankly, what works in Oklahoma may be different than what works in New \nYork, what works in Arizona.\n  So I think my colleague from Washington has an outstanding amendment. \nI hope and urge my colleagues to support it. I hope it will be adopted \ntomorrow morning.\n  I complement him for his outstanding work and hope this amendment \npasses. I believe, if it passes, it will make a very positive \ncontribution towards improving education throughout this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I see no overriding reason to extend this \ndebate. I want to thank the large number of my colleagues who have come \nto the floor, many of them greatly to their inconvenience, during the \ncourse of this evening to speak in favor of my ideas, and the \nsignificant number who, at one time or another during the course of the \nlast 3 days, have spoken on it at other times.\n  I am prepared now to summarize the reasons for favoring the \namendment, to defer to Senator Jeffords from Vermont, who will oppose \nthe amendment, and perhaps take the opportunity to close very briefly \nand to announce, as I understand it, there is no further business to \ncome before the Senate this evening except for a little wrapup which I \nwill undertake.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma spoke about a study that I believe was \nprepared by a very thoughtful Member of the House on the total number \nof Federal education programs, and the number approaches almost 800. He \nalso spoke of almost $100 billion that were spent on these programs. \nThat is a longer list and a larger amount of money than is involved in \nthis amendment because, of course, it includes higher education, it \nincludes preschool education, like Head Start, and it includes a number \nof education and training programs managed by departments other than \nthe Department of Education.\n  I think that many of those programs could be and should be equally \nintegrated into the formula that I have posed here, but I simply lacked \nthe ability to analyze each of those 760 or 788 programs. So what we \nhave done is to take the principal kindergarten through 12th grade \nprograms administered by the U.S. Department of Education, with the \nexception of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, which we \ndebated very thoroughly in the Senate a few months ago, impact aid and \na few other programs which don't fit well into this formula, and to say \nthat instead of continuing dozens of narrow, categorical aid programs \nto education, each managed by its own bureaucracy not just here in \nWashington, DC, but in State capitals and in school district offices \nall across the country, each with its own requirements, each presenting \nto school districts the risk that they may inadvertently spend some of \nthe money on an educational purpose other than that outlined in the \nstatute, and consolidating all of them into one appropriation which \nwill total something over $11 billion and stating that once each State \nhas received the net amount of money that it would get under present \nlaw, that all of the money will be distributed not to State education \nagencies, but to local school districts on the basis of the number of \nstudents each of those school districts serve, with some slight \npreferences for school districts in poorer States and with the changes \nI have already described in title I.\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\n  One of the goals of this amendment, Mr. President, is to see to it \nthat our school districts get more money, and get more money they will, \nbecause close to 15 percent of all of the money that we appropriate at \nthe present time stays in administration in Washington, DC, or close to \nWashington, DC. More of it sticks in our State capitals with the \nadministrators of school programs in each of those States, not so much \nbecause the State capitals want to stick it there, but because they \nhave to meet the multitudinous requirements in Federal statutes and \nregulations. And much more of it must be spent by school districts, not \non education, but on complying with these hundreds of pages of \nstatutory and administrative requirements.\n  So if this amendment is adopted, school districts will have more \nmoney to spend on educating children in an aggregate amount of well \nover $1 billion, and I suspect probably $2 or $3 billion out of the $11 \nbillion. But I think more important than even the extra money is the \nfreedom that we will give to the people who are actually providing our \nchildren with their education: their teachers, with the contributions \nthat come from active and concerned parents, the principals and other \nadministrators of our schools, the elected school board members who \nalmost, without exception, serve without pay. They will be empowered by \nthis legislation to determine in each case how best to meet their \neducational goals, how best to meet standards imposed by the States or, \nin some cases, by the Federal Government, general standards of how well \npeople should be educated, not detailed standards of how money should \nbe spent.\n  So, in summary, seeing my friend and colleague from Vermont here, I \nsimply want to present the issue in these terms: Do we believe that \nfundamental educational policies and procedures are best determined by \nthose who are closest to the students--their parents and teachers and \nadministrators--or do we believe that those policies are best \ndetermined on the floor of this U.S. Senate or by the bureaucrats of \nthe U.S. Department of Education? To the extent that we hold the latter \nbelief, of course, this amendment is unacceptable. I don't think that \nthat belief is warranted. I don't think it is shared by other than a \nrelatively small minority of the American people. In a free country, in \na free society, we trust the people, and that's exactly what this \namendment proposes to do.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \nknow the intentions of the Senator are certainly the best in wanting to \nassist our local governments in having a better handle on their \neducational situation. However, I want to point out several problems \nwith the amendment. I will also say that, given the modifications that \nhave been made, my opposition, as far as the energy involved, has been \ndiminished substantially. Now, we are now talking about only $4 \nbillion, whereas originally the figure was closer to $12 billion.\n  Even with those modifications having been made, I still want to raise \nmy colleagues' understanding of what this amendment does.\n  A lot of the discussion has been about doing away with Federal \ninvolvement, but what the amendment really tends to do is to turn over \nto local governments functions that are now handled by the States. With \nthe modifications, this is somewhat less the case.\n  As a Republican, I have the feeling that the States are better able \nto control, to help, and otherwise assist local schools than is the \nFederal Government. This amendment shifts some responsibilities back to \nthe local governments, but also shifts a great bulk of it back to the \nFederal Government. For that reason, I am a little bit ambivalent as to \nhow serious I consider this amendment.\n  I would like to point out one thing that does alarm me, as someone \nwho believes that the States should have more control over things, and \nthat is the fact that the control that we give back to the local \ngovernments is very precarious. If you read the amendment, the \namendment says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     of Education shall award the total amount of funds described.\n\n  I will recount a problem I once had. I had a wonderful amendment to \nreorder the Nation's priorities in energy. I worked with the committee \nthat handled energy. They adopted all my points, and I thought I had a \ngreat victory. Then they said, ``Gee, Jim, all we did was change one \nword in the amendment.''\n  I said, ``What was that?''\n  They changed ``shall'' to ``may.''\n  Now, if you were to take your language here and change ``shall'' to \n``may,'' then the Secretary of Education would have complete control of \nall these funds. It leaves us in a precarious situation when, with one \nword, you can change the total impact of this amendment.\n  As far as the full impact now, as I mentioned earlier, when you take \nout title I, you take out a huge, huge chunk of money. When you add to \nthat the programs which were excluded from the original amendment, such \nas IDEA and 50 percent of voc-ed and several other programs, you end up \nwith this amendment affecting a mere $4 billion of the roughly $20 \nbillion made available under this bill for elementary and secondary \neducation programs. So my vigor has diminished substantially.\n\n  But let me also point out that, without any guidelines to the local \ngovernments, funding for those programs which are included in the \namendment and which is now targetted to try to help special bodies of \nindividuals--Indians or whomever else--can be used in any way \nwhatsoever.\n  I remember back when we had revenue sharing. What an embarrassment \nthat turned out to be. I was a great one for revenue sharing: Send it \nback to the local governments. We found that, instead of doing the \nthings we thought they would do with it, they built skating rinks, fish \nponds and others things. So we said, ``Gee, we better take it back.''\n  I wish I had that much confidence that local governments would make \nthe optimum use of general Federal funds for education. However, they \nhave tight budgets. In my State, almost every town in the State is \nhaving a problem with its education budget because of its impact on \nproperty taxes.\n  There is nothing in the amendment about a maintenance of effort. You \ndon't have to use the funds for additional education programs. You can \ntake that money and replace the tax funds now being used. You don't \nhave to improve your schools at all. You can just merely reduce the \nproperty taxes to the people in the community. I bet you, if we pass \nthis and it becomes law, that a few years from now we will find out \nalmost all the money went to property tax relief.\n  The problems of education are at the local level. They are not at the \nFederal level. They are at the local level. We argue about how much the \nFederal Government should influence the decisions of local governments, \nbut what we have to do is give the local governments the ability, \nthrough professional development and assistance from the States, to try \nto make sure that they are living up to the obligation of educating our \nchildren.\n  In this Nation right now, 51 percent of the kids who graduate from \nhigh school graduate functionally illiterate. We are way in the back, \nalmost last among the more developed nations, in math. We have right \nnow 190,000 jobs in the information-technology area alone for which we \ncan't find people who have the skills to fill them. In Europe and Asia, \nthose skills are taught in high school.\n  Is giving money back to localities going to make a difference? I \ndon't believe so. So I am afraid what we have here is a well-\nintentioned amendment which could backfire completely by a change in \none word.\n  Let me also say that, although this amendment will not get enacted \nbecause it is veto bait, imagine yourself back home after you have \nvoted for this amendment. You are out there, you are debating your \nopponent, and you say you are in favor of this amendment. He then \nbrings up the amendment and reads it, without knowing the implications: \n``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of \nEducation shall award all the money.''\n  You can argue, but you know how it is trying to argue in a political \nsituation by saying that the language is not really what it meant; \nthat's what it says.\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\n  So, I just think we are not going to accomplish anything of any great \ndimension in terms of the intent of the amendment--to give the local \ncommunities more flexibility with spending. We have cut the States out, \nand we have a direct linkage now between the Secretary of Education and \nevery local school district--with language just open, ripe for being \nchanged from ``shall'' to ``may'' if we should ever lose the majority \nhere.\n  Reluctantly, I have concluded that this amendment would be a very \nserious mistake if we were to pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe my friend and colleague from \nVermont has stated the arguments on his side forcefully and eloquently \nand has illustrated, as I hope I have, the fundamental philosophical \ndifferences over this amendment, over any amendment that is even \nremotely similar to this.\n  The Senator from Vermont believes that a large number of educational \npriorities ought to be set here in the Congress of the United States by \nthe Secretary of Education and the people who work in his department. \nCertainly there is an appropriate theory in this country that that is \ntrue, that the U.S. Department of Education ought to be able to impose \nsignificant controls over State departments of education and even more \ndetailed controls over every school district in the United States, and \nthat in the absence of such requirements not only will money be wasted \nbut the quality of the educational product will be depreciated, will be \nless.\n  I don't know that there is much out there in the educational field \nthat indicates any huge degree of success on the part of this top-down \nset of educational priorities. But nonetheless, it is possible to make \nsuch an argument.\n  My argument, and this is where the Senator from Vermont and I \ndisagree, is that I believe informed parents, informed teachers who are \nin the classroom every single day of their professional lives, informed \nand dedicated administrators and school board members, most of whom are \nelected to nonpaying jobs, not only have an interest in the quality of \neducation that they supply to their children, their students, the young \npeople in their community, but that they are better able to determine \nhow the money they have from whatever source is spent toward those ends \nthan can we here, or anyone in a Washington, DC bureaucracy.\n  As a consequence, this amendment says get rid of the regulations that \napply to the programs that are covered by it, distribute the money \ndirectly to the school districts that are providing education and let \nthem spend it as they will.\n  At one level, of course, that does bypass State education entities in \norder that they not spend any of the money or hold any of it back, but \nit does not prevent any State education entity from saying you have to \ninstruct the mathematics, history, whatever they wish to do, to set a \ncurriculum, much of which is set by the States.\n  It just says with Federal money, the Federal Government is not going \nto tell you how to spend it. It is as simple as that.\n  We are not talking about local governments. The phrase in this \namendment is ``local education agencies.'' By and large, though not \nentirely, single-purpose school districts.\n  To say what this really means is that people in these local \ncommunities will immediately take the new money and not spend it on \neducation but do something else with it or provide property tax relief, \nin my view, evidences a great lack of trust in the fact that our \ncitizens care about the education of their children.\n  I think we know from all of the surveys in which we engage, from all \nthe speeches we make, from all the people we listen to, that our \ncitizens care very deeply about the education of their children, and to \nsay if we do not force them to spend money in particular ways here in \nWashington, DC, they will not spend it at all, that they will ignore \nour kids, is without any evidence, in fact, in the real world.\n  Much of this money is getting through to these school districts right \nnow. I differ with the Senator from Vermont on how much we are talking \nabout. We have not, by any of the changes of this amendment, taken out \nimpact aid, disability education, or 50 percent of local education. \nThey were never in the first version.\n  With respect to title I, we have not taken it out. We just have a \nsomewhat different distribution formula. The same number of dollars is \ninvolved now as when I first discussed it earlier. The point, roughly \n85 percent of this money is somehow or another getting at least down to \nthe State level at the present time. Added money that school districts \nwill get will be the money we save in administration here and in State \ncapitals. I am convinced it will all go into the education of our \nchildren. But the number of dollars, the additional dollars, even if \nthey can be measured, will not be nearly as important as the removal of \nFederal regulatory detail.\n  The Senator from Idaho described the situation in one of his \ndistricts, which I believe is pretty close to universal: 10 percent of \nthe money comes from the Federal Government and 60 percent of the \nrules. That is a terrible imbalance. We would like to get rid of almost \nall of those 60 percent of the rules and power our school districts, \npower our teachers, and power our parents and see whether or not they \ncannot do a somewhat better job than the rather poor job we have done \nso far ourselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1090 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Mack, I ask unanimous \nconsent amendment No. 1090 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1110\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside and the Senate turn to consideration of \namendment No. 1110 to S. 1061.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1110, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President I send a modification to the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (1110), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, line 11, strike ``$3,292,476,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof: ``$3,288,476,000''.\n       On page 10, line 18, strike ``$216,333,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof: ``$212,333,000''.\n       On page 12, line 11, strike ``$84,308,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof: ``$88,308,000''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. This amendment provides $4 million to the Department of \nLabor for the administration of the welfare-to-work job training \nprogram authorized and funded in the recently enacted Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997.\n  The administration had requested $6.2 million but the level was \nreduced in the amendment because of concerns raised by the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The additional funds are fully offsetted.\n  The amendment has been cleared on both sides. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1110), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9062-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Following enactment of the CDA on \nOctober 23, 1992, a number of U.S. telecommunications companies \nsuccessfully negotiated agreements to provide telecommunications \nservices between the United States and Cuba consistent with policy \nguidelines developed by the Department of State and the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  Subsequent to enactment of the CDA, the Department of the Treasury's \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) amended the Cuban Assets \nControl Regulations, 31 C.F.R.

A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, \nregarding the Huna Totem Corp. public interest land exchange, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the huna totem corporation land exchange act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today \non behalf of the Huna Totem Corp. and the residents of Hoonah, AK.\n  This bill would require the Huna Totem Corp. to convey ownership of \napproximately 1,999 acres of land needed as a municipal watershed to \nthe U.S. Forest Service. This will ensure that the residents of Hoonah, \nAK, have a reliable source of clean water. In exchange for these lands \nthe Huna Totem Corp. will be allowed to select other lands readily \naccessible to Hoonah in order to fulfill their ANCSA entitlement. This \nlegislation also requires the exchange of lands to be of equal value \nand provides for additional compensation if needed. Lastly, the \nlegislation requires that any potential timber harvested from land \nacquired by Huna Totem Corp not be available for export.\n  Mr. President, the city of Hoonah is located in southeast Alaska on \nthe northeast part of Chichagoff Island.\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\nHoonah has been the home of the Huna people since the last advance of \nthe great ice masses into Glacier Bay, forcing the Huna people to look \nfor new homes. Since the Huna people had traditionally used the Hoonah \narea each summer as a subsistence harvesting area, it was natural for \nthem to settle in the area now called Hoonah. The community has a \npopulation of approximately 918 residents and is located 40 miles from \nJuneau; Alaska's capital city.\n  Within the city of Hoonah is located the Huna Totem Corp., an Alaska \nNative Corp. formed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n[ANCSA]. Huna Totem is the largest Tlingit Indian Village Corp. in \nsoutheast Alaska. Under the terms of ANCSA each village corporation had \nto select lands within the core township or townships in which all or \npart of the Native village is located.\n  In 1975, Huna Totem filed its ANCSA land selections within the 2 mile \nradius of the city of Hoonah as mandated by ANCSA. Since the community \nof Hoonah is located along the shoreline at the base of Hoonah Head \nMountain, the surrounding lands are steep hillsides, cliffs, or are \ndesignated watershed for the municipal water sources. Most of the \nacres, approximately 1,999, of this land are not conducive to logging \nor development due to the topography and watershed limitations.\n  Therefore in order for the Huna Totem Corp. to receive full economic \nbenefit of the lands promised to them under ANCSA, and for the city of \nHoonah to protect its watershed, alternative lands must be sought for \nHuna Totem to seek revenue from.\n  The legislation I am offering today would achieve these goals. By \nauthorizing a land exchange between the Huna Totem Corp. and the U.S. \nForest Service the residents of Hoonah will be assured a safe supply of \ndrinking water. Additionally, Huna Totem Corp. will be able to fully \nrecognize the benefits promised under the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By. Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1159. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, \nregarding the Kake Tribal Corp. public interest land exchange, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                       THE KAKE LAND EXCHANGE ACT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Kake \nTribal Land Exchange Act. This legislation would amend the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act which authorized the transfer of 23,040 \nacres of land from the U.S. Government to Kake Tribal Corp. The land \nwas transferred to Kake to recognize an immediate need for a fair and \njust settlement.\n  Unfortunately, Kake has not received the full beneficial use of its \n23,040 acres because the city's watershed--over 2,400 acres--rest \nwithin Kake Tribal's lands. In order to protect the city's watershed \nand still receive beneficial use of their 23,040 acres we are proposing \nland exchange. This will assist the people of Kake, AK, as they move \ntoward a safer, cleaner, and healthier future.\n  Under this proposal, Kake Tribal would exchange the watershed for \nother acres in southeast Alaska--thereby allowing Kake to receive its \nfull entitlement under ANCSA. This legislation is of great importance \nto the residents of the community of Kake, AK.\n  This legislation will ensure protection of the Gunnuk Creek watershed \nwhich is the main water supply for the city of Kake as well as protect \ncritical habitat for the Gunnuk Creek hatchery.\n  The legislation has received wide support in Alaska from diverse \ngroups such as: the city of Kake, AK, the organized village of Kake, \nthe Kake nonprofit fishery, the Alaska Federation of Natives, and \nSealaska Corp. Additionally, the Governor of Alaska has written to me \nin support of this exchange.\n  This legislation is similar to legislation I introduced last year and \nheld hearings on in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. During \nthese hearings the Forest Service objected to the bill for four \nreasons, all of which have been addressed in the legislation I now \nintroduce.\n  The first issue was the potential selection of Berners Bay/Slate Lake \nParcel. Kake has made it clear as evident in the maps that they have no \nintention of selecting that area. Second, was the potential that Kake \nwould select established log transfer facilities. Again it is clear \nfrom the maps that these areas will not be selected. Third, was \nregarding subsurface issues with Sealaska which are not addressed in \nthis current version of the bill. And finally, the USFS objected to \nthis exchange because they did not want to manage the watershed. Since \nthe hearing the city of Kake has said they want to enter into a \ncooperative agreement with the Forest Service to manage the watershed \nthemselves.\n  Additionally, Mr. President there is a provision in this bill that \nassures Kake Tribal will receive appropriate compensation for the \nwatershed lands to be exchanged. This is important because this \nlegislation would require Kake Tribal to process any timber derived \nfrom the newly acquired lands in State, potentially reducing the value \nof lands received. Therefore, in order to provide for a fair \ncompensation, under the terms of this legislation Kake Tribal could be \neligible for additional compensation should the value of the newly \nacquired lands be deemed less than their original lands. Likewise, the \nUnited States could also benefit from this provision should a \ndetermination be made that the lands they are receiving are less \nvaluable then those they are conveying.\n  I introduce this legislation with the confidence that it is the best \ninterest of not only the citizens of Kake but with the knowledge that \nit is in the best interest of all Alaskans and Americans to protect \ndrinking water for our communities. Lastly, this legislation will help \nfulfill out commitment to the Natives of Alaska that they will be \ntreated fairly and justly under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1160. A bill to provide for educational facilities improvement; \nread the first time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9080-6", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9081-S9085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing with my colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, a bill to help local communities \nexpand schools that are overcrowded, and repair or replace schools that \nare crumbling, or obsolete.\n  As you know, the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill that we are currently \nconsidering on the floor includes $100 million for school construction \nand repair. This is an important step toward addressing what is a real \nand growing problem in this country.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Educational Facilities \nImprovement Act, provides an additional $1.9 billion over the next 5 \nyears. It represents the second installment in our efforts to upgrade \nthe school buildings America's children attend.\n  Communities can use the money to underwrite a part of the interest \ncosts on school construction projects. In so doing, they will be using \nthese dollars to leverage additional resources from other sources.\n  This is an urgent priority. All over the country, children are \nreturning to schools this month that are crowded or obsolete --even \ndangerous. Children are being taught in trailers. Some school yards \nhave so many trailers outside that you can't tell if it's a playground \nor a trailer court.\n  We need to address this problem now, not next year, not sometime in \nthe future. This is why we are using rule 14 to skip the normal \ncommittee process and bring our bill directly on the Senate calendar. \nWe hope our Republican colleagues will join the call for an early vote \non this critical issue.\n  We don't need committee hearings to know what the problem is. The \nGAO, the non-partisan Government Accounting Office, has already \ndocumented the problem. They say it will take $112 billion to bring all \nof America's schools up to par.\n  We obviously can't commit that many federal dollars. And we \nshouldn't. Public education has always been--and should remain--first \nand foremost a local responsibility.\n  But the sheer size of the problem requires that the Federal \nGovernment be a partner. We can't put America's educational house in \norder while our schools themselves are falling down. Students can't \nlearn in classrooms that\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\nare crowded and buildings that are crumbling. And most local \ncommunities can't afford to foot the whole school construction bill \nthemselves. Our bill will help communities begin to fix the most urgent \nof the problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill and summary be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND \n                   RENOVATION OF EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by repealing sections 12002 and 12003;\n       (2) by redesignating sections 12001 and 12004 through \n     12013, as sections 12101 and 12102 through 12111, \n     respectively;\n       (3) by inserting after the title heading the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 12001. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``The Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) The General Accounting Office performed a \n     comprehensive survey of the Nation's public elementary and \n     secondary school facilities, and found severe levels of \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States.\n       ``(2) The General Accounting Office concluded more than \n     14,000,000 children attend schools in need of extensive \n     repair or replacement. Seven million children attend schools \n     with life safety code violations. Twelve million children \n     attend schools with leaky roofs.\n       ``(3) The General Accounting Office found the problem of \n     crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic \n     boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of \n     rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, at least \n     one building is in need of extensive repair or should be \n     completely replaced.\n       ``(4) The condition of school facilities has a direct \n     affect on the safety of students and teachers, and on the \n     ability of students to learn.\n       ``(5) Academic research has proven a direct correlation \n     between the condition of school facilities and student \n     achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers found \n     students assigned to schools in poor condition can be \n     expected to fall 10.9 percentage points below those in \n     buildings in excellent condition. Similar studies have \n     demonstrated up to a 20 percent improvement in test scores \n     when students were moved from a poor facility to a new \n     facility.\n       ``(6) The General Accounting Office found most schools are \n     not prepared to incorporate modern technology into the \n     classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate \n     electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of \n     technology. More than a third of schools lack the requisite \n     electrical power. Fifty-six percent of schools have \n     insufficient phone lines for modems.\n       ``(7) The Department of Education reported that elementary \n     and secondary school enrollment, already at a record high \n     level, will continue to grow during the period between 1996 \n     and 2000, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 6,000 schools \n     over this time period.\n       ``(8) The General Accounting Office found it will cost \n     $112,000,000,000 just to bring schools up to good, overall \n     condition, not including the cost of modernizing schools so \n     the schools can utilize 21st century technology, nor \n     including the cost of expansion to meet record enrollment \n     levels.\n       ``(9) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       ``(10) The Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities, and can leverage additional \n     funds for the improvement of elementary and secondary school \n     facilities.\n\n     ``SEC. 12002.

For our students to learn, \n     they must be in a physical environment that is conducive to \n     learning. Unfortunately, our nation's schools are in \n     disrepair: about one third of all schools need extensive \n     repair or replacement, and about 60 percent of schools have \n     at least one major problem, such as a leaky roof or crumbling \n     walls.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The Educational Facilities Improvement Act provides $1.9 \n     billion over 5 years to pay a portion of the interest cost on \n     state and local bond issues used to finance public elementary \n     and secondary school repair, renovation, modernization, and \n     construction projects.\n       After set-asides for Indian Schools, U.S. territories, and \n     evaluations, 33 percent of the funds will be administered by \n     the Secretary of Education for competitive awards to the 100 \n     school districts with the largest numbers of poor children, \n     and 25 other districts with extraordinary needs. The \n     remaining 67 percent will be distributed to states according \n     to a formula that takes into account school-age population, \n     poverty, and other criteria. States will set up competitive \n     programs to award these funds to school districts. School \n     districts will be eligible for a subsidy of up to 50 percent \n     of the interest cost on the bonds, using a sliding scale \n     based on need.\n\n\n                         authorized activities\n\n       The new program funds may be used to:\n       Repair or upgrade classrooms or structures related to \n     academic learning, including the repair of leaking roofs, \n     crumbling walls, inadequate plumbing, poor ventilation, and \n     heating or light problems; increase physical safety; enhance \n     access for students, teachers or others with disabilities; \n     improve energy efficiency; address environmental hazards; \n     provide the basic infrastructure to facilitate educational \n     technology, such as communications outlets and closets, \n     electrical systems, and power outlets; construct new schools \n     to meet the needs imposed by growth; or conduct any other \n     related activity identified and approved by the Secretary.\n\n\n                       distribution of the funds\n\n       Of the new funds, 1.5 percent would be reserved for Indian \n     schools, and 0.5 percent would be reserved for the U.S. \n     territories to be administered at the discretion of the \n     Secretary. Not more than 0.1 percent would be set aside for \n     the Secretary to collect data, study the condition of \n     elementary and secondary schools, evaluate the program, and \n     report the findings to Congress.\n       Of the remaining funds, 33 percent would be reserved for \n     administration by the Secretary to the 100 school districts \n     with the largest numbers of poor children, as well as to 25 \n     additional districts at the discretion of the Secretary. The \n     remaining 67 percent would be reserved for administration by \n     the states to local education agencies.\n\n\n                    funds to local bond authorities\n\n       Under this program, 33 percent of the funding will be \n     administered directly by the Secretary of Education. School \n     districts will be eligible for up to a 50-percent interest \n     rate subsidy, using a sliding scale based on need. The 100 \n     school districts with the largest numbers of poor children \n     will be eligible to apply directly to the Secretary for the \n     interest-rate subsidy. Eligible districts will be the top 100 \n     with the highest levels of children ages 5 to 17 living in \n     poverty. In addition, the Secretary may designate up to 25 \n     additional districts for direct grants, based on their \n     extraordinary needs.\n       The Secretary will award grants to districts based on a \n     number of criteria, including the numbers of poor children in \n     that district, the overall age and condition of the schools \n     and their potential threat to children's health and safety, \n     the extent of overcrowding, the extent to which construction \n     would otherwise not occur, and other factors.\n\n\n                            funds to states\n\n       Of the remaining funds, 67 percent will be administered \n     directly by the states. The states must submit an application \n     to the Secretary describing the criteria the state will use \n     to award funds within the state. States can use the money to \n     subsidize local bond issues or to subsidize state bonds \n     issued on behalf of the school districts.\n       The federal government will award the funds to the states \n     based on a two-part formula. Half of the funds will be based \n     on the state's share of federal Title I funds, and half will \n     be based on the state's share of federal Title VI funds. \n     School districts that receive direct grants from the \n     Secretary will be excluded from the calculations used to \n     determine the state-by-state allocations.\n\n\n                                funding\n\n       The amendment is funded at $1.9 billion, to remain \n     available until obligated. It is paid for by restructuring \n     the foreign tax credit carryover rules passed by the Senate \n     and left on the table during conference on the tax bill \n     (Section 867 of the Senate bill). This proposal would cut the \n     current carryback period for taxpayers with unused foreign \n     tax credits from 2 years to one, while extending the \n     carryforward period from 5 to 7 years.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join the \nMinority Leader, Senator Daschle, to introduce the Education Facilities \nImprovement Act. This bill will form a partnership among the national, \nState, and local governments to rebuild and modernize our Nation's \ncrumbling schools.\n  According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, it will cost $112 \nbillion to bring existing school buildings up to code--to patch the \nleaky roofs, replace the broken windows, fix the plumbing, and make \nother needed repairs. That price tag, as enormous as it sounds, does \nnot include the cost of building new schools to accommodate the record \nnumbers of children who are crowding our schools, nor the cost of \nupgrading classrooms for modern computers.\n  Local school districts cannot afford to meet these challenges on \ntheir own. The local property tax, which made sense as a funding \nmechanism when wealth was accumulated in the form of land, no longer \nworks as a means of funding major capital investments. In urban, rural, \nand suburban schools all across the country, the magnitude of the \ncrumbling schools problem has dwarfed local financing capabilities.\n  In Chicago, Mayor Daley announced Monday that the city would issue \n800 million dollars' worth of bonds to build new schools, renovate old \nones, and modernize every school in the system. With an improved bond \nrating, Chicago has financed almost 1.5 billion dollars' worth of \nschool improvements in the last 2 years. Chicago schools, however, need \n3 billion dollars' worth of improvements.\n  The problem is not confined to big cities like Chicago. The GAO found \nthat in urban areas, 38 percent of schools are crumbling, while in \nrural areas the figure is 30 percent, and in the suburbs, it's 29 \npercent.\n  At the New Burnside Center in Tunnel Hill, IL, the track team was for \na time forced to practice at the local prison. The prison had a track. \nThe school did not. They no longer offer track at New Burnside, because \nsome parents objected to their children being sent to the prison to \npractice. The lack of an adequate tax base means too many schools in \nrural areas can barely meet the basic costs of educating children, let \nalone the costs of major capital improvements.\n  In the suburbs also, our outdated method of paying for public schools \nhas taken its toll. Principal Rita Melius, from the Abbott middle \nschool in Waukegan, a suburb north of Chicago, was here in Washington \nthis morning to discuss this issue. Children in her suburban school \nhave to cope with the same kinds of leaky roofs and crumbling walls as \ntheir innercity peers. The school has even had several fires caused \nwhen computers overloaded the ancient electrical wiring.\n  The Education Facilities Improvement Act will provide $1.9 billion \nover 5 years to help Waukegan, Chicago, New Burnside, and schools \nacross the country that simply cannot meet their facilities needs on \ntheir own. It will make the Government a partner in public education, \nwhile preserving local control of curriculum and educational content. \nThis bill recognizes that education is a public good, as well as an \nindividual benefit, and that every American benefits when we provide \neducational opportunities in environments suitable for learning.\n  Winston Churchill said, ``We shape our buildings; thereafter, they \nshape us.'' Nowhere is that more true than in our schools. You \ncertainly can't use a computer if you can't plug it into the wall, and \nwe cannot expect our children to learn in schools that are falling down \naround them.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will consider the conditions of schools \nin their States and join us in sponsoring this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

    \n\n[Pages S9087-S9088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 121--RELATIVE TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. Specter submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 121\n\n       Whereas United States law requires the Palestinian \n     Authority to exert a maximum 100-percent effort to fight \n     terrorism in order to continue to receive United States \n     foreign assistance;\n       Whereas the Palestinian Authority has failed to make that \n     100-percent maximum effort as evidenced by Chairman Yassir \n     Arafat's open embrace of Hamas leader Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi \n     on August 20, 1997;\n       Whereas a Palestinian terrorist bombed a Tel Aviv \n     restaurant on March 21, 1997, killing 3 Israelis and wounding \n     12 others;\n       Whereas 2 Hamas suicide bombers attacked a crowded outdoor \n     market in Jerusalem on July 30, 1997, killing 13 Israelis and \n     wounding over 150 others;\n       Whereas 3 Hamas suicide bombers detonated their bombs in a \n     popular pedestrian mall in Jerusalem on September 4, 1997, \n     killing 5 Israelis and wounding approximately 170 others;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Madeleine Albright conceded in \n     testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign \n     Operations on May 22, 1997 that Chairman Arafat had not given \n     a red light to stop Palestinian terrorism;\n       Whereas in fact the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \n     and the Palestinian Authority are at war with Israel;\n       Whereas the PLO has built up a police force of more than \n     30,000 men and armed it with sophisticated weapons; and\n       Whereas continued United States assistance and assistance \n     from allies of the United States will only strengthen the \n     ability of the PLO to continue terrorism and ultimately wage \n     an all-out war: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States should discontinue all \n     financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority, and the \n     United States should urge allies of the United States to do \n     the same, unless and until the Palestinian Authority \n     demonstrates a 100-percent maximum effort to curtail \n     terrorism.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the 7 minutes intervening, I will \nutilize this time to submit a resolution which I had discussed \nextensively yesterday calling for the United States to cease any \nfinancial aid to the Palestinian Authority and for the United States to \nuse its best efforts to persuade all of our allies to do the same \nthing.\n  I believe that that course of action is necessary to change our \npolicy in the Mideast, because there is no peace process. There is a \ngreat deal of talk about a peace process, but the reality, the brutal \nfact of life is that there is no peace process. But there is a war of \nterrorism, a one-sided war being waged by the Palestinians against \nIsrael.\n  The brutal fact of life, Mr. President, is that terrorism has \nreplaced open warfare as a way of gaining military advantage. The wars \nwhich have been fought against Israel, the open warfare, has been \nunsuccessful, so this practice of terrorism is being pursued. The \nfinancial aid which has come from the United States and our allies has \nbeen used to build up the Palestinian Authority in many ways, including \na 30,000-person police force, armed with highly sophisticated weapons.\n  When Prime Minister Netanyahu made the accusation, after the March 21 \nbombing of the Tel Aviv cafe, that Chairman Arafat had given a green \nlight, I sought a response from the Secretary of State. In her \ntestimony a few weeks ago before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, \nSecretary of State Albright said there had not been a green light, but \nalso there had not been a red light.\n  Mr. President, United States law requires that the Palestinian \nAuthority make the maximum effort to stop terrorism. The Palestinian \nAuthority is not a guarantor, but they have an obligation to make a \nmaximum effort to stop terrorism. And since the March 21 terrorist \nattack, we have seen the July 30 terrorist attack, we have seen the \nembrace by Chairman Arafat of the Hamas leader, the picture seen around \nthe world, comparable to the shot heard around the world, where in no \nuncertain terms Chairman Arafat is saying that he condones what Hamas \nhas done and even encourages Hamas to do more. Then, on September 4, we \nhad the most recent terrorist attack.\n  These three terrorist attacks in the course of the past 6 months have \nkilled 21 Israelis and wounded 330 other Israelis. So where is the \npeace process? There is none. The emperor has no clothes. It is time we \nrecognized that fact.\n  We have had, in addition, a report from an Israeli cabinet officer, \nDeputy Education Minister Moshe Peled, that Chairman Arafat knew in \nadvance of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that it was going to \noccur. If that is in fact true, Chairman Arafat is an accessory before \nthe fact, and that is a form of conspiracy and, under our statutes, \nsubject to trial in a United States court.\n  When I saw that charge I asked the Department of Justice to \ninvestigate. And we do have information that Mr. Peled was questioned \nby the FBI for some 2 hours but we do not know the results of that \ninquiry.\n  I have discussed with the distinguished majority leader the issue \nabout the necessity for bringing this matter to a head to provide some \nleadership on foreign policy where our Senate has the standing to do \nso.\n  You just heard a lengthy distinguished speech by Senator Biden, the \nranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. The leadership has \nbeen taken by Senator Helms and others, and we have constitutional \nauthority to act.\n  Where the administration continues to supply funds to the Palestinian \nAuthority, and those funds directly and indirectly go to build up the \nPalestinian Army, that is a practice which should be stopped.\n  The administration had further talked about going to final settlement \ndiscussions between Israel and the Palestinians. Of course, that is a \nmatter for the Israelis and the Palestinians to decide. But, I believe \nthat it is an unwise policy for the United States to push that approach \nbecause the principles of the Camp David accord and the Oslo accord \nwere to build up confidence, to have relationships which would build up \nand lead to final status negotiations when there was a basis for the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians living side by side. Regrettably, that is \nnot possible.\n\n  We have repeated statements by Chairman Arafat and others of a \nbelligerent nature spewing hatred. We have hatred being talked about in \nthe schools. We have an atmosphere which hardly is conducive to final \nnegotiation status. There had been talk after the Oslo accord of \ndeferring the issue of a Palestinian State. The concern had been that \nthere would be a Trojan horse, a secret Palestinian State inside of \nIsrael.\n  Well, that has not happened. It has not been secret. It has been \nopen. You have a 30,000-person police force, military operation with \nsophisticated weapons. You have the chief of police who has been \ncharged by the Israeli authorities with being involved in terrorist \nattacks and information from the United States.\n  I spoke at some length about this yesterday, Mr. President. My \ncomments are necessarily abbreviated today because there has only been \na period of 7 minutes from the time I started until the 5 o'clock vote \nwhich is due to start soon.\n  Today, I talked to our distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee about hearings on this subject, as I had discussed \nwith Senator Lott. I believe that when Secretary of State Albright \nreturns from the Mideast, it would be a good opportunity to hear from \nher about administration policy and to hear from the Attorney General \nand the FBI Director about what is happening with the investigation as \nto Chairman Arafat's possible complicity in the World Trade Center \nbombing.\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\n  So I file the resolution, Mr. President. We are in the process of \ngetting cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9087-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nTHE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 1126\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1078 proposed by \nMr. Durbin in the bill (S. 1061) making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nrelated agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following: ``Nothing \n     in this Act may be construed to interfere with, or abrogate, \n     any agreement previously entered into between any state and \n     any private attorney or attorneys with respect to litigation \n     involving tobacco.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DURBIN AMENDMENT NO. 1127\n\n  Mr. DURBIN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1078 proposed by \nhim to the bill, S. 1061, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   .

Mr. President, I rise today in sadness at the \ngreat crisis which threatens to end the Oslo Peace Process in the \nMiddle East. The crisis, as we know, has been caused by the most recent \ncowardly and criminal acts of those who are enemies of not only the \npeace process but of the Israeli and Palestinian people themselves.\n  My hope is that a solution to the crisis may be found through the \ningenuity, faith, and the actions of those who have the courage to rise \nabove hatred and suspicion. It is for that reason and in that spirit \nthat I wish to express my strongest support for the mission of \nSecretary of State Albright to the Middle East this week.\n  The recent bombings in Jerusalem were detestable acts of terrorism \nwhich had only one purpose--killing the peace process. Both Israelis \nand Palestinians alike will be the victims if the criminals succeed.\n  Secretary Albright's mission is nothing less than an attempt to save \nthe peace process. But the peace process can recover and move forward \nonly in a secure environment, and the Secretary has properly identified \nsecurity as the primary and essential focus of her trip. This, I must \nemphasize, must be transparently as important to the Palestinian \nAuthority as it is to the Government of Israel. Those that have planned \nand carried out these acts of terrorism against Israel have at the same \ntime weakened the Palestinian Authority.\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\n  Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must address this \nproblem at its root and without equivocation. The coordination of \nsecurity efforts is not and cannot be a bargaining chip to be turned on \nor off at will. There can be no tolerance for the perpetrators of \nviolence--those who plan, finance, supply, or abet terrorism must be \narrested, prosecuted, and imprisoned. No exceptions and no revolving \ndoors.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated that there can be no peace \nwithout security. This is a commitment we share, and a commitment that \nmust be evidenced by the Palestinian Authority beyond question through \nits own unilateral actions. At the same time, and as noted by Secretary \nAlbright, we do not ask the impossible and, against suicide terrorists, \ncannot expect 100-percent success. There must, however, be nothing \nother than a 100-percent effort in this regard by the leadership of the \nPalestinian Authority.\n  With this security perspective as the foundation, there must also be \na political environment that makes it possible to rebuild the trust \nthat has been a victim of the violence and move ahead to achieve a \npeace for all. Prime Minister Netanyahu has expressed his commitment to \n``a peace that will surprise the world.'' We must encourage all parties \nto embrace such a commitment, and I fully support the Secretary in her \nefforts to that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9088-6", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MAKING BOB HOPE AN HONORARY VETERAN\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in praising a \nman who has contributed more to the morale and well being of American \nfighting men and women than anyone else in the 20th century. In every \nconflict where our forces have gone to uphold freedom or to deter \naggression Bob Hope has traveled with them. As president of the USO, I \nworked closely with Bob Hope on many trips to visit our troops around \nthe world. As a combat veteran of the war in Vietnam, I know personally \nhow much he improved the lives of young Americans in Southeast Asia. \nThe places where he entertained the troops were often dangerous areas \nwhere the enemy had the opportunity to attack. Bob Hope went there \nanyway, because he knew what he was doing was important to those \nordinary soldiers. He may have been in danger, but our military \npersonnel were in even greater danger. Invariably Bob Hope made the \ntrip to these far off places during the holiday season when he could \nhave been at home with his family, but he knew the feeling of isolation \nand loneliness that all soldiers feel when they are far away from their \nfamilies around the holiday season.\n  Bob Hope has received numerous awards in his life, including the \nMedal of Freedom, and the Distinguished Service Medal, but I can think \nof no finer, no more appropriate award than that of veteran. Certainly \nif anyone in America can be said to have served, and served with \ndistinction, it is Bob Hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9089-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC RECEIVES LABOR SECRETARY'S OPPORTUNITY 2000 \n                                 AWARD\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Through its efforts, the recipient of this \naward must have enhanced equal employment opportunities for minorities, \nwomen, individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans, or \nveterans of the Vietnam era. It also must have addressed such issues as \nthe glass ceiling, skills gap, and multicultural workforce.\n  I am pleased to say, Mr. President, that for the second time in 8 \nyears, the Opportunity 2000 Award is presented to the Pacific Gas and \nElectric Co.\n  PG takes an active role in ensuring that its employees represent \nCalifornia's diversity. Its various programs, including the executive \ndevelopment program and women in trades forum, focus attention on women \nand minorities. Its management works closely with numerous employee \nassociations which represent its diversity, such as the Hispanic \nEmployees Association, the Black Employees Association, and ACCESS, an \nassociation of employees with disabilities.\n  PG has also adopted community based programs to aid the development \nof the diverse communities it serves. These programs include corporate \ncontribution programs and welfare-to-work demonstration projects which \naid in providing job training and employment to welfare recipients.\n  I applaud PG's continued commitment to the goals of equal \nemployment opportunity for people of all backgrounds.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the South Dakotans associated with the Freeman \nwastewater treatment plant. The Freeman facility earned a first-place \nexcellence award in a six-State region from the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Freeman earned an exceptional rating for its plant septage \nmanagement, toxic waste control, collection system maintenance, \nfinancial management, automation, and staff training. In addition, a \ntelevision-based snaking system was used to pinpoint areas in need of \nrepair. The plant staff and town council should be commended for their \nforesight in planning ahead and making repairs on the city's wastewater \nsystem rather than waiting for an emergency. The efforts of these \nindividuals saves the residents of Freeman thousands of dollars in \ncostly future repairs and insures the health and viability of the \ncity's wastewater system.\n  While all the residents of Freeman should take pride in this \naccomplishment, I would like to mention a few individuals including \nVince Kribell, chief operator of the Freeman plant, and Duane Walter. \nAdministrative personnel include Chester Sorensen, Dean Sikkink, Steve \nWaltner, and Michael Schultz, who is also mayor of Freeman.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency started the Operations and \nMaintenance Award in 1986 to recognize publicly owned watewater \ntreatment facilities that demonstrate excellence in their overall \noperation. The program also heightens public awareness about the \nimportance of efficient wastewater treatment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9089-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9089-S9090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF THE WEBSTER HOSE HOOK AND LADDER CO.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the \nWebster Hose Volunteer Fire Co., which is celebrating 100 years of \nloyal service to the city of Ansonia, CT.\n  Anyone familiar with the early days of the Webster Hose Co. can truly \nappreciate how much this unit has evolved during the past century. The \nWebster Co. started 100 years ago when 20 courageous individuals were \nauthorized by the board of aldermen to undertake all fire-fighting \nduties for the city of Ansonia. This fledgling fire department was \nnamed the Webster Hose Co., in honor of Ansonia's mayor Erwin W. \nWebster, and in 1903 the name was changed to the Webster Hose Hook & \nLadder Co.\n  The number of firefighters quickly grew to 50, and these volunteers \novercame many obstacles in order to serve the people of Ansonia. \nPerhaps their biggest handicap was the rudimentary firefighting \nequipment that was available to them. Their primary firefighting device \nwas a 550-pound hand-drawn cart, equipped with a large hose. Manually \ntransporting this cart through Ansonia's hilly terrain was difficult to \nsay the least, and many early members of the Webster Co. suffered \nbroken arms and legs as they miscalculated the number of people \nnecessary to slow the vehicle down, or the direction it would take on a \nhill. To say that these early members had to go above and beyond the \ncall of duty in performing their jobs would be a tremendous \nunderstatement.\n  But thanks to the extraordinary efforts of these founding members and\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\nother members of the Webster Hose Co., this unit has survived and \nevolved into a modern fire department that is highly trained to save \nthe lives and property of the people of Ansonia.\n  In celebration of their centennial birthday, the Webster Hose Co. has \nbeen chosen to host the 114th Connecticut State Fireman's Convention. \nThis convention will culminate in a parade of hundreds of firefighters \nthrough downtown Ansonia on Sunday, September 14, 1997. I am honored to \nhave the opportunity to walk in this parade, and I hope that the day's \nactivities will serve as a fitting tribute to not only Ansonia's \nfirefighters, but to all the men and women of Connecticut who risk \ntheir own personal safety as they confront danger to safeguard the \nwell-being of others.\n  The men and women of the Webster Hose Co. exemplify the highest \nstandard of community service. They also serve as role models for their \nlong-standing commitment to their community. Some of the current \nWebster members are the direct descendants of the fire service's \nfounding fathers, and it is refreshing to see this spirit of public \nservice passed on from one generation to the next. Without these \ndedicated individuals, the city of Ansonia would be at a tremendous \nloss.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to commend the Webster Hose Co. for a \ncentury of outstanding service, and I wish them well as they continue \nto serve their community in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9089-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM POWELL\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today full of sadness. \nMr. William Powell of Bella Vista, AR, has recently passed away.\n  I came to know Mr. Powell as 1 of the 82 American airmen that were \nheld prisoner of war at the Buchenwald concentration camp during World \nWar II. During my tenure in Congress, I have introduced two resolutions \nthat would have given appropriate and well-deserved recognition to this \ngroup of World War II prisoners.\n  These brave airmen were different from other allied prisoners, \nbecause they were held at Buchenwald--a Nazi concentration camp--and \ntherefore not subject to the protections of the Geneva Convention.\n  Tragically, Mr. President, the United States has never formally \nrecognized the service, sacrifice, and bravery of these American airmen \nwhile they were held as political prisoners. Even more tragically, the \nUnited States and this Congress will never have the opportunity to \nexpress our admiration to Mr. Powell.\n  When I introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 32 in this Congress, \non Thursday, June 12, I contacted Mr. Powell. He responded by saying, \nand I quote:\n\n       The recognition is long overdue. For decades, the \n     Department of Defense and the International Red Cross have \n     stated that there were no military personnel in Buchenwald. \n     Yet as someone who was imprisoned there for 4 months, I know \n     of at least 55 other American soldiers who endured the \n     hardships of this camp. Two men even lost their lives there. \n     And nearly all suffered diseases later in life because of the \n     treatment they received while in Buchenwald.\n       In the late 70s, early 80s, I joined with the other \n     survivors of Buchenwald to push this government to recognize \n     our service. We never wanted any money, we just wanted the \n     United States Government to say, ``Yes you were there, and we \n     appreciate what you went through.''\n\n  Mr. William Powell was a good man, a true patriot, and while this \nresolution that I spoke of earlier, Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nhas yet to pass this body, I urge my colleagues to join with me in \npassing it, in honor of Mr. William Powell.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9090-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE HONORABLE CANDICE MILLER--THE MARCH OF DIMES' 1997 ALEXANDER MACOMB \n                          CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the Refugee Assistance Act. The act authorizes assistance \nto refugees through grants to private non-profit associations, as well \nas public associations, to be used to provide services such as job \ntraining, educational programs, and English language classes to newly \narrived refugees. These programs play an important role in the American \ntradition of opening new doors to those from around the world who have \nbeen subjected to persecutions of all kinds.\n  I would note that under the act, the Department of Health and Human \nServices is free to experiment with innovative ways to help refugees \nbecome self-sufficient in America. For example, the program currently \nmakes some use of private nonprofit groups in rendering assistance to \nrefugees, and I would encourage the Department of Health and Human \nServices to expand those uses more broadly. Such experimentation has \ngreat potential to help the program accomplish its purpose to help \nrefugees make a new life for themselves, rather than becoming dependent \non the Government. My understanding is that the Department of Health \nand Human Services is also committed to experiments along these lines, \nand I look forward to working with the administration and the nonprofit \ncommunity involved with refugees to make this program even more \neffective in the next few years.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Abraham and I have introduced a \n2-year extension of the Refugee Act. The Refugee Act is the core of \nU.S. refugee policy. It sets the criteria under which persons can be \ndesignated as refugees, and provides funds for refugee resettlement. \nLast year, the United States admitted more than 75,000 refugees under \nthe Refugee Act's criteria.\n  In addition to determining whom is considered a refugee, the Refugee \nAct allows the Department of Health and Human Services, through the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement [ORR], to provide services to refugees \nresettled in the United States. For example, ORR provides job training \nand employment assistance to new refugees to help them become \neconomically self-sufficient. ORR helps States provide English language \nclasses, preventive health services, and cash assistance to new \nrefugees to help them get on their feet in their new country. Refugees \noften arrive in the United States terrified, jet-lagged, and with few \npossessions. Most fled persecution in their home countries, and left \ntheir clothes and possessions behind. These programs make a refugee's \nassimilation into the United States a little easier.\n  In addition to providing assistance directly to refugees, the Refugee \nAct provides funds to the Public Health Service to provide overseas \nmedical screening for United States-bound refugees for the protection \nof public health against contagious diseases. ORR also provides \ntargeted assistance to States and counties with large refugee \npopulations, and runs matching grant programs for voluntary agencies \nthat assist States in refugee resettlement. For example, The Boston \nTech Center in Middlesex County, MA received $250,000 in discretionary \ntargeted assistance to teach refugees short-term skills training, basic \nEnglish and math. The International Rescue Committee in Boston received \nfunds under the Refugee Act to provide a refugee youth program for \nnewly arrived Somali children.\n  Mr. President, the Refugee Act is the heart of our refugee law and \npolicy. If it is not reauthorized, the United States will send a signal \nworldwide that refugees are no longer welcome here. We cannot let that \nhappen. I am grateful to my colleagues for supporting this bill.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I have introduced this amendment to H.R. \n1420, the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator Graham. This bill \nrecently passed the House by the remarkable vote of 407 to 1.\n  Last week, I, along with Senators Kempthorne and Graham, introduced \nS. 1059 as a companion bill, and on July 30, the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works held a hearing to solicit views on this \nbill from the Secretary of the Interior, among others. The hearing was \nvery productive, and reaffirmed the widespread support that exists for \nthis legislation. The amendment that I am offering includes narrow, but \nimportant, changes to the House version that clarify several \nprovisions, and that have been agreed to by the administration, the \nHouse Resources Committee, and the stakeholders involved in the earlier \nnegotiations.\n  This legislation is long overdue and very much needed. The National \nWildlife Refuge System was started in 1903 by President Theodore \nRoosevelt, with the establishment of the first refuge on Pelican Island \nin Florida. It has since evolved into a system of Federal lands \nconsisting of 509 refuges in 50 States, covering 92 million acres, for \nthe conservation of fish, wildlife, and plants. Despite 60 years of \ngrowth, however the refuge system remained without a law governing its \nadministration until 1966, when Congress passed the National Wildlife \nRefuge System Administration Act. Even now, almost a century later, \nthere is no law that identifies a mission or articulates guidance for \nrefuge management.\n  For several years, both sides of the aisle and both sides of the \nCapitol have attempted to enact legislation to rectify this situation. \nThe President has also taken administrative steps for improving refuge \nmanagement with an Executive order issued in March 1996. Earlier this \nyear, after a month of negotiations among a broad range of \nstakeholders, the House passed H.R. 1420, which was then referred to \nthe Senate.\n  After discussions here in the Senate, we have this amendment that \nmakes narrow but important changes to H.R. 1420, and that clarifies the \nintent expressed by the House in the report of the Committee on \nResources and in deliberation on the floor. The first two provisions of \nthe amendment were\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\nchanges included in S. 1059. This amendment clarifies that compatible \nuses can be both wildlife-dependent and other uses. The allowance of \ncompatible uses has become the cornerstone of the refuge system, \nbalancing the needs of the fish, wildlife, and plants for which the \nrefuge was established, with our own ability to use and enjoy the \nrefuge for a wide range of activities. Two points should be emphasized, \nhowever. First, while this legislation establishes that wildlife-\ndependent recreational uses are to be given priority, any use may be \nauthorized by the refuge manager provided that it is compatible with \nboth the mission of the system and the purpose of the refuge. These are \ntwo separate principles contained in the bill. Second, that all uses \nare required to be compatible in order to be allowed does not mean that \nall compatible uses are required to be allowed. The longstanding policy \nof the Fish and Wildlife Service that a refuge is ``closed until open'' \nis not altered by this legislation, although wildlife-dependent uses \nmay be approved on an interim basis pending completion of the \nconservation plan for any land added to the system after March 25, \n1996.\n\n  The amendment requires that the Secretary provide for monitoring of \nthe status and trends of fish, wildlife, and plants on refuges. While \nthis provision seems somewhat obvious, monitoring is often one of the \nfirst casualties of budgetary constraints. In addition, given some of \nthe past problems with secondary uses on refuges, monitoring will be \nvery important in measuring the success of the recent administrative \nand legislative changes that we are now undertaking. Lastly, monitoring \nwill ensure that our scientific knowledge regarding wildlife and \nnatural resources continues to grow.\n  The amendment clarifies the legislative intent regarding the periodic \nreevaluation on longterm secondary uses, such as electric utility \nrights-of-way. The bill requires that nonwildife dependent uses be \nreevaluated no less than every 10 years. Some rights-of-way are \nauthorized for longer periods of time, and concern has been expressed \nthat this reevaluation, together with the requirement that incompatible \nuses be eliminated or modified, may threaten the very existence of the \nrights-of-way. For uses that are authorized for periods of longer than \n10 years, this amendment limits the review to compliance with the terms \nand conditions under which the authorization is made, and not to the \nauthorization itself.\n  Numerous individuals in both the Senate and the House, as well as in \nthe administration, deserve praise for their persevering efforts over \nthe years in seeking to improve the refuge system, and for their \ninvolvement on this bill. On the Senate side, I would like to thank \nSenators Kempthorne and Graham for their support on this amendment. I \nwould also like to thank Senators Murkowski and Allard for their \nunderstanding on issues relating to rights-of-way and water rights on \nwhich they have expressed concern.\n  With this amendment, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. \n1420.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recommend to the \nSenate passage of the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act \nwith a Kempthorne-Graham amendment. The passage of this bill represents \na victory for many who are concerned with the hundreds of wildlife \nrefuges across the United States and the multiple uses that they \nsupport.\n  The bill, which was negotiated between Chairman Don Young of the \nNatural Resources Committee and Secretary of the Interior Bruce \nBabbitt, is another example of how positive change for the benefit of \nour environment can be achieved when we make a sincere effort to work \ntogether to reach consensus.\n  The original House bill, H.R. 1420, came to the Senate after an \noverwhelming vote in the House. The bill was referred, in the normal \ncourse, to my subcommittee in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Now, there are some who wanted me to just let the House bill \ngo without further review in the Senate. But if I have learned anything \nfrom Senator Byrd over the years, I have learned that I would be \nignoring the responsibility and indeed constitutional duty of the \nSenate if I simply signed off on such important legislation without \nconsidering it carefully.\n  The time that we spent to review the House bill was well worth it. We \ndiscovered an internal ambiguity in the bill which could have been \ntaken advantage of by those who might want to eliminate many legitimate \nuses of wildlife refuges. My concern was that the bill's exclusive \nfocus on so-called wildlife-dependent activities might be interpreted \ndown the road as a signal that Congress intended only for these kinds \nof activities to qualify as potentially compatible activities on \nFederal wildlife refuges and that the many other uses of refuges that \ncan now be authorized if they are compatible with the purposes of a \nrefuge would be left out.\n  That would indeed be a significant problem. Under the law now, our \nnational wildlife refuges support many uses, including wildlife-\ndependent uses such as hunting and fishing, but also important \nnonwildlife-dependent uses, like grazing, oil and gas production, \nelectricity transmission, and even family picnics and weddings.\n  Under the House bill, any one of these activities arguably could have \nbeen eliminated on Federal refuges simply because they are not \nwildlife-dependent activities.\n  In my home State of Idaho, for example, ranchers who were once \npromised that they would retain the right to graze their cattle on the \nGray's Lake Refuge might have lost that right because an individual \nrefuge manager, already hostile to grazing, interpreted the House \nlanguage to preclude grazing as a compatible use. This is an important \nissue for my State because grazing occurs in four of the six Idaho \nrefuges.\n  On the Mississippi Sandhill Crane Refuge, grazing could have been \ncurtailed even though the refuge manager there recognizes the value of \ngrazing to improve the habitat for the crane.\n  This amendment will ensure that livestock grazing can continue to be \nconsidered to be a compatible use on a wildlife refuge.\n  But this amendment was not intended to address only grazing. Other \nlegitimate and compatible uses on wildlife refuges could have been \naffected. Important activities associated with oil and gas development \nand the transmission of electricity to our homes and businesses could \nhave been curtailed and even eliminated. From the 300 oil and gas wells \nat the Upper Ouachita Wildlife Refuge to the three wells in the \nKirtland Warbler Management Area, all could have been shut down if this \nambiguity had been exploited. With my amendment, all of these \nactivities will be allowed to continue, provided that they are \ncompatible with the purposes of the refuge.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two lists of \nwildlife refuges that currently support grazing and oil and gas \nproduction. All of these activities, as well as other legitimate and \ncompatible uses, could have been eliminated had we not addressed this \nambiguity in this amendment. These lists include wildlife refuges in 35 \nStates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGES PERMITTING GRAZING              \n                           [As of July, 1995]                           \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1  CA..............................

Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I do not \nbelieve it was the intention of the parties who negotiated this \nagreement to eliminate nonrecreational uses on wildlife refuges. But I \ndo believe that we have eliminated a potential legal argument for any \nwho might try to use the ambiguity to curtail nonwildlife-dependent \nuses on refuges.\n  As amended, I will support this bill. For the first time, it will \nestablish hunting and fishing as priority uses of wildlife refuges and \nwill ensure that other legitimate and compatible uses can continue in \nthe future. Of particular interest and importance to me, to Idaho, and \nto other Western States, is the provision in the bill that provides, \n``Nothing in this act shall create a reserved water right, express or \nimplied, in the United States for any purpose.'' I strongly support \nthis provision now, as I have in the past.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill and the Kempthorne-Graham amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to \ndiscuss the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997. It \nis a long overdue organic act for our magnificent refuge system. In \n1991 and again in 1993, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Fish and \nWildlife, I introduced the National Wildlife Refuge System Management \nand Policy Act--legislation which was very similar to that which is \nbefore us today.\n  My aims then were straightforward. First, to clarify that the purpose \nof the National Wildlife Refuge System is to conserve our Nation's \ndiversity of fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats. Second, to \nimprove the process used to determine which public uses shall be \nallowed on the refuges. Third, to require the development of \ncomprehensive conservation plans for each of the refuges and ensure \nthat the public has ample opportunity to participate in the planning \nprocess as it does in planning for our national parks and national \nforests. Fourth, to lay out clear affirmative duties for the Secretary \nof the Interior to protect the integrity and plan for the appropriate \nexpansion of the Refuge System.\n  My bill had the strong support of conservation groups like the \nWilderness Society, the National Audubon Society, Defenders of \nWildlife, and the Sierra Club. Thanks to Senators Chafee, Kempthorne, \nand Baucus, my bill also enjoyed the support of the International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies along with a variety of \nsportsmen's groups. The Environment and Public Works Committee reported \nthat bill in the 103d Congress but unfortunately we were not able to \nbring the bill to the Senate floor because a number of procedural holds \nwere placed on the bill.\n  In the last Congress, the House introduced and passed a radically \ndifferent bill that would have harmed our Refuge System. President \nClinton indicated that he would veto the House bill but fortunately, it \nwas not acted upon by the Senate.\n  The bill before us today is not identical to the bill I introduced in \nprior years. It is not exactly how I would have drafted it, but I am \nvery pleased that it addresses the four major areas that I outlined \nabove: a mission statement for the system, a formal process to assess \nthe compatibility of refuge activities, a planning requirement, and \nduties for the Interior Secretary.\n  Of course, even with passage of this bill, the Refuge System will \nonly meet its potential to conserve the Nation's fish and wildlife if \nthe Congress appropriates the funds necessary for its proper \nmanagement. I am pleased that the House has approved a healthy increase \nfor this purpose in its fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill \nand will work to ensure that the Senate does as well. Senator \nKempthorne and I and 18 of our colleagues have written to the \nAppropriations Committee to urge such funding.\n\n\n              theodore roosevelt's endangered species act\n\n  Ninety-four years ago, President Theodore Roosevelt established the \nfirst national wildlife refuge at Pelican Island in my State of \nFlorida. This bold move protected the last remaining nesting colony of \nbrown pelicans on the\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\nAtlantic seaboard. But as critical as this action was for the pelicans, \nit had much broader importance for the Nation's wildlife because it \nbegan our only system of national lands dedicated to wildlife \nconservation.\n  Before leaving office, Roosevelt went on to establish more than 50 \nsuch sanctuaries. Herons, egrets, pelicans, and other shorebirds, along \nwith all manner of waterfowl found sanctuary on Roosevelt's refuges. \nLarge mammals including bison, elk, and antelope were also protected. \nIn this sense, the refuge was Roosevelt's Endangered Species Act.\n  Refuges continue to be created to meet the most pressing wildlife \nconservation challenges of the day. Refuges have been established for \nendangered fish, birds, mammals, reptiles, frogs, bats, and \nbutterflies. In my State we even have the new Lake Wales Ridge Refuge \nestablished for endangered plants. And while we have many refuges to \nprotect endangered species, we know that many other species would be \nheaded for the endangered species list were it not for the protections \nafforded by the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n  Today the Refuge System includes more than 500 refuges and 92 million \nacres which makes it larger than the National Parks System. Yet in the \nlower 48 States, the Refuge System amounts to less than 4 percent of \nthe Federal public lands and less than 1 percent of the total land area \nof those States.\n  In Florida we have 25 refuges encompassing more than 1 million acres \nof land and water. These include refuges to protect our manatees, \nFlorida panthers, sea turtles, Key deer, crocodiles, and those \nendangered plants.\n\n\n              public support and use of the Refuge System\n\n  Our Refuge System has been strongly supported by bird watchers, \nhunters, and anglers throughout its history--even though there was very \nlittle recreation permitted for much of the system's history. For \nexample, hunting was a rarity on refuges until 1949, but hunters and \nsportsmen's organizations were strong supporters of the system even in \nthose early years because they realized that without protected \nhabitats, there could be no wildlife.\n  Today, the Refuge System provides ample opportunities for fish and \nwildlife related recreation including wildlife observation, nature \nphotography, and hunting and fishing, as well as environmental \neducation. But these public uses are clearly secondary to the long-\nstanding primary purposes of the Refuge System to conserve fish and \nwildlife and habitats. S. 1059 continues this clear distinction between \nthe purpose of the Refuge system to conserve fish and wildlife, and the \npriority uses of the system which are those related to learning about \nor enjoying fish and wildlife.\n\n\n                         problems in the system\n\n  Unfortunately, public use has not always been carried out in a manner \nthat is consistent with the well-being of our refuges and their \nwildlife. A 1989 study by the General Accounting Office found that \nsecondary activities considered by refuge managers to be harmful to \nwildlife resources were occurring on nearly 60 percent on our refuges. \nPower boating, mining, military air exercises, off-road vehicles, and \nair boating were cited as the most frequent harmful uses. Oil and gas \ndrilling, timbering, grazing, farming, commercial fishing, and even \nwildlife related recreation such as hunting, trapping, and wildlife \nobservation in some instances were also found to harm wildlife or \nhabitat. A 1991 study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed \nthe GAO's findings. The Service found that harmful activities were \npresent at 63 percent of the refuges.\n  At one time, for example, the Key West National Wildlife Refuge \nharbored the only known breeding colony of frigatebirds in the United \nStates. The Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge, also in the \nFlorida Keys, hosted numerous colonies of wading birds. But increased \nactivity within the refuges by jet skiers, power boaters, water skiers, \ncampers, and others was the most likely reason that the frigatebirds \nabandoned the refuge rookery and the chief culprit behind the fact that \nother birds have showed signs of declining breeding success.\n  Refuge managers, despite their best efforts, have often been \nsusceptible to outside pressure to allow these damaging activities \nbecause the laws governing the Refuge System are not completely clear. \nFurthermore, decisions about which activities were compatible with \nwildlife conservation purposes have often been made without adequate \npublic input or written records. The problem had been compounded in \npast years by lack of periodic reevaluations of uses.\n\n\n            action to restore integrity to the refuge system\n\n  Fortunately, the Clinton administration has taken a number of steps \nto resolve many of the problems in the National Wildlife Refuge System. \nI like to believe that the interest and oversight that we provided in a \nbipartisan fashion in the 102d and 103d Congresses set the stage for \nthese improvements.\n  A number of harmful economic, recreational, and even military \nactivities have been eliminated or appropriately reduced. In Florida, \nfor example, action has been taken by the Fish and Wildlife Service to \nreduce the number of people allowed to scuba dive alongside manatees in \nthe Crystal River refuge that was established to protect the manatee. \nLikewise, the Service has taken action to reduce public use at the \nEgmont Key National Wildlife Refuge. And a back-country plan has been \nimplemented in the Florida Keys to greatly reduce conflicts between \npeople and wildlife.\n  President Clinton has also issued an Executive order on the \nmanagement of the Refuge System that specifies that the mission of the \nrefuges is to preserve a national network of lands and waters to \nconserve our wildlife diversity. The Executive order also appropriately \nensures that recreational pursuits that are related to fish and \nwildlife will take priority over other activities not so related.\n  Now, as in the past, I am gratified to be part of the process of \nupdating the laws that govern our magnificent National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem. It is my sincerest hope that this new law will improve the \nRefuge System for the benefit of our Nation's fish and wildlife and for \ngenerations of Americans to come.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I understand that the Senator from Alaska has raised some \nconcerns regarding the requirement to periodically reevaluate existing \nsecondary uses to ensure that they remain compatible within the meaning \nof the law. I would like to ensure that the Senator's concerns have \nbeen fully addressed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to thank the Senator from Rhode Island, \nand obtain his understanding regarding how the periodic reevaluation \nwill affect those secondary uses that are authorized for less than 10 \nyears.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. As a preliminary matter, numerous rights-of-way have been \napproved in the past as compatible uses in various refuges, and this \nlegislation does not alter the basis under which those activities may \nbe approved in the future. With respect to the periodic reviews, the \nreevaluation of existing uses is required ``when conditions under which \nthe use is permitted change significantly or when there is significant \nnew information regarding the effects of the use, but not less \nfrequently than once every 10 years.'' For uses that are authorized for \nperiods of less than 10 years, it is my understanding that the Fish and \nWildlife Service will, under normal and usual circumstances, review the \nuse at the time of the reauthorization of the activity. The only \nexception to this would be in situations in which significant new \ninformation is developed regarding the effects of the use, or \nconditions under which the use change significantly.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to obtain his understanding regarding how \nthe periodic reevaluation will affect those secondary uses that are \nauthorized for longer than 10 years.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. For uses that are authorized for periods of longer than \n10 years, the amendment that we have introduced explicitly limits the \nreview to compliance with the terms and conditions under which the \nauthorization is made, and not to the authorization itself. During \ndeliberation of H.R. 1420 by the House, Representatives Young and \nSaxton entered into a colloquy on this issue. Our amendment codifies \nthe understanding reached in that colloquy.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I understand that the Fish and Wildlife Service has \nbeen consulted on these two issues, and that they have concurred with \nyour explanation.\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is correct. With respect to long-term secondary \nuses, the amendment has met with the approval of the Department of the \nInterior, as stated by Secretary Babbitt at a hearing on S. 1059 before \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee on July 30. With respect to \nshort-term uses, the Service has also agreed with my understanding.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for 3 long years, the House Resources \nCommittee has worked with the Department of the Interior to craft a \nstatute that redefines and redirects the mission of the wildlife refuge \nprogram. After holding a total of eight hearings and countless \nlegislative meetings with the administration, the House Resources \nCommittee introduced and reported H.R. 1420. Thanks to the dedicated \nsupport of Chairman Young and Secretary Babbitt, this bill \noverwhelmingly passed the House by a vote of 407 to 1 on June 3, 1997.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of the Senate's unanimous approval of this \nhistoric legislation. It proves that successful environmental policy \ncan be crafted in a bipartisan manner.\n  This legislation was endorsed by a coalition of diverse interests. It \nis rare to find an issue that captures the attention and collective \neffort of industry, sportsmen, and conservationists. These groups, \nranging from the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America and the National \nRifle Association to the Safari Club and the Audubon Society, have \nshown good faith in their efforts. I appreciate their perseverance and \ncooperation in finding a consensus for the public policy governing \nAmerica's refuge system.\n  In order to ensure that the bill would be considered and passed with \nas few changes as possible, it was held at the desk for consideration. \nSome may claim that this was an unusual parliamentary procedure, but I \ncontend that this is an unusual bill. I was protecting the balance \nreached within the House-passed legislation in order to ensure a swift \nresolution of the legislative process. Senators' concerns and the \njurisdictions of the committee process were respected and preserved.\n  Mr. President, the result of these unusual proceedings is an \noutstanding product. Americans for generations to come will appreciate \nthe wisdom and equity of this clear multiuse mission for our refuge \nsystem.\n  As Mississippians go to the Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge, some \nwill be there to hunt, some to enjoy the tremendous beauty of their \nsurroundings, and others to appreciate the effort to preserve our \nnatural heritage. All is possible because of H.R. 1420. \nMississippians--and their many diverse interests--will be given the \nright to coexist within the refuge.\n  H.R. 1420 will refocus the mission of the refuge system. It \nrecognizes that hunting and fishing are important and legitimate \nactivities on these public lands. Common ground was found--and it is \nhigh ground indeed.\n  Again, I want to personally applaud Chairman Young and \nRepresentatives Dingell and Miller for their dedication to this \nlegislative initiative. With the assistance of Secretary Babbitt, they \nhave forged a new path for a refuge system with a clear multiuse \nmission. I thank my Senate colleagues for their participation and \nendorsement of this legislative proposal.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill read the third time, and passed, as amended, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1129) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1420), as amended, was read the third time, and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/10/senate-section/article/S9092-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1160\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
