Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nonce again thank everyone who has worked so hard to bring S. 4, the \nFamily Friendly Workplace Act, to the floor. In particular, I would \nlike to recognize the efforts and hard work of Senator Mike DeWine, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, and Senator \nJohn Ashcroft, the author and original sponsor of the bill. I am \nespecially gratified to be working with Senators Ashcroft and DeWine on \nthis important bill.\n  We are here today because we share the belief that S. 4 could make a \nworld of difference in the lives of millions of Americans. During the \nmarkup of S. 4, a number of issues were brought to the committee's \nattention by my esteemed colleagues in the minority. At that\n\n[[Page S4335]]\n\ntime, Senator DeWine and I committed to look into several of the issues \nthat were raised and to resolve them to the extent practicable. In the \ndays following the markup, I have worked closely with Senator DeWine \nand other Members to address these issues. I am extremely pleased with \nthe results of this process. I believe that the changes proposed in the \ncommittee amendment will result in an even stronger piece of \nlegislation. The Senator from Ohio will discuss the changes that have \nbeen made in the committee substitute to S. 4, the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act.\n  After spending a great deal of time working with the language of this \nbill and the committee amendment, I am more convinced than ever that S. \n4 will assist American workers to balance work and family, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are on this legislation again today. I \nhave a great appreciation for the leadership in attempting to try to \njuggle a variety of very important pieces of legislation. We have had \nthe emergency appropriations which I think all of us would agree is the \nfirst order of business that we want to get passed. As to this \nlegislation, we have been on again, off again. We are glad to debate \nthese issues, but I understand some of the frustration of some of our \ncolleagues during the course of this debate where the bill is on for an \nhour or two, and they try to begin to follow it, and then it is off \nagain and we are uncertain when it will be be brought up again. That is \nsomething we have to deal with, but we will do the best that we can in \nattempting to deal with the on again, off again nature of this debate \nand respond to the questions which have been raised over this.\n  As we continue this debate, I want again to outline for the Members, \nwho it is who supports this legislation because there have been a \nvariety of different observations about the degree of support, who is \nsupporting it, and who is opposing it. Those of us who have concerns \nabout this legislation have enormous empathy and sympathy for families. \nThat has been the focus over time of our Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, as well as others here. It is not just Members on this side \nof the aisle. It is many of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who have made the cause of working families their cause.\n  But nonetheless, as we deal with this issue, it is important to know \nwho is supporting it and who is against. I want to say again at the \noutset that we believe working families have been hard pressed over the \nlast 25 years since about 1972 when their incomes effectively became \nstagnant. In the last 5 to 7 years we have seen that families are \nworking longer and harder to make ends meet and are very hard pressed \nto rise every morning and deal with their family's issues as well. And \nso at the outset this legislation has some appeal, and if it was \nexactly as has been described it might have some merit. But the concern \nthat many of us have is that it really gives the whip hand, so to \nspeak, to the employers and it does appear to many of us that this is \nreally a subterfuge to permit employers to avoid paying overtime.\n  We even had testimony from witnesses who were supporting the \nlegislation who told the Labor and Human Resources Committee that that \nwas the principal reason why they were supporting it. The National \nFederation of Independent Businesses told the Committee, ``Small \nbusinesses can't afford to pay their employees overtime. This is \nsomething they can offer in exchange that gives them a benefit.''\n\n  So we ought to understand right at the outset why many of those who \ndo support comptime, also support the inclusion of Senator Murray's \namendment. That amendment would have given absolute discretion to \nemployees to take up to 24 hours a year to be able to attend a parents' \nmeeting at school to consider the child's educational progress, or \nother such educational activities. Such an amendment was offered in the \ncommittee, but it was defeated along party lines.\n  That amendment was offered. It was supported by the President, and \nsupported overwhelmingly by the majority of the American people. Under \nthe amendment, the decision was the employee's. But the committee \nrejected that amendment along straight party lines. It was rejected. It \nwas rejected. It was rejected.\n  We have also heard a great deal about the needs that families have to \nget some time off when they have a sick child. No employees in this \ncountry ought to have to make the choice between the job that they need \nand the child that they love. We passed the Family and Medical Leave \nAct to address those needs. That effort was achieved in a bipartisan \nway. But it was limited to those employers that had more than 50 \nemployees. It has worked and worked well. And, under the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, if there is a medical emergency, if the need for \ntreatment is not foreseeable, the employee has an absolute right to \ntake time off. The employee has that right. If the medical condition is \nforseeable, then the employee has to make a reasonable effort to \nschedule the treatment at a time that does not unduly disrupt the \noperations of the employer. We offered an amendment in the committee to \nallow employees to use compensatory time under this same standard. That \nis, an employee has the right to use comptime at any time for reasons \nthat would qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act. But that \namendment, too, was rejected along strict party lines.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act applies to firms with 50 and more. \nSenator Dodd offered an amendment in the committee to lower that \nthreshold to 25 employees. That amendment, too, was rejected on party \nlines.\n  That is why the real issue regarding comptime is who is going to make \nthe decision. If it is going to be the employee, put my name on it. Put \nmy name on it. And I bet you would get the overwhelming majority of the \nMembers on this side. If the employers are the ones who are going to \nmake the decision--certainly you are not going to have my support, and \nyou are going to be hard pressed to get the support of those who have \nbeen championing workers' rights.\n  That leads me to another point, and that is who are the supporters. \nAre these concerns just mine, or those of my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Wellstone, or Senator Dodd, Senator Harkin, Senator Moseley-\nBraun, and many others? No, that was a conclusion reached by the League \nof Women Voters, the National Women's Political Caucus, the National \nWomen's Law Center, the Women's Legal Defense Fund.\n  It is very interesting why these organizations which have been the \nchampion of women's issues and women's rights oppose this bill. It is \nbecause many of the people who are going for the overtime are women, \nsingle moms. You would think these organizations that have been \nfighting for women's rights and workers' rights would be out here \nsupporting it, saying why are you battling it? Why are you battling it? \nThese organizations that day in and day have been championing the \neconomic rights of women universally reject the conclusions that have \nbeen drawn by some of our friends and colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle--that the employees are going to make all of these decisions, \nthat it is going to benefit the single moms for employers to make the \njudgments about when they can be with their children.\n\n  That is not my reading of this bill, and many others agree. It is the \nconclusion of those organizations--not that we have to be on the side \nalways of these organizations; they are not always correct. But it is \ninteresting that every one of the organizations that have been \nchampioning women's economic rights and rights for children are all \nopposed to it. Why?\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights:\n\n       The legislation could reduce the income of many working \n     families and make it more difficult for them to balance \n     competing work and family responsibilities.\n\n  That theme runs all the way through. I will include it in the Record, \nMr. President. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights draws the same \nconclusion that I and many others have drawn, and that is after all is \nsaid and done it is the employer that is going to make the judgment \nabout whether employees choose whether to earn comptime and when to use \nit if they've earned it. So these wonderful speeches\n\n[[Page S4336]]\n\nthat I read over the course of the weekend in support of comptime, \nwhich were well stated and eloquently stated in many instances, beg the \nfundamental issue: that is, who is going to make the judgment about \nthat sick child, about that sick relative, about the necessity for \ngoing to a teachers' conference or to a child's play. That has been the \nsubject of debate here for more than 10 years. When we finally achieved \nit, in the Family and Medical Leave Act, it is the employee who has the \nright.\n\n  But now we have this different bill. As I mentioned, those who are \nopposing it not only include those women's organizations but also the \nCouncil on Senior Citizens, the NAACP, disability rights organizations, \nthe National Council of Churches, a whole host--I will have the list of \nthose included in the Record--let alone the unions, in spite of the \nfact that they are outside the coverage of this legislation. Unionized \nemployees are outside. They are not affected by this legislation unless \nthey choose to try to achieve comp-time in the collective bargaining \nprocess. It is other workers, who are not unionized. But, nonetheless, \nthese organizations understand what is happening out in the plants and \nfactories. They supported the increase in minimum wage, as they support \nchild care, as they supported family and medical leave and plant \nclosing legislation--the whole range of issues that can offer some \nempowerment to workers dealing with a lot of challenges in the \nworkplace. They have been, obviously, fighting for those rights, and \nthey reached the same conclusion as well.\n  On the other side, those supporting this bill include the principal \norganizations that said ``thumbs down on the increase in the minimum \nwage,'' even though 65 percent of the people who were getting the \nminimum wage were women, a great percent of them with small children--\nthumbs down on that; thumbs down on family and medical leave, thumbs \ndown on that. That is the decision that no worker ought to have to \nmake, that decision between the child they love and the child they \nleave--thumbs down on that. And, as to plant closing legislation, which \nrequires employers to give some notice to workers so they can go out \nand get other jobs if a business shuts down--thumbs down on that.\n  But these organizations that fought all of these worker protections \njust cannot wait to get this bill passed. They just cannot wait to get \nthis passed. And one, I think, can reasonably assume that they are \ntrying to get this passed for the very reason that was stated by the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses, because they do not want \nto pay overtime to workers.\n  I also want to describe the people who get overtime. Let us take a \nlook at who are going to be the ones affected by this bill. To \nunderstand the real world impact of the bill, you have to look at the \nworkers who are currently depending on overtime--that is what we are \ntalking about, on overtime--to make ends meet. Mr. President, 44 \npercent of those who depend on overtime earn $16,000 a year or less--44 \npercent. More than 80 percent of them have annual earnings of less than \n$28,000 a year. These are hard-working Americans who are on the bottom \nsteps of the economic ladder. They are the hard-working Americans who \nhave a sense of pride, a sense of dignity--in so many instances they \nare the ones who clean these buildings at night, separated from their \nfamilies. They are the teachers' aides, they are the health aides who \nwork in nursing homes. They are men and women facing tough life \ndecisions in tough economic times. Mr. President, 80 percent of them \nearn less than $28,000 a year. These are people who need every dollar \nthey can earn just to make ends meet. They are men and women who are \nsupporting families.\n  If this bill passes many of them will lose the overtime dollars they \nneed so badly. Employers will give all the work to employees who agree \nto take the comptime. There will not be any overtime work for those who \ninsist on being paid. Under the Ashcroft bill, discrimination in \nawarding overtime will be perfectly legal. Do we understand that? \nDiscrimination against workers who refuse to sign on for the comptime \nprovisions, the flexible credit hours or the so-called 80-hour biweekly \nschedule --discrimination against such workers will be perfectly legal. \nFor example, let's take a worker in a plant who says, I am not going to \ngo for that program. I want to play by the rules just as we have them \nnow, a 40-hour week. I want to work overtime and get my time and a \nhalf. This bill gives the employer new powers--new powers. Time-and-a-\nhalf pay for overtime was the rule for all the workers in that place. \nNow, under this bill, it is different. Now the employer can go up and \nsay, OK, so that is your position. The employer can then go to the next \nworker and say, What about you? Do you want to sign on for the flexible \ncredit program that means you work overtime this week and get paid \nstraight time without time and a half? Would you like to do that? Do \nyou want that instead of time and a half?\n\n  Let's assume that this worker says, OK, I'll take that. I ought to be \ngetting time and a half, which I would under the present law, but we \nhave a new law. We have a new law called the comptime law, and it's \nsupposedly family friendly. So if that is what I have to do, OK, I'll \ndo it. I will work the extra time and just get paid straight time.\n  Now, what happens next? You come now to the third worker who says, \nAll right, I will take the abolition of the 40-hour week. I'll work 60 \nor 70 hours one week and 10 in the next. So this worker is signed up.\n  Then, assume that the business gets a little overtime work. Do you \nthink they are going to go back to the person who wants to get paid \ntime and a half? Or do you think they will go to the person who takes \nthe straight time, requiring no extra pay? Of course, the business will \ngo to that person. That is what this bill is all about.\n  When we said in the Labor Committee, all right, if you are going to \ngo this route, don't discriminate against those who participate, who \nwant the existing law now--that amendment was rejected. Turned down, by \na party line vote.\n  I wonder if, in the back of the minds of those who are the principal \nsupporters, they know exactly what they are going to do. If they have \nthis bill passed, they are not going to give any of the overtime to \nthose people who insist on getting time and a half pay for overtime \nwork. Instead, they'll assign the overtime work to workers who will \naccept flexible credit hours. Flexible credits are nothing more than \nsaying I will do overtime but I will get paid straight time.\n  We must remember, again, who we are talking about. We are talking \nabout the people who will get hurt the most. Mr. President, 56 percent \nof employees earning overtime have only a high school diploma or less. \nDo you know how hard it is to get ahead today, no matter how hard you \nwork, without more education? We don't seem to dwell on that here on \nthe floor of the Senate of the United States. The more you learn the \nmore you earn. It is not always true, but it is by and large true. Yet \nthese are the hard-working people who need the overtime pay to continue \ntheir education.\n  Millions of those affected by this bill rely on the overtime to make \nends meet because they only earn the minimum wage. They are minimum \nwage earners--60 percent of them are women, a third of them are the \nsole breadwinner in their families. Mr. President, 2.3 million children \nrely on parents who earn the minimum wage, parents who hope their \nchildren do not get sick because they cannot afford a doctor. They are \nout there working, but they cannot afford a doctor for their children. \nIf they make a little more money, it makes them ineligible for \nMedicaid, but they cannot afford the premiums for private health \ninsurance. Children make up another group we are trying to provide some \nrelief for, under the leadership of Senator Hatch, to try to make sure \nat least they are going to get some health care. I hope those on the \nother side of the aisle who are speaking so eloquently about the needs \nof these working families are going to be out there giving us a hand in \ntrying to do something about their health care costs.\n  Interviews conducted by the Women's Legal Defense Fund demonstrate \nthe sacrifice American women are making in support of corporate \nflexibility, such as a waitress who was involuntarily changed to a \nnight shift despite the fact she had no child care for evening\n\n[[Page S4337]]\n\nhours. One working mother expressed the bitter frustration of many when \nshe said, ``My life feels like I am wearing shoes that are two sizes \ntoo small.'' Millions of these low-wage workers are already working two \njobs to make ends meets. They need to work every hour they can and be \npaid for it. Over 400,000 employees, well over half of them women, are \nworking two jobs. They need the resources so badly they are working two \njobs. But this bill is going to open up the opportunity for their \nexploitation.\n\n  I want to comment on what is, I believe, the fundamental issue. We \nnow know who is really for this bill. We know that amendments to try to \nstrengthen the bill against the possibility of exploitation were \ndefeated in committee. I also mentioned others we offered to try to \ndeal with other very important features of the bill.\n  But I also want to offer a general response to some of the points \nthat were brought up by my friend and colleague from Missouri last \nFriday. After I discussed the Family and Medical Leave Act he said: I \nwould like to ask the Senator from Massachusetts whether he believes \nthat this abolishes the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  Let me tell my colleague why I raised the Family and Medical Leave \nAct. I raised it on the floor because the Republicans rejected the two \namendments to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act in committee. The \nSenator from Missouri said Friday that the Family and Medical Leave Act \nand S. 4 are compatible. Obviously, his Republican colleagues in the \ncommittee did not think so. On a straight party line vote, as I \nmentioned earlier, Senator Dodd's amendment to extend the availability \nof family and medical leave to workers in businesses with between 25 \nand 50 employees was rejected. On a similar vote they rejected Senator \nMurray's amendment to allow 24 hours of leave a year to attend parent-\nteacher meetings.\n  This debate is not about the changing demographics of the work force. \nWe are all aware that in more than 60 percent of two-parent families \nwith young children, both parents are now working outside the home. \nWorking parents need more opportunity to take time off from their work \nto be with their children. The debate is over how best to provide that \ntime.\n  Those of us who oppose S. 4 believe that it does a very poor job of \nproviding employees with time off at those times when they need it \nmost. S. 4 is designed to meet employer needs, not employee needs. The \nlegislation purports to let employees make the choice between overtime \npay and comptime, but it does not contain the protections necessary to \nensure that employees are free to choose without fear of reprisal. It \nis the employer, not the employee, who decides what forms of comptime \nand flextime will be available at the workplace. There is no freedom of \nchoice for workers.\n  This is really a Hobson's choice. It says: We are going to change \ntoday's existing protections for what is really a pig in a poke. So if \nthe employee signs on, he or she is going to have a series of choices. \nBut they are all going to be bad choices. They are all going to be bad \nchoices, that are not in the employee's interest. Under this bill, \nemployees will indeed have some choices, but they are all going to be \nthe bad choices. Let me explain.\n  The worker goes to work in the plant. The employer comes up and says, \nThis is a voluntary program. You can either play by the rules as we do \nat the present time or, as I mentioned, you can sign on for the \ncomptime provisions. Or you can do the flexible credit hours, and we \ncan abolish the 40-hour week. Which one of these, or all of them, do \nyou want? You would like all of them? If the employee agrees, that \nagreement does not even have to be a written statement. It can be an \noral statement. It has to be written if employees are trying to get out \nof one of these programs, but it can be oral for employees to get in. \nVery interesting; I wonder why. Why do they not treat the employer and \nemployee the same way? If employees believe somehow they are in the \nprogram, they have to write a written statement to get out. But an oral \nstatement is enough to get you in.\n  Again, that doesn't apply to the Federal employees, which we hear so \nmuch about; again, that is a decision made purely by the employee.\n  Imagine a situation where employees say, Look, I really need that \nmoney. I like time and a half. That's what I get now. But I need this \nmoney so badly in order to provide for my kids, getting their teeth \nfixed, I will work the extra hours just for straight time.\n  The employer will respond, Fine. You are on. You are on. Look, it's \nvoluntary. You are on. You wanted to do that, you are stating that, OK, \nyou are on.\n  Now imagine that the employer needs a little overtime work. Do you \nthink he is going back to the person who wants time and a half? Of \ncourse not. Of course not. Of course not.\n  They are going to go to this part that says, Look, you can work me 60 \nhours a week. So that employer is going to say, I'm going to take those \nthat go for the flex credit and those that will go for the 60- or 70-\nhour week, then I don't have to pay the overtime.\n  Mr. President, that is what this bill provides. We can hear this is \nvoluntary. Sure, it is voluntary for this person to get in or out. It \nis voluntary for that person that effectively is going to have to need \nthose resources so much that they will sign on for a lesser \ncompensation, but it is not voluntary for the employer. He or she can \nmake that judgment as to which one of those they will use and do it in \na way which effectively undermines these provisions.\n  I want to just mention what the current situation is, and then I will \ncome back to the analysis.\n  Currently, if employers generally want to provide family friendly \narrangements, they can do so under the current law. The key is the 40-\nhour week. Normally, employees work five 8-hour days a week, but more \nflexible arrangements are possible. Employers can schedule workers for \nfour 10-hour days a week, with the fifth day off, paid at the regular \nrate for each hour. No overtime is required. They have that flexibility \ntoday.\n  We hear, What if you want Friday off? Well, you can have Friday off \non this if the employers want to do that to benefit their employees. We \nheard so much the last time that employers care so much about the \nemployees that they are really going to take care of them. They can do \nthat today under the existing law. They can give them a half day off on \nFridays. A number of companies do that, but they do not have it \nmandated. And no overtime is required. Or they can arrange a work \nschedule for four 9-hour days plus a 4-hour day on the fifth day, again \nwithout paying a dime of overtime.\n  Under current law, employers can also arrange a work schedule for \nfour 9-hour days plus 4 hours on the fifth day without paying the \novertime.\n  Under the current law, some employees can even vary their hours \nenough to have a 3-day weekend every other week. They can offer genuine \nflextime. This allows employers to schedule an 8-hour day around core \nhours of 10 to 3 and let employees decide whether they want to work 7 \na.m. to 3 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. This, too, costs employers not a \npenny more.\n  But only a tiny fraction of the employers use these or the many other \nflexible arrangements available under current law. The Bureau of Labor \nStatistics found in 1991, only 10 percent of hourly employees use the \nflexible schedules. The current law offers a host of family friendly \nflexible schedules today, yet virtually few employers provide them.\n  This bill, Mr. President, has to lead us to a different conclusion. \nIf they have the flexibility, they can do it, and they are not doing \nit, I think it is fair to reach a different conclusion, which is cut \nworkers wages, and employer groups unanimously support it. That is the \nrecord. All the employer groups unanimously support it. Obviously, it \nis not just small businesses which wish to cut the pay and substitute \nsome less expensive benefit instead.\n  As I was just mentioning about the comments that were made last week, \nwe have the situation where the employer has those choices over those \nemployees. Those of us who oppose S. 4 believe it does a very poor job \nof providing employees the time off at the times they need it.\n  S. 4 is designed to meet the employer needs, not the employee needs. \nI mentioned last week about the change in the decisionmaking from the \nemployee to the employer that is made with Federal workers. We heard so \nmuch about\n\n[[Page S4338]]\n\nthe Federal employees: We are just doing here for the private sector \nwhat the Government has already done for Government employees. We heard \nthat for a long time, until someone picked up the book and said, ``In \nthe Federal Government, the employees make the decision.'' But \nnot here, Mr. President.\n\n  The way this is designed, which I went into in some detail last \nFriday, demonstrates that the employer will make the ultimate decision \nabout whether he or she has been given reasonable time and whether it \nwill unduly disrupt. Even if the employer is arbitrary in basically \ndenying this kind of reasonable request, do you think that there is any \nenforcement mechanism there? Do you think there are any penalties in \nthis area there? Absolutely none. What do you think that says to the \nemployers? That gives them the whole enchilada. They make the decision \non whether the request is reasonable, they make the decision whether it \nwill unduly disrupt, and if they make it wrong, there is nothing that \nwill happen to them. Come on, Mr. President, that gives the authority \nand the power to those employers.\n  An employer can lawfully deny all overtime work to those employees \nwho want to be paid and give overtime exclusively to workers who will \naccept the comptime in lieu of pay. There is no freedom of choice for \nworkers.\n  A working mother may want a particular day off so that she can \naccompany her child to a school event or a doctor's appointment. \nNothing in this legislation requires the employer to give her the day \noff she requests. The employer decides when it is convenient for her to \nuse her accrued comptime. There is no freedom of choice for workers.\n  The employee witnesses cited in the Republican majority report, \nChristine Korzendorfer and Sandie Moneypenny, emphasized the importance \nof employee choice in their testimony. Ms. Korzendorfer, who the \nSenator from Missouri focused on in his remarks, told the Employment \nand Training Subcommittee: ``What makes this idea appealing is that I \nwould be able to choose which option best suits my situation.'' But \nthose who brought Ms. Korzendorfer to testify did not tell her who \ncontrolled that decision. Under S. 4, it is the employer alone who \ndetermines what flexibility is available in her schedule.\n  Ms. Moneypenny testified, ``If I could bank my overtime, I wouldn't \nhave to worry about missing work if my child gets sick on a Monday or \nTuesday.'' The problem is that the Republican bill doesn't give her \nthat opportunity. Her employer has no obligation to let her use the \naccrued comptime on the days her child needs to see a doctor. There is \nno provision, there is no guarantee in here, absolutely none.\n  The Senator from Missouri went to great lengths to rebut my \ncontention that on crucial issues, S. 4 gives the choice to the \nemployer, not the employee. His defense of the legislation is that the \nemployee can choose not to participate in the first place and can \nchoose to withdraw from the program later. He refers to this as ``the \nchoice to change his or her mind'' if the program is not working \nfairly. Contrary to the Senator from Missouri, I do not consider that \nto be much of a choice at all.\n  If they are out, if they say, ``I am not for this, I have worked \nthese flex credit hours until I am blue in the face and I'm not getting \nthe overtime, I want out of it,'' does anybody think that that \nindividual is ever, ever going to be able to get overtime as one who is \nnot participating in this?\n  This is so far beyond the possible understanding about what is \nhappening in the work force, where last year, 170,000 cases came before \nthe NLRB and over $100 million was returned to workers because of the \nfailure to pay overtime. That is what is happening.\n  And where is it happening? Among these various workers. That is \ntoday. That is happening just as we are here. The idea that this is all \nbeing done in this wonderful atmosphere of consideration of the bill \ndefies what is happening in the work force of America among this \neconomic group: over 80 percent, $28,000. We know where they are \nworking. We know about the failure to give them overtime. We know what \nthose working conditions are. How many studies, how many reviews, how \nmany inspections have to be done? We know what will happen to that \nemployee when that employee says, ``Well, I'm out of it now, I want to \nget out of it.''\n\n  If we are truly concerned about the employee's need for families, we \nshould design a program that really works. I do not consider it to be \nan appropriate response to say, in essence, if the employees don't like \nwhat we give them, they can reject it and get no time off at all. I \nthink we have a greater obligation to draft legislation which genuinely \naddresses the real needs of workers.\n  The Senator from Missouri denied this bill will result in a pay cut. \nAs presented, S. 4 would allow an employer to deny overtime work from \nemployees who insisted on receiving overtime pay. All the overtime work \ncould go to the employees who agreed to take comptime. Those who wanted \novertime pay would no longer receive any of the extra work. Their \npaychecks would be reduced, and, in plain English, that is a cut in \npay.\n  Furthermore, under the biweekly work schedule and the flexible credit \nhour provisions, employees who work more than 40 hours a week will no \nlonger receive time and a half in their wages or time off. That is, Mr. \nPresident, if the person said, ``Look, I really need to get that time \nfor my child on Monday, give me the time off my comptime,'' they say, \n``OK, you get it,'' but the interesting thing is, the words that are \nleft out are when they come back to work, they can be forced to work on \nFriday because it does not use the words ``hours paid,'' to equivalency \nin hours paid which gives the protection.\n  So mom or dad gets the child on Monday but loses them on Saturday. \nThese are the kinds of things in this bill. Do you think we got \nsupport? We tried to make those adjustments in the legislation. No, no.\n  As the Senator from Missouri directly noted, that loss of pay creates \nundue stress. We should not permit it to happen, but it will happen if \nS. 4 is enacted.\n  All of the problems with S. 4 I have described this morning --the \nfailure to ensure employees the right to use comptime when they choose; \nthe failure to prevent employers from discriminating in allocating \novertime work; the failure to preserve the principle of the 40-hour \nworkweek; and the failure to treat comptime hours used as hours worked \ncould easily be corrected. In the Labor Committee, the Democratic \nmembers offered amendments to correct these flaws. Each was rejected. \nEach was rejected. Each one of those would have given greater power to \nthe employees. All of them were turned down.\n  The refusal of the Republican majority to make these changes --to \npresent legislation that would truly empower workers to make real \nchoices--speaks for itself. The real intent of S. 4 is to create \nchoices for employers, not employees. We can do better. Let's enact a \nbill that gives those choices to working men and women so they are free \nto do what is best for their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, last Friday, we had the privilege of \nbeginning our discussion of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. During \nthat debate, the Senator from Massachusetts asked an important question \nof the sponsors of S. 4. He put the question this way: Who's side are \nyou on?\n  I want to answer that question very clearly: We are on the side of \nthe workers of this great nation. We are on the side of giving American \nworkers the capacity to be better fathers and mothers, sons and \ndaughters. We are on the side of providing a framework so workers can \nadequately balance the competing demands of work and family. We are on \nthe side of giving the 59.2 million private sector hourly workers the \nability to work flexible work schedules that already are enjoyed by the \n66 million American workers who enjoy flexible working arrangements.\n  Who's for flextime? I think it is an important question that has been \nasked. A Penn and Schoen survey reports that 75 percent of the public \nsupports the choice of comptime; 64 percent of the public prefers time \noff to more pay, given the choice. They want to have the choice to take \ntime off instead of receiving more pay.\n\n[[Page S4339]]\n\n  Federal workers now have the same flextime arrangements that are \noffered in this legislation; 74 percent say that it boosts their \nmorale; 72 percent have more time with their families.\n  It is time to provide this same benefit we provide in Government to \npeople in the private sector. Working Woman and Working Mother \nmagazines both endorse this particular proposal of flextime, because \nthey believe that it is essential that we have more capacity to \naccommodate the competing demands of flexible working arrangements and \nour families. We are on the side of working women who have said that \nflexibility is what they need to meet the competing demands of work and \nfamily. We are for women who, in the Department of Labor's working \nwomen count report to the President stated that, ``The No. 1 issue \nwomen want to bring to the attention of the President is the difficulty \nof balancing work and family obligations.''\n\n  As I mentioned, Working Mother magazine says it supports this \nlegislation. Working Woman magazine also supports this legislation--in \nits approval of this bill--the editors said that we should give women \nwhat they want and not what Congress thinks they need.\n  Why should we want to give flexible work arrangements to these \nworkers? What does it mean for their families? What does it mean for \ntheir lives? The workers enjoying the benefits can tell you. The \nexecutives in the boardroom can tell you how important it is to be able \nto accommodate their family needs through flexible scheduling. The \nsalaried workers of America--supervisors, managers, stockbrokers, \nbankers, and lawyers can tell you how flexible working arrangements \ngive them opportunities to leave work early when needed to watch their \nchild play in a ball game or go talk to a parent-teacher conference, or \ntake care of personal business that cannot be done on the weekend.\n  Of course, Federal workers, and many State and local government \nworkers, who have comptime can tell you what the benefit of being able \nto go home to be with their sick child instead of worrying about that \nchild. Congress recognized the benefit of flexible work arrangements \nand passed the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules \nAct almost 20 years ago. This act allowed Federal Government employees \nto enjoy flexible work schedules, which still are illegal for the rest \nof America's private sector hourly workers. That disparity between what \nwe have provided as an opportunity for Federal workers and which we \nmake illegal for people in the private sector is a disparity which the \npeople of America are uncomfortable with, and they expect us to change.\n  The Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act \nallows hourly workers to work an extra hour one week in order to work 1 \nhour less the following week, something that is illegal now. It allows \nFederal Government employees paid by the hour to work on biweekly \nschedules, at their option. This allows a worker to work 5 days one \nweek, 4 days the next, and have every other Friday off.\n  When surveyed about the program among the workers who have it in the \nFederal Government, it is interesting that Federal workers, on a 10-to-\n1 basis--actually, better than 10-to-1 basis--stated they like the \nprogram and they wanted it to continue. No wonder. Today, almost 20 \nyears after giving this benefit to workers in the Federal Government, \nit is still illegal for private sector employers to cooperate with \ntheir employees in the same respect.\n  As far back as 1945, the Congress of the United States recognized \nthat some times, when employees work overtime, they would rather have \nsome extra time off rather than the money. Congress recognized that no \nmatter how much money you get for overtime, you cannot replace the time \nyou need with your family, so they amended the Federal Employees Pay \nAct to allow Federal Government employees the choice between being \ncompensated for overtime work and being able to take time off with pay. \nIn 1985, Congress gave the same choice to State and local government \nemployees, in terms of comp-time opportunities. These workers can take \ntime off with pay at a later date, instead of being paid cash for time-\nand-a-half overtime.\n  Congress acknowledged that sometimes time is more valuable than money \nand that Congress is not in a place to make that decision for every \nworker. However, right now Congress is making that decision for private \nsector hourly workers. Congress is making that decision because there \nis no option, under the law, for employees to choose to take time off \nlater over monetary compensation.\n  Now, the squeeze on people for time has never been more dramatic than \nit is at this time. Yet some Members of Congress continue to fight \ngiving the same option of flexible scheduling to private sector \nemployees that we have given to Federal government employees. They \nfight giving compensatory time off options to private sector workers \neven though they supported such measures for State and local government \nemployees just 12 short years ago.\n\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act would give all hourly workers this \nsame opportunity to make such choices.\n  Now, President Clinton recognized the benefits of flexible work \nschedules himself when he directed the use of flexible work \narrangements for executive branch employees. On July 11, 1994, he said:\n\n       Broad use of flexible working arrangements to enable \n     Federal employees to better balance their work and family \n     responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job \n     satisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism.\n\n  It sounds like the President was endorsing the concept. I agree with \nhis statement. I urge him to be on the side of the rest of the workers, \nnot just the Government workers of America. I urge him to join us in \nsaying that all hourly paid workers in America should have this \nopportunity to cooperate with their employers to work for comptime off \ninstead of paid overtime when they prefer comptime off.\n  It is important to note that this legislation would impose taking \ntime off on no one, and anyone, even if they made a choice to take time \noff, could later convert that to paid time merely by saying so. The \nbill provides that second choice.\n  I think it is important for us to say whose side are we on. I think \nwe are on the side of the private sector, hourly workers in this \ncountry. Everyone agrees that flexible work arrangements have been good \nfor Federal employees, for salaried workers, for State and local \nworkers in terms of comptime provisions. Every study that has ever been \ndone on the subject concludes that these arrangements are beneficial to \nworkers.\n  So why is that group of hard-working Americans, the laborers of this \nNation who work on an hourly basis--the store clerks, the mechanics, \nthe factory workers, the clerical workers, baggage handlers, gas \nstation attendants--why are they denied the opportunities for this \nbenefit? Could it be that the Congress has the arrogance to decide that \nno worker could make such a choice for himself, that these workers are \nincapable?\n  I believe that is outrageous. We should no longer say, ``You cannot \nmake this decision, we must make it for you.'' We should say to these \nworkers, you have the same capacity and right to cooperate with your \nemployer to make decisions about time off and about flexible working \narrangements and about scheduling as do the Federal workers and workers \nat State and local governmental entities.\n  That is whose side we are on. Everyone in the culture, other than \nhourly workers, now has a real shot at flexible working arrangements \nand compensatory time. The boardroom has it. When the boss goes to play \ngolf on Friday afternoons, he knows of the value of flextime. It is \nhigh time, if the boss is capable of doing that, he should at least be \nable to cooperate with employees who need to spend time with their \nfamily to provide such opportunities for hourly workers, as well.\n  So I ask the opponents of this legislation, whose side are you on? \nAre you on the side of working women who sit at their desk worrying \nabout a sick child because they cannot afford to take time off from \nwork without pay, while their salaried coworkers leave for their sons' \nsoccer games? Are you on the side of working men who pack their lunch \nevery day and go to work only to go\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\nhome to look at pictures of their child's award assembly, pictures \nwhich show that the business executives were proudly at the side of \ntheir children while his child accepts the award?\n  Are you on the side of Christine Kordendorfer who wanted the option \nof occasionally taking her overtime compensation in the form of time \noff rather than pay to care for her growing family and take care of her \nhealth in the last stages of her pregnancy? Are you on the side of \nArlyce Robinson who came in to testify that she wants to take some time \noff as a result of flextime, so she can participate in her four \ngrandchildren's extracurricular activities? Or are you on the side of \nthe special interests? Are you on the side of the organizations \ndesigned to represent the interests of America's workers, who just this \nSunday began running ads opposed to this legislation?\n\n  Let me just say I was stunned when those organizations, which purport \nto be helping American workers, began running television ads against \nthis legislation. The television ads were replete with \nmisrepresentation. Here is the text of the ad: ``Big business is moving \nto gut a law protecting our right to overtime pay. If they win, \nemployers could pay workers with time off instead of money.'' That is \nsimply false, that the employer would have a unilateral right. As a \nmatter of fact, it takes a request by the employee in order for that to \nhappen. They say that the choice will be up to employers. They say that \nthere are no real safeguards to keep employers from pressuring workers \nto accept time off or to telling them when to take the time off.\n  The fact of the matter is the bill itself contains safeguards that \nare substantial. The bill provides that there can be no coercion, \neither direct coercion or indirect coercion. I will read from the bill, \nline 14 on page 15: ``An employer that provides compensatory time off \nunder paragraph 2 to an employee shall not directly or indirectly \nintimidate, threaten, coerce or attempt to intimidate, threaten or \ncoerce any employee for the purpose of,'' and then it goes on, \n``including interfering with the rights of the employee to use accrued \ncompensatory time off in accordance with this law, or requiring, \nthreatening or coercing them in terms of requiring the employee to use \ncompensatory time off.'' When you go to the definition provided in the \nlaw about intimidation and coercion, either direct or indirect, you \nfind out that relates to conferring a benefit or denying a benefit.\n  Now the Senator from Massachusetts has repeatedly said employers \nwould be free to offer benefits like overtime work and extra pay, which \nhe categorizes as a benefit to those who would choose one form or \nanother of compensation. The bill itself unmistakably challenges the \ncharges levied in the AFL-CIO spots against this matter.\n  This ad says, ``You could work up to 40 additional hours in a week \nbefore qualifying for overtime.'' Up to 40 additional hours in a week \nbefore qualifying for overtime, suggesting that an employer could make \nan employee work an 80-hour week. That is a total falsehood. To do \nthat, to say that, knowing this bill does not provide that, is to lie.\n  It is important for us to know that the real provisions of this bill \noutlaw specifically direct and indirect coercion. They outlaw \nintimidation. They outlaw the promise of a benefit, or the conference \nof a benefit to an individual to shape or to otherwise distort the \ndecisionmaking that is voluntary, and it is supposed to be voluntary \nand guaranteed to be voluntary under this bill.\n  I think it is shameful that the AFL-CIO would seek to impair the \nability of hourly workers in this country to have the benefit. It is \nthe same kind of flexibility that workers at the salaried level, at the \nboardroom, at the management level, at the supervisory level, have long \nhad. It is sad--twisted, that these ads began running on Mother's Day. \nFrankly, the best Mother's Day present we could have given to the \nUnited States of America would have been flexible working arrangements \nthat would have made possible mothers spending more time with their \nfamilies, fathers spending more time with their families, fathers and \nmothers spending more time with each other and their children. On the \nday set aside to recognize the valuable contributions that mothers make \nin our society, the labor lobby was beginning a campaign opposing this \nbill rather than embracing a change that would enhance the lives of \nmothers across this great land.\n  Rather than supporting public policy to make workers' lives easier, \nthe labor lobby found out that the Members on the other side of the \naisle recognize how important it is to give American workers these \noptions. The labor lobby realized that Congress is going to work \ntogether to ensure America's families a brighter future, so the labor \nlobby interests in Washington took money, paid out of the pockets of \nhard-working Americans--it is from the very workers who would benefit \nfrom these scheduling options--yet they are spending the worker's money \non ads opposing this legislation. These ads are a lie. These ads were \nstrategically targeted to those Members on the other side of the aisle \nwho have expressed an interest in working with us on this issue.\n  When I first introduced this legislation back in 1995, the labor \nlobby ran similar ads in my State. However, the ads backfired as their \nlies were exposed. As concerned constituents called my office, they \nfound out the truth about the legislation. Many of them told me not to \nlisten to the voice of the opposition coming from the labor lobby. They \ntold me that, as workers, they were interested in this kind of \nflexibility. They told me that these scheduling options would enhance \ntheir lives. They recognized the fact that the labor lobby should be \nleading this fight, leading the charge to help get workers more \nscheduling options. In fact, these constituents resented the fact that \nthe labor lobby in Washington had abandoned their traditional promoting \nof workers' interests.\n  Knowing that some of this body's strongest opponents of this bill \nsupported these flexible scheduling options for Federal Government \nworkers makes me wonder whose side they are on. Knowing that just 12 \nyears ago these same opponents not only supported comptime options for \nState and local government employees, but cosponsored the legislation, \nI wonder whose drum they are marching to now. Is it the drumbeat of the \nAmerican worker who needs to have the opportunity for flexible \nscheduling? Or is it the cadence that is being called by the labor \nunion leaders in Washington? I wonder whose side they are on when there \nare much greater protections in this bill than the bills they have \nsupported in the past.\n  This bill is replete with protections for workers that are not \nincluded in the bill that is providing the same framework of options \nfor Federal employees. Under the legislation giving State and local \ngovernment workers comptime options, cosponsored by the opponents, \ncomptime can be made a condition of employment. It can't be a condition \nof employment here. There is no protection of a worker against \ncoercion. Under this legislation coercion or even attempted coercion \nwould be a violation of the law. We have rules against coercion and \nintimidation. State and local government agencies can force the \nemployee to use their comptime when it is convenient for the agency, \neven though that practice has been successfully challenged in some \ncourts. That is the provision they allowed in the bill they passed for \nState and local governments. We have protections against that happening \nin this bill.\n  Last but not least, in the bill that they sponsored and passed for \nState and local government authorities, there were absolutely no cash-\nout provisions for the workers. The bill that is before us allows a \nworker who has said, ``I will take my time in comptime,'' any time \nprior to taking the time off with pay, later on, can say, ``No, I would \nlike the money, the time and a half overtime. I will be working to gain \nadditional hours later.'' So the worker has a choice in the first \ninstance to say, yes, I would like to have some comptime or not and \nwork time and a half--that is the worker's choice. It can't be imposed \non him, by the terms of the legislation, with a stiff penalty.\n  A second choice is an option of the worker. At any time prior to \ntaking the time off, the worker can say, ``I changed my mind. I would \nlike to have the money.'' That is not an option under legislation \ncosponsored by opponents of this bill. That is not a protection that \nwas included by those who sponsored the measure for State and\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\nlocal governments. They didn't have that protection there. We have it \nhere. Further, there is another protection. At the end of every year, \nthese hours have to be cashed out if they are not taken in this bill. \nWere those protections in the items sponsored by those who oppose this \nbill for State and local workers? Not on your life. They are demanding \na much higher standard here because they are marching to the beat of a \ndifferent drum.\n  I submit to you that it is important to know whose side we are on in \nthis legislation. I say it is time that we be on the side of American \nworkers and their families. For a long enough time we have been on the \nside of those individuals whose effort is made in Government. For the \nlast 20 years, we have had these kinds of flexible arrangements. \nFederal Government workers enjoy using them at a 10-to-1 rate. They say \nthese schedules improve their morale and give workers more time to \nspend with their families. Last week, they interviewed working mothers \nin the United States of America, and 81 percent of them said flexible \nworking arrangements would be very important. Yes, that is whose side \nare we on?\n\n  Now, those who oppose this call this a ``paycheck reduction act.'' I \ndon't know how they can call this the paycheck reduction act with a \nstraight face, because there answer it to create more unpaid leave. \nThey say we should not do this, we should expand family and medical \nleave. Family and medical leave is nothing more than the right to take \ntime off without pay. Here we have a flexible working arrangement \nproposal which would give people the right to take time off with pay. I \nthink the American people want to have time off with pay. So who's side \nare we on?\n  Let's go to the statistics from the Family and Medical Leave \nCommission report. The Family and Medical Leave Commission report says \nwhat happens when people take time off without pay--which is really the \nway you reduce your paycheck, by taking time off without pay. Here is \nwhat happens: Twenty-eight percent of all the people who took time off \nhad to make ends meet by borrowing money. This is from the report of \nthe Commission on Family and Medical Leave. Senator Dodd chaired this \nCommission. The Commission reported that 28.1 percent had to borrow \nmoney; 10.4 percent of the people who took time off under family and \nmedical leave went on welfare in order to accommodate the reduction in \npay; 41.9 percent said they had to put off paying bills. The opponents \nof this legislation are just offering more additional leave without \npay, so that another 40, 41, or 42 percent of the people have to go \nwithout paying their bills, or another 10.5 percent will have to go on \nwelfare, or close to 30 percent will have to go out and borrow money.\n  Whose side are we on? How can you call this the paycheck reduction \nact, which would provide individuals the opportunity to take time off \nwithout taking the pay cut? They could use comptime or take time off by \nusing flextime. It just is beyond me to think that we would reject this \nopportunity for Americans to spend time with their families. It is \nbeyond me that we would reject this opportunity to give Americans time \nto accommodate their needs outside the workplace by taking comptime off \nor using flextime and still get paid for it only to have the other side \nallege that this is a paycheck reduction act. I cannot believe that \nafter calling this bill the paycheck reduction act, that they can claim \nthe real solution to this problem is to put more people in the position \nwhere, according to the Family and Medical Leave Commission, 28.1 \npercent of them had to borrow money, 10.4 percent had to go on welfare, \nand 41.9 percent had to say to creditors, ``I am not going to be able \nto pay you.'' This isn't what Americans want. No wonder 75 out of 100 \npeople in this culture say we really want more flexible working \narrangements.\n  Now, I just add that nothing in this measure impairs the ability of \nanyone to take time off under family and medical leave. That time is \nstill available. This doesn't abolish family and medical leave. Every \nsingle hour of family and medical leave that exists--if a person \nprefers to take time off with a pay cut, they will be able to use that \nand there will be times when they may have to. This is a different set \nof options.\n  This bill doesn't say we will no longer have family and medical \nleave. It is not incompatible with it. It doesn't outlaw it. People \nwill be able to, if they need or want to, say, ``Because I meet the \nconditions of the Family and Medical Leave Act, I am going to take time \noff.'' That is appropriate. We want workers to have that choice and to \nadd to workers another range of choices. It doesn't in any way impair \ntheir ability to choose time off under family and medical leave. That \nis still there. This is merely a way to say to them, if you don't find \nthat comfortable, if you are tired of having to go on welfare and put \noff bills or borrow money in order to take time off under family and \nmedical leave--you might want to try another way of doing it. Instead \nof being paid time and a half sometime when you have overtime to work, \nyou would put it in a comp time bank, so later on, when you needed time \noff to be with a sick child or to go get your car license renewed and \nstand in that silly line at the department of motor vehicles during \nworking hours when you normally can't do that, you could do it and you \ndon't have to take a pay cut.\n\n  The truth of the matter is, this is not the paycheck reduction act at \nall. This is the way to take time off with pay. The American people \nbelieve, I think, a lot of things and, given the amount of \nmisinformation, I guess that is expected. But they will not believe \nthat compensatory time off is taking a pay cut. If you earn time and a \nhalf as a result of working some overtime and you are going to take \ntime off the next week and still get paid for it, that means you get \ntime off without a pay cut, not that you get time off with a pay cut. \nSo I think it is important for us to understand that.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts thinks that there are tremendous \nopportunities for abuse, in the event we would average the work week \nover 80 hours instead of 40 hours and only at the option of the \nworker--only with the approval of the worker. He talks about the \npotential abuse of an employer choosing one person as opposed to \nanother person for overtime. Yet, he lauds the current system. I guess \nhis point is that if they want somebody to work overtime on Monday, \nthey can say, ``Who will work it tonight and take a couple hours off on \nFriday afternoon?'' He thinks that is OK as long as it is done within 1 \nweek. But over a 2-week period it is somehow a great threat. Employers \nwould be abusive in a 2-week stretch, but not in a 40-hour stretch.\n  Get serious. The truth of the matter is that we ought to understand \nthat, where there are abuses, we ought to have strict, tough \nenforcement, and I think we can agree on that. We have doubled the \npenalty for abuses under this law. But to make it illegal for an \nindividual to take an hour off on Friday and make it up the next Monday \nis inappropriate and should be changed. For the life of me, I can't \nbelieve that we should persist in that respect. We have seen how this \nworks. We have watched it work in State and local government and in the \nFederal Government. We haven't been overrun by a series of complaints. \nWe certainly haven't been inundated by a demand to change the bill. It \nhas been in place for 19 years now and is working very well. You would \nthink if this is the kind of thing that was abusive, we would at least \nhave some people talking about it.\n  I should emphasize, and I want to make very clear to those who would \nbe watching, that nothing in this law mandates any worker to take time \noff instead of being paid time and a half for overtime. Everything in \nthis law provides penalties for an employer who would coerce a worker \ninto doing so. Nothing in this law provides any mandate that a worker \nwould have to build up a bank of flextime hours. A lot of workers might \nlike to do that. In the event they needed time off, they would not have \nto take a pay cut in order to get it.\n  Flexible working arrangements are enjoyed by the managers, by those \nin the boardroom, by supervisors, Presidents, CEO's, and corporate \ntreasurers. As a matter of fact, 66 million workers have flexible \nworking arrangements. Only 59 million hourly paid individuals don't. It \nis time for us to accord to these individuals the same option of \nworking together with their employers\n\n[[Page S4342]]\n\nso they can accommodate the needs of their families and work at their \njobs. It should be unnecessary to take a pay cut to be a good mom or \ndad in America. Flexible working arrangements would make it possible \nfor people to meet the needs of their families without taking a pay \ncut.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Minnesota \nthat there is no time control.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I should not take more than 15 \nminutes. Mr. President, listening to my friend from Missouri expound on \nthe wonders and benefits of this bill, once again, reminds me of what I \nhave often said about the U.S. Senate and the 100 Members that comprise \nthis body. There are no bad people in the U.S. Senate. I can honestly \nsay that I like each and every individual here in the Senate. There are \nno bad people here.\n  There are just a lot of bad ideas. Listening to this explanation of \nthis bill reminds me once again of that truth. The Senator from \nMissouri is a friend, and he is a good guy, but this happens to be a \nvery bad idea. I think it is terribly mistaken--what this bill would do \nin the force and effect of this bill. I am going to get into some of \nthose in my remarks, especially on whether or not this really is a \npaycheck reduction act, because it really is. Of the three options that \npeople have, it actually would reduce their paychecks.\n  Mr. President, as our workplace has changed the number of two-parent \nfamilies has increased. Workers deserve relief to meet the demands of \neveryday life. That is why, for example, I support, like a number of \npeople here, the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow workers to take \ntime off to care for newborn children, or ailing relatives, without \nfear of losing their jobs.\n  Mr. President, millions of Americans have been helped by this \nlandmark law. Now I believe it is time that we expand this profamily \nprotection to provide parents with a little time off from work to \nattend a parent-teacher conference, or a doctor's appointment for their \nchild.\n  I have worked my entire career in the House and the Senate to try to \nimprove the lives of working families, and that includes comptime. I \nsupport giving families more flexibility to balance their work and \nfamily lives, and I am hopeful that we can pass such a bill. However, \nthis bill before us, designated S. 4, is truly a wolf in sheep's \nclothing. It is a sham. This bill offers the appearance of employee \nchoice but it is not the reality. The appearance but not the reality. \nIn the Labor Committee markup of this bill several amendments were \noffered to improve this bill to provide real choice and protection for \nworkers. All were rejected on party-line votes. I am going to go \nthrough some of them.\n  I am deeply concerned that this legislation will actually take \nfamilies in the wrong direction. It gives the employers more \nflexibility to get out of their overtime obligations rather than giving \nemployees more flexibility to spend time with their families. It will \nleave workers with less money, not more flexibility, and should be \nreally titled ``Paycheck Reduction Act.'' A genuine comptime bill must \nprovide employees with choice, protection, and flexibility. It has to \nbe commonsense and profamily, and S. 4 falls short on all of those \ncounts.\n  Supporters claim that S. 4 allows employees to make the choice \nbetween overtime pay and comptime, but it doesn't contain the \nprotections that are necessary to ensure that employees have free \nchoice and are free from reprisal. Under this legislation, the employer \nholds all the cards. The employer chooses what options to provide the \nflexible work options to, and when the employees can exercise the \noptions. It is also seriously lacking in other important employee \nprotection measures which would ensure flexibility and not a reduction \nin benefits.\n  S. 4 outlines three flexible work options, the employer--not the \nemployee--gets to pick what flexible options to provide. An employer \ncould either offer comptime in lieu of overtime pay; second, a biweekly \nwork schedule; third, flexible credit hours. Two of these three options \nwould effectively relieve an employer of their overtime obligations, \nand result in an actual paycheck reduction for the employee. In effect, \nS. 4 would eliminate the guarantee of pay for overtime work for over 64 \nmillion workers.\n  Again, when I think about it, what rational employer would not want \nto maximize profits and savings with their company? The employer has to \nanswer to the shareholders, to the stockholders. They want to maximize \nthat. I understand that dynamic. But on the other side of that equation \nthere must be provisions to protect the employee so that you can have a \nbalance in those scales. This bill does not provide that kind of \nbalance. All of the help goes to the employer and not to the employee.\n  Again, I understand that employers want to maximize profits. That is \ntheir business. They want to ensure that their shareholders get the \nbest return. That is their business. Our business ought to be to ensure \nthat the workers have their rights protected to even out that balance \nto provide the kind of support for the workers so that this time and \ntheir work and their schedules are not totally determined by the \nemployer. That is what this bill does. This bill gives it all to the \nemployer. For example, under the biweekly work schedule, the employer \ncould choose to abandon the 40-hour work week altogether. An employer \nwould not be obligated to pay overtime until an employee works over 80 \nhours during a 2-week period. So in effect an employee could work 60 \nhours one week, 20 hours the next week, and receive no overtime pay, or \neven comptime. Under this scheme an employer could rig it so that \novertime hours are never approved and, therefore, the employer has no \novertime obligations. That is factual. I challenge anyone to dispute \nwhat I just said right there. It is not in the bill. That is what an \nemployer could do. So not only would this result in less income than \nthe employee would receive under current law for working those same \nhours and no comptime for those who want that time instead of pay but, \nI submit to you, Mr. President and others, that a 60-hour workweek \nisn't very family friendly. Under the biweekly schedule it would be \nextremely difficult for those workers to arrange for child care, or to \nplan time with their families if their employer could constantly change \ntheir work schedule. That is exactly what could happen: 60 hours one \nweek, 20 the next, 50 the next, 30 the next, 60 one week and 20 the \nnext. How could any employee and their family arrange for child care, \nor to reasonably plan their schedule? That is one of the options under \nthis bill. So we can see that it really is not very family friendly, \nand it would take away overtime pay and even comptime.\n\n  Under the flexible credit hours provision, an employer could offer \nthe employee an option to work the extra hours but receive only 1 hour \nof overtime for each extra hour worked. Under existing law an employee \nwould be paid time and a half for extra hours worked. Even with \ncomptime, the employee would at least receive 1\\1/2\\ hours of overtime \nfor every extra hour worked. It is hard to believe that any employee \nwould choose this, unless he or she wasn't given any other choice.\n  In addition, under S. 4, the flexible work hour arrangements would \nnot have to be made available to all employees. The employer picks who \ngets to participate. The employer could legally discriminate against \nworkers who need and who want overtime pay instead of comptime, and \nthere are no remedies available to the employee to protect it. Again, \nlet me repeat that. The employer could legally discriminate against \nworkers who need and want overtime pay instead of comptime, and there \nare no remedies available to the employee which might prevent this.\n  Instead of having a choice, workers may have it chosen for them, or \nsuffer the consequences. For example, the Senator from Missouri cited \nparts of the bill which say that the employer could not directly or \nindirectly intimidate, threaten, coerce, et cetera, or anything like \nthat. OK. But what if the employer did this? He could lawfully stop \noffering overtime to employees who do not participate in flexible \noptions, or they could give promotions\n\n[[Page S4343]]\n\nand raises only to those employees who participate. There is nothing in \nthe bill that prohibits that. That sends a strong signal to the \nemployees that they had better participate in what the employer has \ndecided, or they will not get offered overtime, or they don't get the \nright to promotion, or they don't get the right to raises. There is \nnothing in this bill that prevents that. So it may be a good deal for \nthe employer but it is a raw deal for the worker who usually receives \novertime pay.\n  This fundamental flaw was outlined clearly during the Labor Committee \nmarkup. Senator Kennedy offered an amendment that would have expressly \nmade it unlawful for an employer to discriminate in awarding overtime, \nor in awarding overtime based on an employee's willingness to accept \ncomptime instead of overtime pay. It was defeated on a straight party-\nline vote. Supporters of S. 4 say it prohibits coercion. The bill does \nnot account for the mild but effective pressure employees feel to \naccommodate their employer. Hourly workers have little leverage in the \nworkplace and are least likely to challenge the employer when it could \nmean their job, or loss of a promotion, or raise. The workers who rely \nmost heavily on overtime pay are the most vulnerable employees. \nConsider the following Department of Labor statistics: One-fourth of \nworkers who depend on overtime earn under $12,000 per year. Sixty-one \npercent earn $20,000, or less. More than 80 percent of overtime \nrecipients earn less than $28,000 a year. When you are making that kind \nof money, you can't afford to offend your employer.\n  Supporters of S. 4 often point out that there are remedies when an \nemployer coerces an employee to participate, again a very hollow right. \nWithout more resources for Department of Labor enforcement this is a \nsham, hollow promise. Employers violate current overtime provisions at \nan alarming rate. One-third, or 13,687, of the investigations by the \nDepartment of Labor in 1996 disclosed overtime violations. The \nDepartment ordered over $100 million in back pay for 170,000 workers \nwho were victims of those overtime violations. In addition, there was a \nbacklog of 16,000 unexamined complaints pending at the Department of \nLabor at the end of 1996. That backlog accounts for about 40 percent of \nthe annual number of complaints. In committee markup, Senator Wellstone \noffered an amendment that would delay the implementation of this bill \nuntil the backlog could be reduced to 10 percent. Again, it was \ndefeated on a party-line vote.\n  You say the employee has a right. They can go to the Department of \nLabor. They can file a complaint. But look at the odds against you. \nLook at the odds that you will ever be seen, at the odds that you will \never be compensated if 40 percent of them are still backlogged cases. \nPlus the fact many of these are low-income workers. They do not know \nabout filing complaints. They don't have an attorney. They are mainly \nscraping by week to week to take care of their families. If they get in \ntrouble on something like this, they talk about filing a complaint and \nthe employer says, ``You know something. I don't like the way you are \nperforming your job.'' Out the door, fired. They are going to say, \n``Boy, I am going to take my time and I am going to file this complaint \nwith the Department of Labor, and I am going to hire me an attorney, \nand I am going to get what is due me''? No. You know what they are \ngoing to do? They are out the door looking for a job. They don't have \nthe time and wherewithal to do that. They are out on the streets. They \nhave some kids to feed, and the rent to pay. So when you say that there \nare remedies, believe me those are very hollow remedies when you look \nat these statistics.\n\n  Again, despite the statistics that demonstrate overtime violations \nare just the cost of doing business for some industries, S. 4 doesn't \nmake any attempt to exempt such industries from coverage under this \nbill. For example, even though the Department of Labor has found that \nhalf the garment shops in the United States unlawfully pay less than \nthe minimum wage, fail to pay overtime, or use child labor, S. 4 \nprovides this industry a lawful way to get out of their overtime \nobligations. Think about that. The Department of Labor found that half \nof the garment shops pay less than the minimum wage, fail to pay \novertime, or use child labor. S. 4 would effectively say to this \nindustry you are exempt. This is the way to get out from underneath \nthat. Again, workers in these industries are the most vulnerable to \nemployee coercion, and the least likely to file any complaints.\n  During the committee markup, Senator Wellstone offered an amendment \nto exclude from coverage workers who would be particularly vulnerable \nto exploitation should comptime be offered at their worksites. The \nWellstone amendment would have excluded employees in the garment \nindustry as well as part-time seasonal and temporary employees, the \nmost vulnerable in our society. Again, the amendment was defeated on a \nparty-line vote.\n  Under this bill the employer has the last word when an employee can \nuse their comptime. The employer could lawfully deny comptime for any \nreason and the employee has no recourse. Let me repeat that. The \nemployee has no recourse if the employer denies comptime for any \nreason. This bill, S. 4, provides that an employee who requests the use \nof comptime off shall be permitted to use the comptime ``within a \nreasonable period,'' if it ``does not unduly disrupt the operations of \nthe employer.'' But nowhere in the bill are the terms ``reasonable \nperiod'' and ``unduly disrupt'' defined. They are not defined. So an \nemployee might give an employer 2 weeks' notice of his or her intent to \nuse comptime to take a child to the doctor and have that request denied \non the grounds of insufficient notice or the employer could claim that \nthe time off might unduly disrupt business.\n\n  There is no definition in the bill of these terms. Employees work \nhard to earn their comptime. They should be able to use it within a \nreasonable time unless it substantially interferes with the employer's \noperations. No one would want to change that.\n  Now, again, Senator Wellstone offered an amendment to ensure that an \nemployee could actually use the earned comptime when he or she needed \nto, but, again, the amendment was rejected on a straight party-line \nvote. Supporters claim they want to offer employees more flexibility, \nbut if the employee has little control over when they can use comptime, \nwhere, I ask you, is the flexibility? There is none.\n  And as if giving the employer all the flexibility was not enough, S. \n4 does not even provide for the protection of an employee's comptime. \nAccumulated comptime is an earned benefit that is accepted instead of \novertime pay. S. 4 does not contain sufficient protection to ensure \nthat workers whose employers go bankrupt will have some claim on their \nunpaid comptime. Let us be straight about this. Comptime is what an \nemployee chooses in lieu of overtime pay. I think that is pretty well \naccepted by everyone on both sides of the aisle. But what happens when \nan employer goes bankrupt? Do you have a claim on that? No. In 1994, \n845,300 businesses filed for bankruptcy. The rate of failure in the \ngarment industry was 146 per 10,000 firms, twice the national average. \nIn construction the rate of business failure was 91 per 10,000 firms. \nSo comptime should be treated as unpaid wages during a bankruptcy.\n  In addition, comptime should be calculated as hours worked for the \npurpose of calculating an employee's entitlement to overtime and \ncertain benefits tied to the number of hours worked. No such protection \nis found in this bill. No such protection. For example, a worker \ndecides to use 8 hours of banked comptime in order to take a 3-day \nweekend by taking a Monday off. There is no provision in this bill that \nwould prevent an employer from requiring that employee to work 10 hours \nTuesday through Friday without paying overtime because only 40 hours \nwould have been counted as worked.\n  So you bank the comptime. You take a Monday off for a 3-day weekend. \nYour kid has a day off from school. There is a teacher conference or \nsomething like that. Your kid gets a day off from school on Monday. You \nsay we are going to spend some family time this weekend. So I have got \nmy banked comptime. I want to take Monday off. I come back to work on \nTuesday and the employer says, OK, you are working 10 hours every day \nthis week and no overtime. No overtime. Why? Because there would only \nbe 40 hours a week. Talk about a disincentive to take comptime.\n\n[[Page S4344]]\n\n  So, again, businesses go bankrupt. You have overtime pay that is due \nyou. You have a claim in that bankruptcy court. But if you have banked \ncomptime, you are out of luck. Well, it ought to provide that if you \nhave banked comptime and it goes bankrupt, you ought to have a claim, \njust as if you had banked overtime pay due you.\n  Also, there is another interesting little feature about this bill I \ndo not think has been pointed out adequately enough. In many \nindustries, contributions to pensions are made for each hour that the \nemployee works. Overtime hours are considered hours worked for purposes \nof making contributions to these plans. But under this proposal, \nworkers taking comptime not only will lose overtime pay, but they will \nsuffer a reduction in pension benefits as well.\n  Imagine that. Imagine that. Now we have said, OK, guess what, \nemployee. We are going to make this flexible, as they say in this bill. \nAs I just pointed out, there isn't really much flexibility for the \nemployee. You can now take comptime in lieu of overtime. But what \nhappens if you have a defined benefit plan, a pension benefit plan. \nHours worked including overtime hours would mean that you could also \nmake contributions to that benefit plan. Well, if you take comptime, \nfirst of all, you lose the overtime pay. You say, OK, that's fine. I am \nwilling to lose the overtime pay for my comptime. OK, fine, but then \nyou suffer a reduction in your pension benefits as well. Another little \ntwist in this bill that makes it harder for employees to take comptime \nin lieu of overtime pay.\n\n  Now, again, in markup, Senator Wellstone offered an amendment to \ncount comptime as hours worked for this very purpose of making \ncontributions to their pension programs. Again, it was defeated on a \nparty line vote.\n  Now, my friend from Missouri talked a lot about he just wants for \npeople in the private sector to have what Federal employees have \nbecause Federal employees have this comptime, so he wants private \nsector people to have the same thing. Well, all right, first of all, I \ndo not believe that Federal employees should enjoy more rights than \nprivate sector employees. I supported the Congressional Accountability \nAct when we passed it in the last Congress. However, the public and \nprivate sector operate under very different circumstances. For one, \nGovernment agencies do not go in and out of business like thinly \ncapitalized enterprises in the private sector often do. So when a \npublic sector employee accrues comptime, they can count on eventually \nreceiving the benefits.\n  But as I just pointed out, in the garment industry or construction, \nwhere they have high rates of bankruptcies and failures, you may bank \nthe comptime. They go out of business. You are out of luck. Not so if \nyou work for the Government. You are going to get it.\n  Also, private sector employers are driven by the profit motive. That \nis as it should be. And as such they are more likely to press their \nemployees to take comptime rather than to pay overtime. Obviously, as I \nsaid, what manager does not want, what employer does not want to \nmaximize their profits to make a higher rate of return for their \nshareholders? That is their business. So, driven by the profit motive, \nthey would want an employee to take comptime rather than overtime pay.\n  In addition, aside from having a higher rate of unionized workplaces \ncompared to the private sector, most public workplace employees are \nunder the protection of civil service laws. That means if they are, in \nfact, singled out because of the choices they have made on the job, \nthere is a set body of law that provides for both substantive remedies \nand a meaningful procedure in order to enforce their rights. Civil \nservice laws.\n  For example, in the private sector, an employee can be fired for any \nreason at the will of the employer. In the public sector, employees can \nonly be fired for good cause. They are entitled to a hearing to \ndetermine this. So in the private sector, an employee could be fired \nfor not taking comptime, but not in the public sector--a big \ndifference.\n  Also, Federal employees are entitled by law to paid sick leave, paid \nvacation, health and retirement benefits. If we could amend this bill \nto provide private sector employees with all of that, maybe I could \nsupport this bill. So I would challenge those on the other side, \nespecially my friend from Missouri, amend the bill, provide the same \nkind of legal protections to employees in the private sector as \nemployees have in the public sector working for the Federal Government. \nMaybe you could make a case for this bill. But I daresay they are not \ngoing to want to do that.\n  Lastly, I would like to point out that much of the flexibility the \nsupporters of this legislation claim to want to offer is available \nright now. It is available now under existing law. So one has to wonder \nthat if employers can do these things now but they are not, what is the \nreal motivation, what is really behind their desire to get rid of the \n40-hour workweek? Is it really to provide the comptime on the \nemployer's side, or is it a way of saying, hey, this is a way I can \nimprove my bottom line, increase my profit margin, pay a little bit \nmore to the shareholders.\n\n  We got a real hint of this, Mr. President, at the Employment and \nTraining Subcommittee hearing on February 13 of this year. A \nrepresentative of the National Federation of Independent Businesses \nsaid:\n\n       Real small businesses. . . our members cannot afford to pay \n     their employees overtime. This (comptime) bill is something \n     they can offer in exchange that gives them a benefit.\n\n  Gives the employer some benefit.\n  Well, if S. 4 is supposed to be family friendly, employee driven, \ngiving flexibility to the employee as the supporters suggest, why are \nwe looking for ways to give the employer more benefits? But that is \nwhat the NFIB representative said, I think in a moment of unguarded \ncandor, if I might so state.\n  So the bottom line is this. When considering altering overtime \nprotections in current law, the rights of employees must be of \nparamount importance to any proposal affecting their time and \ncompensation. This proposal before us appears to be neither worker \nfriendly nor family friendly, and the result of its enactment would \nrequire employees to work longer hours for less pay.\n  Lastly, the Senator from Missouri went on at great lengths to say \nthat the special interests are ganging up to defeat this. Special \ninterests? Let me just read a few of the groups opposed to this bill: \nthe League of Women Voters, American Association of University Women, \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, the NAACP, the National Council of \nLa Raza, the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, the Union of \nAmerican Hebrew Congregations, the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, the National Council of Churches, on and on and on. Special \ninterests?\n  The fact remains, Mr. President, that every group that represents \nlow-income workers is opposed to this bill. Every group that represents \nlow-income workers is opposed to this bill. That is a fact. Special \ninterests? Not at all. Special interests, not opposed to this bill. But \nthose who understand what real life is about and who understand what \nthese low-income workers have to go through, they are opposed to this \nbill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield just for a brief question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know there are others who want to speak. I see my \nfriend, Senator Wellstone, in the Chamber. I commend Senator Harkin for \nmaking an excellent presentation. I hope the Senator will perhaps \nmention the coalition Members that are in support of this bill. The \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, the National Restaurant Association--they are \nnot shrinking violets in terms of special interest groups. But the \nbottom line is, as I understand the Senator from Iowa and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, we oppose comptime where employees cannot make the \ndecisions, as they can under the Family and Medical Leave Act and as \nFederal employees can. The situation might be different if the employee \ncould genuinely make the choice, but, under this bill, there is no \nchoice for the employee. Therefore, we oppose the bill. We draw the \nline where we say this is basically stacked against the employees. I \ntried to spell that out earlier. But I just welcome getting the \nSenator's reaction on that issue.\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\n  We are for trying to get those kinds of protections. We were for it \nin the committee, as the Senator knows, when we tried to get the Murray \namendment to give the 24 hours with the decision to be made by the \nemployees. It was voted down by the Republicans unanimously. In terms \nof the Dodd amendment, it was voted down by them again--where the \nemployee has it. When we get to the bottom line, is that not really the \nbasic issue which is at stake?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator is correct. That is the bottom line \nat stake. Are we really going to give the employee--are we going to \nempower the employee to make those decisions? This bill does not do \nthat. This bill actually just gives more power to the employer. It \ngives more power to the employer to take away from the employee the \nbenefits they have right now for overtime pay and the benefits they \nwould have from, really, accruing comptime.\n  As I said earlier, again, this is another one of the very bad ideas \nthat periodically come up through the Senate. It sounds good. What's it \ncalled? The Family Friendly Workplace Act? Ridiculous. I don't know who \nthinks up all these titles and these names. Nothing could be farther \nfrom the truth.\n  This is a bill--the intent may be good. I do not question the intent \nor motivation of my friend from Missouri at all. I just think it is \ngoing in the wrong direction. There are ways we can improve this bill. \nWe offered these amendments to the committee. Senator Wellstone, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Murray offered amendments to really make \nthis more like what Federal employees have now. The Senator from \nMissouri is right. Federal employees do have this--with good \nprotection, good comptime. As I point out in my statement, there is a \nlot of difference between the private sector employer and the public \nsector. If the Senator from Missouri wants to amend this bill to give \nprivate sector employees the same protections as civil service laws \ngive Federal employees, maybe he can make a case for this bill. But \nthat is not the case right now. So you cannot compare Federal employees \nwith employees in the private sector.\n  This is just an example of good intentions gone awry. Good \nintentions, I think, messed up by other special interest groups that \nhave come in, as Senator Kennedy pointed out. Who is for the bill? As I \npointed out, every group representing low-income workers is opposed to \nthis bill. If this was such a good bill, they would be for it. I think \nthat is the proof of what this bill is all about. It is a bad bill. It \nought to be defeated. I am sure we will have some amendments, and I am \nsure the Senate in its wisdom will defeat this bill and put it back in \nthe files where it belongs. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Federal employees have enjoyed flexible \nwork schedules since 1978. It is time to give private sector employees \nthe same options. Today's work rules are too inflexible, and this \nlegislation changes that to meet the needs of today's working families.\n  The bill provides employees with several options in determining their \nwork schedules.\n  First, workers would have the option of paid flexible leave. An \nemployee might choose to work 35 hours one week and 45 hours the next, \nand still receive a full paycheck.\n  Second, an employee could set 2-week schedules totaling 80 hours in \nany combination. This would not change the 40-hour work week, as some \nhave said. The Family Friendly Workplace Act simply adds a section to \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act to create options for employees who want \nflexible work schedules. In addition, this cannot be forced upon an \nemployee. It must be agreed to by the employee and the employer.\n  Third, employees could choose to take time and a half off instead of \novertime. Up to 240 hours of comptime could be banked. Employees would \nalso have the option of cashing out accrued hours for overtime pay at a \nlater date.\n  No employee would be required to participate in any of these \nprograms, and coercion or intimidation by the employer with respect to \nparticipation is prohibited. Strict penalties in this bill ensure that \nthese arrangements will be voluntary. Let me reiterate that all of \nthese options are 100 percent voluntary for workers. Nothing would \nchange for employees who want to work a standard schedule. Employers \nwould still have to pay time and a half for any overtime hours put in \nby an employee in any week, if that is what the employee wants.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1960 just 39 percent \nof women who had children between the ages of 6 and 17 were in the work \nforce. Today, 76 percent of mothers with school-age children are \nworking. This increase of working families is not compatible with the \none-size-fits-all workplace laws enacted in the 1930's.\n  I urge my colleagues to support giving working families the \nopportunity to balance their work and family obligations by supporting \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators on the \nfloor. We are undoubtedly going to be back on this bill with plenty of \nopportunity for amendments and work on it, so I am going to try to be \nvery brief in deference to a number of colleagues. I know my colleague \nfrom Texas has to leave very soon, and I see a colleague from Maine \nhere.\n  My disappointment is that the version of S. 4 that we see right now \non the floor is a harsh version. It is not going to pass. It is going \nto go nowhere.\n  I would really like to see us do some work together. We had several \nsubcommittee hearings that I thought were productive. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator DeWine from Ohio, for his leadership. We had a \nrespectful markup. There was discussion in the markup, where amendments \nwere voted down on a straight party vote, in which some of our \ncolleagues appeared interested in modifications and ways of making this \na better bill, changes that could bring people together--fixing the \nbill. That just has not happened. I know there is a managers' \namendment. But a lot of concerns that have been raised just have not \nbeen spoken to.\n  The House bill, remember, passed narrowly. That bill was a much more \nmoderate version than this Senate bill. It did not have the 80-hour \nbiweekly work period framework. It did not have the so-called flextime. \nIt was a straight comptime bill. In my view, anything that essentially \ntakes the Fair Labor Standards Act and turns it on its head is not \ngoing to go anywhere. That is what the 80-hour framework does. And \nflextime, which offers little to the employee, does the same thing. I \ndon't believe that anything that is hour for hour as opposed to time \nand a half is going to go anywhere either.\n  So I find it surprising and discouraging that we are discussing this \nparticular version of this bill. It is not going to be enacted into \nlaw. I really wonder why we are debating it in its present form.\n  I believe there is some work we can do on the bill. Maybe we can do \nit through amendments and come out of here with a piece of legislation \nthat we can all get behind. But whatever the bill's press materials \npromise about it, the fact of the matter is that in its current form \nthe bill turns the clock back half a century. It is simply not going to \nwork. My colleague, for example, came to the floor and was angry about \nads that have been run. This is the first time I heard what those ads \nhave to say. But reading from the script of one of the ads, a portion \nof the voiceover says:\n\n       Big business is moving to gut a law protecting our right to \n     overtime pay. If they win, employers could pay workers with \n     time off instead of money.\n\n  That is true. That is absolutely true.\n  In theory, you could say employees have a right to choose. But the \nreality of the pattern of power between employees and employers is that \nquite often employees do not have that power to choose.\n  Then the ad says:\n\n       They say the choice will be up to us. But there are no real \n     safeguards to keep employers from pressuring workers to \n     accept time off, or telling them when to take it.\n\n  That also is true. I pointed out in subcommittee and in committee \nexamples of ways in which overtime law is being violated right now. \nThere is a backlog of complaints at the Department of Labor. Regardless \nof the theory of the bill, it could very well happen that coercion will \ntake place.\n  Finally, and I know my colleague from Missouri, whom I enjoy as a\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\nfriend, was very worked up about this portion:\n\n       You could work up to 40 additional hours a week before \n     qualifying for overtime pay.\n\n  That provision is not in the House version of comptime. But in \ntheory, that is true of this Senate version. I don't think it would \nhappen, but the fact of the matter is, when you go from a 40-hour week \nto an 80-hour biweekly timeframe, that is exactly what could happen. \nSomebody could work 80 hours one week and not work the next week at \nall, but for the 80 hours they worked for that first week, there would \nbe no overtime pay for the hours worked over 40 hours. That could \nhappen. That is true. I don't think it would happen. But there is a \nreal danger here, if you don't limit the bill to comptime, of employers \nbeing in a situation--and they really do have the power most of the \ntime--where they basically can say to employees: We are interested in \nthe flextime option. We are interested in your working overtime 1 week \nand taking more time off the next week. But we are not interested in \ntime and a half, premium compensation, which you would earn with \ncomptime.\n\n  Employers are in the driver's seat. The real problem is that the bill \ndoes not provide the flexibility that it purports to provide. That is a \nhuge problem.\n  There are two principles, and I am skipping over a lot of what I \nwanted to say. There are two basic principles at a minimum, I say to my \ncolleague from Missouri, that will be required to make comptime work \nfor employees and give them real flexibility. These should be the basis \nfor the work we do together.\n  First, it has to be truly voluntary. There has to be some language \nthat puts more teeth into the voluntariness. Frankly, there is not \nright now.\n  Second, employees must really get to use their accumulated comptime \nwhen they want and need to use it. That was the why of one of the \namendments I introduced, which said we have the Family and Medical \nLeave Act. FMLA makes clear in which cases we let families take some \ntime off, even though millions of people are not covered right now. In \nany case, this bill would be an opportunity to say to somebody with \nbanked comptime: It's your time. You have earned it. If you have that \ntime and now you need to take time off because you need to go to a PTA \nmeeting or have an illnes in the family, or for that matter you are \nhaving problems at home and have been battered, where there are \nproblems of domestic abuse and you need to take time off, you should be \nable to take that time off. There should not be any question about it. \nYou have earned it as compensation for hours worked. It should not be \nup to the employer to decide whether you can use it if FMLA reasons \nexist.\n  So I just want to make it clear that at the moment I do not see this \nas a Family Friendly Workplace Act. I do not see it as a Mother's Day \npresent. It is not truly voluntary. We cannot change a piece of \nlegislation that people have given their sweat, blood and tears for, \nwhich is what we are talking about when we talk about the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, unless you keep the integrity of it. We are not doing \nthat here.\n  So there are some huge problems. The bill is not truly voluntary, No. \n1. It moves away from a 40-hour week. It sets up a 2-week, 80-hour \nframework. That is not in the House bill. I think that has to be out of \nthe bill. It has a flextime option which is just hour for hour. In my \nview, if we want to get something passed here, we should be making it \ncomptime and we should then say to people, look, we want to give you \nreal choice and the flexibility of using that time when you want and \nneed to use it.\n  But I say to my colleagues that at this point in time, I don't know \nwhat the majority leader's intentions were, but I think it is fine to \ndebate, it is fine to talk. It is not pointless, but this legislation \nis not going anywhere, not in its present form.\n  I believe Senator DeWine is very committed to working out a \ncompromise, and I believe my colleague from Missouri is also committed \nto a compromise. Maybe the strategy is to stake out an extreme \nposition, with the idea that it helps for negotiating purposes. I don't \nmean to incur my colleagues' wrath--but I say to them, this is not a \nMother's Day present, not in its present form. It is not a Family \nFriendly Workplace Act, not in its present form. However you package \nit, and however you try to market it, and however you try to advertise \nit, the fact of the matter is, you don't have the flexibility for the \nemployee; you take the Fair Labor Standards Act and you turn it on its \nhead. You go to an 80-hour framework and you should not. Then on \ncomptime, you don't really make sure employees truly will have the \nchoice, which is what I thought it was about.\n  We had some amendments that lost on a straight party-line vote. So \nlet's get rid of the extreme provisions of this legislation, let's talk \nabout the comptime part. Let's talk about how a family, a woman or a \nman can have this choice between time and a half for overtime pay or \ntime-and-a-half overtime for time needed to be with family. Let's make \nsure that employees have the flexibility to truly be able to make this \nchoice, that it is not one sided and just for employers. Let's make \nsure that we really establish a kind of cooperative arrangement. But \nthat is not what this bill does.\n  I say with some disappointment to a good friend, I oppose it. I think \nthat we will have a strong vote against it. I have to say, it is one of \nthese situations--I promise my colleague from Texas, I will be done in \n1 minute now, I know she wants to speak--but really Florence Reese \nwrote the song, ``Which Side Are You On?'' I heard my colleague from \nMissouri cite that lyric. I know it by heart because my wife is from \nHarlan County, KY. It is a great song. It was written during all the \ncoal mining strikes. Of course, you know it's a strong union song.\n  The fact of the matter is, when I look at the lineup of who is \nopposed to this bill, and I see all these unions and all these \norganizations that have fought for civil rights and human rights and \nfor women over the years, I guess I do know who's side I am on. I am on \nthe side of working people.\n  This piece of legislation could be for working people, but in its \npresent form, it is going nowhere. There are going to be Senators, and \nI certainly count myself as one of them, who will oppose this with \neverything we have, and I think we can stop it. I hope we get to the \npoint of having some amendments, figuring out ways we can come together \nand pass a piece of legislation, but not in this form. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is somewhat surprising, and not very \nencouraging, that we are considering such a harsh version of S. 4 \ntoday. The bill before us is essentially the version which was reported \nout of the Labor Committee on a straight party-line vote. That vote \nfollowed rejection by a majority on the committee of a number of \namendments which would have improved the bill considerably. All those \namendments were defeated on a straight party-line vote.\n  This version of S. 4 makes almost no changes which directly address \nthe serious and substantive problems in the bill during committee \nconsideration. The managers' amendment has just been made available \nthis morning, so we have not been able to examine it in detail. But it \ndoes not appear to be much of an effort to make the bill more \nacceptable to those who have made a real effort to improve the bill so \nfar.\n  It is surprising and discouraging that we are considering this \nparticular version of S. 4 for two reasons.\n  First, many of our colleagues are aware that a comptime bill has \npassed the House of Representatives. That bill is considerably milder \nthan this bill in its undermining of basic, long-respected labor \nprotections. The House-passed bill does not directly undercut the 40-\nhour workweek. It does not give employers the option of offering only \nhour-for-hour compensatory time off in exchange for overtime work--so-\ncalled flextime.\n  Still, the House bill passed narrowly, and it passed under the threat \nof a likely veto by the President. The President has said he would like \nto sign a comptime bill. But the Department of Labor has signaled that \nthe President would likely veto a bill like the House bill. In my \nopinion, a veto of the House-passed bill would clearly be warranted \nbecause that bill does not meet the standards of anyone who is serious \nabout trying to help employees cope with the competing demands of work \nand families.\n\n[[Page S4347]]\n\n  The House has narrowly passed a bill which likely would, and \ncertainly should, be vetoed. So what is the Senate doing today? Here in \nthe Senate we are considering a bill that is a far blunter and a far \nmore dangerous attack on workers with families, a bill which we all \nknow cannot be enacted in its present form. We know an 80-hour biweekly \nwork period will not become law. Why are we debating it? Do we think \nthe public is fooled by a bill which does away with the 40-hour \nworkweek simply because the measure's proponents say it is voluntary?\n  It is somewhat absurd. If a Member came and offered a bill doing away \nwith the minimum wage--but on a voluntary basis--we would not take it \nseriously. If a bill offered employees the voluntary choice of working \nregularly in conditions which threaten life and limb, we would not take \nit seriously. A bill doing away with the 40-hour workweek cannot be \nenacted as drafted, and it should not even be taking our time here \ntoday.\n  The second reason I find it surprising and discouraging that we are \ndiscussing this particular version of comptime is that I sat through \ntwo hearings on this topic in the Labor Subcommittee on Employment and \nTraining, where I serve as ranking minority member. I heard a great \ndeal of illuminating testimony during the subcommittee hearings. I also \nengaged, as did others in the Labor Committee, in a respectably \nrigorous markup of this bill in the full committee.\n  During these subcommittee and committee meetings we heard a number of \nexpressions of sympathy and concern from Republican colleagues \nregarding criticisms of S. 4 raised by myself and others. These \nexpressions of concern might have been slightly more persuasive if even \none Republican could have found a way to vote for even one Democratic \namendment in the committee. Nonetheless, I thought I detected a desire \nto make this a workable bill. There were suggestions that ways might be \nfound to fix problems in the bill.\n  Some of us thought that there would be an effort to address the more \nserious of our concerns between committee and the floor. But the minor \nchanges in the managers' amendment, with one exception do not begin to \ndo that. I will come back to the managers' amendment and our detailed \ncriticisms of this bill's comptime provisions later.\n  But what we have before us today is hardly an effort at \naccommodation. The bill in its current form is little more than an \naffront. Not only have the most offensive provisions for employees--the \n80-hour biweekly work period and so-called flextime--not been pulled \nfrom the bill. But the comptime provisions which could be the basis of \ndiscussion and agreement remain largely unchanged.\n  Mr. President, many of us on the minority side would like nothing \nbetter than to help provide genuine flexibility to working Americans \nwith families. That is what this bill's press materials promise it \nwould do. That is what some of us set out to do 4 years ago when we \npushed hard to win eventual passage of the Family Medical Leave Act. \nSome of today's proponents of S. 4 issued dire warnings back then that \nthe FMLA would harm businesses and the economy. It hasn't. The FMLA has \nworked well.\n  That is why our side offered two amendments to S. 4 in committee \nwhich would have expanded the FMLA. Millions of workers do not \ncurrently enjoy the benefits of the FMLA. Millions who do are able to \nuse it only for medical reasons, not for other times of true family \nneed and importance, such as parent-teacher conferences. This bill \npurports to provide greater flexibility to employees, so we sought to \nexpand the ability to take unpaid leave in exceptional family \ncircumstances. Unfortunately, both amendments to that effect were \ndefeated.\n  Many of us on the minority side also would like nothing better than \nto allow working Americans with families to get more control over their \nwork schedules. What could be more important than to help people juggle \nwork and family by getting more control over their work schedules?\n  That was the motivation behind an amendment I offered in committee \nwhich would have ensured that employees who accumulate comptime as \nenvisioned by this bill would actually get to use it when they want and \nneed to use it. That seemed simple enough.\n  If the idea of the bill is to help employees get control of their \nwork schedules, if the idea is to be family friendly, then people who \naccumulate comptime under this bill, which is compensation that has \nalready been earned at some prior date, not vacation or some other \nbenefit conferred by the employer, but previously earned compensation, \nshould be able to use it when they want and need to use it.\n  My amendment included very reasonable restrictions to avoid harm to \nemployers. It was an honest amendment. It sought to take this bill at \nits word. At least it sought to take the bill at the word of its \nown advertising. It sought to provide employees who have families just \na little more control over their work schedules by allowing them to \nchoose when it is that they use their earned comptime.\n\n  In the case of this bill, however, its advertising and its content \nare not the same thing at all. Undoubtedly, many workers who may have \nheard this bill described by it proponents, who may even have heard it \ndescribed as a Mother's Day gift to working mothers, probably have \nassumed that if the bill passes and they earn comptime, then they will \nbe able, within reason, to choose when to use that comptime. Sadly, \nthey would be wrong. This bill does not provide for that. My amendment \nsought to repair this fairly obvious, fairly egregious flaw. But it was \ndefeated.\n  Many of us on the minority side even find the idea of a truly \nvoluntary choice between cash overtime on one hand, and paid time off \nat a premium rate on the other--in other words, between cash overtime \nand comptime--to be an attractive idea on its face. We think comptime \nmight be able to work to the benefit of both employers and employees if \nit is drafted properly.\n  Therefore, in the committee we offered a number of additional \namendments whose purpose was to take seriously the idea that comptime \nis indeed meant to deliver on what the title of S. 4 promises. The bill \nis called the Family Friendly Workplace Act. All those amendments were \ndefeated.\n  Comptime will not be an easy idea to make work in a way that is truly \nvoluntary. A lot of care must go into drafting such a bill. It is worth \nremembering that the Fair Labor Standards Act has served both employers \nand employees well since its initial passage in 1938. We should amend \nit with care. Nonetheless, the whole law is not sacred. Democrats and \nworking people are not stuck in the past. If we can move forward, and \nnot turn back the clock, it might be possible and desirable to change \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act. But not in the way this bill suggests--\nnot in a way that attempts to turn back the clock when it comes to \nbasic workplace protections.\n  After the two hearings we held in the Labor Committee's Subcommittee \non Employment and Training, I was frankly skeptical about whether \ncomptime could be made truly voluntary and beneficial for employees. It \nwas the testimony of some of the majority witnesses which made me even \nmore skeptical than I was before the hearings. Looking at the version \nof the bill which has now been brought to the floor, my skepticism \nappears to have been justified. But still I think comptime could be \nattractive for many working people if it is drafted properly.\n  There are two basic principles which at a minimum are required to \nmake comptime attractive for employees: First, it must be truly \nvoluntary; second, employees must really get to use their accumulated \ncomptime when they want and need to use it.\n  A number of additional protections would be necessary as details to \nmake comptime work. But these two principles are fundamental.\n  As currently drafted, S. 4 fails both tests. It has additional \nproblems, but above all S. 4 as drafted barely even pretends to be \nabout providing flexibility for working people. It is flexibility for \nemployers. It is flexibility for employers, combined with ways to cut \npay for employees. It disfigures what could be a decent idea, comptime, \nand it adds provisions that even leaders in the House of \nRepresentatives did not attempt, which would directly cut workers' pay.\n  Mr. President, we all understand the game of staking out an extreme \nposition in the hope that you can get more\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\nof what you want through creating the illusion of compromise from a \ndrastic proposal. I hope we will not spend our time on that game. But \nit appears that is the game we are playing with this bill.\n  Let us just drop the 80-hour biweekly work period from the bill. It \nis not a real proposal. It is an insult to working people with \nfamilies. Many workers face enough indignities without Congress adding \nto them. Let us drop this frontal attack on the principle of the 40-\nhour work week.\n  Second, let us drop the flex hours provision from this bill. That is \nthe provision which would ask workers to work overtime with no premium \ncompensation, only hour-for-hour paid time off.\n  These are provisions which not even the House of Representatives \nincluded in their bill. No one can argue with a straight face that \nthese are not pay-cut provisions. Their purpose is to cut pay. The \nPresident will not sign a bill with such provisions. The 80-hour and \nthe flextime provisions simply detract and distract from the debate we \nshould have about comptime.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude with some remarks about \nworking families.\n  S. 4 is called the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I believe the \nfriendliest thing we could probably do for most working people who have \nfamilies in America would be to increase their pay. We did that for \nmillions of American workers last year. Perhaps the minimum wage bill \nwhich was so fiercely resisted by a number of colleagues on the \nmajority side and by a number of groups who are supporting S. 4 should \nhave been called the Family Friendly Workplace Act.\n  But whether that is true or not, I believe it is safe to say that any \nobjective person who reads this bill, S. 4, carefully, a person with \nsome familiarity with modern workplaces, might wonder whether its title \nis actually a grim attempt at humor. They might wonder whether the \ntitle, ``Family Friendly Workplace Act,'' is really a mean-spirited and \nsarcastic message to working Americans. That is because no one who \nreads this bill carefully, in its current form, could reasonably \ndescribe it as family friendly.\n  S. 4 as written is family-unfriendly. It is a thinly disguised effort \nto reduce pay and to help employers avoid paying overtime. That is not \njust rhetoric. That is the bill. I wonder how many families will \nconsider this bill to represent a friendly gesture when we strip it of \nits happy-face packaging and expose it for what it is: an effort to \nreduce pay and to help employers avoid paying overtime?\n  Plenty of employers do try to avoid paying overtime already under \ncurrent law. And far too many succeed, as we will see later during our \ndebate. We don't need to provide encouragement to cut more pay and \navoid paying more overtime.\n  We will continue to debate S. 4. I look forward to a debate over a \nnumber of amendments. I hope to offer one or more myself. I hope that \ndebate can focus on how to construct a truly voluntary and beneficial \ncomptime bill.\n  But a bill which features two pay-cutting options out of a total of \nthree options for employers and employees is not family friendly.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to add a brief remark concerning the \nManagers' amendment. I appreciate the Senator from Ohio's description \nof it. While we are only seeing it now for the first time, I think we \ncan say that it doesn't go very far toward addressing the deep, \nsubstantive concerns many of us have raised against S. 4.\n\n  We had some discussion during the committee markup. There was some \nhope that we could actually work together to make this bill acceptable. \nBut this amendment, as I understand it, makes fairly minor changes--\nwith one exception.\n  My understanding of the managers' amendment is that it changes the \nbill's definition of who would be considered a covered employee. That \nis a substantive step. The change takes a step toward addressing a \ncriticism we raised in committee. It ensures that many part-time and \ntemporary workers would not be covered by the bill's provisions. I \ndon't believe the change goes nearly far enough in exempting vulnerable \nworkers. But it is a move in the correct direction.\n  The additional changes, again, as I understand them, we are just now \nseeing them, are minor. One change which we discussed, and which I had \nhoped we would have agreement on, concerned bankruptcy. I was prepared \nto offer an amendment in committee to ensure that workers with \naccumulated comptime would be able to collect on that earned \ncompensation in case of employer bankruptcy. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. \nDeWine] indicated that he hoped to address the problem. It is my \nunderstanding now that the majority does intend to fix that portion of \nthe bill, although the problem is not addressed by the managers' \namendment. I hope we can correct that flaw.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I were just a person sitting out \nthere watching this debate, I think my first question would be, ``Well, \nwhy can't an employee go to his or her employer and say, `I'd like to \ntake time off at 3 o'clock on Friday, and could I work extra next \nweek?' '' I am sure people are scratching their heads and saying, \n``What would prevent them from doing that?''\n  The law prevents them from doing that if they are hourly employees. \nThe great Big Brother Federal Government says ``No, no, Mrs. Smith, you \ncannot go to your employer and ask for time off at 3 o'clock to attend \nJohn's soccer game on Friday afternoon and suggest making it up next \nweek. You can't do it if you are an hourly employee,'' because the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, which was passed in 1938 when fewer than 10 \npercent of families had both spouses in the workplace, prohibits \nDorothy Smith from being able to go in and say, ``I'd like to go to \nJohn's soccer game on Friday afternoon, and could I work an extra hour \non Monday and Tuesday?''\n  So now Dorothy, who is one of two-thirds of the working women in \nAmerica who have school-age children, is being subject to a law that \nwas passed in 1938 that does not even relate to the workplace today.\n  Mr. President, with the Family Friendly Workplace Act we are trying \nto bring our labor laws into the 21st century to reflect the changing \nface of working America and to meet the growing demands of work and \nfamily. We realize that two-thirds of the working women in this country \nhave school-age children, and that what they need most is a little \nrelief from the stress caused by being both the provider at work and \nthe caretaker at home. When their child comes up to them and says, \n``Mommy, can't you come to my tennis game,'' ``Can't you come to my \nbaseball game this afternoon,'' mommy will no longer have to say, ``No, \nI'm sorry, there is just no way because Federal law won't allow me to \ndo it.\n  I have to say, Senator Ashcroft has provided great leadership on this \nissue, because until he proposed this bill, I was not fully aware of \nthe restrictions the Fair Labor Standards Act was placing on the hourly \nworking men and women of this country. I, like most Americans, thought \nit common sense that an hourly employee would have the ability to work \na few extra hours 1 week in order to take a few hours off in another \nweek. In fact, as the need for this bill demonstrates, the hourly \nemployee in America has fewer hours than virtually every other class of \nworkers. A salaried employee can work out flexible work arrangements \nwith his or her employer. A Federal employee at any level can do this, \nbut not an hourly employee in the private sector.\n  Mr. President, I don't see the logic. In fact, when the bill was \npassed in 1978 to allow hourly Federal workers to have this right, this \nvery important flextime/comptime right, Senator Kennedy, who is now \nopposing comptime/flextime for private sector workers, cosponsored that \nvery legislation.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts say that our \nlegislation could allow coercion of employers into taking or not taking \ntime off in lieu of overtime pay. In fact, the bill that he cosponsored \nto extend comptime and flextime to Federal workers allows Federal \nagencies to make acceptance of comptime in lieu of overtime a condition \nof employment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest it is the legislation that the Senator from \nMassachusetts supported, not the present\n\n[[Page S4349]]\n\nbill, that allows for coercion. Far from allowing employers to make \ncomptime or flextime a condition of employment, S. 4 gives employees \nthe absolute right to refuse any of these new options, and provides for \nsevere penalties for employers who might pressure employees one way or \nthe other.\n  In fact, neither the employee or the employer has the ability to \ndictate whether the other chooses to participate in a comptime or \nflextime option. Either side can say, ``No thank you.'' If the employer \nsays on Friday, ``I need you to work 2 extra hours today,'' the \nemployee then has the right to say, ``That's fine, and I will take that \nin overtime pay,'' or ``That's fine, and I would like to bank that at a \ntime-and-a-half rate to take later on as free time.'' Likewise, if an \nemployee goes to the employer and says, ``I would like to work 2 \novertime hours this Friday and take those off with pay next Monday,'' \nthe employer has the right to say, ``I'm sorry, but it doesn't work \ninto the schedule this week.''\n\n  But Mr. President, let me make one point clear. Once an employee has \naccrued either comptime or flextime, the employee would have the legal \nright to take that time, with pay, with reasonable notice to the \nemployer, so long as taking the time does not unduly disrupt the \noperations of the business. If the standard were otherwise, Mr. \nPresident, scant few employers would even want to offer comptime or \nflextime, for fear that it might shut down their business if too many \nemployees left at some critical time. A florist simply could not afford \nto lose his or her employees around Valentine's or Mother's Day, for \nexample. For my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to argue that \nemployees should have the absolute, unfettered right to take time off \nwhenever they choose for other than serious health or family needs is \ndisingenuous. They know that doing so is unreasonable and would prevent \nworkers from having any flexibility because most employers would not be \nable to offer a comptime or flextime program.\n  In fact, in the bill that was sponsored by Senators Kennedy, Dodd and \nothers that extended comptime and flextime to Federal workers \nrecognized this. The bill they supported also allows Federal workers to \ntake comptime only within a reasonable period after the employee makes \nthe request and only if the use does not unduly disrupt the operations \nof the Government agency. That is exactly the same standard in our bill \ntoday. By the way, Mr. President, it is also the exact same standard \nthat provides for non-emergency leave under the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, again supported by my many if not most of my colleagues who \nnow oppose this bill.\n  But Mr. President, I think the essence of this bill is not whether \nthe employer or the employee have the upper hand legally speaking, \nbecause this bill puts them on an even playing field. Rather, it is a \nmatter of the employee and the employer coming together. The only \nreason an employee would want to take comptime or flextime is so that \nthey can restore some measure of control and sanity to their workweek. \nThe only reason an employer would want to offer comptime or flextime is \nso that his or her employees will be more engaged, fulfilled, and \nultimately more productive at their jobs. This bill truly will create \nmillions of win-win arrangements throughout this country, where both \nemployer and employee walk away happy.\n  The employer might say, ``Gosh, we've got a big order that has to go \nout on Friday. Could we, instead, have you work overtime Friday rather \nthan Monday,'' assuming that wasn't the time the employee asked for \ntime off, say it was Thursday. So, of course, the employer can say, \n``Well, could you do it at this time?'' I think reasonable people will \nbe able to work this out.\n  I thought it was very interesting that the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, Senator Harkin said, ``Gosh, what if you have biweekly schedules \nand a person works 60 hours in 1 week and 20 hours the next week? That \nmay make it harder to find child care.'' What if the person is having a \nhard time finding child care in the Monday and Tuesday of the following \nweek and would like to go to her employer and say, ``I would like to \nwork extra hours this week when I have child care and take off 2 days \nnext week when I don't have child care?''\n  The point, Mr. President, is that we are trying to give more options \nto the hourly employee of this country. I ask the labor unions, what \nare you afraid of? Why wouldn't you want hourly employees to have this \nright, because, in fact, you know we have protected labor union \ncontracts in this bill. If employees are under a labor union contract, \nthen this law simply does not apply. If the labor union doesn't allow \nthem to, this bill would not extend to them the right to take comptime \nor flextime. Labor contracts will not in any way be violated. So why is \nlabor so afraid of this bill? Why would they not allow the hourly \nemployees of our country who don't have labor contracts to have the \nright to have some added flexibility and manageability in their \nschedules.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is very important for us to put in \nperspective that we are adding another option for the hourly employees \nof this country, because we know that what moms need most if they are \nworking is relief from stress. They need the option of time. This \ndoesn't say they have to take comptime instead of overtime; but it \ngives them the option.\n  Recent polls show that these are options that working Americans are \noverwhelmingly demanding. More and more people in the workplace are \nsaying, ``I'd rather have the time. I would rather have the ability to \ngo home and spend more time with my children, without losing any money \nin my paycheck.''\n  A recent Money magazine survey found 64 percent of the public and 68 \npercent of women would choose time off over cash for overtime work. So, \nwhy would we not give the option to those working women to get that \ntime--without wrecking their budgets, I might add?\n\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act, as some have called for expanding, \ngives them time off, but it is not paid time off. We are talking about \npaid time off in this bill, so that working parents do not have to \nworry about making the mortgage payment or making the car payment if \nthey take that 2 hours off for their child's soccer game. If their \nbudget is a little tight this month because they had an extra visit to \nthe dentist or the car breaks down, then the employee always has the \nright to take the cash for the hours he or she has banked. But if they \nhave a secure budget and would rather have a little extra paid time to \ngo to the soccer game, to go to the PTA meeting, to go to the baseball \ngame, the Family Friendly Workplace Act gives them that option. It is \nan added advantage. It takes nothing away. That is what is important \nfor all of us to remember.\n  When the labor unions say, ``We think this is a bad bill,'' what are \nthey afraid of? The Federal employees who have this right now love it. \nThe polls show they love it. A recent Government Accounting Office \nsurvey found that Federal employees are pleased with their comptime and \nflextime options, 10 to 1. They love being able to work flexible \nschedules, like the very popular 9-hour days for 8 days, 8 hours the \nnext day, then taking every other Friday off. They love that option to \nget to go on a camping trip on Friday or participate in a child's \nschool activity. One parent here in the Washington, DC, area even \ntalked about how wonderful it was that she and so many other parents at \nher child's school who were Federal employees are able to attend plays, \nfootball games, and other school activities on Fridays. She talked \nabout the pride she felt at being able to see her son play football at \nso many Friday games. I think it is high time that every hourly worker \nin America have that same ability and right.\n  Mr. President, we will apparently have a long time to talk about this \nbill because Senator Wellstone and others have signaled they may try \nand filibuster this bill. He is going to try to avoid a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate on whether we are going to give the 60 million \nhourly working men and women in this country the same opportunity for \nflexible scheduling that the rest of the country enjoys. They want to \navoid a vote to be able to tell that working mother that ``Yes, you can \ntake Friday afternoon off, with pay, in order to see your child in a \nschool play or to take your child to the doctor.\n  I think for them to filibuster this bill and not give that added \nright to hourly employees begs--begs--for an explanation.\n\n[[Page S4350]]\n\n  Mr. President, I see our distinguished majority leader has come to \nthe floor. I am happy to yield the floor and just say, in closing, that \nwe will not give up this bill. If they are going to filibuster it, they \nwill know we are going to fight for the hourly working moms in this \ncountry to spend more time with their children and at the same time be \nable to make the home mortgage payment and the car payment. Thank you, \nMr. President, and I again want to thank the distinguished gentleman \nfrom Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, as well as the distinguished committee \nand subcommittee chairmen, Senator Jeffords and Senator DeWine, for \ntheir leadership and hard work on this most important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas for her remarks today and on several occasions with regard \nto the working mothers of this country and the women who would benefit \nfrom this opportunity, as well as her work on the spousal IRA last \nyear. In so many ways she has raised our sensitivity to ways that we \ncan help the working women and the moms of America.\n  She was on the air this morning shortly after 7 o'clock, speaking up \nabout this important legislation. I hear her often at all hours of the \nday. She is doing a great job. I commend her for her leadership.\n  I also want to thank the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, \nSenator DeWine from Ohio, Senator Jeffords, all of the Members who have \nworked to bring this legislation to the floor. S. 4 is probably one of \nthe most important things we can do this year to help the workers of \nAmerica have flexibility with their work schedules, to deal with the \ncomptime issue in a different way that is more beneficial to them. This \nis very important legislation.\n  I had hoped we could come together on an agreement on getting it \ncompleted and moving it through the Congress and on to the President \nfor his signature. There were indications in the administration that \nthey would like to do it, and from the Democratic leadership. So far, \nit has not happened. But we feel this is so important we must bring it \nto a foreseeable conclusion and make sure that the amendments that are \noffered are relevant.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee \n     amendment to calendar No. 32, S. 4, the Family Friendly \n     Workplace Act of 1997.\n         Trent Lott, John Ashcroft, Susan M.

For the information of all Senators, the cloture vote on S. \n4 will occur on Thursday, May 15, and I ask unanimous consent the vote \ntime be determined by the majority leader after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader and that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to S. 4, the \nFamily Friendly Workplace Act. At a time when we should be debating \nways to raise the wages of working Americans to reverse two decades of \ndecline, S. 4 proposes comptime policies which will place additional \ndownward pressure on the standard of living of working Americans. \nRather than seeking a bipartisan solution to give great flexibility to \nworkers without jeopardizing their income, S. 4 unnecessarily \nundermines longstanding wage protections afforded American workers.\n  The problem is simple: Working families today find both their time \nand financial resources stretched to the breaking point. The average \nworking family has not seen their income increase over the past 20 \nyears. In almost two-thirds of families, both mom and dad have to work \nto make ends meet. Financial resources and family time both are at a \npremium.\n  Manifestations of the problem are easy to manage, and they occur in \nvarious forms every day. We have heard much discussion about the \nworking mom and her problems. The working mom, for example, might get a \ncall from her daughter's school, and the teacher requests a meeting \nexplaining that the child's grades have slipped, and normally the child \nis a very attentive child, but she has become disruptive. Concerned \nabout her daughter, who is usually a good student, mom seeks to \nschedule a teacher conference as quickly as possible without \ndiminishing her income. The factory where she works is currently busy, \nso she approaches the manager and requests to work an hour of overtime \nthis week so she can take an hour and a half to see her daughter's \nteacher next Thursday.\n  How would S. 4 address this problem? Unfortunately, the answer is, \ninadequately, if at all. First, under S. 4, a worker cannot avail \nherself of the program. Comptime is provided solely at the discretion \nof the employer. It is a program that only the employer can offer. \nSecond, even if the employee had been offered comptime and, indeed, had \nalready worked an hour of overtime, there is no guarantee that she will \nreceive the time off that she needs. The Republican bill nebulously \nallows an employee to take time off within a reasonable period after \nmaking the request time does not unduly disrupt the employer.\n  There are no further guidelines. So, if an employer found the timing \nof the mother's request was not reasonable or if the time would be \nunduly disruptive, the request could be denied. Considering the fact \nthat the worker has already earned the right to this compensation, her \nrequest for a particular time off deserves deference.\n  Inexplicably, the sponsors of S. 4 rejected an amendment offered in \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee that would have ensured a \nworker receive the time requested if the request was made 2 weeks in \nadvance and would not cause the employer substantial injury. This bill \noffers quite a bit more flexibility to the employer than it does to the \nemployee, and it does not represent another real option for the wage \nearner, the hourly wage earner in America.\n  In addition, there are serious concerns regarding how much choice \nemployees actually will have. The bill contains hortatory language \ndictating that programs be the voluntary choice of the employee and \nthat employers cannot coerce employees into taking time off in lieu of \npay. However, S. 4 fails to provide a verifiable system by which \nemployees choose to take comp time. Indeed, the bill fails to stipulate \nsafeguards concerning potential discrimination.\n  Under the bill, employees will be quickly divided into two groups: \nthose who accept time off as overtime and those who want pay. The bill \ndoes not explicitly or effectively prevent an employer from offering \novertime only to those who will accept time off. Again, in committee, \nthe sponsors of S. 4 rejected amendments which would have clarified the \nprinciple that employees cannot be distinguished based on their \nwillingness to take nonpaid overtime.\n  Most seriously, the current Family Friendly Workplace Act contains a \nprovision which devastates the family's ability to both schedule time \ntogether and make ends meet: the evisceration of the 40-hour workweek. \nUnder this legislation, an employer would be permitted to schedule \nemployees to work 50, 60, 70, even 80 hours a week without providing \nany overtime pay. Overtime pay would only be required after working 80 \nhours in a 2-week period. It is difficult to contemplate how an \nemployee scheduled to work 70 or 80 hours a week at the discretion of \nthe employer will be able to better schedule time to attend to the \nneeds of his or her family. Supporters of the bill may argue that the \nprogram is voluntary. Yet the bill's sponsors have denied workers the \nability to refuse this voluntary program when the employers offer it.\n\n  S. 4 proposes to eliminate a very clear standard; namely, that \nemployees who work more than 40 hours in a week are entitled to premium \nwages for those extra hours. In its place, the so-called Family \nFriendly Workplace Act\n\n[[Page S4351]]\n\nleaves workers with a nebulous framework. Most of S. 4's provisions are \naimed at hourly employees who depend upon their overtime pay. Eight \nmillion overtime workers will hold down two jobs in an effort to make \nfinancial ends meet and are the most likely targets of this \nlegislation. More than 80 percent of these individuals make less than \n$28,000 a year. For these people, overtime pay can represent as much as \n15 percent of their wages. These workers already face precarious \nfinancial situations. The reality is that they cannot risk their job by \nchallenging their employer's application of comptime or realistic \ndemanding wages rather than comptime or flextime. Without clear rules, \nthese workers will be left without redress and left extremely \nvulnerable.\n  Would most employers implement comptime in an equitable manner? I am \nsure many would. However, S. 4 gives managers the authority to \neffectively eliminate all overtime pay, and truth be told, there are \nsignificant numbers of employers who already abuse the current system. \nIndeed, last year, the Department of Labor awarded $100 million in \novertime pay which was wrongly denied by employers. Labor examiners \nreport that half the garment industry now fails to pay the minimum \nwage. This bill would only protect those who currently violate the law. \nWe should simply exempt these troubled industries from comptime \nlegislation. Yet this was another suggestion rejected by the sponsors \nof S. 4.\n  Many Democrats, including myself, would be interested in crafting \nlegislation which ensures flexibility while guaranteeing protections to \nensure employee choice--true employee choice. Last year, President \nClinton suggested legislation addressing many of these goals. My \ncolleagues should make no mistake, there are solutions to the growing \ntime demands on working families such as the extremely successful \nFamily and Medical Leave Act.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees employees the right to \ntake 12 weeks of unpaid leave for certain family emergencies. Since \nbeing enacted in 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act has been \nembraced by the vast majority of employers and employees who have been \ngoverned by its regulations. Employers have found that it has only \nincrementally increased the benefits, hiring, and administrative costs \nthey face. The law readily defines eligibility and lengths of benefits. \nThe Family and Medical Leave Act administration costs have been low, if \nnonexistent, and its benefits extraordinary. Comptime, properly \nstructured comptime, legislation protecting the workers, particularly \nthe most vulnerable workers, could provide the same types of benefits.\n  Now, proponents of this bill claim that this legislation provides \nflexibility to needy families. We should be clear. The bill will impact \nthe 50 percent of American workers who receive hourly compensation and \nare thus classified as hourly wage employees. These are our most \neconomically vulnerable citizens.\n  A recent article in the Wall Street Journal points out that more and \nmore progressive employees are implementing, under current law, \nflexible workplace schedules for both hourly and salaried \nemployees. Indeed, as the article points out, one such company, \nChevron, has implemented a flexibility option which would allow an \nemployee to work four 10-hour days and have the fifth day off to tend \nthe family. Again, these options are provided under current law.\n\n  Now, I compliment these progressive companies for their policies. But \nI also believe that the Wall Street Journal article points out the \nreality of some of the fears that are being expressed today on the \nfloor. Businesses are appropriately concerned, first and foremost, with \ntheir bottom line. As one corporate manager was quoted in the Wall \nStreet Journal article, ``You have to look at [the work-friendly \narrangements] as a business strategy, rather than an accommodation'' \nbecause the accommodation doesn't get to the bottom line. Employers \nwill move toward plans that make economic sense to them. Yet, S. 4 \nprovides all the wrong incentives. It potentially discriminates against \nworkers who request pay instead of time off, as well as being \ninflexible in granting workers' requests for time off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 12:30 has arrived.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. How much longer would the Senator like to go so that we \ncan get a unanimous-consent for him to finish?\n  Mr. REED. Approximately 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nextended for the recess by an additional 20 minutes. That would enable, \nI think, the Senators who are now on the floor to make their \nstatements. I ask unanimous consent that we extend our time until \n12:50.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take one moment on a point \nthat has been addressed periodically throughout the course of the \ndebate. First is the argument that this legislation simply gives to \nprivate sector employees the same benefits enjoyed by public employees. \nPublic employees do have certain flexibilities, but they also have a \ngreat deal more protection than typical hourly wage earners. When we \ntried to provide some of these additional protections to the private \nsector at the committee level that are enjoyed by public sector \nworkers, they were rejected.\n  Public employees can only be fired for cause, unlike most private \nsector employees, who have at-will contracts. Most public sector \nemployees have grievance systems, which assure them that any \ndisagreements with their employer will receive equitable redress. \nPublic employees need not worry about the bankruptcy of their employer. \nThe list goes on. Public employees have the power to ensure that \nflexibility works for them. If the sponsors of this legislation had \nbeen willing to provide any of these types of protections to those \nimpacted by this bill, I think their argument would have some merit. \nUnfortunately, my colleagues have been unwilling to incorporate any \nsignificant worker protections into their bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this bill has been offered in good \nfaith. Many employers would implement this legislation equitably. \nHowever, some employers would not. And, sadly, large sectors of \nemployers do not follow even the current rules.\n  Unfortunately, portions of this legislation have been hijacked by \nthose same interests who opposed an increase in the minimum wage, the \nimplementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act, and who now impose \nthe implementation of employee-oriented flexible work schedules. This \nwell-intentioned idea now contains large loopholes by which some \nemployers could dramatically reduce the pay of employees.\n  Mr. President, I hope these problems can be addressed so we can \nprovide today's workers stretched thin by demands of work and family, \nthe power with which to make use of flexible work schedules. I hope we \ncan work to amend this so that it would reflect a bill that is balanced \nbetween the needs for employees and time with their families and giving \nthem the opportunities to make the choices so that they can effect the \npolicies for their families and improve the quality and climate of the \nworkplace. I hope that we all can work toward that end.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back my time.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today not only as a proud original \ncosponsor of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, but also as a \nparent of three wonderful children. I am a working parent of three \nwonderful children. Many of my colleagues know from personal experience \nthat being a parent is tough work--even for Senators.\n  I come to the floor today to speak as an advocate for more family \ntime. My family is my lifeblood. They were by my side long before I \nbecame a Senator, and they will be by my side long after I leave this \njob. If I had to make a choice between politics and parenting, my \nduties as a father would receive my vote.\n  Having said that, I think it is important that my colleagues keep in \nmind that there are millions of working American parents in their \nStates who confront far greater difficulties managing work and families \nthan we do. As a\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\nSenator, I have flexibility to spend time with my family. But what \nabout the millions of working parents that want paid time off with \ntheir kids? They can't have it because they remain tethered to a 60-\nyear-old act that prevents them from crossing that bridge to the 21st \ncentury.\n\n  This is a different world from 60 years ago. In 1938, only 2 out of \n12 mothers worked. Now, 9 out of 12 mothers work. We have had so much \nGovernment help that two parents in a family have to work. One works to \npay the bills; the other one works to pay the taxes. We have to reverse \nthat trend. Until we do, we have to find ways that they can keep the \nfamily together and have time to spend with their families.\n  S. 4 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938--not eliminate \nit from the pages of history, as the opponents of this bill would like \nus to believe. This vital piece of legislation would provide American \nworking parents with flexible work schedules and increase their choices \nand options for their time at work and quality time with their \nfamilies, even if they don't work for the Federal Government. Ensuring \nthat such opportunities are provided for working parents can only serve \nto strengthen our American families.\n  I do recognize that there are changes in this Nation's work force \nthat have been made over the past 60 years. There has been this influx \nof women into our Nation's work force. According to the Bureau of Labor \nstatistics, 63 percent of mother and father households now see both \nparents working outside the home. Moreover, 76 percent of mothers with \nschool-age children now work.\n  Americans want flexibility. This month's Money magazine shows that 64 \npercent of the American public and 68 percent of women would prefer \ntime off to overtime pay--if they had a choice. I predict that these \npercentages will continue to increase. I urge my colleagues to invest \nnow, while it is still a meager 68 percent. That number will continue \nto rise and the payoff will be big for our Nation's workers--not just \nin paid time off from work, but paid time off with family--a true \ninvestment in America's future.\n  Wage payers are not the heartless and cruel reincarnations of \nEbenezer Scrooge and Simon Legree, like we keep hearing on the floor \nhere. Having played the wage payer role for more than 26 years, I take \ngreat offense when employers are characterized as being the bad guys in \nthis thing. I have been a small businessman, and my wife and I had shoe \nstores, small shoe stores, family shoe stores. We employed, in each \nstore, three to five people. It gives you a different perspective on \nthe world and on flexibility. Back here, I have been in partisan \ndiscussions where we have talked about whether small businesses have \n500 employees or 125 employees. I have to tell you, that isn't even \nclose. Small businesses have 1 to 5 employees. These are small \nbusinesses where the guy that owns the business sweeps the front walk, \ncleans the toilet, and waits on customers. That is a focus that we have \nto get in this United States. We have to think about those small \nbusinesses and the flexibility they need, instead of overburdening with \ncontinuous regulations and tough forms to fill out for taxes. Eighty \npercent of the American work force works in those small businesses--90 \npercent in my State.\n  Now, they used to have flextime. Why don't they now? They can't \nafford to litigate. We have become a Nation of victims. If something \ndoesn't go just exactly the way we want it to work, we complain about \nit, try and figure out how we have been a victim, and we try to figure \nout how to make somebody pay for it. When it gets into a contentious \nsituation like that, some of the things not provided for in law have to \nbe watched very carefully. That is why there isn't as much flextime now \nas there used to be. I went to a small business hearing in Casper, and \nwhen it was over, the news media said, ``You only had 75 people here at \na time. Why were there not more here?'' They are kind of prohibited \nfrom coming to daytime hearings, because if they had an extra person to \nbe able to attend the hearing, they would fire them because it would be \ntoo much overhead.\n  That is the kind of perspective we have to look at. Those are the \npeople this seeks to work with. It seeks to give people working in the \nsmall businesses some flexibility so they can do the things they need \nto, without being overburdened by the problems that are provided in the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act. That excludes businesses under 50, and \nthere is a good reason for it. If they have employees with less than \n50, they have problems filling out just the paperwork for that bill \nwith 300 pages of regulation. This is a 45-page bill. I can picture \nsmall businessmen trying to handle what we may force on them with this \nmany pages of legislation. As for the Ebenezer Scrooges and Simon \nLegrees, they are probably out there; 2 percent of the businessmen \nprobably fall into that category. We have to quit writing laws to take \ncare of the 2 percent in this country and write laws that take care of \nthe 98 percent, the good employers that want to work together, that \nwant to keep their business going. That is a focus we lost in this \ndiscussion.\n\n  Part of the reason for this flextime is so that the business can \nstill function. They say, why isn't there a provision in here that \nabsolutely guarantees the employee to take off any time that he wants \nto? If you only have three people and the other two who don't have an \ninvestment in the business insist they are going to leave tomorrow \nmorning, you don't have enough help to take care of the customers. If \nyou do that a few days in a row, you don't have anymore customers. If \nyou don't have the customers, then you don't have a business. I have to \ntell you, in small business, the employee understands that. He is more \nsensitive to the business than anybody in the big businesses, and he \nknows that it is his job that goes. So he is interested in having a \nflexible work situation that we are trying to provide with this bill \nand that it does provide with this bill, without putting anybody out of \nbusiness and taking away all three to five of those jobs.\n  I have heard some things against the Family Friendly Workplace Act \nbesides the ones mentioned on the floor. Employees have talked to me \nand say, ``How come there are limits in this bill on how many hours I \ncan collect?'' They would like to work extra so they could have the \nbiggest anniversary party you could ever imagine. They may have a son \ngraduating from college and they want some extended time together, \nprobably their last time together. They may want to build up some hours \nfor that. In this bill, there are limitations on that. So they are \ngoing to have to pick one or the other, or maybe neither. I hear the \nemployer saying, well, by golly, this puts us in a bit of a bind, \nbecause if there is enough work force around here now, and they have \nenough flexibility on where they go to work. If my competitor offers \nthis flex, then I am going to have to offer the flex. So it isn't a \nperfect bill for anybody. But it is a perfect bill for most and it will \nprovide solutions in the work force.\n  Four years ago, the President signed the Family and Medical Leave Act \ninto law. While well intended, the Federal Government took 13 pages and \nmade it into 300 pages, instead of targeting employees with choices and \noptions, and overburdened everybody with a bunch of paperwork. It is \nmaking a difference, but it is unpaid time, without any option in the \nprivate sector to change that around so it is paid time.\n  One of the things that came up in the committee was a request or \nsuggestion that people could take their time, time and a half, take the \nmoney, and when they had an emergency or just wanted to see a ball \ngame, they could just pay for it. That isn't how America works. When \nyou get that money, you spend it. Particularly with working mothers, if \nthey get the paycheck, they say this paycheck is now my family's and it \nhas to go for the bills. But they can bank hours; the hours are theirs. \nThe hours are theirs to spend the way they want to. It is a way to bank \nit. Then if they run into that family emergency where the refrigerator \nbreaks down, they can make that trade and take the money. This bill \nsays you can take the cash if you want to. You can bank the hours, and \nyou can take cash.\n  It is a much easier situation than trying to meet all of the Federal \nguidelines on everything else that we have. I have to tell you one of \nthe reasons I am in on this bill. When I was in my campaign, I was in \nCheyenne, WY, a\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\ncompany down there does first-day stamp covers; it's one of the biggest \nones in the world. If you want a first-day cover on any stamp, there is \na place in Cheyenne--not just for the ones that are going to happen, \nbut for the ones that already happened. It's one of the greatest \nmuseums of stamps. When the Federal Government passed this law that \nsaid that employees can have flextime and comptime in the Federal \nGovernment, the same proposals we are talking about here, some of the \npeople working for that company were married to Federal employees. Now, \nthe ones working for the Federal Government could do that kind of time. \nThe ones working for the private business could not. So they got the \nemployees together and said let's offer this opportunity, and they took \nit to management and management said, ``why not?'' They offered it to \nthe employees. Then they got in trouble because it is only a Federal \nlaw. I ask you, how fair is Government if two people in the same family \ndon't have the same advantages and the one that gets all the advantages \nis the one working for the Federal Government? Businesses are not \nEbenezer Scrooges or Simon Legrees. They are the ones who want it to \nwork for the employees. They have worked on this for 19 years now, and \nthey are overjoyed that we are considering this at this moment. They \nsent somebody back at their expense to testify on behalf of the \nemployee to get this kind of flex in the schedule.\n\n  I ask you, are those people working for Unicover crazy? No, they want \nflextime in their schedule. Private sector employees know that the \nFederal employees have this flexibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in giving the employees the \nopportunity to balance their work and family obligations. This bill is \njust common sense. We can put all kinds of smoke screens behind it. We \ncan make it look like it is just for big business.\n  But, please, on behalf of the small businesses of this country, on \nbehalf of the working people, particularly the working mothers of this \ncountry, let's give them some flexibility in their work schedule so \nthat they can have better families. If we have better families, we will \nhave a better America. And the Family Friendly Workplace Act will \nprovide that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to support the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act once again. Senator Jeffords earlier today submitted to \nthe Senate the committee substitute. I would like to take a few moments \nnow to explain the terms of that substitute to the Senate.\n  I note the time. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that our time \nfor the recess be extended by an additional 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as has been pointed out by my colleague, Senator \nWellstone, we had the opportunity to have hearings. We had the \nopportunity to thoroughly discuss this bill in not only the \nsubcommittee but the committee. We listened to the criticism. We \nlistened to the constructive comments that were made. I believe that \nthe committee substitute that has been brought forward today addresses \nthe legitimate concerns that were, in fact, raised by many of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think this committee \nsubstitute is a fine work product. I am pleased to be able to discuss \ntoday some of the details.\n  First, the collective bargaining process.\n  When we drafted this bill, we wanted to give nonunion employees the \nability to select flexible work options through individualized \nagreements with their employers--and to give union members the ability \nto select these options collectively. We wanted all unionized employees \nto use the collective bargaining process to select these options. \nDuring the markup, however, it was pointed out by Senator Kennedy that \nthe bill actually limited the scope of coverage to unions who are \nrecognized representatives of the employees under section 9(a) of the \nNational Labor Relations Act [NLRA]. It's true that a great many unions \nare recognized under section 9(a)--but that provision does not, in \nfact, cover all union members.\n  Under the committee substitute before us today, all employees who are \nmembers of unions will obtain their flexible work options through the \ncollective bargaining process. The new language says, and I quote, \n``where a valid collective bargaining agreement exists between an \nemployee and a labor organization that has been certified or recognized \nas the representative of the employees of employer under applicable \nlaw,'' end of quote, the employee may obtain flexible work options \nthrough collective bargaining.\n  I would like to point out, Mr. President, that notwithstanding this \namendment, it has always been our intention to ensure that employees \nparticipate in S. 4's flexible options through agreements with their \nemployer. Under no circumstances can an employer provide flexible \noptions to an employee without either a written agreement from a non-\nunion employee or collective bargaining agreement on behalf of a union \nemployee.\n  This measure, along with the bill's anti-coercion measures, was \nintended and designed to protect employees from being forced to \nparticipate in any of the options available under S. 4. Today we simply \nstrengthen that policy.\n  Senator Wellstone expressed concerns about the tenuous and short-\nlived nature of certain types of jobs in certain industries--\nquestioning the ability of some workers to use and benefit from the \nflexible work options provided by S. 4. To address this concern, \nSenator Wellstone offered an amendment in markup which would have \nexempted part-time, seasonal, temporary, and garment-industry workers \nfrom the comptime provisions of the bill.\n  Even though we found Senator Wellstone's concerns legitimate, the \nmajority of the Committee disagreed with the proposed solution--the \nexemption of whole industries and classes of workers as well as giving \nthe Secretary of Labor broad authority to determine the eligibility of \nother industries.\n  We believe that workers should be protected from potentially abusive \nsituations and that employees and employers that enter into any \nagreements have a stable relationship. However, we believe that it \nwould be unfair to exempt whole industries and classes of workers--\neliminating even the possibility of participating in a flexible work \noption, even if they have worked with the same employer for many years.\n  The solution provided by the committee substitute states that before \nan employee is eligible for a flexible work option, or before an \nemployer can offer a flexible work option, the employee must work for \nthe employer for 12 months and 1,250 hours within 1 year--ensuring that \na stable relationship exists between the employer and the employee.\n  This solution may sound familiar. That's because it's the same basic \nrequirement that exists under the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n\n  This requirement effectively creates the exception Senator Wellstone \nsuggested. Employees whose duration is too short-lived or tenuous to \ntake advantage of S. 4's options are excluded. However, employees who \nare not so situated have an opportunity to develop a stable trusting \nrelationship with their employer.\n  In addition to satisfying Senator Wellstone's concerns, this change \nwill allow long-term employees an opportunity to determine whether \ntheir employer is the type to respect the parameters of S. 4's flexible \noptions and to determine if they want to participate or not.\n  The purpose of this provision--as of the bill in its entirety--is to \nincrease the freedom and flexibility of the workers.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to a third change we propose in the \nbill. We propose aligning the potential damages available for \nviolations of S. 4's bi-weekly and flexible credit hour provisions. \nSome of our colleagues appear to believe that it's impossible to modify \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act and still provide adequate protection to \nworking men and women.\n  If my friends believe this, they are wrong. The purpose of our bill \nis worker protection. There are severe penalties for employers who \nviolate the workers' rights.\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\n  S. 4 had strong penalties under the comptime provisions. The \ncommittee substitute takes these strong penalties and extends them to \nviolations under the other flexible workplace options.\n  Mr. President, the committee substitute will also include an addition \nto the provisions for biweekly work schedules and flextime options. It \nwill require the Department of Labor to revise its Fair Labor Standards \nAct posting requirements so employees are on notice of their rights and \nremedies under the biweekly and flextime options as well as the \ncomptime option.\n  Let me now discuss the salary basis provision. Under the FLSA's \nsalary basis standard, an employee is said to be paid on a salary \nbasis--and thus exempt from the FLSA overtime requirements--if he or \nshe regularly receives a straight salary rather than hourly pay. These \nindividuals are usually professionals or executives. Furthermore, the \nFLSA regulations state that an exempt employee's salary is not subject \nto an improper reduction.\n  For years this subject to language was noncontroversial. Recently, \nhowever, some courts have reinterpreted this language to mean that even \nthe possibility of an employee's salary being improperly docked can be \nenough to destroy the employee's exemption, even if that employee has \nnever personally experienced a deduction. Seizing upon this \nreinterpretation, large groups of employees, many of whom are highly \ncompensated, have won multimillion-dollar judgments in back overtime \npay--even though many of them never actually experienced a pay \ndeduction of any kind. This problem is especially rife in the public \nsector.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would not affect the outcome in cases \nwhere a salary has in fact been improperly docked. If an employer docks \nthe pay of a salaried employee because the employee is absent for part \nof a day or a week, the employee could still lose his or her exempt \nstatus.\n  The purpose of S. 4, in this regard, is to make clear that the \nemployee will not lose his or her exempt status just because he or she \nis subject to--or not actually experiencing--an improper reduction in \npay.\n  Mr. President, we're making progress on this legislation--a bill that \nwould help give American workers the flexibility they need and deserve \nas they confront the challenges of a dynamic new century.\n  This bill will strengthen America's families, by allowing millions of \nhourly workers to balance family and work. Let's move forward in a \nbipartisan way to get it passed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4327-6", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to S. 717.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 717) to amend the Individuals With Disabilities \n     Education Act, to reauthorize and make improvements to that \n     act, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take just a couple of \nminutes to rise in support of the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act. I have a particular interest in this bill in that I have \nbeen involved for a very long time with disabilities, chairman of the \ndisabilities council in Wyoming, my wife teaching special kids, and so \nI wanted to comment very briefly.\n  I rise in support of the current bill to reauthorize IDEA, the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act. The Federal Government, in \nmy view, should and does play a rather limited role in elementary and \nsecondary education. This is the responsibility generally of \ncommunities, those of us who live there. State and local control, I \nthink, is the strength of our educational system, and yet I believe \nstrongly that this is an appropriate Federal responsibility. This is \ndealing with that kind of a special problem which exists in all places \nto ensure that every child has the opportunity to be the best that he \nor she can be.\n  IDEA helps local schools meet their constitutional responsibilities \nto educate everyone, and that is what we want to do. Today nearly twice \nas many students with disabilities drop out of school compared to \nstudents without disabilities, and that is what it is about, to have a \nprogram that helps keep students in school.\n  S. 717 does not have as much punch as legislation considered in the \nlast Congress. Some issues about discipline and litigation were \nimpossible to resolve last year, and therefore there was no \nreauthorization. This bill, as I understand it, represents a consensus. \nIt is a product of negotiation. No party involved, as usual, received \nall they had hoped for, but nevertheless it is a fair approach. It is a \nstep in the right direction. This bill has had a very long journey. We \nowe it to our local school districts to pass this reauthorization \nlegislation that has been stymied for several years.\n  Education is clearly an issue that is on the minds of all of us. It \nis on the minds of Wyomingites. There is a great deal of uncertainty \nregarding the future and shape of secondary and elementary schools in \nWyoming. State legislators currently are scrambling to provide a \nsolution to a Supreme Court ruling that funding and opportunities must \nbe allocated more uniformly and fairly across districts in Wyoming. I \nam hopeful that Congress can pass this IDEA legislation and eliminate \nat least one of the sources of uncertainty for educators and, more \nparticularly, for parents in my State.\n  Since its original passage in 1975, it has become clear that there \nare improvements that are necessary to IDEA. Wyoming teachers and \nadministrators have contacted me expressing concern about the endless \npaper trail. I hear that every night, as a matter of fact, at home; as \nI mentioned, my wife teaches special kids and spends, unfortunately, as \nmuch time in paperwork as she does with kids. That is too bad.\n  They complain the current law is unclear and places too much emphasis \non paperwork and process rather than actually working hands-on with \nchildren. The bill we have before us today attempts to reduce paperwork \nassociated with the individualized educational plan. Teachers and \nadministrators also write to me, and I am sure to my fellow Senators, \nto ask for strengthening of the discipline and school safety provisions \nof the law. They want power to take steps necessary to assure that \nschools are safe for all children. S. 717 would give the power to \nschool officials to remove disabled students who bring weapons or drugs \nto school and keep them out for as long as 45 days pending a final \ndecision. This will give educators a clearer understanding of how they \nare able to exercise discipline with disabled children, as they should \nbe able to.\n\n  IDEA has also proved to be a highly litigated area of law. This bill \nwill require that mediation be made available in all States as an \nalternative to the more expensive court hearings. Mediation has been \nshown effective in resolving most of these kinds of disputes. Meeting \nwith the mediator will help\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\nschool professionals and parents reach agreements more quickly.\n  In summary, S. 717 will help cut down on the overregulatory nature of \nIDEA. It will allow parents and educators to work out differences by \nusing noncontroversial and nonadversarial methods. It will go a long \nway toward allowing all children to learn free from danger and serious \ndisruption. And, therefore, Mr. President, I urge that this bill be \npassed, that we make more certain the opportunities for disabled \nchildren in schools throughout the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

There will be two amendments to be offered, one by Senator Gorton \nand the other by Senator Smith of New Hampshire. They have agreed to a \ntime limitation. I do not know whether it has been shared with the \nminority or not. Under the agreement, there would be 2 hours equally \ndivided between Senator Gorton and myself, which I will share with \nSenator Harkin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the amendment offered by \nSenator Gorton, there be 2 hours for debate equally divided between \nSenator Gorton and myself, and I will share with Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. And I add to that unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendments shall be considered in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 243\n\n (Purpose: To permit State educational agencies and local educational \n          agencies to establish uniform disciplinary policies)\n\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and that the clerk report the amendment which I \nsend to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as you know, it is the custom in the \nSenate to ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with. I did not ask for that unanimous consent this afternoon \nbecause I wanted to demonstrate that the amendment before us is exactly \n7 lines long, to be added to a bill which is 327 pages long--327 pages \nof detailed requirements imposed on each and every school district in \nthe United States of America from New York City to Los Angeles to one \nof my own, Harrington, WA, a small school district in a rural farm \narea.\n  I will recap only briefly the remarks that I made yesterday relating \nto this entire bill, and then I will attempt to fit this amendment into \nsome of the objections, perhaps the single most important objection \nthat I have to the bill that is before us.\n  As was the case yesterday, I must start by saying that we are not \noperating here today on a clean slate. An Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act has been a part of the law of the United States for the \nlast couple of decades. This revises and reauthorizes that proposal. On \nthe narrow question of whether or not this bill is somewhat easier for \nschool districts to administer and grants them somewhat more authority \nthan they have at the present time, the answer can only be in the \naffirmative. If our only choice was between a continuation of the \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\nlaw and the adoption of this bill, I would have to confess that this \nbill would be superior. Nevertheless, it retains all of the profound \npolicy and balancing of power objections that are applicable to the \ncurrent law to such extent that the relatively modest improvements in \nthis bill simply do not make it an appropriate law to be passed by the \nCongress of the United States and imposed on every school authority and \non every student and on every teacher of the United States. So it is \nwith deep regret, and in spite of the view that the education of the \ndisabled is an important priority, that some aid and assistance, at \nleast, of the Federal Government to that end is an important priority, \nthat I present this amendment and oppose the bill as a whole.\n  It seems to me that fundamentally the objections to the bill fall \ninto two quite separate categories. The first and the easiest to \nunderstand is that this bill, as is the case with the current IDEA \nstatute, imposes a huge unfunded mandate on all of the school systems \nof the United States. We are told, I believe by the Congressional \nBudget Office, that the costs imposed on the school districts of the \nUnited States next year, 1998, in that 1 year alone, will be $35 \nbillion. That number is greater than the sum of all of the \ndiscretionary appropriations for education from kindergarten through \nhigh school passed by this Congress. As against that $35 billion \nmandate, we will appropriate somewhere between $3 and $4 billion to the \nStates and the school districts when we have finished our work for the \nyear. For the current year, the figure is just over $3 billion. So, \nperhaps for every $10 of costs and expenses we impose on our school \ndistricts, we will reimburse our schools $1.\n  It is difficult for me to imagine any Member of the U.S. Senate \nstanding up on this floor supporting this bill if that Senator had to \npersuade the Congress to appropriate $35 billion to enforce it. Given \nthe nature of our budget challenges, given our bipartisan desire for a \nbalanced budget, given the agreement between the President of the \nUnited States and the leadership of the Congress on the budget for this \nyear, we would not be able to find that $35 billion without repealing \nall of the other aid to K-12 education bills and a number of our higher \neducation expenditures as well.\n  So, what Congress is doing in this bill, just as it has done for the \nlast 20 years, is saying to each school district: We know what is best \nfor you. We are going to tell you what you have to do. But we are not \ngoing to pay for it. This is, I am informed, the largest unfunded \nmandate we impose in the U.S. Congress except for some of our \nenvironmental mandates that are spread out over the private sector as \nwell as over the public sector. It is, we are told by the Advisory \nCouncil on Intergovernmental Relations, the piece of legislation that \ncreates the fourth greatest amount of litigation of any of the statutes \nof the United States. Why? Because of its immense complexity.\n  So, fundamentally, it is wrong that we should be debating a bill like \nthis, or its predecessor, because we are not willing to pay for the \nconsequences of our own actions. We make the rules. We do not pay the \nbills. That is the first objection to the bill, and I must confess the \namendment I have just introduced does nothing about that unfunded \nmandate whatsoever.\n  The second objection has to do with the highly valid but nevertheless \nextremely narrow focus of the bill. The theory of the bill, the \nphilosophy of the bill, is to guarantee a free public education to all \ndisabled students or potential students of a grade-school or high-\nschool age. The focus is narrow because the bill allows school \ndistricts, in providing this education, to focus on nothing else. With \nrespect to the bill and its mandates, no other interests are even \nrelevant. The costs of providing the education are not relevant. The \nindividual education plan can be literally unlimited in the cost for an \nindividual student--costs which obviously come out of the same pool of \nmoney which educates every other student and thus deprives each and \nevery other student of what that money could furnish. The safety of the \nschoolroom or the school grounds is not a relevant consideration, with \nthe narrowest of limitations, slightly broadened by this bill over \ncurrent law. The classroom environment for all of the other students is \nnot relevant in the decisions that are made under this bill.\n  So, whatever the impact on all of the other students, the school \ndistrict simply may not consider them. Only the beneficiaries of the \nbill and their perceived welfare, by their parents or by an \nadministrative officer or by a court, may be considered.\n  One parent in the State of Washington wrote to me on this subject and \nmade the following statement:\n\n       I recently asked my school district attorney what rights I \n     had as a parent when the education program of my child was \n     interrupted by the behaviorally disabled due to legal \n     decisions. His response was, you have no rights.\n\n  ``You have no rights.''\n  Yesterday, I shared with my colleagues a letter from a parent in \nCalifornia who responded, as I suspect thousands of others have \nresponded, to this frustrating decision by taking her child out of the \nschool system entirely. She was required to find privately financed \neducation for just such a student. In this connection, the fundamental \nflaw in this law, as in its predecessor, is the double standard it sets \nboth for disciplinary proceedings and for classroom environment. Every \nschool district in the United States retains all of the powers that it \nhad previously to discipline students for what in a different context \nwould be criminal offenses--weapons, drugs, assaults and the like. \nEvery school district retains the authority to act on behalf of the \nmajority of its students with respect to classroom atmosphere and \nenvironment so a learning environment conducive to the learning of all \ncan be enforced.\n  If, however, a student is disabled or contrives to get a finding of \ndisability, all of those rules go out of the window. Discipline is \nseverely limited. The right of ultimate and complete expulsion is wiped \nout entirely, and an elaborate set of requirements that take up many of \nthe 327 pages of this bill are substituted, including legal proceedings \nin which attorney's fees can be imposed against the school district but \nnot against a parent, even if the parent loses that litigation. And, \ninevitably, this double standard communicates itself to the students, \nto the subjects of our education system.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to share with you a comment from \nthe superintendent of the Edmonds School District in the State of \nWashington. Edmonds is a relatively prosperous, relatively large \nSeattle suburban school district. Brian Benzel, its superintendent, \nwrites:\n\n       Our major frustration is that we continue to have high \n     expectations for programs thrust on us by the regulations \n     with very little resources to achieve those expectations.\n       The result is that good people do not understand why we do \n     some of the things we do because they defy common sense. When \n     we try to explain the regulations and the requirements, we \n     all come away as losers and the public support necessary for \n     the public schools is undermined.\n       We have had several incidents with guns and dangerous \n     knives. We have a strong policy and clearly set an \n     expectation that possession of these items will result in \n     expulsion. At same time, we often get into time-consuming and \n     expensive due process hearings where our principals are the \n     focus of concern rather than the student's behavior. We all \n     begin to think we're attorneys rather than educators.\n\n  Another letter from the superintendent of the Othello School \nDistrict, a rural school district:\n\n       Already this morning I have received two phone calls from \n     principals asking for advice regarding disciplining disabled \n     students. One student is in possession of a knife for the \n     second time this year, and another middle school student has \n     threatened to kill another student. Each time the principal \n     is faced with one of these situations, s/he should not have \n     to worry about negative consequences for trying to provide a \n     safe environment for all of their staff and students. . . . \n     please don't tie the hands of the administrators that are \n     trying so hard to provide a safe learning environment for all \n     of their students.\n\n  This is a field which has made modest progress, but it is very \nmodest. Expulsion, as one of the superintendents spoke about, still is \nnot an alternative. And so, Mr. President, the amendment that I have \nsent to the desk, and I wish to read it just once again, in its \nentirety it reads:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, each State \n     educational agency or local educational agency may establish \n     and implement uniform policies with respect to\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n     discipline and order applicable to all children within its \n     jurisdiction to ensure the safety and appropriate educational \n     atmosphere in its schools.\n\n  No more and no less than that. No more and no less than considering \nmaybe perhaps our local school boards, our principals and our teachers \nknow more about running their classrooms and are equally concerned with \nall of their children as we are, we, in this artificial atmosphere, \nsetting out 327 pages of regulations for the ordering of our public \nschools. Mr. President, that would be wrong if we paid for it, and, as \nI said earlier, we are not paying for it. Most States have laws \nrelating to the education of the disabled. Most teachers in school \ndistricts would do the best job they possibly could in the absence of \nregulations, even from the State, and yet we feel in our wisdom we can \nset up one set of rules applicable to every school district across the \ncountry that ignores completely individual situations taking place in \nindividual school rooms, each slightly different than the other, and \nthat we can ignore completely the educational atmosphere in which the \nvast majority of our students live and work.\n  Is it any wonder that since the passage of this act, we have a \nconstantly increasing number of students who are denominated disabled, \nwhen every incentive to a parent is to get such a designation, when we \nhave a large number of so-called experts who will say that the very \nfact that a student disrupts the classroom is proof of disability, so \nthat the disruption cannot be effectively sanctioned?\n  I believe that it is inevitable that even if we pass this slightly \nimproved law, the number, the share of those who are denominated \ndisabled will continue to increase; the percentage, the share of the \nlimited dollars available for education will continue to increase. The \namount of litigation and lawyer's fees, coming straight out of the \neducational budget, will continue to increase. One size does not fit \nall, and my amendment will not cure all of the shortcomings of this \nbill. It will leave intact the absolute requirement that a free public \neducation be provided to every individual, disabled or not. That will \nnot be affected. It will not solve the money problem of an unfunded \nmandate.\n  It will, however, allow the reimposition of a single standard for \ndiscipline, classroom safety and classroom environment to be determined \nby the school authorities most affected by those standards. It will end \nthe process of student after student leaving the public schools because \nof the impact of the bills, teachers leaving the profession because of \nthe impact of those bills, and the fact that many of us, I know in my \nown case, receive more complaints about this aspect of the Federal \nprogram for education in the United States than we do on any other \nsingle subject.\n  So, knowing in this case that the odds are stacked against me, I have \ntried to present this amendment in the simplest possible fashion. You \neither believe in a single standard of discipline and safety and \neducational atmosphere or you do not. If you believe in it, if you \nbelieve in the essential goodness and expertise of the people who are \nproviding our children with their education, you will vote for the \namendment. If you disbelieve in that good faith, if you disbelieve in \nthat expertise, your problems and our problems with our public schools \nare far greater than those dealt with in this amendment. Free our \nschool boards and our teachers and our administrators to provide the \neducation we demand of them for all of our children. Free them by \nadopting this amendment.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from the State of Washington. I can understand \nhis particular concern, given that the State of Washington at one time \nhad the highest percentage of due process hearings that resulted in \ncourt cases of any State in the country. I would note that the State \nhas taken dramatic action in the last couple of years which has greatly \nreduced the amount of litigation.\n  But first of all, let me talk about the word ``mandate,'' as it is \nused not only the Senator from Washington but also by many others. The \nindication is that IDEA somehow is a Federal mandate.\n  Back in the early seventies, there were many court cases and some 26 \nStates were told that they must provide an appropriate education for \nchildren with disabilities. In order to provide national uniformity, a \nnational consent decree was developed. The decree provided that, if a \nState provides for a free education, then it must provide it for \neveryone and, with respect to students with disabilities, it must \nprovide a free and appropriate education. Part of the definition of \n``appropriateness'' were the words ``shall contain mainstream \nprovisions,'' or words to that effect.\n  It is not just an issue of court cases in those States. This is a \nconstitutional matter--a matter of equal protection.\n  Congress responded by developing a bill that provided uniformity and \nattempted to provide information, guidelines, and rules for the States \nas to how to provide an appropriate education consistent with \nmainstreaming. It is amazing that, since that bill was written in 1975, \nthere have been no amendments to it other than the 1986 amendments \nwhich dealt with other matters, such as early intervention as well as \nattorney's fees. I hope that sets the background with respect to where \nwe are today.\n  Now let me talk about the cost of this education. Yes, it is costly. \nIt costs right around $35 billion a year, of which the Federal \nGovernment provides only a relatively small amount, some 7 percent to 8 \npercent. The Gregg amendment, which has already been offered, attempts \nto rectify our failure to provide the 40 percent we promised back in \n1975, but that is another issue.\n  The Republican education bill, S. 1, delineates a path toward living \nup to our promise to finance 40 percent of the cost of this education. \nI hope we do carry out that plan. At the same time, I do not believe we \nshould add any amendments on that issue at this time.\n  What will the Gorton amendment do? If you talk about lawsuits, if you \ntalk about lawyer's fees, it is a bonanza. This proposal may take care \nof some of the less than fully employed lawyers around the country. We \nhave 16,000 school districts and, under this amendment, we would have \n16,000 sets of rules. It will take us a long time to figure out what \nthat means--which ones do you use and where do you go? Senate bill 717 \nsets specific rules for everybody across the country, so every State \nhas uniformity. Therefore, I think contrary to the desire of the \nSenator from Washington, his amendment will exacerbate the problem \nrather than solve it.\n  Also, I would like to point out, as to the total cost, you have to \nconsider that it is a constitutional mandate, so it is a necessary \ncost. It is not something which was added in order to try and benefit \nsome people. This is a constitutional mandate. If you measure those \ncosts and you compare them with the savings that have occurred by \nvirtue of providing this education, then you will come up with a \ntotally different picture.\n\n  All of us have observed in our States what has happened. Almost all \nthe institutions which used to house children with disabilities, \nchildren who were not able to function in our society, have been closed \nin Vermont. Even those children who have a particularly difficult time, \nthose who are less educable, are in private foster homes. Millions and \nmillions of dollars have been saved in our State by that alone.\n  Second, there is the issue of the quality of life of individuals who \nare able to participate in a school system and are able to have \nfunctional lives and be employed. There is story after story after \nstory of young people who have come through the system and become an \nimportant part of society--employed and paying their own way. To say \nthat the cost is so high, this amendment will do nothing but increase \nthe cost.\n  As I indicated earlier, I understand the concern of the Senator from \nWashington. In 1993, the State of Washington had 72 hearings, 26 of \nwhich resulted in court cases. The State of California, on the other \nhand, had 849 hearings requested--only 10 of which resulted in court \ncases.\n  The State of Washington recognized that they had to make some \nchanges, and they did. They implemented a process of getting people \ntogether to\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\ntalk these things over and find a resolution, and the figures have \nchanged abruptly. They now have a lot of mediation proceedings and few, \nif any, court cases. In 1995 and 1996, there were 137 mediations in the \nState of Washington, with 6 pending at the end of the year. Just about \nall of the cases were settled. During that same period, only three \nhearings were held.\n  In view of these improvements, I urge the Senator from Washington to \nwithdraw his amendment. I hope we can take a look at what could happen. \nIf this amendment passes, it would destroy a system which has \napparently been working very well and would put us in a position where \nwe would be back to court in about every case.\n  I hope that the Senator will end this instead of creating a problem \nwhich would destroy all of the efforts that the State of Washington has \nmade in the last few years to get rid of the problems they had.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the facts contained in \n``Mediation Due Process Procedures in Special Education Analysis of \nState Policies'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Findings: Due Process Hearings\n\n       With few exceptions, states were able to provide statistics \n     in response to survey items that asked for numbers of \n     hearings requested, held and appealed for the years 1991, \n     1992 and 1993. The data is displayed in Table 6. In some \n     states, data concerning appeals of hearing decisions to state \n     or federal court are not provided to the department of \n     education.\n\n                                   STATE DUE PROCESS HEARINGS 1991, 1992, 1993                                  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Hearings  requested     Hearings held       Appeals to court \n                      State                       --------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    1991   1992   1993   1991   1992   1993   1991   1992   1993\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAL...............................................     27     44     53     10     10     19      1      2      2\nAK...............................................      4      2      0      4      2      0      1      0  ( \\1\\\n                                                                                                               )\nAZ...............................................

Mr. President, let me discuss the bill and what it does \nto take care of these situations. Senate bill 717 provides one set of \nrules with discretion for school districts and protection for children.\n  The Gorton amendment, if passed, will kill the bipartisan, bicameral \nconsensus that this measure enjoys. We simply cannot destroy all the \nwork that has gone on throughout this country in bringing us the bill \nwe have today--we all remember what happened last year when we thought \nwe had a consensus. Issues similar to those raised by the Senator from \nWashington came up, and the whole thing fell apart. We cannot let that \nhappen again.\n  If the Gorton amendment were to pass, school districts would get no \nrelief. All the major educational organizations support S. 717, and \nthey would all oppose this amendment.\n  Let me lay out a rationale of how we approach the sensitive issue of \nhandling the discipline problems. Educators and parents need, deserve, \nand--in fact--have asked for the codification of major Federal policy \ngoverning how and when a child with a disability may be disciplined by \nremoval from his or her current educational placement.\n  The bill takes a balanced approach to discipline. It recognizes the \nneed to maintain safe schools and the same need to preserve the civil \nrights of children with disabilities.\n  This bill brings together, for the first time, in the statute the \nrules that apply to children with disabilities who are subject to \ndisciplinary action and clarifies for school personnel, parents, and \nothers how school disciplinary rules and the obligation to provide a \nfree, appropriate education fit together. The bill provides specificity \nabout important issues such as whether educational services can cease \nfor a disabled child--they cannot--how manifestation determinations are \nmade, what happens to a child with disabilities during the parent \nappeals, and how to treat children not previously identified as \ndisabled.\n  We have gone through all that and we worked hard all across the \ncountry. We have a consensus on this very difficult issue, one that has \nbeen the most contentious for several years. We now have an agreement \non how to handle it.\n  When a child with a disability violates school rules or codes of \nconduct through possession of weapons, drugs, or demonstration of \nbehavior that is substantially likely to result in injury to the child \nor others in the school, the bill provides clear and simple guidance \nabout educators' areas of discretion, the parents' role, and the \nprocedural protections for the child. The Gorton amendment would say to \na town or a school district that they could throw all this out and put \nits own in.\n  Dangerous children can be removed from their current educational \nplacement. Specific standards must be met to sustain any removal. If a \nbehavior that is subject to school discipline is not a manifestation of \nthe child's disability, the child may be disciplined the same as \nchildren without disabilities. So, that group which has been \ntroublesome certainly is treated just like any other child. If parents \ndisagree with the removal of their child from his or her current \neducational placement, they can request an expedited due process \nhearing. If educators believe that the removal of a child from his or \nher educational placement must be extended, they can ask for an \nextension in an expedited due process hearing. So there is a process to \nmake sure that no child who is dangerous is forced on the other \nchildren in the classroom.\n  The bill allows school personnel to move a child with disabilities to \nan interim, alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if that \nstudent has brought a weapon to school or a school function or \nknowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale \nof a controlled substance while at school or at a school function.\n  The bill gives school personnel the option of requesting that a \nhearing officer move a child with a disability to an interim, \nalternative educational setting for up to 45 days if the child \nis substantially likely to injure themselves or others in their current \nplacement.\n\n  I commend the Senator from Washington. He worked so hard last year to \nmake us aware of the need to change this. We took into consideration \nhis advice and counsel. We came up with a version which everybody in \nthe country has agreed to. Why does he now want to supersede it and \nsay, ``Do away with that, let the communities decide what they want to \ndo themselves''?\n  Including the regular education teacher in an IEP meeting should help \nto reassure that children with disabilities get appropriate \naccommodations and support in regular educational classrooms, \ndecreasing the likelihood for a need for discipline.\n  Under no circumstances can educational services to a child with a \ndisability cease. If a local educational\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\nagency has a policy which prevents it from continuing services when a \nchild is given a long-term suspension or is expelled, the State must \nassume the obligation to provide educational services to the child with \na disability. The disabled child is protected, also.\n  The discipline records of the child with the disabilities will be \ntransferred when the child changes schools to the same extent that the \nrecords of a non disabled child transfer. That is another thing, which \nI think was also at the suggestion of the Senator from Washington last \nyear, that you ought to be able to provide that record with the child \nso the school district that receives a child has warning that there may \nbe problems. Prior discipline records will be provided to officials \nmaking decisions about a current violation by a child with a \ndisability.\n  We have gone out of our way to accommodate the suggestions of the \nSenator from Washington which he made last year. I think he helped us \ncraft a very excellent bill. Why does he now want to throw it all away \nand say, ``Yes, notwithstanding that we took care of all these \nproblems, we will let the communities decide how they want to do it''?\n  This would create chaos, and, therefore, I have to very strongly \noppose the amendment of the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. I do not intend to take a great deal of time. I wanted to \ncomment on this particular legislation.\n  Mr. President, I, like most Members, if not all Members, have been \nback at home discussing at official forums, school meetings, and with \nteachers, educators, parents, and students the impact of the current \nstatute relative to education for children with disabilities.\n  Clearly, there have been problems. There have been discipline \nproblems, as the Senator from Washington has enunciated. There have \nbeen problems of excess regulations and paperwork for teachers. There \nhave been accountability problems for schools. There have been funding \nproblems due to the Federal Government not living up to its promise to \nfund up to 40 percent of the cost of this particular education.\n  Now, there have been numerous attempts over the years since this was \nfirst introduced--in 1975, I believe--numerous attempts to modify and \ncorrect some of these problem areas. Most of those have not succeeded \nand many of the situations that have been enumerated by the Senator \nfrom Washington have continued.\n  By the same token, there has been nowhere near consensus in this body \nto revoke that statute. I think there is a solid commitment to provide \neducational opportunities for students with disabilities. There has \nbeen strong support for that. There will continue to be strong support \nfor that.\n  The question this body has been faced with over the past 3 years is \nwhether or not we could make substantive, important changes addressing \nmany of the problems that arise under the current statute. Our task has \nbeen to make effective changes, gain a consensus in support for those \nchanges, and preserve the essence of the statute. These amendments seek \nto provide all children with disabilities in America with the \nopportunity for education and do so in a way that provides more \naccountability, ensures a safe environment for all students, and \naddresses a number of the other perceived flaws in the current statute.\n\n  This has been a 3-year effort. Senator Frist, from the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, undertook the effort as subcommittee \nchairman last year under the chairmanship of Senator Kassebaum and \nspent an enormous amount of time and effort trying to pull a consensus \ntogether. We were not able to do that by the end of the session.\n  That effort was restarted in this new Congress under the direction of \nthe majority leader. The majority leader appointed a special task force \nof Members--a bicameral, bipartisan task force of Members--to see if it \nwas possible to get everybody in one room around one table and address \nthese issues on an issue-by-issue basis and come to some type of an \nagreement. Now, when you do that, you clearly end up with a piece of \nlegislation that is not perfect from any particular person's point of \nview. It leaves probably more to be discussed and debated and perhaps \ncorrected in future efforts, but the goal here was to see if we could \nsubstantially improve the current legislation.\n  My colleagues need to understand that the choice here today is not \nbetween repealing the statute as it currently exists on the books and \ngoing back and writing a new one from scratch. I doubt very much we \nwould be able to successfully do that, or at least come up with \nsomething that is in any measure different from the current statute. \nThe choice is: Given the statute on the books; given what we know \nthrough experience over 20 years with this particular law and its \nimplications for parents, teachers, students, educators, Members of \nCongress and appropriators, and others; given the need to put together \na consensus that will allow us to substantially improve that current \nstatute; the choice today is, stay with the existing law, with all of \nthe problems that it has, all of the concerns that people have, or move \nforward on legislation which, while it does not give any one person \neverything they wanted, moves the mark very substantially toward a \nbetter bill.\n  I think we have done that with S. 717. We have made a better piece of \nlegislation, a better IDEA. It is better for children, better for \nparents, and it is better for educators.\n  First, we increase substantially the role that parents play in their \nchildren's education. This is a very important principle, to involve \nthe parents more thoroughly, engage them more in the decisions of \nplacement, provide them with information that parents of general \neducation students receive, and give parents access to all their \nchildren's records. This provision helps provide accountability, and \nhelps provide a framework for understanding the problems that the \nteacher might be dealing with in school.\n  Second, we include children with disabilities in State- or district-\nwide assessments, and in doing so, we provide systemwide \naccountability. Schools will now be responsible for what children in \nspecial education are learning.\n  Third, S. 717 moves us toward a much better understanding of the \ninequity and imbalance that exists in the funding of IDEA whereby the \nFederal Government has not lived up to its promise to provide 40 \npercent of the costs of special education. We are actively engaged now \nin working with the appropriators and others to increase the Federal \nfunding for this act. In fact, the Republican Party, as part of its top \npriority as defined in our caucus at the beginning of this session, \ncommitted to making good on the promise of the Federal Government to \npay its full share of IDEA funding, and to no longer leave this \nobligation and burden on the States and local districts. I am hopeful \nthat the Appropriations Committee can help us this year in making a \nvery substantial step in that direction.\n  We have taken special care to address the question of the amount of \nregulations and paperwork that educators have to deal with. This bill \nprovides far more flexibility for teachers and will allow them to spend \nmore time with the children and less time filling out forms.\n  Finally, we have worked very carefully and very thoroughly to try to \ncraft a discipline provision in this reauthorization bill that \naddresses many of the concerns raised by the Senator from Washington.\n  This is a particularly contentious area, and it is important that we \nunderstand that the task force looked at this very, very carefully and \nworked very hard to try to address these concerns.\n  Now, in regard to specific discipline procedures, we came to the \nbelief that parents needed and, in fact, deserved codification of major \nFederal policy governing how and when a child with a disability may be \ndisciplined by removal from their current educational placement. Here \nwe have a disagreement with the Senator from Washington. I understand \nwhere he is coming from. But to avoid having literally tens, if not \nhundreds or thousands of different standards, the Federal statute\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\nmust include guidelines for a consistent standard that parents and \neducators can understand, so that everybody knows where we are coming \nfrom on this.\n  The bill takes a balanced approach to discipline procedures. It does \nnot go all the way in the direction that the Senator from Washington \nwould like to go, and it probably goes further than others would like \nto go. That, again, was part of the consensus that we reached on this \nlegislation. But we do recognize in the discipline section the need to \nmaintain safe schools, and to balance that with the need to retain and \npreserve the civil rights of children with disabilities. We are dealing \nwith a whole series of court cases. We are dealing with legislation \nhere that has to stand the scrutiny of the courts. So we have to pay \nattention, obviously, to those cases and try to craft legislation which \nwould give us a constitutionally sound and civil rights compliant \ndiscipline procedure.\n  For the first time, this bill brings together the rules that apply to \nchildren with disabilities who are subject to disciplinary action and \nclarifies for school personnel, parents, and others, how these \ndisciplinary rules work in conjunction with the school's obligation to \nprovide a free, appropriate education. We have to meld these two \nconcepts together to make an effective discipline procedure. The bill \nprovides specificity about important issues, such as whether \neducational services can cease for disabled children--they cannot. But \nalso how manifestation determinations are made, what happens to a child \nwith a disability during parent appeals, and how to treat children not \npreviously identified as disabled. In each of these categories, we have \ntaken a very substantial step forward, and made very substantial \nimprovement to the current legislation.\n  When a child with a disability violates school rules or codes of \nconduct through possession of weapons, drugs, or a demonstration of \nbehavior that is substantially likely to result in injury to the child, \nor to others in the school, the bill provides clear and simple guidance \nabout educators' areas of discretion, the parent's role, and procedural \nprotections for the child.\n  Clearly, we must remember that we are dealing here with the potential \nfor litigation, with court cases, with the civil rights of children, \nthe rights of the parents, and the responsibilities that we give to \neducators. Finding the appropriate balance is not easy. It is very \ndifficult to find that balance that will allow us to meet all these \nconcerns and tests.\n  Dangerous children can be removed from their current educational \nplacement. I want to stress this. There is a belief here that there is \nnothing we can do with children whose behavior is disruptive, if they \nbring violence to the classroom or to themselves, or if they possess \nweapons or drugs; this is not true. Under this legislation that we are \ndebating and will be voting on, dangerous children can be immediately \nremoved from their current educational placements. Specific standards \nmust be met to sustain their removal.\n  So you can remove the child, but S. 717 states that you must then \napply specific standards in order to sustain that removal. And it is \npossible to sustain that removal. If a behavior that is subject to \nschool discipline is not a manifestation of the child's disability, the \nchild can be disciplined the same as children without disabilities.\n  If, however, it is determined that the behavior was a manifestation \nof their disability, then, obviously, there is a separate standard to \nfollow. If parents disagree with the removal of their child from his or \nher current educational placement, they can request an expedited due \nprocess hearing. These are the parent's rights. If educators believe \nthat the removal of a child from their educational placement must be \nextended, they can ask for an extension in an expedited due process \nhearing--once again, the balance of the rights of the parents, the \nchild and the educators.\n  The bill allows school personnel to remove a child with disabilities \nto an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if that \nstudent has brought a weapon to school or to a school function, or \nknowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale \nof a controlled substance while at school or a school function. The \nbill gives school personnel the option of requesting that a hearing \nofficer move a child with a disability to an interim alternative \neducational setting for up to 45 days if a child is substantially \nlikely to injure themselves or others in their current placement.\n  There are some other provisions here, Mr. President, which, in the \ninterest of time and because others want to speak, I won't state. I \njust say to my colleagues that I very much believe we have made \nsubstantial improvements and addressed some of the major concerns in \nthe current statute. I don't discount all the things the Senator from \nWashington says because many in my State have indicated the same to me. \nWe have tried to address those concerns, balancing the civil rights of \nthose students and what we believe are important educational \nopportunities for those students, with the rights and the needs of \nteachers to have an orderly and safe classroom.\n  We have put all this together in this consensus bill which has been \ncrafted with bipartisan support on a bicameral basis. I think we have a \nbill--maybe the only bill--that can pass. Failure to pass this \nreauthorization bill, or alternatively passage of the amendments being \noffered, would undermine the consensus process and put us back to the \nstatus quo. We would be right back to a situation where none of the \ncomplaints or concerns arising from the current statute are addressed, \nand we would probably go an even more considerable amount of time \nbefore Congress is able to put together consensus to address these \nsignificant concerns.\n  So I hope we will look past what we believe to be perfect and look \ninstead toward what I think is a good, substantial move forward in \nterms of this statute. I commend the chairman of the committee for his \ndiligent work in that, and Senator Harkin for his long time support for \nthis and the many others, including the majority leader, who worked so \ndiligently to achieve this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am sorry to interrupt. I know the \nSenator from Iowa wishes to speak, as do some Senators on this side. \nUnfortunately, I am now 1 hour late to a hearing that I am supposed to \npreside over. So I would like to make just one or two remarks after \nwhich I will yield the balance of my time to the control of Senator \nSmith and he can proceed as he wishes.\n  Mr. President, I believe firmly that the case for my amendment has \nbeen established by the last two speakers, the Senator from Vermont and \nthe Senator from Indiana. We have heard a wave of arguments about \nmanifestation determinations and individual education plans and the \nfine distinctions between various forms of violence and disorder. My \ngood friend from Vermont has informed me not only that he knows more \nabout education in the State of Washington than I do, but that he knows \nmore about education in the State of Washington than do the \nsuperintendents of my schools in the State of Washington. Mr. \nPresident, that is the heart of this debate.\n  If, in fact, you believe the Senator from Vermont knows more about \nhow education ought to be provided to students in the State of \nWashington and in your State of Idaho, Mr. President, than do the \nprofessionals, the teachers and the administrators and the citizen \nschool board members in your State and mine, then by all means, you \nshould vote against my amendment and you should vote for this bill. If \nyou believe that what uniformity means in education in the United \nStates is that we should have exactly the same rules relating to \ndiscipline applicable to every one of the thousands of school districts \nand millions of students in the United States, then you should vote \nagainst my amendment and you should vote for this bill. If, however, \nyou believe that uniformity means something quite different, and that \nis that the rules should be uniform with respect to every student in a \ngiven school rather than a demonstrable double standard, in which the \nstudent sitting at this desk is subject to one set of rules and the \nstudent at that desk, a totally different set of rules, that that \nstudent can do things without significant discipline that this student \ncan't,\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\nthen you should vote for my amendment.\n\n  Somewhat naively, I had thought that all of us believed that \neducation was so important that the most vital decisions relating to it \nought to be made as close to the student and parent as possible. My \nfriend from Indiana spoke of involving the parents more in these \ndecisions. This bill does, but only those parents whose children can be \ndetermined to be disabled. What about the parents of the nondisabled \nstudents? Well, the quote from the letter to me, I simply need to \nrepeat:\n\n       I recently asked my school district attorney what rights I \n     had as a parent when the education program of my child was \n     interrupted by the behavioral disabled due to legal \n     decisions. His response was, ``You have no rights.''\n\n  Yes, if uniformity means the same rule for every school district, for \nevery school board member, for every principal across the country, then \nthis bill is going in the right direction and my amendment is going in \nthe wrong direction, except, of course, that we are making the rules \nbut we are not paying the bills.\n  I heard something about this being a constitutional responsibility. \nWell, Mr. President, if it were a constitutional responsibility, we \nwould not have to legislate at all. But just recently, under the \npresent law, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the State of Virginia \nruled that the Virginia law that stated that there were certain \noffenses that were egregious enough to allow for the absolute expulsion \nof a student applied equally to the disabled and to the nondisabled.\n  No constitutional right for this egregious behavior was found to \nlimit the discretion of the school authorities of Virginia. This bill \nreverses that decision. It says, ``Oh, no, Virginia, you have to have a \ndouble standard. You can expel the nondisabled. You cannot expel the \ndisabled no matter what the offense.''\n  That is what this bill says. That is not required by the Constitution \nof the United States. That is a value judgment made by the sponsors and \nthe writers of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I said yesterday--and it bears repeating just one more \ntime--I have asked school districts to serve as advisory committees to \nme in every county of the State of Washington with whom I visit. I try \nto visit at least once a year, and sometimes more than once. Every one \nof them has someone who is a teacher or a school board member or a \nprincipal. This subject is the one brought up by far the most often by \nall of the people who actually provide education--the interference in \nthe system. Oh, it is true, as the Senator from Vermont said, there are \nfewer lawsuits over it now than there were a few years ago. Why? \nBecause the school district can't win the lawsuit. So it now surrenders \nbefore the process is so much as started. But the costs of that \nsurrender are paid by every other student in those schools.\n  So I repeat one last time. Mr. President, if the Senators in this \nbody who have written this bill know more about schools and about \neducation--not just another Senator--than the people who have devoted \ntheir lives to public schools and to education, then you should follow \ntheir example.\n  Of course, many of the educational organizations have agreed with \nthis bill. Their alternative was even worse--the present system. I \ndon't blame them. I commend them for doing so. But, Mr. President, that \ndoesn't mean they like it. That doesn't mean they think we know what we \nare doing. That means they were told that this was the most they could \nget, and you either go along or get lost. And they have chosen to go \nalong. And they made a wise decision. But we don't have to make that \ndecision. We can decide, if we wish, that these are the decisions that \nought to be made by educators--not Senators. And, if you believe that, \nyou vote for the Gorton amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, a leader in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President I thank Senator Jeffords.\n  First of all, I thank Senator Coats for his recent statement that he \njust made on the floor. He hit all the right points. He talked about \nhow long this bill had been in the making and the delicate balance that \nwe reached. I thank Senator Coats for his efforts over a long period of \ntime in this area to reach this very delicate balance.\n  I also see my colleague, Senator Frist, on the floor. I want to \npublicly thank Senator Frist again for his great leadership in this \narea.\n  I was just looking up today, and it was on May 9, 1995, that Senator \nFrist held the first hearing on this bill--2 years ago. It has taken us \n2 years to get to this point. He has worked day and night on this to \ntry to get it through. Last year we had a lot of problems, and Senator \nFrist hung in there every step of the way making sure that we got this \nbill through. It took 2 years. But we no have a well-balanced bill. I \nwant to publicly thank Senator Frist for hanging in there and not \ngiving up. I appreciate that very much.\n  Of course, I thank Senator Jeffords, our leader on the committee, \nagain for leading us in this area. Again, Senator Jeffords was one of \nthe few around here who was there when Public Law 94-142 was passed. He \nwas a leader at that time 22 years ago. He is still here to lead the \ncharge on this landmark legislation.\n  I want to talk for a couple of minutes with regard to some of the \nthings that Senator Gorton brought up.\n  First, Senator Gorton said there are two main objections he had to \nthe bill. The first was that it was an unfunded mandate. This is, of \ncourse, not an unfunded mandate at all. No matter how many times \nsomeone may say it or how strongly they may say it, this is not an \nunfunded mandate. The Congressional Budget Office, the American Law \nDivision of the Library of Congress, and the Supreme Court, have all \nsaid this does not fall under the unfunded mandate legislation. So it \nis not an unfunded mandate. It is a civil rights bill, it is a law \nimplementing the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. It is not an unfunded mandate.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, let me put it this way. The State of \nIdaho does not have to provide a free public education to its kids. If \nthe State of Idaho decided to stop that, they can do it. But as long as \nthe State of Idaho decides that they will provide a free public \neducation to all their kids, then the State of Idaho can then not \ndiscriminate against kids because they are black or they are brown or \nthey are female or they are disabled. That free education must be \navailable to all kids. The Supreme Court has decided that.\n  So it is a constitutional mandate, not an unfunded mandate.\n  What we have said with IDEA--Public Law 94-142--is, ``Look, we will \ntry to help the States meet that obligation because it will cost some \nmoney, and we will help them meet that.'' That is why Senator Gregg \nmoved in this area to get the Federal Government to pick up more of \nthat obligation. We should. But I do not want to go into that anymore. \nSenator Jeffords responded to that.\n  But this is a civil rights bill.\n  What Senator Gorton's amendment basically says is, if you just read \nthe first words, ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this act,'' \neach State educational agency, et cetera, can decide for themselves \nwhat they want to do. Notwithstanding anything else, they can do \nwhatever they want to do.\n  Would Senator Gorton apply that same reasoning to the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964--notwithstanding any other provision of the law, if a \njurisdiction wants to discriminate against African-Americans, they can \ndo so, they can fashion whatever framework they want? Would Senator \nGorton apply that to title IX and say, ``Well, with regard to women, \neach jurisdiction can decide whatever they want and how it applies to \nwomen''? We can do that with the civil rights bill? Of course not. \nCivil rights applies to all in this country.\n  The second thing he brought up was the cost. He mentioned something \nabout the cost of this in terms of the mandate. There are a lot of ways \nto look at the cost. But what is the marginal cost of this? We have \nsome figures here. You have to look at the savings. The average per \nstudent in America for those in special education the average cost is \n$6,100.\n  So it costs about 14 percent more marginally to educate a kid with \ndisabilities than a child without disabilities.\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\n  Well, is it worth it? We have to ask: Is it worth it to spend that 14 \npercent?\n  Look at it this way. Mr. President, in 1974, before the enactment of \nthis bill, 70,655 children were living in State institutions. By 1994, \n20 years later, as a direct result of this bill, that number went to \n4,001--less than 6 percent of what it had been 20 years before.\n  What is the cost? What is the savings? The average State institution \ncost was $82,256 per person in 1994.\n  So, if you take the difference of $66,654 for kids that are not \ninstitutionalized but are in school learning, that is a savings to the \nState of $5.46 billion each and every year. That doesn't include the \nsavings later on in welfare costs.\n  For example, my friend, Danny Piper, who got special education, went \nto school. We figured up for Danny Piper that the total cost of his \nspecial education was $63,000. That is what it cost. Danny Piper today \nis living on his own in an apartment and takes the bus to work. He is \nemployed. He is a taxpayer. He is not in an institution. But when he \nwas born with Down's syndrome, the doctors told his parents, ``Put him \nin an institution.'' They refused to do so. Because of IDEA, they got \nhim in school in special education. He did well in high school. Now he \nis working and making money. The cost to the taxpayers of the State of \nIowa to institutionalize Danny Piper would have been $5 million. Do you \nknow what it cost us? $63,000 to get him his education.\n\n  So you can look at it from the cost, but you have to look at it from \nthe other side--the savings side, not to mention lifestyles, quality of \nlife, and what it means to the Danny Pipers and others not to be \ninstitutionalized.\n  Lastly, Senator Gorton talks about the double standard. I am sorry. \nThat is just not so. There is no double standard here at all.\n  I guess what we have to ask is, What do we want at the end of the \nday? At the end of the day, we want a safe classroom with an \nenvironment that is conducive to learning for all students. That is \nwhat we are all about. What we want to do is teach children behavior \nthat will lead to that safe, quiet classroom that is conducive to \nlearning. Under IDEA, we want to use discipline as a tool to learn and \nnot just as a punishment and to ensure that each child receives the \nsupportive services necessary to function appropriately in a classroom \nenvironment.\n  For example, we have some examples of kids. Here is one. I have \nhundreds of these examples. Here is one, Nick Evans in Wisconsin. I \nhave a letter here dated January 24, 1997. He was in school. He was \nfighting. We are told that they did not know what to do with him. We \nare told by the school that they felt Nick was emotionally disturbed, \nmentally retarded, and did not belong in the school. They did not know \nwhat to do. But they sought an evaluation at the clinic in La Crosse, \nWI. They met with the child's specialist. He had a superior IQ of over \n130. His behavior problem stemmed from tremendous frustration of an \nunidentified, profound learning disability. Once that was recognized, \nonce he got the supportive services, his behavior problems literally \ndisappeared overnight. Now he is an A, honor roll, student. The kids \nwant to work with him. When he is doing a class work science project, \nthe classmates choose to work with him. This is a kid who the school \nsaid, ``Kick him out. Get rid of him. He is disturbing everybody. He is \ndangerous.'' But he got the supportive services and the proper kind of \ndiscipline--the discipline to teach him how to act within that \nenvironment.\n  I can go through a lot of them. Here is Molly, who was very abusive \nto others, hitting and pushing them; teachers wanting the child \nremoved. A speech language pathologist was called in. They commenced a \nprogram and found out that she had a communications problem. Within 12 \nweeks her ability to talk to her peers grew. Her behavior problems \nfaded away.\n  Here is a family of three. The children engaged in fighting, \naggressive outbursts, name calling. Frustrated by lack of support by \nthe school system, they moved to a neighboring district where they \nfound the support, and now all three of their kids are honor roll \nstudents and doing well.\n  Let me talk about Mike McTaggart of Sioux City, something closer to \nmy home. I visited the school last year. Mike McTaggart is the \nprincipal of West Middle School in Sioux City. Listen to this. There \nare 650 students in the middle school. Student population is 28 percent \nminority, 32 percent are children with disabilities, and one out of \nthree have IDP. One year prior to Dr. McTaggart coming there and taking \nover this school, there were 692 suspensions, and of those suspended, \n220 were disabled children. The absenteeism rate was 25 percent, and \nthere were 267 referrals to juvenile authorities in 1 year.\n  In 1 year. Dr. McTaggart came in, and 1 year later the number of \nsuspensions of nondisabled children went from 692 to 156. The number of \nsuspensions of disabled children went from 220 to zero. Attendance has \ngone from 72 percent to 98.5 percent. Juvenile court referrals went \nfrom 267 to 3.\n  What happened in that 1 year? We had a principal who came in--who \nbrought a different philosophy, a philosophy of using discipline as a \ntool to teach rather than to punish, and turned that school around by \ninvolving kids and involving their parents. That school is very \nsuccessful today. But if you had looked at that school before he got \nthere, there was a lot of blame on the kids--blame the kids, blame \ntheir parents. They shouldn't be there. They are dangerous. Get them \nout of there. There were 267 referrals to juvenile authorities--from \nthat to 3 in 1 year--and 220 disabled kids were suspended. It went to \nzero the next year.\n  I am just saying that is again bringing in someone who understands a \ndifferent philosophy, that you use discipline as a method of teaching \nand enabling--not just as a method of punishment.\n  Lastly, the Senator from Washington State kept asking the question. \nHe had a letter that he was reading from a parent in Washington who \nbasically said that I asked my attorney--and I am paraphrasing here. \nBut the letter the Senator read into the Record was, what rights do I \nhave for my child to be free from all this commotion, and dangerous \nactivity in school. And the attorney said, ``You have no rights.'' \nWell, first of all, I would suggest that parent get a different \nattorney because you do have rights.\n  That parent has the right to demand of that school a safe and \nconducive learning environment. They have a right to demand that. They \nought to demand it. What they don't have the right to do is to demand \nthat a disabled kid gets kicked out of school. They don't have that \nright.\n  It would be like this. Let's say, Mr. President, that a caucasian kid \ncame to school and had to sit next to an African-American. They said, \n``Well, I don't like that. I don't like this integration.'' I am \nconjuring up memories of a few years ago. ``Oh, no. Those kids cause \nall kinds of problems in school. They couldn't be conducive to a \nlearning environment.'' Well, we found out that wasn't so, as long as \nteachers and principals and parents got together, and in sort of an \natmosphere of working together, it was fine; no problems.\n  Let's say that a child went to school, and all of a sudden sitting \nnext to him was a physically disabled child who made them nervous \nbecause they didn't look the same, they didn't act the same, they had a \nphysical disability that, well, maybe they weren't like the rest of the \nkids. Would a parent who said, hey, wait a minute. My kid has to sit \nthere and it's disturbing; it confuses him; it is not a good, conducive \natmosphere for him to learn--would that parent have the right to say, \nkick that disabled kid out of school? No. But what the parent has the \nright to do is demand of the school that they provide a safe and \nconducive learning environment.\n  That means at least to this Senator that the school has to develop \nstrategies to make the classroom safe and quiet and conducive to \nlearning. If kids are disturbed by someone who is in the classroom, by \ntheir appearance or by their actions, that means you develop a strategy \nto deal with it and bring the parents in and provide for an atmosphere \nwhere kids can learn, not just a knee-jerk reaction and say, well, the \neasiest course of action is to expel them, kick them out, get rid of \nthem, segregate them, exclude them.\n  We have been down that road before. The whole theory of IDEA, the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act, is to mainstream, is to \nbring people together, not to segregate people.\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\n  So I would say to the person who wrote that letter to Senator Gorton, \nyes, you have that right; go to that school and demand the safe, \nconducive learning environment. You have that right. But you do not \nhave the right to demand the kid gets kicked out because he or she is \ndisabled. You do not have that right. So I would suggest that perhaps \nthey ought to get a different attorney. I just wanted to make those \ncomments. I did not have the time before.\n\n  There was one other thing. Again, showing how things can happen if \npeople really do want to make it work, will work together, on January \n29 of this year Elizabeth Healy, a member of the Pittsburgh School \nBoard, testified before our committee. She said she thought IDEA was a \ngood law; it is working. She said the Pittsburgh School District has \nadopted a family centered inclusive approach to provide special \neducation. Because of what they did in Pittsburgh, because of this \nfamily centered approach, the number of due process hearings has \nplummeted.\n  Unlike reports from other urban school districts regarding the due \nprocess hearings, last year there was only one due process hearing and \none special education mediation in the entire school district in \nPittsburgh. I do not know a lot about Pittsburgh, but it is a pretty \nurban city. One due process hearing, one special education mediation in \nthe entire school district.\n  I might suggest to the Senator from Washington that he might want to \ntake the principal of this school that he keeps talking about with all \nthese problems and maybe send him to Pittsburgh and have him look at \nwhat they did there or send him to Sioux City, IA, and we will have him \nlook at what Principal Mike McTaggart did there. And maybe, and I say \nthis in all candor and seriousness, they could pick up some pointers on \nhow to structure the school environment, how to involve the families, \nso that they will have the same results as Sioux City or the same \nresults as Pittsburgh.\n  So I am saying it is not impossible. It is very possible to have a \nsafe and conducive learning environment and to meet at the same time \nthe requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. \nWhat it really takes is a commitment by the school boards, teachers and \nprincipals, parents and the community to work together in an atmosphere \nof mutual accommodation and understanding and support. If they do that, \nthere won't be that many problems. Oh, you will always have some \nproblems, but, my gosh, Pittsburgh went down to one due process \nhearing. That is the kind of goals we ought to be looking for.\n  That is what this bill does. That is what this bill does. I have to \ntell you, Mr. President, a lot of times my heart goes out to teachers \nwho are in the classroom and they are confronted with situations where \nthey have emotionally disturbed kids, physically disabled kids, \nmentally disabled kids, and that teacher does not have the proper \nsupport and learning and training to know how to deal with it. Teachers \nneed that support. They need that kind of training and that kind of \neducational support that will help them. That is what we are talking \nabout here. If they do that, IDEA will work, but it will not work if \nour reaction is, first of all, notwithstanding any other provision of \nthis act, let each school district decide for themselves.\n  That is what the Gorton amendment does. That is not conducive to an \ninclusionary-type of principle where we are going to bring kids \ntogether. We are a much better society today because we have included \npeople with disabilities. We are a stronger society. As President \nClinton says so often, as we enter the next century, we cannot leave \none person behind, and we certainly should not leave people behind just \nbecause they have a physical or mental disability.\n  That is what this bill does. It provides those kids with that support \nand those opportunities the kind of education that allows kids to dream \nand allows kids with disabilities to know that they can fulfill their \npotential. We all have different potentials. Kids with disabilities are \nno different. They have potential, too, to achieve, to dream, and to do \nwonderful things. We have seen it happen because of the Individuals \nWith Disabilities Education Act.\n  This bill that we have before us, this reauthorization, as I said, is \ncarefully crafted, very balanced. I think it meets all of the needs of \nparents and school administrators and, most importantly, meets the \nneeds of the kids themselves not to be segregated out but to be \nincluded, to make sure they have the support they need so that they can \nbecome fully self-sufficient, productive, loyal American citizens in \ntheir adulthood. That is what this bill is all about.\n\n  Mr. President, are there situations where a school officials must \ntake immmediate action to remove a disabled child from his or her \ncurrent placement? The answer is yes, and this bill provides for two \nlimited exceptions to the stay put provision under which children with \ndisabilities are entitled to stay in their current placement pending \nappeals.\n  Under the first exception to the stay put provision, school officials \nare provided authority to remove a child from his or her current \nplacement into an interim alternative educational setting for the same \namount of time they could remove a nondisabled child, but for not more \nthan 45 days, if the child carries a weapon or knowingly possesses, \nuses, or sells illegal drugs or controlled substances.\n  Under the second exception to the stay put provision, local \nauthorities can secure authority from an impartial hearing officer--in \naddition to a court--to remove a child from his or her current \neducational placement into an interim alternative educational setting \nfor up to 45 days if the school officials can demonstrate by \nsubstantial evidence--that is, beyond a preponderance of the evidence--\nthat maintaining the child in the current placement is substantially \nlikely to result in injury to the child or others.\n  Some of my colleagues have raised concerns about allowing impartial \nhearing officers to make these critical decisions. I support this \nprovision for several reasons.\n  First, this standard codifies the holding in Honig versus Doe. In \nthat case, the burden was clearly placed on the school officials to \nrebut the presumption in favor of maintaining the child in the current \nplacement. Thus, the case does not deal with perceptions or stereotypes \nabout disabled children but provides authority to remove a child who \ntruly is dangerous.\n  Second, in giving the authority to make these determinations to \nimpartial hearing officers, the proposal not only includes the \n``substantial likelihood of injury'' standard, but also specifies that \nthe hearing officer must consider the appropriateness of the child's \ncurrent placement and whether reasonable efforts have been made by the \nlocal school officials to minimize the risk of harm, including the use \nof supplementary aids and services, and if the child is moved, the \nhearing officer must determine that the new placement will allow the \nchild to continue to participate in the general curriculum and to meet \nthe goals of the IMP and that the child will receive services that are \ndesigned to address the behavior that led to the removal.\n  Third, in placing this additional authority with hearing officers, \nthe bill recognizes the important role already assigned to these \nindividuals in guaranteeing the rights of disabled children. It is \nbecause of the importance of this role that the act requires that \nhearing officers be impartial. This means, for example, that a hearing \nofficer could not be an employee of the child's school district. It is \nmy expectation that the Department will re-examine current policies \nconcerning impartiality in order to ensure that, to the maximum extent \nfeasible, the integrity of these persons, and thus the system, is \nensured.\n  It is also my expectation that hearing officers will be provided \nappropriate training to carry out this new responsibility in an \ninformed and impartial manner and that both SEA's and the Secretary \nwill closely monitor the implementation of this provision.\n  In sum, Mr. President, we do not have to choose between school chaos \nand denying education to children with disabilities in order to \nmaintain schools that are safe and conducive to learning. If anything, \nparents with disabled children want schools that are safe and conducive \nto learning more than other parents because their children are \nfrequently more distractible and more likely to be the brunt of attacks \nand abuse.\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\n  Parents who have disabled children are not asking that they be \nexcused from learning responsibility and discipline. What they are \nasking for is that the approaches used be individually tailored to \naccomplish the objectives of maintaining a school environment that \ntruly is safe and conducive to learning for all children, including \nchildren with disabilities.\n  Mr. President, this bill provides a fair-balanced approach to \nensuring school environments that are safe and conducive to learning. I \nurge my colleagues to support the underlying bill and reject the Gorton \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I compliment my good friend from Iowa, \nwho, along with me, came in about the time that this special education \nlegislation was enacted back in 1975, and we have worked closely \ntogether on matters of disabilities ever since that time. It is a \npleasure to work with the Senator. I think we have had pretty \nsuccessful adventures along this line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment that I wish to talk to is the amendment on discipline \nwhich would instruct local education agencies to set their own policy \nin disciplining disabled students. In short, each school district could \nthen have its own distinct policy defined for itself in how to \ndiscipline children with and without disabilities. I oppose such an \namendment.\n  A statement was made that the underlying bill is leading us in the \nwrong direction and that this amendment would set us back in the right \ndirection, at least in that one area of discipline. I disagree.\n  In the statement, the case was cited that there were two \nschoolchildren sitting together, one with a disability and one without \na disability, and that they both should be treated exactly the same.\n  I would argue that that is difficult to do. Let me give two brief \nexamples where I find it hard to have a different process other than \nthe one spelled out by Senator Jeffords and as spelled out in the \ndefinitions. And, yes, it is several pages long because it takes that \nsort of detail when we are dealing with the issue of individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Let us say that one of the people in these chairs has a syndrome \ncalled Tourette's syndrome. That individual who would be sitting in \nthat chair could learn just as well as the other individual, could take \nadvantage of the education just as well as that other individual. If \nthat individual has a disability, a disability called Tourette's \nsyndrome where, with everything else hooked up in a normal way, there \nis one little cross-connection in one little tiny part of the brain \nthat causes that individual, while they are sitting there studying and \nlearning with the same capacity as everybody else, with the potential \nto be as successful an individual as anybody else, for some reason we \ndo not understand--as a physician, I do not understand, scientists do \nnot understand yet; hopefully, we will change that--that individual all \nof a sudden blurts out something that does not relate to anything at \nall.\n  Should that person have the same process for disciplining as the \nindividual next to him? Some people would say yes. I would say no, that \nsome attention needs to be paid that that is a manifestation. And, yes, \nwe spell it out in the bill. What if we did not? What would we go back \nto--22, 24 years ago where that student would be thrown out of the \nclassroom and thrown out of school through no fault of their own when \nthey can learn just as well as anybody else? I say no, the process \nneeds to be different. And it is spelled out in detail as the Senator \nfrom Vermont has read from the bill earlier--a different process. You \ncan call that a double standard, I guess, because people will react to \nthat and say, no, double standards are wrong. I call it a different \nprocess and for a very good reason. If you go back 25 years, you see \nwhy.\n\n  Or let us say there is another student. Let us call him Tom. Let us \nput him in the fourth grade. Let us say he can learn well, he has the \npotential to be everything that one would wish his son to be in the \nfuture, yet Tom has a severe developmental disability. Say he is an \nindividual with mental retardation. I do not know exactly what that \nmeans, but most people understand generally what I am talking about. \nAnd let us say somebody comes up to Tom in the fourth grade--and we all \nknow bullies like this. This is the reality. This is the reality of the \nclassroom today. A bully comes up and says, we are going to get Tom; \nlet's give Tom this little toy gun. ``Tom, this is a little toy gun.'' \nIn truth, this is not a toy gun. In truth, that bully brought it from \nhome, put it in his pocket, and he knows how to get Tom and he gives it \nto Tom. And Tom says it looks like a toy gun. As a father, I can't tell \nthe difference between toy guns and real guns. I look at them closely. \nTom looks at it and says, yes, and I appreciate the gift, and so he \nputs it in his locker. Now the principal or teacher comes forward and \nopens the locker and finds what Tom thinks is a toy gun. Remember, Tom \ncan learn just as well as anybody else, can benefit from an education. \nShould the process be to throw him out of school when it probably is a \nmanifestation of his disability? And so, yes, you can call it a double \nstandard. I call it a process, a very specific process where we do have \nto spell out manifestation and, yes, it takes more than six lines on \none page to do that.\n  It is not quite so simple, and I would argue that with two people \nsitting in the same room, if one of them has a manifestation of a \ndisability, we need--and not just we but people across all 16,000 \nschool districts--to have a process, a fair and equitable way, to \ndiscipline that individual.\n  Senator Harkin mentioned that 2 years ago I held a hearing, and it \nwas really the first hearing I held as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nDisability Policy. It was about the original enactment and what led to \nthat enactment. I was looking at those hearings, and it was really \npowerful. I encourage my colleagues to go back and look at that 20-year \nhistory, what led up to it. It was very clear that IDEA, the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act, was enacted to establish a \nconsistent policy, not what Senator Gorton's amendment would do, have \n16,000 school districts each with their own policy to handle the sort \nof situation, but it was enacted to establish a consistent policy that \npeople could read and understand for States and school districts to \ncomply with. With what? The equal protection clause under the 14th \namendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  We hear the words ``unfunded mandate'' and ``mandated.'' We passed \nIDEA. Unfunded, yes. I will not argue with that. A mandate? This goes \nback to a civil rights issue as defined by the Supreme Court decision \nafter IDEA was enacted. The Supreme Court, under Smith v. Robinson, \nrecognized IDEA as ``a civil rights statute that aids States in \ncomplying with the equal protection clause under the 14th amendment.'' \nAgain, it was very clear to me in those hearings 2 years ago as we went \nback and looked at the decisions, two landmark decisions that Senator \nHarkin talked about yesterday, in 1972 which established the \nconstitutional rights--not a mandate, the constitutional rights--for \nindividuals with disabilities to receive a free, appropriate public \neducation.\n  So now what we want to do is turn back to allow 16,000--it may be \n15,000, it may be 17,000--individual school districts to try to go \nthrough this definition to really throw aside what we have learned over \nthe last 20 years, which we have modernized through our current bill, \nto go back and allow 16,000 school districts to reinvent the wheel, to \ntry to learn once again what we have learned over the last 20 years--\npotentially 16,000 separate policies.\n\n  Talk about lawsuits. We have had many people comment on attorneys and \nattorney's fees and how difficult it is. Talk about lawsuits with \n16,000 different policies. I can see somebody moving from Davidson \nCounty where I live to Williamson County only because, as parents of a \nchild with disabilities, they think that the discipline requirements \nmight be fairer. I think lawsuits will explode. Our bill provides one \nset of rules, an update, defining, yes, manifestation and, yes, \ndiscipline\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\nif it is not a manifestation in a very clear way, with discretion for \nschool districts, with protection for children.\n  The whole manifestation issue I do not think we need go into now. The \nSenator from Vermont went through it in pretty much detail. But let me \njust point out again for weapons or drugs--and it has been expanded to \ncover weapons, possession and use or distribution of illegal drugs--if \nit is not a manifestation of that disability, the school would \ndiscipline that student just as they would a nondisabled student who \nengaged in such behavior. There is nothing exceptional about that. If \nit was a manifestation, very clearly--so all 16,000 school districts \ncan understand this civil rights issue--how to discipline that student \nin an orderly way that parents understand, the individuals with \ndisabilities understand, the principals understand. For all other \nbehavior subject to disciplinary action, again, if it is not a \nmanifestation, that is, other than weapons and other than drugs, again, \nstudents are treated just as those without disabilities. If it is a \nmanifestation, again, it is spelled out in IDEA.\n  I just close and simply say that all major educational organizations \ndo support this bill. It is not perfect. We sat around the table night \nafter night and day after day bringing people together. It is not \nperfect. But they say support this bill. Why support this bill? Because \nthis bill as clearly defined is the way that we can improve the \ntreatment of individuals with disabilities in discipline.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Minnesota 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to commend my friend \nand colleague, Chairman Jeffords, for the exemplary work he has done in \nregard to the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act. That this is the first time in 22 years that Congress \nhas attempted major changes to its law with any likelihood of success \nspeaks volumes about the time, energy, and commitment Senator Jeffords \nand others have devoted to it.\n  Over the last 5 months, I have listened to the concern of school \nboard members, students, parents, principals, teachers, and \nadministrators from all over Minnesota on the issue of IDEA. Primarily, \neach of these groups stressed concern over proliferating litigation, \nprogram inflexibility in regard to discipline, and the tremendous cost \nburdens associated with the mandates that have been placed on our \nschools.\n  In regard to the issue of discipline, this legislation provides \nadditional flexibility to deal with children who are disruptive in the \nclassroom or who are otherwise a danger to themselves or others. \nClearly, this is an instance where the interests of the child and the \ninterests of sound learning in the classroom must be carefully balanced \nto ensure that neither are breached. Unfortunately, current Federal law \ndictates that a child may only be removed from school if the parents \nconsent to removal or if the student brings a firearm to school.\n  Mr. President, this is not balance at all. This legislation makes \nconsiderable strides toward restoring some balance by returning more \ndecisionmaking to the people who know best, and that is those who \nactually teach our children.\n\n  Another issue is litigation. According to a study done by the \nMinnesota State Legislature, one of the largest factors contributing to \nthe increased costs in educating their children is the cost of special \neducation. Unfortunately, too many of these expenses have nothing to do \nwith buying things such as Braille for the visually impaired or \nproviding instruction for children with disabilities. Many of these \nexpenses are legal fees resulting from litigation between schools and \nthe parents of children with disabilities.\n  In light of the limited resources available to pay for the mandates \nimposed by IDEA, this is a glaring flaw that is ripe for reform. Toward \nthis end, S. 717 requires States to establish a mediation system and \nprovides incentives for parents to avail themselves of mediation \ninstead of litigation to amicably resolve their differences.\n  The one issue that is not addressed in this legislation, however, and \nit is, in my view, a critical one, is the issue of funding. The Senator \nfrom Vermont has urged Senators to wait for another day to tackle this \nissue. The Senator's objection to dealing with funding at this juncture \nis not based on substance but, rather, on process, and I fully \nappreciate these constraints. We need to pass this bill.\n  However, because I believe the issue of funding is so vital to the \nsuccess of IDEA's reforms, I must reluctantly part paths with the \nchairman. I believe the funding issue should be addressed now. As \nSenator Gorton has pointed out, IDEA is an unfunded mandate on our 50 \nStates and our schools. As such, consistent with the spirit, if not the \nletter, of the unfunded mandates legislation we approved last Congress, \nthe mandate imposed by IDEA should either be repealed or it should be \npaid for. As it stands, the Federal Government pays a mere 7 percent of \nthe total cost we impose on our schools through IDEA. It is my \nconsidered opinion that the Federal Government should put its money \nwhere its mouth is. In short, Congress must fully appreciate the \nconsequences of its actions. If Congress places a premium on a desired \ngoal or sets a priority for States or local governments to attain, the \nFederal Government must ante up or then reconsider that mandate. And \nbecause I believe IDEA serves an important role in the education of our \ndisabled children in Minnesota and throughout the Nation, in this case \nI believe Congress should ante up. Accordingly, if it is offered, I \nwill support the Gregg amendment to fully fund the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I just wanted to say again I support S. \n717 because it does improve upon the commitment we have made to \ndisabled students in Minnesota and throughout the country. Although I \nwish it would have gone a little farther, I support the Gregg \namendment, as I said, because it backs up this profound commitment. But \nin my view, if we at the Federal level really desire to help our \nNation's schools, we will finish the jobs we started. Beyond this, the \nFederal Government's next job in furthering the education of our \nchildren is to step aside and allow parents and school boards to do the \njob they were designed to do and not the Federal Government.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 27\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from New \nHampshire, [Mr. Smith].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is expected to vote shortly on S. \n717, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Amendments Act of \n1997, also known as the IDEA bill. Mr. President, I compliment the \nmanagers of the bill, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Jeffords. They have worked \nhard and the legislation is certainly an improvement over the current \nsituation.\n  I do have some reservations about the contents of the bill--I intend \nto vote for it--and about the manner in which it was brought up for \nconsideration.\n  Before I cast my vote, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my concern with the legislation. First, and foremost, a \ncommittee report on S. 717 was not available until early on Monday, \nyesterday, and the Senate proceeded to debate S. 717 on Monday. That is \nnot anything new around here. We are witnessing more and more of it, \nand too much of it. I was not able to secure a copy of the report until \nyesterday afternoon, which constrained my ability to read the committee \nreport as thoroughly as I would have liked. It is unfortunate and \nunnecessary that our independent judgment as Senators is so often being \nsubjected to\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\nnarrow time constraints to render a decision on the ramifications of \nimportant bills such as this one.\n  In addition, I have been contacted by a number of West Virginians who \nhave raised concerns about the ``stay-put'' clause in the current law \nfor violent and disabled students. The ``stay-put'' provision means \nthat a disabled student cannot be removed from his or her current \nclassroom until a hearing is held to resolve the matter. Under S. 717, \nsteps have been taken to attempt to correct this matter by permitting \nlocal school authorities to relocate a disabled child into an \nalternative educational environment for up to 45 days pending an appeal \nif he or she brings a weapon to a school or a school function, or \nconsumes or solicits a controlled substance.\n  I think these provisions are improvements, as I say, over the \npresent. But I don't think they go far enough. Why should school \nauthorities be limited to a period of 45 days for the removal of a \ndisabled student--disabled or any other student--who carries a weapon \nto school or uses drugs at school or school-sponsored events? Why not \n90 days? Why not longer, if the situation warrants it? While I applaud \nthe efforts of the sponsors to provide the local schools with more \nauthority to deal with a violent and disabled child, I am disappointed \nthat more stringent discipline provisions are not included in the final \ndraft of the bill. We ought to consider the security and educational \nneeds of every student in the class, in addition to the disabled child.\n  Finally, I have, over the years, detailed the national problem of \nalcohol abuse, and have urged people, young and old, not to drink and \ndrive--but not to drink, period. That is the way I feel about it: Not \nto drink. I have urged people, young and old, to abstain from drinking \nalcohol. Yet, S. 717 makes no reference to a disabled child who brings \nor consumes alcohol on school property. I know the sponsors would argue \nthat the bill contains language that would allow local school officials \nto exact discipline under the same terms that a nondisabled student \nwould face. But it is my opinion that alcohol is just as evil as any \nother drug defined by the Controlled Substance Act, to which S. 717 \nrefers. Therefore, I believe that the bill should include alcohol under \nthe provisions that relate to school officials' authority for the \nimmediate removal of a disabled child who possesses a weapon or a \ncontrolled substance on school property. I hope that, when the managers \nagain consider legislation of this type, they will consider carefully \nthe inclusion of the word ``alcohol.'' It does not hurt to have it in, \nand it may help.\n\n  In conclusion, I will vote for S. 717, the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Amendments Act of 1997, but I would like to \ninform my fellow Senators that the manner in which we have arrived at \nthis point troubles me. Proponents of the bill have argued that the \nquick markup of the bill and its subsequent expeditious floor clearance \nwas necessary to avoid a subsequent demolition of the fragile agreement \nthat has been reached. Mr. President, if it is all that fragile, \nperhaps we ought to start over. Mr. President, efforts to ram \nlegislation through, not only in this case but all too many other \ncases, as we have seen around here in late years, are not consistent \nwith the duties of the Senate to adequately deliberate on a matter that \naffects millions of disabled and nondisabled children who have a right \nto a safe and appropriate public education.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \nfor yielding me the time. I again congratulate the managers of the bill \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to indicate, first \nand foremost, that I understand what the sponsors of the bill are \ntrying to do. I support the concept of reforming the IDEA law. I do not \nfault them for trying to make the changes. What I fault is the process \nin which we bring the bill to the floor with a locked-up agreement. One \nof the greatest aspects of the U.S. Senate is that we have the \nopportunity to debate, and hopefully sometimes have a couple of people \nlisten to what we say and influence an outcome. I realize that does not \nhappen very often around here. But in this particular case, we do not \nhave the opportunity to influence the outcome because we are told: A \ndeal has been struck between the House and the Senate, minority and \nmajority, White House and everybody else. It is just one happy old time \nhere, everything is done and we do not need to debate it, we do not \nneed to suggest any changes.\n  Perhaps an analogy might be if we had an agreement to spend $1 \nbillion on cancer research and somebody told us if we spent another $50 \nmillion we could cure cancer, I think we would be prepared to amend the \nbill to add the $50 million to the $1 billion in a hurry. So I do not \nsupport this kind of process. I do not think it is right, and I think \nthat we can strengthen a bill and, if somewhere along the line the \nPresident specifically decides to veto the bill with the strengthened \nprovision, we have a constitutional process--the Founding Fathers \nthought it out very clearly--which says that bill would come back here, \nto the Senate and House, and we could override his veto or not. So I do \nnot think anything is lost by allowing Senator Gorton and myself the \nopportunity to offer amendments in good faith.\n  You might say, You are offering your amendments. Yes, we are, but we \nare offering them with just about everybody out there against us, even \nthough I believe our ideas are good.\n  Senator Gorton made some very interesting points on his amendment, \nand I rise in strong support of that amendment, which is the business \nbefore us. He made the interesting point that he did not feel U.S. \nSenators necessarily knew more about what was happening in the various \nschool districts in Washington State or in New Hampshire, for that \nmatter, than the people in those districts did. I could not agree with \nhim more. I bring perhaps a different perspective than many of my \ncolleagues here in the Senate. I spent 6 years in the classroom as a \nteacher. I also spent 6 years on a school board. I know what Public Law \n194 is, and I know the good things that that law has done for people \nwho are in need of special education. It has done wonders for many, \nmany students who were in need.\n  The Senator from Iowa made specific reference to one individual who \nhad been helped under this program. I applaud that. That is not what we \nare talking about. What we are talking about is this basically \ndistorting the process to write individualized education plans for \npeople who perhaps should not have IEP's; who really are not in the \nsame category as the young man who was mentioned by the Senator from \nIowa.\n  I took the opportunity, even though this is not a bill that is in the \njurisdiction of any of my committees--that is Senator Jeffords' \ncommittee--I did something that perhaps is not always done around here, \nI wrote to all the school districts in my State and I asked for input \non this legislation. I informed them I felt there was a good \nopportunity, that Senator Jeffords and others were moving the bill \nthrough the process here, that it was going to improve the special \neducation program or IDEA as we know it, and I think Senator Jeffords \nhas done that. He has improved it. But the question again goes back to \nmy original point. Can we improve it more? I think Senator Gorton's \namendment does that. I would like to explain why I think that is the \ncase. I would like to explain the rationale for the amendment, which is \nintended to ensure that the education of all students not be \ncompromised.\n  This is an important issue. I wish we had the opportunity for more \ndebate, but unfortunately we do not have that. The problem the Gorton-\nSmith school safety amendment addresses is, I believe, one of the most \nserious problems in all of the legislation. A safe school environment \nis a precondition for learning.\n  I listened to my colleague, for whom I have the greatest respect, Dr. \nFrist, the Senator from Tennessee. He used some medical examples and \nindicated that there are times when these unexplained medical \noccurrences occur. I understand that. I respect that. I do not claim to \nchallenge his medical knowledge. But I hope we might speak from the \nteacher's point of view, because that is what this is all about. We are \nnot talking, here, just about helping children who need help. That is \none part of it. There are children who need\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\nhelp. But there are also children, for whatever reason--whether it is \nbecause they need help or because they got an IEP that they should not \nhave gotten, an individual educational plan--they are disrupting the \nclassroom. And there are other students in that classroom.\n  When I am standing before that classroom, trying to teach 25 other \nstudents, and this student blurts something out and disrupts the class, \nor waves a gun in class, or brings drugs into class, or shouts \nobscenities, or whatever else the student may decide to do, it really, \nas far as the other 25 students in the class are concerned--I do not \nreally think that they are overly concerned at that point, when the \nclassroom is disrupted and education is disrupted, as to what the cause \nis, or what the problem may be specifically with this child. It is a \nproblem. If it is a medical problem, it ought to get medical attention. \nIf it is a discipline problem, it ought to get disciplinary attention. \nThat disciplinary attention ought to come from the decisions of the \nteacher, parents, school board, school administrators--not from the \nFederal Government. Not from the U.S. Senate.\n  So, the school safety amendment is a commonsense addition to this \nbill. That is all it is. It simply ensures that the rules governing \ndiscipline in schools may be formulated in such a way as to treat all \nstudents uniformly. Without this amendment, S. 717 will preserve the \ndouble standard that exists under current law. Students will see there \nis one standard for students diagnosed with disabilities and another \none for those who do not have such a diagnosis.\n  Recently, my office received a call from a school board chairman in \nNew Hampshire complaining that a student in one of the districts had \nbrought a gun to school. He reported that because the student had been \ndiagnosed with a disability, the school board was powerless to \nintervene. It goes without saying that without the diagnosis, the \nsituation would have been different.\n  I ask you, Mr. President, if you are standing in that classroom \ntrying to teach those other students and a kid waves a gun around, at \nthat point, do you really care specifically what his problem is? When \nsomebody walks into a bank and waves a firearm at a clerk, at that \npoint in time, are we really concerned about how difficult his or her \nchildhood may have been, or are we concerned about dealing with the \nnow, what is of utmost urgency, and that is the violence that is \npending, immediately and then deal with the other problem? Doesn't that \nmake more sense, I say to my colleagues? That is all Senator Gorton is \ntrying to do. That is all his amendment does.\n  If you read on page 157 in the bill, basically what it says is that \nif you have that student waving that gun, you can get that student out \nof the classroom, according to the Federal Government now dictating to \nthe school district. You can get the student out of the classroom for \n45 days. That is very nice that the Federal Government and the Senate \nand the House and the President have given the school districts a \ndirective that, yes, if you have a kid waving a gun around in Mrs. \nJones' class, let's say in the sixth grade, you can take the kid out of \nschool for 45 days. That is very good of the Federal Government to \nallow that to happen. I applaud them for letting that happen.\n  In addition, to show the kindness of the Federal Government even \nmore, if you provide an IEP, an individual education plan, for that \nstudent who is waving a gun around--you have to do that--you have to \nprovide that help for this student while he or she is out for 45 days \nand then, after the 45 days, you have to bring the student back into \nthe classroom again. Now, that is real nice for the Federal Government \nto get into that kind of micromanaging.\n  As a teacher who has the responsibility for educating the students \nand, in this particular case, the safety of the students, we need a \nbetter way. I do not want the Federal Government to make that decision. \nI want the teacher on the spot, the administrators on the spot to get \nthat student out of the classroom and to find out whatever the problem \nis. If it is a medical problem, fine, then deal with it as a medical \nproblem outside the parameters of the school district. The school \ndistrict is not a hospital, it is not a social service agency, it is an \neducational institution, and we have lost sight of that. Everybody in \nAmerica knows it, the school districts know it, the students know it, \nin some cases.\n  I believe honestly that without this amendment we will eventually be \nforced to revisit this problem. This is not going to resolve the \nproblem despite our best intentions. We are going to be sending the \nmessage that the Federal Government is not a help but an impediment to \nefforts to provide students with a safe learning environment. By \nsending that message, we will give citizens who want safe schools for \ntheir children reason to doubt that the Federal Government considers \ntheir concerns worthy of serious attention.\n  I do not believe we should send that message, Mr. President.\n  Throughout this debate, we have heard that any successful effort to \namend this bill, no matter how worthy, is going to imperil the entire \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues to think about that for a moment. How \ndoes it imperil this legislation to say to a local school district, if \nyou have somebody waving a gun around in a classroom, or doing drugs in \na classroom, or in other ways disrupting the classroom, how does it \nimperil this legislation to say that we want to add an amendment on \nthis bill that says that the school district, the teacher, the \nprincipal, the enforcement official, the police department, whatever it \ntakes in that local community, should be able to address that problem \nas they would if any other student were causing it. Deal with the other \nproblems, the problems behind this incident later, but get the child \nout of the classroom. That is all Senator Gorton and I are asking with \nthis amendment.\n\n  It is not unreasonable, Mr. President. Schools should not be forced \nto adapt their own behavior policies on the basis of IDEA. This is a \nreasonable amendment. I encourage my colleagues to search their \nconscience, in spite of the effort to stop all amendments, in spite of \nthe effort to say this will destroy the bill, I plead with my \ncolleagues to support the Gorton amendment because of the reasons I \nhave given.\n  Bear in mind, we all understand the rules, we understand the \nconstitutional provisions of what we do in the Senate. We all \nunderstand that if a bill is defeated, it can be defeated because the \nPresident vetoes it, it can be defeated because the Senate or the House \ndefeats it, but in this case, if the Senate passes it with this \namendment and the House passes it with this amendment, who knows, the \nPresident may sign it with this amendment. We do not know the answer to \nthat. And if he does not sign it, we can override his veto, and if we \ndo not override his veto, we go right back to where Senator Jeffords is \nnow. So what have we lost? A little time, that is all.\n  But I guarantee you, if you talk to those teachers out there in those \ninner cities and other locations where these kinds of things are \nhappening, it would be very interesting to hear their remarks in terms \nof how they feel about this.\n  Let me close by saying, again, I understand and respect what Senator \nJeffords is trying to do. This is an advancement of current law in the \nright direction. I applaud that and support that, but I resent the fact \nthat we cannot make an attempt, where there are deficiencies \noverlooked, where we are denied the opportunity to make the attempt to \nreform them because we are going to ``undo'' some compromise on the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve any time I have.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. If I may, I would like to comment on the bill in general \nand the Gorton amendment specifically, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I see no people on my side. I yield the \nremainder of my time to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his gracious \nefforts.\n  I rise today to support the reauthorization of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, and also to oppose the proposed Gorton \namendment.\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\n  This legislation represents remarkable progress to date, building on \nprogress in the last 20 years with respect to IDEA. In 1975, when IDEA \nwas first passed, 1 million children were excluded from the public \nschool system and another 4 million children did not receive \nappropriate educational services.\n  Working in a bipartisan manner years ago, Congress passed IDEA, \ncreating a situation in which all children are entitled to a free \nappropriate public education.\n  IDEA has made a real difference in the lives of children throughout \nthis country. Over 5 million children from birth through age 21 are now \nenjoying the benefits of the Individuals With Disabilities Education \nAct, and it has made a real difference. Indeed, the number of children \nwith disabilities entering college more than tripled during the period \nbetween 1978 and 1991. The unemployment rate for those individuals with \ndisabilities in the twenties is half that for the older generation. \nSimply put, IDEA demonstrates the positive and powerful role that \nCongress can play and has played. Today's bipartisan and bicameral \neffort builds on that great success of the last 20 years.\n  I commend particularly Senator Lott, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Frist, and Assistant Secretary for Special \nEducation and Rehabilitative Services, Judith Heumann, for all of their \nefforts in leading this reauthorization process.\n\n  In March, I went up to Rhode Island and met with many of the \nteachers, administrators, parents and families who are deeply involved \nand deeply concerned about special education. We talked to them, we got \ntheir ideas, and I am very pleased to say this legislation incorporates \nso many of the important ideas that they expressed to us.\n  For example, this legislation promotes greater parental participation \nby providing parents with regular reports about the progress of their \nchildren. It also includes parents in group placement decisions which \nis so critical to the success of their child. This legislation \nstrengthens the individual education plan, the IEP, by including \nchildren with disabilities in school reform efforts and also ensuring \nthat performance assessments includes all children, including children \nwith disabilities. All of these efforts will strengthen the education \nthat is provided to these young Americans.\n  In addition, this legislation strengthens and emphasizes early \nintervention services which are absolutely critical. In my home State \nof Rhode Island, we screen every child for disabilities and follow \nthrough with those children. People up in Rhode Island speak with great \nconviction and passion about the success of this aspect of the IDEA \nbill, and we are building on that success today.\n  This legislation also reduces the paperwork and the litigation that \nwe have seen in the past and strengthening and emphasizing mediation \nand reconciliation processes rather than going to immediate litigation. \nIndeed, it also requires that complaints be specified so that we don't \nget into an endless litigation process. All these things together add, \nI think, to the sensibility and the streamlining that this legislation \nrepresents.\n  With respect to the amendment before us at the moment, it would \nundercut, I think, most of the progress we have made to date in this \nreauthorization. It would essentially undercut all of the specific \ngoals and objectives that we have laid out carefully after considering \nthis legislation. It would also, in a sense, undo so much of what has \nbeen done so positively and progressively by all parties coming \ntogether to deal with this legislation.\n  To defer, once again, to local control I think is to invite what took \nplace before IDEA, not because of insensitivity or any maligned intent, \nbut the fact is, quite frankly, that millions of children with \ndisabilities did not receive an appropriate education. It was only with \nthe passage of IDEA in 1975 that we committed ourselves to ensure that \nevery child, including those with disabilities, would have an \nappropriate education.\n  This is the commitment we continue today. This is the work of many \nmonths by my colleagues who worked so diligently. I hope today we not \nonly will reject this amendment but that we will overwhelmingly \nreaffirm the work that has been done, pass this bill, move it forward, \nlet the President sign it and let us build on more than two decades of \nsuccess and, once again, reaffirm our commitment that in this country, \nevery child, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, will have a \nfree appropriate public education.\n  I thank the Senator and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of the \ndiscussion on this amendment. It is my intention to have it set aside. \nI would like to point out that this is not just Jim Jeffords versus the \ncities and towns of America, as Senator Gorton stated. He indicated \nthat the teachers wouldn't like it, but actually, this bill is backed \nby the National Parent Network on Disabilities, the AFT, and the NEA. \nIt also has the support of the American Association of School \nAdministrators, the National Association of Developmental Disabilities, \nthe Council of Great City Schools, the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, and 32 other organizations representing \nmillions of people. I urge everyone to vote against the Gorton \namendment.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Gorton amendment be set aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Is the pending business now the Smith \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has not called up his amendment \nyet.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 245\n\n (Purpose: To require a court in making an award under the Individuals \n with Disabilities Education Act to take into consideration the impact \n the granting of the award would have on the education of all children \n     of State educational agencies and local educational agencies.)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself and \n     Mr. Gorton, proposes an amendment numbered 245.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 156, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       ``(I) Limitation on awards.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act (except as provided in subparagraph \n     (C)), a court in issuing an order in any action filed \n     pursuant to this Act that includes an award shall take into \n     consideration the impact the award would have on the \n     provision of education to all children who are students \n     served by the State educational agency or local educational \n     agency affected by the order.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with \nrespect to the amendment offered by Senator Smith, there be 1 hour for \ndebate, equally divided between Senator Smith and myself. I also ask \nunanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Vermont working with me on this amendment. I do not intend to use \nthe full 30 minutes on my side. If it helps to yield back some time on \nboth sides to expedite things, I am more than pleased to do that.\n  This, again, Mr. President, is another opportunity to strengthen this \nbill. Like the Gorton amendment, it is just a commonsense amendment \nthat simply underlines a commitment to fairness and equity that I \nbelieve every Member in this body shares. My amendment would require a \ncourt making an award under the Individuals\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\nWith Disabilities Education Act to take into consideration the impact \nthe granting of the award would have on the education of all children \nin that State or locality.\n  The problem that the Smith amendment addresses is a very real one. \nAgain, talking with school boards, having served on a school board, I \ncan tell you that litigation costs are consuming a lot of resources \nthat would otherwise be dedicated to education services or \ninfrastructure development.\n  In one instance, a school district was forced to pay $13,000 in \nattorney's fees as a result of a dispute over less than $1,000. I \nsimply ask my colleagues if that is reasonable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gorton be added as a cosponsor \nto my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Senator Gorton, in \ndiscussing his previous amendment, which did not relate directly to \nattorney's fees, has provided me a copy with some of the litigation \ncosts in various school districts in his State of Washington. I will \nnot go through them all, but if you added all of the litigation costs \nup in 1 year, the 1994-95 school year, it would be almost $1 million in \nlitigation costs just on special education, $330,000 in Seattle, alone.\n  Now, if you add up all of those thousands and thousands of dollars \nand you end up with a total in excess of $1 million, if you are a \nteacher or an administrator or a private citizen thinking of your own \nschool district, you might ask ``How many teachers, how many textbooks, \nhow much infrastructure could you provide for $330,000?''\n  We have an adverse reaction around here when we try to get anything \ndone to knock any attorneys out of a dollar or two. There was a \nWashington Post story recently quoting lawyers bragging--and I will not \ncite names here, I do not think that is important--but there was a law \nfirm in the city that got $2.4 million, according to school budget \nrecords, just on special education, just on this law. In fact, one \nperson was quoted as saying, ``Winning those cases is like taking candy \nfrom a baby.''\n  I might just say, why is that? Well, I took the time, Mr. President, \nto talk to my school districts--not all of them, but I wrote to them \nand got a lot of input back and attended some school board meetings. I \nattended school board meetings, about one a week for 6 years, when I \nserved on the school board in another life before I came here to \nCongress. Believe me, I have heard a lot of reasons and a lot of things \nabout what is wrong with this law as well as what is good with it. We \nknow there are good things about it.\n  The Manchester school district, which has 100,000, roughly, \ncitizens--not 100,000 students--a district of a little over 100,000 \npeople, pays litigation costs on this issue alone of between $110,000 \nand $125,000 every year. That is the cost of three teachers. This may \nbe justified, but sometimes it is not, is the point I am making.\n  Using the example I cited in my last speech of the youngster with a \ngun in the classroom, if somebody determines that youngster must have \nan individual education plan, and the school district says, ``Now, wait \na minute. Hold on. This kid has disciplinary problems. He does not have \nmedical problems. He has disciplinary problems. We want to discipline \nhim. We want to get him out of this classroom.'' But somebody \ndisagrees. Maybe the parents, maybe somebody representing the parents, \nmaybe the Civil Liberties Union--whoever--but somebody disagrees. So \nsometimes when the school district looks at the ramifications, they \nthink, ``Well, if we go to court and fight this and lose, it could cost \nus $300,000. If we give in and we cave in and say, `Well, OK, the kid \nis waving a gun around, he must have a medical problem somewhere, \nsomething is wrong, he is waving a gun around a classroom, we need an \nIEP,' we might as well cave in because that will cost $100,000, and it \nis better to pay $100,000 than $300,000.''\n  That is exactly what happens, Mr. President, over and over again, \nyear after year, district after district, all over America. They simply \nthrow up their hands and look at it simply on the basis of a bottom \nline. ``If I go to court and I lose, I will owe $300,000 in legal fees. \nIf I go to court and win, maybe I will not owe them. But if I lose I \nwill have to pay, and for the sake of $100,000 IEP, knowing that the \nlegal fees' estimate may be three times that, why, then, would I take \nthe risk?'' That is exactly what happens, Mr. President. I have sat as \nchairman of the school board and seen it happen and participated in \nthose decisions. They were bottom-line decisions.\n  Now, let me tell you why this hurts children in those schools. Maybe \nI am mistaken, but I think we are trying to reform this law because we \nwant to help students get a better education. Now, the question you \nmust ask the question you might want to ask is: Is it fair to provide \nthis kind of education, this kind of alternative, at the expense of \nother students? If it is going to cost $300,000 to go to court, then I \nhave to think, if I am a school board chairman, well, how about the \nother kids? What happens to them? Let me tell you what happens: Those \ndollars go to the lawyers. That is what happens. And we are letting it \nhappen.\n  I thought the point of a civil rights law was to protect people from \ndiscrimination, especially minorities, not to provide minority group \nmembers with benefits not available to the rest of us. That is what I \nthought. Maybe I am somehow mistaken in that regard.\n  So, all my amendment does, all it does, is it simply requires a \ncourt, in making an award under the IDEA legislation, to take into \nconsideration the impact the granting of that award would have on the \neducation of all the children, all the children, in the school \ndistrict--not just one, all of them.\n  I might say to you, is it fair to take education away from kids who \nwant it, who need it, who deserve it, who ask for it, for the sake of \nsomeone who is a discipline problem? Not someone who has a handicap or \nsomeone who has a need. I want to make that clear, because I will be \naccused otherwise. That is not what we are talking about when we talk \nabout kids who have legitimate needs. We are talking about these \noutrageous individual education plans that are written, and the \noutrageous examples of the kind that I gave you, a kid is selling drugs \non the school ground, you have a kid waving a gun in the classroom, you \nhave a kid shouting obscenities in the classroom, and instead of \nworrying about getting the kid out of there and out of that environment \nwhich is destroying the educational opportunities of other students, we \nare worried about what the background is, what the reason is for it. \nThere is a justification for finding out the reason, but get them out \nof the school classroom where these problems are occurring.\n  We are not talking about a child with Down's syndrome here or a child \nwho is blind or deaf or who needs some special education to help that \nchild learn. We are not talking about that. I voted for hundreds of \nthousands of dollars of taxpayer dollars to help those children as a \nschool board member and as a Senator. I am talking about some type of \nreasonable restriction on outrageous legal fees that come right smack \nout of the pockets of those good kids, good kids who simply want to \nlearn, those good kids and decent parents who say, ``You know, I am \nsending my child into school. I know the teachers are imperfect. We are \nall imperfect. We are human beings. I do not expect them to be perfect. \nI do not expect the school or the administrator to be perfect or the \nclassroom environment to be perfect, but I am asking they be free from \nthe threat of violence, they be free from the threat of drugs, free \nfrom the threat of outrageous outbursts of obscenities and other things \nthat may cause an impact on my child or their child's education.'' That \nis all parents are asking. What is so unreasonable about that?\n\n  Who are we in the Federal Government or the U.S. Senate or the House \nof Representatives or the White House to tell the school district that \nthey can't correct this? Who are we to do that? If you can find that in \nthe Constitution, Mr. President, somewhere, anywhere, even implied, I \nwill withdraw the amendment. It is not there. It is absolutely not \nthere. We need to do something about it.\n  There was a principal from a school in New Hampshire who wrote to me \nsaying that because of litigation costs, ``funding of other regular \neducation programs is being seriously jeopardized.'' He describes \nhimself, this principal, as a member of a generation that\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\nsought to extend equal opportunity to all. He concluded, with regret, \nthat as a result of excessive litigation the IDEA has become ``a law \ngone crazy. The students that are disadvantaged now are the regular \neducation children.''\n  I include in regular education children those who have a disability, \nwho need help. Let me repeat that: I include in regular education, \nchildren in that category, those children who have a special need, who \nneed extra help--not the ones that are causing these problems that are \nso outrageous in these classrooms.\n  I wish I could say this was just one mere anecdotal example out of \nmillions and that it was not a big deal, but it is not. A study that \nwas conducted by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations \nshows that the IDEA is the fourth most litigated law in its study of \nunfunded mandates--unfunded Federal mandates. Is it any wonder that \nsome lawyer from Washington, DC would say ``winning those cases is like \ntaking candy from a baby?'' It is not.\n  I have talked to the school board members. They throw their hands up \nin the air. It is costing them money by the hundreds of thousands and \nmillions of dollars, money that could be spent on educating, yes, the \ntruly needy special needs kids, as well as the people in that \nclassroom.\n  Again, for emphasis, I repeat what I said earlier. Can you imagine \nbeing in a classroom, as a teacher or as a student, with that kind of \noutrageous behavior occurring, and then knowing as a school board \nmember that you have to tolerate it unless you want to break the bank \nwith legal expenses?\n  So, basically, what this amendment does that I am offering, it simply \nallows the court to pull back on these court costs, to have the \nflexibility to say, look, $13,000 for a $1,000 IEP or $350,000 for a \n$10,000 IEP, those kind of fees are outrageous. They are not going to \nbe tolerated because we are not going to let some lawyer who wants to \nfatten his wallet do so at the expense of decent children in some \nschool district in Anywhere, USA, from having the opportunities of \ngetting what he or she deserves in that classroom.\n  That is wrong, Mr. President. That is absolutely wrong to let that \nhappen. Yet, it is happening and we are encouraging it to happen. We \nare encouraging it to happen because we have some deal struck that no \none wants to break and, therefore, we can't offer an amendment. ``Yes, \nyou can offer an amendment, Senator Smith, but everybody is going to \noppose it. If you get five votes, good luck.'' Well, I just ask the \nAmerican people to look very carefully at the votes, frankly. Those of \nyou out there in the school districts around America, look at who votes \non the Gorton amendment and Smith amendment and see whether they are \nthere for you or not, because that is what it amounts to.\n  I don't care what anybody tells you on the floor of this Senate, it \nis absolutely not true to say that this bill will be defeated if this \namendment passes or the Gorton amendment passes. That is not true, \nbecause it can be defeated here and the President could veto it, but we \ncan override the veto. That is the constitutional process.\n  The need to address the problem of litigation costs seems all the \nmore pressing at a time when some of my colleagues have begun calling \nfor the Federal Government to take over the job of building and \nmaintaining the schools from State and local governments. They want to \ntake it over. Can you imagine that? The U.S. Senate, in this vote, is \ngoing to use the power of the Federal Government to prevent you from \ngetting that child waving the gun or using the drugs out of the \nclassroom but that same Federal Government is going to take over the \njob of maintaining school buildings. Can you imagine that?\n  Do we really want to do for public schools what we have done for \npublic housing? I think some do. I don't. Perhaps we in Congress would \ndo better to ease the burdens of excessive regulation and litigation so \nthat States and localities can devote more of their resources to \nrepairing or replacing crumbling school buildings.\n  You know, it might be a good idea--I hadn't thought of it; it just \ncame to mind--when the lawyers get the big fat settlements or legal \nfees by winning these cases, which they take with great glee--``like \ntaking candy from a baby''--maybe we ought to have an amendment that \nsays they ought to give 90 percent of it back to the school district. \nMaybe they get an IEP or two for some of these kids that really need \nit. But that would be wrong. That is in violation of capitalism, I \nguess, isn't it?\n  Well, all you have to do, Mr. President, is look and see where all \nthe money goes from the legal community and who they are giving it to. \nThere are a lot of lawyers in here and they do pretty well. So it is \ntough to beat the lawyers in this body.\n  I ask my colleagues simply to search your consciences, read the two \namendments, the Smith and Gorton amendments, read what they do and ask \nyourself, is it the end of the world if this passes and this bill takes \na few more weeks running through the process of getting changed? That \nis all we are asking. If the process around here is to strike a deal \nbefore we get stuff to the floor, I am going to be the first Senator \nout on the floor the next time that somebody who votes for this bill \nsays, ``I would like to offer an amendment.'' I am going to say, \n``Excuse me, why are you offering an amendment? I thought we had a deal \nhere. Isn't that the way you want to govern--strike the deal before you \nbring the bill to the floor so nobody can make any amendments?''\n  This amendment would make this legislation a responsible piece of \nlegislation if we were to pass it. That is all I ask. I am not asking \nfor anything else. I am asking for the Senate to adopt this amendment \nto strengthen this bill, to take money out of the pockets of lawyers \nand put it into the educational opportunities of young girls and boys \nthroughout this country. That is all my amendment does. If you want it \nin the pockets of lawyers, vote against me. If you want it to be spent \nfor the schoolchildren, then vote for me. That is it, pure and simple.\n  Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Smith \namendment. I will not go into all I have said before about why that is \nnecessary. But the House today has completed debate of a version which \nis identical to the bill before us, and any amendment to it would \nrequire us to go to conference. The delay would give time for those who \nare opposed to the bill to try to scuttle it, as they did last year \nsuccessfully.\n  I want to point out several things with respect to the Senator's \namendment. First, it is not necessary. Under the bill as written, there \nis no award for legal fees without the courts saying there should be; \nit's purely discretionary. The courts, with their discretion, can take \ninto account the effect of the award on the school districts, or \nwhomever else. So there is that ability to try to reduce the awards. It \nis in there now. The amendment is also not necessary, because mediation \nis working. Due to changes in the approaches that have been taken, the \ncost of litigation and the number of court suits that have been brought \nas a result of appeals has gone way, way, way down. So we are talking \nabout something that used to be a problem but is not a problem anymore.\n  As I pointed out before in addressing Senator Gorton's amendment, I \nthink he is talking about the State of Washington of old, not the State \nof Washington of the present. In fact, given the dramatic success with \nvoluntary mediation in Washington State and given the success and cost-\nbenefit advantage associated with voluntary mediation of 38 other \nStates, the bill requires all States to offer voluntary mediation.\n  So the bill is going to try to help replicate what happened in \nWashington, which has decreased the number of appeals so \nsubstantially--a 96-percent decline in due process hearings held \nbetween 1993 and 1996. It is a problem of old. We can forget about it.\n  As far as the comments about waving the gun and there being no \nremedy, that is not accurate. If a child's behavior is not connected to \na disability, then he or she is treated like any other child except \nthat there can be no cessation of services. So that certainly takes \ncare of that. If the behavior is related to the disability, the child \ncan usually be removed for not more than the amount of time that the \nschool system would remove a child without disabilities but for not \nmore than 45 days. If at the end of 45 days the school\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\npersonnel propose to change the child's placement and the parents \ndisagree with the proposal, the child must return to the placement \nprior to the interim placement except if the school personnel maintain \nthat it is dangerous to do so and make a demonstration to the hearing \nofficer that this is so. And that could go on until there is no risk.\n  The best way to help the communities is to vote for this bill. It is \nimportant to understand that, if we increase IDEA funding--and that is \nthe effort this body and its Republican Members are putting their full \nweight behind--all that increased funding will not go to States. \nRather, it will flow to the local governments. So, if you want to help \nlocal governments take care of problems--and sometimes there are \nproblems--this money going directly to them will assist them more than \nanything else. The States can't pick any of it off. It goes right to \nthe local government. So I just emphasize that, in my mind, we have \ntaken care of the problems. We are, again, in the position of \nconsidering an amendment which could be seriously disruptive. If \nadopted, it will have no impact on solving real problems, but it would \nraise the possibility of killing the bill.\n  Let me give you an idea about the lawyer's fees and the history of \nthat and let you know exactly what has to occur before you can get an \naward. There was a case called Smith versus Robinson in 1984. This was \na case that came to the U.S. Supreme Court. They went through it and \nfound out that, actually, there was no ability to award attorney's \nfees. So we went into the 1986 session and said there ought to be an \naward for some under certain circumstances, but we should make sure \nthat it is not in any way automatic and is purely at the discretion of \nthe court. Let me read some of the phrases:\n\n       In any action or proceeding brought by IDEA, or the parent \n     or child with disability against the school, the court may \n     award reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n  ``May.'' That is discretionary. They could take into consideration \neverything Senator Smith wants them to. There is no limit on the \ndiscretion. Also:\n\n       Attorney's fees may not be awarded and related costs may \n     not be reimbursed in any action or proceeding for services \n     performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of \n     settlement to a parent, and if they had a good deal and \n     didn't accept it, they don't get attorney's fees.\n       Attorney's fees may not be awarded related to any meeting \n     of the IEP team unless such meeting is convened as a result \n     of administrative proceeding or judicial action or at the \n     discretion of the State or a mediation is conducted prior to \n     the filing of the complaint.\n\n  I can go through more. I think you get the drift. It is very hard to \nget attorney's fees. Therefore, that is really not the problem. Plus \nthe mediation process has reduced almost to zero the number of court \nappeals--only a hundred all last year. I think we are talking about \nsolving a nonproblem and creating a huge problem with respect to the \npossibility that this bill might be, as happened last year, scuttled at \nthe last minute.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes. The other side has \n22\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator from \nIowa desires.\n  Mr. SMITH. Then I will yield the remainder of my time to the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I don't intend to take a long \nperiod of time. I wanted to respond to my friend from New Hampshire. \nLet me, first of all, recap a little history on the provisions in the \nbill which provide for reasonable attorney's fees--again, keeping in \nmind you have to prevail in this case.\n  The provision here, what is in the bill, is nothing new. This has \nbeen in the bill for a long time. In fact, I did a little bit of \nresearch and found out that this first came under S. 415, the \nHandicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986. And the person who was \nin charge of this provision was none other than our own Senator Orrin \nHatch of Utah. I just thought I would read into the Record, again, what \nhe said at that time on July 17, 1986.\n  He says that the agreement we are now considering is a compromise \nwhich I feel accomplishes two major objectives.\n  First, it provides the reward of reasonable attorneys' fees to \nprevailing parents in Education of Handicapped Act proceedings.\n  Second, it includes the application provisions from some court cases, \nwhich he mentioned, which I don't have to go through.\n  In order to protect against excessive reimbursements. Senator Hatch \ngoes on to say, ``Let me again emphasis that the conference agreement \ndeveloped was a compromise. Without the passage of this carefully \ncrafted document, handicapped children and their parents cannot be \nfully protected since they have no recourse under current law, if their \nrights are violated.''\n  Again, that law now provides that a court may award reasonable \nattorneys' fees as part of the cost of the parents of a child with a \ndisability who is the prevailing party in a due process proceeding, or \ncourt action.\n  In other words, if a parent prevails at an administrative hearing, \nthey are entitled to fees. What fees? Reasonable? They must be based on \nrates prevailing in the community for that time, and quality of \nservices performed. Unlike other civil rights statutes, no bonus or \nmultiplier may be used to increase the amount of fee awards. No award \nof fees may be made for services performed subsequent to the time a \nwritten statement offer is made to the parents, if, among other things, \nthe relief finally obtained by the parent is not more favorable to the \nparents than the offer of settlement.\n  I think this is really a critical point. Again, I apologize to the \nSenator from New Hampshire. I do not know if he covered this or not.\n  Let's say they have a written statement of offer to settle. The \nparents decide not to do that, and they go on. From that point on, if \nthe final judgment is not more favorable than the written statement \noffer, they get nothing beyond that point. They go at their own peril.\n  So, again, how can that be unreasonable attorneys' fees?\n  And the court must reduce the amount of the fee award whenever the \ncourt finds the following:\n  First, the parent unreasonably protracted the final resolution;\n  Second, the amount of fees unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate \nprevailing in the community;\n  Third, the time spent on the legal services furnished were excessive \nconsidering the failure of the action or proceeding.\n  So this is all in current law--adequate protections to make sure that \nthere are not unreasonable attorney fees in these cases.\n  So really this amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire \nreally undermines the rationale for having attorney's fees.\n  Again, let's keep in mind one other very important fact that I think \nkeeps being ignored here when we are talking about IDEA. The \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act is a civil rights statute. \nIt talks about civil rights for kids with disabilities. I already went \nthrough that earlier today talking about not discriminating on the \nbasis of race, sex, creed, or national origin. Well, the courts have \nnow said disability too. You can't discriminate on that basis.\n  I have here a copy of all of the statutes under which attorneys' fees \nmay be awarded by Federal courts and agencies in other civil rights \ncases. The Civil Rights Act of 1964; Public Facilities; Equal \nOpportunities; Fair Housing Act; title 8; Employment Act of 1967; Fair \nLabor Standards; Voting Rights Act of 1965; the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act; the Age Discrimination Act; the Rehab Act of 1973. And \nall of\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\nthose we get reasonable attorneys' fees.\n  So now are we going to say, ``But, for the civil rights of kids with \ndisabilities and their parents, no, that is different''? Why don't we \ncarve out the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or public accommodations on the \nbasis of race or color? Why don't we say, ``Well, if you have a civil \nrights case and it is based on race, you don't get attorneys' fees, if \nyou prevail?'' Why not? The Senator from New Hampshire says we will \ncarve it out for kids with disabilities. Why don't we carve it out on \nthe basis of race?\n\n  How about religion? What if you got a complaint based upon violations \nof civil rights based on religion, and you prevail? You say you don't \nget attorneys' fees? No. We say in the law you get attorneys' fees, if \nyou prevail.\n  Equal employment I mentioned.\n  Title IX dealing with discrimination based upon sex, we say, ``Oh. \nWell, in this case, however, if you are female, your civil rights have \nbeen violated under title IX, and you bring action. No. We are not \ngoing to give you attorney's fees.''\n  Why don't we have those amendments offered around here? It is only \nthe kid with disabilities. It doesn't make any sense at all.\n  So let's keep all of our civil rights laws the same. If your civil \nright is violated on the basis of race, I submit to you it is no more \nonerous than if your civil rights is violated based upon disabilities. \nAnd we shouldn't discriminate under the Civil Rights Act, and we \nshouldn't here either.\n  So I oppose the amendment because it undermines the rationale. It \nsubjects the parents of children to a double standard compared to other \ncivil rights bills. We have to keep these things the same.\n  Last, the data doesn't support the assertions that the fee is a \nresult of proliferation of litigation. I looked up New Hampshire. For 1 \nyear--1995-1996--New Hampshire had 10 complaints that went through due \nprocess. Do you know how many become court cases? Zero. This is an \namendment looking for a problem.\n  There is no problem out there. Vermont has zero. Arkansas has zero.\n  Again, it is just not a big problem out there at all.\n  In my State--I might as well talk about Iowa--we had four due process \nhearings, and we had three cases go to court.\n  Out of the thousands--this is what is interesting. In California, one \nof the largest States, we had 1,289 requests for due process hearings. \nOut of that, 1,114 were disposed in mediation. We had 57 hearing \ndecisions rendered out of 1,289 requests. That is just not much of a \nproblem. That is out of 550,000 students in California receiving \nspecial education. Out of 550,000 students, only 57 had a hearing \ndecision rendered.\n  So, again, the number of due process hearings per year averages about \none-hundredth of 1 percent of the number of children served. The law \nspecifically provides for reasonable attorney's fees, and I just \noutlined what that means when Senator Hatch put this in the bill 11 \nyears ago.\n  And, third, we would not--no one here, I would think--would want to \ndiscriminate on the basis of civil rights that in one civil rights case \nyou get attorneys' fees but in another civil rights case you don't. No. \nWe don't want any of that around here. For those reasons, while I have \nevery respect for the Senator from New Hampshire--and he is a good \nfriend of mine--this is just a bad idea, quite frankly. And I hope \nSenators will reject this approach of trying to divide out kids with \ndisabilities and their families away from everybody else under the \npurview of civil rights laws.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Right now I would just like to say a couple of things. \nI think it is very clear that both of these amendments are not \nnecessary--in fact, would create problems rather than solve them, and \nthat what we have is a bill which, if we are able to pass, will save \nmoney. That has not been mentioned, but the estimates are it will save \nup to $4 billion a year in reduced litigation and all of the other \nproblems that are inherent in the process as well as the fact that both \namendments are trying to solve problems that are no longer there. In \nfact, the Gorton amendment will create a monstrous problem and solve \nnone.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to send a message to parents \nand educators across this nation. No matter if they are the parents of \na disabled child, or the superintendent of a rural or urban school \nsystem, each one of them will have something to be pleased about in the \n1997 reauthorization of IDEA. As with most legislation, no one is \ncompletely happy with every paragraph and clause. And yet, with issues \nso complex and needs so great, I find it remarkable that we have before \nus such a potentially successful bill.\n  It is testament to the work we have done over the past 2 months that \nwe have brought the discussions over the past 20 years of IDEA to a \nproductive next step. I have always believed that we do our best work \nwhen we agree to sit down, put differences aside, and work toward the \ncommon good, using common sense. This is exactly what the American \npublic expects us to do. The negotiations over the IDEA bill represent \nthis philosophy and put it into action.\n  I want to congratulate Senators Harkin, Kennedy, Lott, Jeffords, and \nFrist for all the great work they and others have done. I also want to \nthank the education community for working together through differences, \nto get to a bill that can pass and will work for students in regular \neducation and special education in schools and communities across the \nland.\n  The Individuals With Disabilities in Education Act is 20 years old \nthis year. It has represented a major change in the way our society \nviews students with disabilities--and has helped us take concrete, \nmeasurable steps toward improving the lives and education of all \nAmerican students.\n  In this process this year, it is my view that we have preserved the \nbasic civil rights protections that were part of IDEA when it was \npassed, and that we have granted important flexibility to local schools \nand parents to work together in the best interest of children.\n  One thing evident from the process of writing this bill--we do a \ngreat job here in the Senate in cranking out pieces of legislation, but \nwe must do more to monitor implementation of these laws. Practices in \nthe field of special education have improved dramatically over 20 \nyears; yet our methods of disseminating information--even in the \ninformation age--have not kept pace. Much of the disagreement in the \nclassrooms and communities of America between special education folks \nand regular education folks is because we have let the ball drop on \nimplementation of IDEA. The sad part is that it didn't have to happen--\nthe information was there.\n  Information about how much more effective it is to use mediation as \nan option to legal action. Information about what strategies of \ncommunication, teaching, and problem-solving can be used to prevent \nsituations from escalating to the point where they need mediation. In \nplaces where people have good information, and exercise leadership, you \njust see fewer problems.\n\n  It has been obvious for some time to educators and parents alike \nthat--as with other Federal laws--there is a wide variety in what \nspecial education means from community to community. Some of this \nvariety is as it should be. Decisions about how educational services \nare delivered are best made with local flexibility. But basic \nprotections afforded by civil rights law, and effective techniques that \nimprove student learning, should not be subject to the whims of \ngeography.\n  The IDEA reauthorization legislation recognizes this, and makes \nseveral changes that will benefit all students and members of their \ncommunity.\n  First, the new law codifies court decisions, regulations, and other \ninterpretive documents so that the law itself better reflects its \ncurrent uses.\n  Second, the law improves educator training, methods for sharing \ninformation, and improves the process for developing and using the \nindividualized education plan--the key to disabled students getting the \nservices and challenges they need.\n  Third, practices to achieve safe and well-disciplined schools have \nbeen improved or more clearly articulated in the bill--so it will be \nclear that students whose behavior causes disturbance in the classroom \nwill get help if that behavior is part of their disability, and if the \nbehavior is determined\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\nnot to be part of their disability, they are subject to appropriate \ndisciplinary action.\n  This bill represents improved results for all students in our \nschools. It ties a student's individualized education plan to the \neducational goals and assessments for nondisabled students--so we set \nhigh expectations and provide clear opportunities for achievement. The \nbill includes parents in decisions regarding placement, because we \nrecognize that a child's needs are uniquely the concern of her or his \nparents.\n  This bill will serve as a vehicle to increase funding for IDEA, so \nthe Federal Government can meet its obligations to disabled students. \nThe bill holds outside agencies responsible for their share of the \nhealth or other costs of serving disabled students, so we can clarify \nthat local schools do not bear all responsibility for these costs.\n  People from different perspectives will find things to praise in this \nbill. Perhaps the best thing is that we will reauthorize IDEA this \nyear, so people can predict what the future will hold, and have access \nto more and better information. The tension in this country between \nregular education and special education has boiled for too long. This \nIDEA reauthorization bill will not pit people against one another; it \nwill bring us together in service to all students.\n\n\n                                  IDEA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, at a time when communities are \ndemanding that schools provide quality education; at a time when many \nschools talk of scarce resources; at a time when parents ask that their \nchildren's schools be safe and orderly places to learn--it is easier \nsometimes to find a scapegoat than to address the real problems. I am \ngreatly concerned that the scapegoat has become children with \ndisabilities. Even though they have only had the right to an education \nfor 22 years--I have heard over and over again that it is those \nchildren who gobble up scarce resources and who prevent other children \nfrom receiving a decent education.\n  But I have heard from parents whose children have disabilities, I \nhave met these children. They just want to learn. And the civil rights \nstatute that we passed 22 years ago says that to not educate them is to \nillegally discriminate against them. But still, these students and \nparents are afraid that schools will retreat to segregation and \nseparate schooling. We must listen to these voices of pleading and \nconcern.\n  There are 100,000 children in Minnesota that are protected by this \nstatute, and up to 200,000 parents. IDEA strives to keep these students \nin school in as normal an environment as possible because integration \ngives them the chance they deserve. What a noble goal. What \nachievements we have seen over the years since the law was written. The \nfirst generation of IDEA educated children are just now coming into \ntheir own in this country and I believe that we all benefit \nimmeasurably from their developed talents and abilities. While there \nhave been problems with IDEA, it is my belief that the problems stem \nnot from the law itself, but from the enforcement and implementation of \nthis law.\n  I know the bill we have before us represents a delicate compromise--\nand that any successful amendment has the potential to make the deal \ncrumble. I have not come to the floor this morning seeking to change \nthis bill. But I cannot vote for this bill without pointing out the \ntrouble spots I see. The disability community has not had much time to \nfully analyze this bill. This is a fact that I mentioned in my letter \nlast Monday to Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, while asking them \nto postpone this markup.\n  A quick review of this bill shows that, at least among parents and \nstudents, the discipline section has raised the most red flags. There \nis a concern that a manifestation determination review will be a very \ndifficult process for parents, particularly low-income parents who may \nnot have access to psychologists and other professionals. Advocates are \nparticularly worried about the courts being replaced by an \nadministrative hearing officer because they may be appointed by an LEA, \nthere are different rules of evidence and there is no assurance that \nthey will be attorneys or appropriately qualified. Another concern \nraised by parents is how substantially likely to result in injury to \nself or others will be interpreted. Children with autism, Tourette's \nsyndrome, ADHD or ADD and severe emotional disturbances are especially \nat risk.\n\n  And last we need to ask where children will be placed--what \nalternative placements are available? If the primary alternative is \nhome-bound placement we will see families facing incredible stress and \nfinancial hardships. If the primary alternative is a segregated setting \nwe run the risk of returning to a system that offered minimal education \nto children in isolated, warehouse-like settings.\n  That said, I would like to congratulate the leadership team that \nassembled this bill in marathon sessions for the last 8 weeks. On \nFebruary 20, 1997 a bipartisan, bicameral working group was established \nto develop a compromise bill. This working group included a \nrepresentative from the Department of Education--Judy Heumann, \nAssistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services--\nand the following offices: Harkin, Kennedy, Dodd, Jeffords, Coats, \nFrist, Martinez, Scott, Miller, Goodling, Riggs, and Castle. The \nfacilitator of the group was David Hoppe, the majority leader's chief \nof staff. A member of my staff was intimately involved in this process, \nand by his and all accounts this was an impressive display of \nbipartisan negotiation.\n  The first work product of the group was a statement of principles. \nThe major goal of the working group was to review, strengthen, and \nimprove IDEA to better educate children with disabilities, and enable \nthem to receive a quality education. With this goal in mind, the \nworking group agreed to start with current law and build on the \nactions, experiences, information, and research gathered over the life \nof the law, particularly over the past 3 years. The group met for 7 \nweeks, often for 12 hours a day, to reach an agreement that all could \nsupport.\n  I believe that the bill improves current law in several ways. The \nbill includes significant increases for the IDEA preschool program and \nsignificant increases for the early intervention program under part H.\n  The final agreement significantly improves and strengthens the \nIndividualized Education Plan [IEP] by, among other things, relating a \nchild's education to what children without disabilities are receiving \nand providing report cards just like nondisabled students receive. \nOf great concern to my home State of Minnesota, the bill retains short-\nterm objectives which are planned goals in the education of children \nwith disabilities that parents consider a crucial device for ensuring \nsuccess and accountability. The bill also specifies that regular \nteachers will be part of the IEP team, where appropriate, and the \nreport language encourages the participation of school health \nprofessionals where appropriate.\n\n  The new bill requires parents to be included in the group making \nplacement decisions about their child, as opposed to current law, which \nin some States allows another group other than the IEP team to make \nplacement decisions.\n  The new bill ensures that States and local school districts include \nchildren with disabilities in their performance goals, indicators, and \ngeneral assessments. The bill ensures parental consent for triennial \nreevaluations--not just initial evaluations as under current law--and \nensures that evaluations are relevant to the child's instructional \nneeds.\n  The bill includes improvements in the early intervention program, \nincluding clarification that infants and toddlers should receive \nservices in natural environments, such as their homes, where \nappropriate.\n  IDEA funding will now cover support services related to a student's \ndisability. For example, the final agreement now lists orientation and \nmobility services for vision-impaired children as a related service--\ncurrently required by interpretation--and includes report language \nclarifying that children with disabilities should receive travel \ntraining--including how to use public transportation where it is deemed \nappropriate as part of their IEP.\n  The bill requires States to monitor school districts to determine \nwhether they are disproportionately segregating minority children in \ncertain placements and to determine whether there\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\nis a disproportionate number of long-term suspensions and expulsions of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  The bill gives the Secretary and State educational agencies [SEA's] \ngreater power to implement the law by providing authority to withhold \nall or some funds when schools violate IDEA. Currently, the Secretary \nis required to withhold all funds if there is a violation; this \npunishment was viewed as too strict and never applied.\n  The bill contains provisions to ensure that increases in Federal \nappropriations are not offset by State decreases in spending. The State \nmaintenance of effort provisions give reasonable authority to the \nSecretary of Education to establish criteria for exceptions if \nnecessary.\n\n  The bill codifies local maintenance of effort provisions from \nregulations and includes reasonable additional exemptions for when a \nlocality need not maintain financial efforts for special education--for \nexample when a teacher at the high end of the pay scale retires and is \nreplaced by a recent graduate.\n  The bill reduces paperwork. State and local applications need be \nsubmitted only once and thereafter they need to submit only amendments \nnecessitated by compliance problems or changes in the law.\n  Importantly, when it comes to discipline, the bill provides for no \ncessation of services for IDEA students, no separate IDEA provision on \nthe treatment of disruptive children, and no unilateral authority to \ndetermine who is dangerous and remove them.\n  These improvements in the IDEA law do make a difference and I'm \npleased that they were adopted. But the drawbacks I mentioned earlier \nhamper my enthusiasm for the bill. While I will vote for the bill \ntoday, I have chosen not to cosponsor this bill. I hope that Members \nwill continue to listen to the voices of parents, who are faced with \nthe daily task of raising and educating their children. They know \nfirsthand how IDEA is implemented at the local level and thus we must \nlisten to--and address--the concerns that they raise. Let us all \nremember who this bill is for, and strive to make it work for them.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nin cosponsoring this important legislation, S. 717, to reauthorize the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA].\n  S. 717 is the result of a bipartisan effort, which included parents, \nspecial interest groups, and educators. My colleagues in both the House \nand Senate worked hard in crafting this legislation.\n  I believe that this bill will strengthen the current law. IDEA is a \ncivil rights statute. It guarantees that every child with a disability \nhas the right to a free appropriate public education. Public education \nis one of the core values of our country.\n  Before the enactment of IDEA in 1975, children with disabilities had \nlittle opportunity to receive a public education. Over 20 years later, \nIDEA has been successful in providing opportunity to children with \ndisabilities.\n  S. 717 retains the principles outlined in the current law. There are \nfive principles that IDEA encompasses: First, educational planning for \na child with a disability should be done on an individual basis; \nsecond, parents of a child with a disability should participate in \neducational planning for their child; third, decisions about a child's \neligibility and education should be based on objective and accurate \ninformation; fourth, if appropriate for a child with a disability, he \nor she should be educated in general education with necessary services \nand supports; and fifth, parents and educators should have means of \nresolving differences about a child's eligibility, IEP, educational \nplacement, or other aspects of the provision of a free appropriate \npublic education to the child.\n  Under current law infants and toddlers have the right to receive \nearly intervention services and children with disabilities are placed \nalongside children without disabilities. Children with disabilities \ndeserve no less than fair treatment.\n  Over 5 million special education students are served under IDEA. \nDecades of research have shown that educating children with \ndisabilities is successful by having high expectations of special \neducation students; strengthening the role of parents in the education \nof their child; coordinating State- and district-wide assessments; \nproviding an education in the least restrictive environment; and \nsupporting professional development for teachers who work with special \neducation students.\n\n  I am concerned, however, about the disproportionate number of \nminority students who are identified as special education students. I \nsupport the goal of this legislation to provide greater efforts to \nprevent the problems associated with mislabeling and the high dropout \nrates among minority children with disabilities.\n  My State of Maryland will receive approximately $61 million this year \nto provide support services to over 100,000 students with disabilities \nin local school systems. I believe this legislation will help support \nmy State's efforts to educate disabled children.\n  I support Federal funding for implementation of IDEA. I believe that \nfunds should keep pace with student enrollment. This legislation \nmaintains part of the formula in current law, which provides part B \nfunds based on the number of children with disabilities served. Once a \ntrigger of $4.9 billion is reached, which amounts to approximately $850 \nper child, a new formula based on census, 85 percent, and poverty, 15 \npercent, will apply to any new funds in excess of the appropriation for \nthe previous year.\n  Although I have some concerns about how States will be able to \nimplement and handle the additional administrative burdens under the \nnew formula, I believe that this approach goes in the right direction.\n  S. 717 focuses on the crucial areas of increasing funding for special \neducation, teacher training, and early intervention for children with \ndisabilities.\n  This legislation reaffirms our country's commitment to educating \ndisabled children. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nlegislation before us today to reauthorize the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act. It is a strong, balanced bill. One that I \nam a proud cosponsor of and one that I believe we should all be proud \nto support.\n  Getting to this point has not been easy and I would like to thank our \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Harkin, and others for all of the time they have invested in \nputting together this strong and balanced bill and for assigning it \nsuch a high priority for consideration by the full Senate.\n  There has been a great deal of debate about this bill in the last \nseveral years. But one thing is very clear. In its over 20 years, IDEA \nhas made an incredible difference to millions of American children, \ntheir families, and society as a whole.\n  Before the passage of this landmark legislation, children with \ndisabilities were frequently excluded from schools, and some had \nabsolutely no opportunity for education at all. Expectations for these \nchildren were low. Not only was great potential undervalued and lost, \nbut also we lost as taxpayers who often picked up the tab for a \nlifetime of support. State and communities were struggling with \nincreasing litigation and state court rulings requiring them to serve \nall children in the schools.\n  IDEA brought us all together--the Federal Government, States, local \ncommunities, schools, parents and students--behind a firm commitment, a \npromise to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities.\n  Since that time, we have made huge improvements in affording children \nwith disabilities the same opportunities open to other students. Today, \nmore than half of all students with disabilities go onto college and 57 \npercent of youth with disabilities are competitively employed within 5 \nyears of leaving school.\n  These students go on to good jobs in every sector of our economy. Not \nonly are they workers, they are taxpayers.\n  But the impact of IDEA is broader; it works for all students. \nNondisabled students live, work, and learn alongside all the members of \ntheir community. Those are skills that over the long run make our whole \nsociety stronger.\n  Unfortunately, over the last several years, concerns have been raised \nabout IDEA--concerns about cost of services,\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\ndiscipline, the low Federal contribution, litigation and inclusion. \nThere is no question, it has been a difficult few years. But we have \nsomething to show for all the debates and questions: this bill.\n  One thing has not changed in this bill--children with disabilities \nremain at its core. But in this reauthorization, we have improved IDEA \nto ensure that the law does not stand in the way of meeting children's \nneeds.\n\n  Administrative requirements are clarified and streamlined. Discipline \nprocedures, which have been the focus of so much attention, are \nmodified to provided school officials with additional tools to ensure \nthe safety of all children. Mediation systems to resolve disputes about \nthe placements of children are required in each State. We also \nclarified that attorney's fees are not allowed during the development \nof the Individual Education Plan or in pre-complaint mediation. In \naddition, parents must provide school districts with more detailed \ninformation on their concerns to avoid protracted legal battles.\n  This bill also better defines the role of other partners in the \neffort to meet these special needs. Regular classroom teachers are \nclearly defined as part of the students' IEP team. The parents' role is \nstrengthened or clarified. In addition, states have new authority to \ncollect from noneducational agencies for noneducational services, such \nas speech therapy. The IDEA bill before us also provides new \nenforcement tools for the Department of Education to ensure that this \nlaw is properly implemented and enforced.\n  Beyond the larger issues, there were several issues of deep \nimportance to me that I am pleased to see in this final bill. Language \nis included reaffirming the importance of braille instruction to \nstudents with visual impairments. The bill also reauthorizes a program \nproviding support for an unique and wonderful effort, the National \nTheater of the Deaf. The Theater, which is based in Chester, CT, has \ntraveled across the country and world inspiring and entertaining \nhearing and nonhearing audiences.\n  Mr. President, fundamentally, this is a good bill--a strong bill that \nwill guarantee us the full potential of all of our children. I am \nhopeful that my colleagues will join me in strong support of this \neffort.\n\n\n Section 685 Coordinated Technical Assistance Dissemination--National \n                             Clearinghouses\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Under section 685(d) National Information Dissemination the \nfirst five authorized activities listed have traditionally been \nperformed utilizing the services of the national clearinghouses.\n  The national clearinghouses, which have been in existence for over 25 \nyears, have developed very effective, specialized and targeted lines of \ncommunications to State and local entities serving this population of \nspecial needs as well as to individual families. Representatives in my \nown State of West Virginia have communicated to me that they want to \ncontinue to be able to be serviced by these clearinghouses with whom \nthey have developed longstanding and trusting relationships.\n  Does the bill continue to authorize all the activities currently \ncarried out by the national clearinghouses?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. The bill authorizes all the current activities and \nallows the Secretary to support national clearinghouses.\n  Mr. BYRD. I note in section 685 that the statutory language states--\nand I will paraphrase--that the Secretary should provide these \nauthorized services utilizing ``mechanisms as institutes which include \nregional resource centers, clearinghouses, and programs that support \nState and local entities.''\n  I want to make sure that this language, even though somewhat general \nwould allow the Secretary to utilize a Federal resource center, as well \nas regional centers. The Federal center provides a longstanding, vital, \nand supporting role in keeping regional centers supplied with and \nconnected to the latest technical information and research development \nwithin this specialized field, in addition, the Federal resource center \nhas traditionally coordinated some of the activities of the regional \ncenters.\n  Does S. 717 allow the Secretary to utilize a Federal resource center \nin this role?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The bill allows the Secretary flexibility in the \nmechanisms used to provide State and local entities the technical \nassistance they need to improve results for children, youth, infants, \nand toddlers with disabilities. A Federal resource center is one \nmechanism the Secretary could use to carry out his responsibilities \nunder this section.\n\n\n        treatment of persons with disabilities in adult prisons\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nSenators Harkin and Jeffords regarding the treatment of those with \ndisabilities who are convicted as adults and incarcerated in adult \nprisons.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be pleased to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleague, Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As my colleagues are aware, the Department of Education \nhas determined that the requirement that States provide eligible \nstudents with a free, appropriate public education extends to people \nunder age 21 convicted of felonies as adults and incarcerated in adult \nprisons. Under current law, if a State fails to provide special \neducation services to eligible prisoners, that State faces the loss of \nall Federal special education funding. I believe strongly that this \nmandate is wrong. I introduced legislation last week, S. 702, which \nwould amend IDEA to exempt people convicted as adults and incarcerated \nin adult prisons.\n  This issue is particularly important to the State of California. My \nState does not provide special education services in adult prisons, and \nas a result, faces the loss of over $300 million in Federal special \neducation assistance. It seems unconscionable to me that the needs of \napproximately 600,000 California special needs children could be \njeopardized because my State does not provide special education \nservices to an estimated 1,500 prisoners.\n  It is my understanding that this bill makes several significant \namendments to these provisions and dramatically changes the scope of \nsanctions that can be imposed on States for failing to provide special \neducation services to those incarcerated in adult prisons. Would the \nSenator elaborate on these changes?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under the legislation, States are authorized to transfer \nthe responsibility for educating juveniles with disabilities convicted \nas adults and incarcerated in adult prisons from State and local \neducation agencies to other agencies deemed appropriate by the \nGovernor, such as the State Department of Corrections.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What are the consequences of the transfer of authority in \nterms of the ability of the Secretary to withhold IDEA funds allotted \nto the State?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If a State makes such a transfer and if the Secretary \nfinds that the public agency is in noncompliance, the Secretary must \nlimit any withholding action to that agency. Furthermore, any reduction \nor withholding of payments must be proportionate to the number of \ndisabled children in adult prisons under the supervision of that agency \ncompared to the number served by local school districts. For example, \nif 1 percent of the disabled students were in adult prisons, the \nSecretary could only withhold 1 percent of the funds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In the State of California, approximately one-fourth of 1 \npercent of all people eligible for special education are convicted of \nfelonies as adults and incarcerated in adult prisons.\n  It is my understanding that under this bill, if California does not \nprovide special education services in prisons it stands to lose only \none-fourth of 1 percent of its allotted share. California would no \nlonger face the possible loss of 100 percent of its allotted special \neducation funds. I would ask the Senator from Iowa, is my understanding \ncorrect?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct that any withholding of Federal \nfunds will be limited to the proportional share attributable to \ndisabled students in adult prisons. Other funds would not be withheld.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would ask the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nMr. Jeffords, if he agrees that under this bill, States do not face the \ntotal loss of Federal special education funds for failing to provide \nspecial education services to those convicted as adults and \nincarcerated in adult prisons.\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I do agree.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am particularly troubled that under current law, States \nare required to develop an IEP for eligible students even if they have \nbeen sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or even \nsentenced to death. Would the Senator from Iowa comment on the \nauthority to modify an IEP for such incarcerated individuals?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Public agencies may modify an IEP for bona fide security \nor compelling penological reasons. For example, the public agency would \nnot be required to develop an IEP for a person convicted as an adult \nand incarcerated in an adult prison who is serving a life sentence \nwithout the possibility of parole or is sentenced to death.\n  This exception applies to those inmates for whom special education \nwill have no rehabilitative function for life after prison. Our aim in \nassuring that prisoners receive special education is to make them \nbetter able to cope after prison, resulting in a safer environment for \nall of us. This goal does not apply for those who will not return to \nsociety.\n  In addition, the provisions requiring participation of students with \ndisabilities in statewide assessments will not apply. Further, the \ntransition services requirements will not apply to students whose \neligibility will terminate before their release from prison.\n  Finally, the obligation to make a free appropriate public education \navailable to all disabled children does not apply with respect to \nchildren and 18 to 21 to the extent that State law does not require \nthat special education and related services under this part be provided \nto children with disability, who, in the education placement prior to \ntheir incarceration in an adult correction facilities, were not \nidentified as being a student with a disability, or did not have an \nIEP.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the legislation modify in any way the \nresponsibilities of adult prisons to prisoners with disabilities under \nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Americans With \nDisabilities Act?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, these laws still apply.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the bill make any changes to current law with \nrespect to disabled students incarcerated in juvenile facilities?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for entering into this colloquy with \nme.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for raising these important issues.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object, I would like to just get \nus out of the situation we are in and then be happy to turn it over to \nmorning business, if that is all right with the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4354-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Chinese \nGovernment that the Chinese Government immediately release Wei \nJingsheng, an extraordinary man who tells truth to power, authoritarian \nand arbitrary power. I meant to bring his book to the floor. It is \nbeing released today, May 13.\n  Mr. President, the publication date of this book is today. The title \nof the book is ``Courage To Stand Alone.'' I have very limited time, \nbut I just want to say on the floor of the Senate, because I really \nbelieve there ought to be a focus on Wei Jingsheng, that this is a man \nof tremendous courage. I have had a chance to skim-read the book. I am \ngoing to read it word for word.\n  I know that Wei Jingsheng was in prison from 1979, I believe, until \n1993. Then he was released, and then again he spoke out, as anyone \nshould do, about the importance of freedom and democracy, and again he \nfinds himself in prison.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will all help me in calling \nfor his release. I know Senator Helms has signed this letter. So has \nSenator Kennedy. I am very pleased to work with both of those Senators, \nand, in addition, Senator Moynihan has signed this letter as well. We \nare going to add more and more signatures. We are talking about a man \nwho is in very poor health. I just want to quote from Wei's outline of \n``My Defense'' which was delivered at his trial on December 13, 1995.\n\n       To sum up, the basic error of the indictment . . . is that \n     it confounds the actions of defending human rights and \n     promoting democracy and reform with ``conspiracy to subvert \n     the government.'' Therefore, anything that can be linked to \n     the ``Democracy Movement'' or ``human rights'' is an act of \n     conspiracy and subversion. . . . A government that can be \n     subverted by a movement of human rights and democracy can \n     only be a government with a contradictory and opposite \n     nature, a government that does not respect human rights or \n     promote democracy, a government of ``feudal, fascist \n     dictatorship.'' . . . According to our Constitution and laws, \n     the people are the owner of this nation and the government is \n     merely an agent of the people. The government must respect \n     the sovereignty of the people, namely the individual freedoms \n     and political rights of each citizen, including the right of \n     people to know, the right to criticize and supervise the \n     government, even to replace the government. If the government \n     abolishes or suppresses such democratic rights, then it \n     becomes an illegal government and loses its legitimacy, which \n     is based on the Chinese Constitution. Therefore, if the \n     general charges brought by the indictment against the human \n     and democracy movement are valid, then the government it \n     represents is not the legal Chinese Government and the \n     charges it brings are illegal.\n\n  Mr. President, these are words that might have been uttered by Thomas \nJefferson. I again want to just rise in the Senate today and call on \nall of my colleagues to stand up for Wei Jingsheng, this extraordinary \nman. He has now been sentenced to 14 years in prison under austere \nconditions that threaten his life. Today is the publication of the \nbook, ``Courage To Stand Alone.'' This is a collection of Wei's letters \nto Chinese leaders, prison officials, and to his family.\n  He is a remarkable man, as I have said before. This is an extremely \nimportant work. He is eloquent. If you think about the conditions under \nwhich he has written these letters, it makes this all the more \nremarkable.\n  It is not only urgent that the Chinese Government release Wei, but \nalso that it provide him with the medical care that he desperately \nneeds but has been denied. He has a heart disease that threatens his \nlife, severe hypertension, and a serious back ailment that renders him \nunable to hold his head erect. The Chinese Government ought to release \nthis courageous man. He is a prisoner of conscience.\n  Today is the publication of a remarkable book, ``Courage to Stand \nAlone.'' Wei Jingsheng is a man who represents the very best of the \ntradition of our country. He is a man who has spoken up for human \nrights and democracy and has paid a terrible price for it. I believe it \nis important for all of us, regardless of political party, all of us in \nour country to speak up for prisoners of conscience. In this particular \ncase, I take the Senate floor to call on the Chinese Government to \nrelease Wei Jingsheng from prison, to release him from prison today and \nto provide him with the medical care that he needs.\n  Mr. President, again, I hope my colleagues will join me in this \neffort. I hope my colleagues will have a chance to read this remarkable \nwork, ``Courage To Stand Alone.'' I hope it becomes a best seller in \nthe United States of America.\n  In the 30 seconds I have left, let me just say, personally I do not \nknow how people find the courage. If I lived in such a country and I \nthought that by speaking up I could wind up in prison, or even worse, \nthat my children could be rounded up and that they could end up being \ntortured or they could end up\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\nbeing in prison, which so often happens in these countries headed by \nrepressive governments, I do not think I could find the courage to \nspeak up.\n  I think it is time all of us in the U.S. Congress speak up for men \nand women like Wei Jingsheng who have had the courage to stand alone. I \nthink it is extremely important that we do everything we can to call on \nthe Chinese Government and to make it crystal clear to the Chinese \nGovernment that they ought to release this courageous man from prison, \nand other prisoners of conscience as well. If they do not do that, then \nI think all of us ought to look at trade relations and other relations \nwith China and other countries that violate the basic human rights of \ntheir citizens. We need to exert leadership and we need to make a \ndifference.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4376-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FREEDOM FOR CHINESE DISSIDENT WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to call for justice for Wei \nJingsheng. Mr. Wei is a Chinese citizen who has devoted his life to the \ncause of democracy and tolerance in the People's Republic of China. In \nexchange for his selfless effort, Mr. Wei has spent almost 20 years in \nprison. We must, as a Senate and as a country, call upon Chinese \nleaders to recognize Mr. Wei's genuine love of his country, to respect \nhis right to dissent, and to set him free to live his life in peace.\n  I have chosen to make this statement today because today we celebrate \nthe publication of Mr. Wei's book, ``The Courage to Stand Alone: \nLetters from Prison and Other Writings.'' In these unadorned yet \npowerful reflections, Mr. Wei provides insight into the tortures he has \nsuffered in prisons and labor camps, as well as the passion and \ncommitment which have maintained his fighting spirit. His \nstraightforward missives on the obvious need for democracy remind us \nall of our fundamental civic values.\n  Wei Jingsheng is a hero. With a background as an electrician, and \nwith the weight of the Communist leadership against him, he became what \nthe New York Times called the strongest voice of China's democracy \nmovement. It is with awe and sadness that I note Mr. Wei's ability to \npersevere these many years despite his and other Chinese dissidents' \nvirtual invisibility on the international scene.\n  We can not allow Mr. Wei to be invisible. As Americans we have always \nsupported the cause of democracy and tolerance. In our own country we \nare lucky. Democracy as law and tolerance, though we must always be \nvigilant for transgressions against it, is an integral part of our \nsocial fabric. In other parts of the world, including the People's \nRepublic of China, democracy and tolerance remain elusive. Mr. Wei is a \nhero because he fights against the tide. The leaders of China will be \nheroes when they realize that men and women like Wei Jingsheng can \nstrengthen and enrich their country--if only they are set free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4377-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I join with other Senators today in \ncalling for the immediate release of Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng. \nWei Jingsheng exemplifies China's best aspirations for democracy, and \nhis imprisonment exemplifies the worst of the Communist cadre that \nstands in the way of freedom for a nation of over one billion people. \nWei's imprisonment is only one story in the broader tragedy of brutal \npolitical repression that has silenced all voices of dissent in China. \nIn a world that is increasingly open to the benefits of freedom and the \npotential of free markets, the great hope is that the growth of \ncapitalism in China will undermine Beijing's tyranny. The growth of \nfree markets alone, however, will never replace individual acts of \ncourage and conviction by people who defy China's Communist leadership. \nPeople willing to spend their lives for the freedom of their countrymen \nare mankind's true heroes.\n  Mr. President, Wei Jingsheng was first imprisoned in 1979 after \ncriticizing the Government's suppression of the Democracy Wall movement \nin China. Since that time, he has spent all but 6 months of the last 18 \nyears in prison. Inside China's prison system, Wei has been a constant \ntarget for harassment and reeducation by China's prison guards. Wei has \nfought the daily battle to maintain his integrity, the strength of his \nprinciples, and the conviction of his beliefs. After 14 years in \nprison, Wei was released in 1993 and promptly began condemning the \nGovernment's horrific record of political repression. He was imprisoned \nagain for his courage and remains in a Chinese prison today suffering \nfrom a life-threatening heart condition.\n  Wei's love for his country is most clearly seen in the personal \nsacrifice associated with his forthright and constant stand against \npolitical tyranny. The Clinton administration could learn a lesson from \nMr. Wei. In the long run, honesty is the best policy, and a forthright \ndiscussion of the atrocities being committed by Beijing will do more \nfor a stable United States-China relationship than repeated acts of \nappeasement. True constructive engagement means that China is required \nto honor the trading agreements it signs, to avoid proliferating \nweapons of mass destruction, and to respect international norms for \nhuman rights. We in America need to realize what Wei recognized long \nago--that the forces of justice and liberty are at work in the Chinese \npeople just as they have been at work with such stunning effect in \nother nations around the world.\n  In the battle between liberty and tyranny in China, I am placing my \nwager on the side of freedom. As Ronald Reagan said, ``Democracy is not \na fragile flower. Still, it needs cultivating. If the rest of this \ncentury is to witness the gradual growth of freedom and democratic \nideals, we must take actions to assist the campaign for democracy.''\n  Mr. President, we must ask ourselves if we are taking those actions \nto cultivate the flower of liberty in China. Has our commitment to \nhuman rights and civil liberties been constant? Have we defended \ninternational norms against weapons proliferation that the free people \nof the world have embraced for their mutual protection? One need only \nlook at the record of political repression in China and China's arming \nof Iran to see that the Clinton administration is failing to press our \nconcern for international human rights and protect our own long-term \nnational security interests.\n  American foreign policy needs to return to its most enduring and \nnoble aspect: our willingness as a nation to sacrifice in order to help \nother peoples achieve the individual liberties we enjoy. When the \nChinese people eventually rid themselves of tyrannical leadership and \nestablish a democracy--and they will just as the South Koreans, the \nJapanese, and the Taiwanese have done before them--I hope they will be \nable to say that America stood by them in their darkest hours. For the \nChinese people, the torch lit in Tiananmen Square is flickering. The \nAmerican people want to stand by the Chinese. The Clinton \nadministration has been less clear. The administration can stand up for \nAmerica and the Chinese people by insisting that Wei Jingsheng be \nreleased.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4377-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4377-S4378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE COURAGE TO STAND ALONE\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues \nthe publication of ``The Courage to Stand Alone,'' the letters of Wei \nJingsheng, a fearless and outspoken dissident currently imprisoned by \nthe People's Republic of China. For two decades Wei Jingsheng has been \na leader in the struggle for democracy in China, as well as a \npassionate advocate of human rights for the people of Tibet.\n  Among the many crimes for which Wei has spent the last 18 years in \nprison, perhaps none is so onerous to his persecutors as his \npresumption to hold the totalitarian regime of the People's Republic of \nChina to its own standard of law. As Andrew J. Nathan writes in his \nForeword:\n\n       Wei's powerful statement of self-defense [at his 1979 \n     trial] exposes how little difference there is between the new \n     legal system and the old absence of a legal system. The \n     prosecutors and judges search for a crime and find none, but \n     they obey orders. They sentence Wei to fifteen years.\n       The outside world is outraged, but most Chinese at the time \n     are wiser. They see Wei as the victim of his own naivete. He \n     failed to appreciate the unwritten limits to free speech and \n     legal reform. He committed the greatest offense in a \n     dictatorship: taking words at face value.\n\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\n\n  The Courage to Stand Alone serves as a testament of resistance to the \ntotalitarian phenomenon so brilliantly dissected in our century by the \nlikes of Hannah Arendt and George Orwell. Wei's letters stand as the \nliterary equivalent of the famous photograph of the lone Chinese \nindividual confronting a column of tanks during the 1989 Tiananmen \nSquare massacre.\n  In his letter of June 15, 1991 Wei writes:\n\n       It is precisely because human rights are independent of the \n     will of the government, and even independent of the will of \n     all mankind, that people fight for the realization and \n     expansion of human rights as a natural and unprovoked matter \n     of course. They gradually come to the realization that the \n     more widespread and reliable the protection of human rights \n     is, the more their own human rights are protected. Just as \n     man's understanding of objective truths and objective laws is \n     a gradual process, man's understanding and comprehension of \n     human rights is a gradual process. Just as man's grasp and \n     utilization of objective laws is a progressive process, man's \n     protection of the theory and practice of human rights is a \n     progressive process.\n\n  Wei Jingsheng--by his words and conduct--has done much to advance our \nunderstanding of human rights in China and throughout the world. I \ncommend ``The Courage to Stand Alone'' to all Senators, and I look \nforward to the day when Wei Jingsheng will again be free to stand \ntogether with other Chinese dissidents who struggle to bring a measure \nof democracy to their ancient and long-suffering homeland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4377-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are some individuals whose personal \ncourage is almost impossible to fathom, who will be long remembered for \nthe example they set in standing up for what they believed for the sake \nof all of us. Wei Jingsheng, who is perhaps China's most famous \npolitical prisoner, is one such individual. Today I join Senators \nMoynihan, Helms, Wellstone and Kennedy in recognizing today's \npublication of Mr. Wei's collection of letters to Chinese leaders and \nmembers of his family, and essays about democracy, ``The Courage to \nStand Alone: Letters from Prison and Other Writings.''\n  Known as the intellectual leader of the Democracy Wall movement, \nChina's first prodemocracy protest, Mr. Wei has spent nearly all of the \nlast 18 years in prison for his outspoken, unrelenting criticism of \nChina's political leaders and his thoughtful and inspiring writings \nabout the need for democratic change and the rule of law in China. In \none essay, Mr. Wei describes the law in China as, ``merely a `legal \nweapon' that anyone in power can wield against his enemies.''\n  In an effort to convince the International Olympic Committee to award \nChina the 2000 Olympic Games, the Chinese Government released Mr. Wei \nin late 1993. The cynicism of that decision was exposed just 6 months \nlater, when he was rearrested and held incommunicado for 20 months, in \npart for meeting with Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck. He is \ncurrently serving a 14-year sentence.\n  In addition to the egregious violations of the rights to freedom of \nexpression, due process, and freedom from arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, I am very concerned about Mr. Wei's health. He is suffering \nfrom high blood pressure and a heart condition, and has not received \nthe medical attention he needs. He is not permitted to go outside, nor \nis he allowed physical exercise. I am told that prison authorities have \nmoved other prisoners into Mr. Wei's cell to monitor and limit his \npolitical writing. If Mr. Wei serves all of his current 14-year prison \nsentence, he will be 60 years old when he is released. His health is so \nfragile it is uncertain whether he will ever get out alive.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Wei is one of thousands of courageous people who \nhave been thrown in prison, tortured or otherwise silenced in order to \nsquelch any expression for democratic change in China. Despite repeated \nattempts by our administration to discuss human rights with Chinese \nauthorities, the Chinese Government has continued to insist that \ninternationally recognized human rights are an internal matter. The \nsituation has gotten worse, not better.\n  I urge all Senators read ``The Courage to Stand Alone,'' and to \nremember Wei Jingsheng and the thousands of other Chinese citizens who \nhave remained steadfast in support of democracy and human rights, in \nthe face of repression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4378-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RELEASE OF WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nurging the authorities in Beijing to provide immediate medical care to \nWei Jingsheng and to end his prolonged incarceration in Chinese prison. \nGranting these requests would not only be an act of official compassion \nbut it would also signal to others that the introduction of economic \nliberalism--and the remarkable economic advancements that it spawned--\nis leading to improvements in internal freedom, human rights practices, \nand the quality of life in the People's Republic of China.\n  Responding to our modest requests would be a positive sign that \nChina, as it seeks to be more fully integrated into the global system, \nis increasingly self-confident about itself, about the image it \nprojects to the rest of the world and about the role it intends to play \nin the world.\n  Wei Jingsheng has spent the better part of his adult life in \ndetention, in jail, and in labor camps. Most of his past 18 years have \nbeen spent in solitary confinement in unusually harsh conditions. His \nhealth has deteriorated badly and he is deprived of most normal \nprivileges available to political prisoners. Those conditions and these \ndeprivations would have broken the spirit of defiance in most human \nbeings. Not so for Wei Jingsheng.\n  Wei Jingsheng's remarkable prison letters to the Chinese leadership \nwill be published today, May 13. His book, ``The Courage to Stand \nAlone: Letters from Prison and Other Writings,'' is a splendid \ntestament to the yearning for democracy by a political dissident who \nhas never experienced true freedom in a land and country that has never \nexperienced true democracy or anything approximating an open society. \nHis writings speak to us about the need for democratic reform at a time \nwhen China exhibits little internal visible dissent. There is now no \nvisible political dissent in China because political dissidents have \neither gone into exile, are in prison, or have redirected their \nenergies in new-found entrepreneurial enterprises.\n\n  Mr. President, we are here today not only to laud the publication of \nWei Jingsheng's book of letters or to urge Beijing to discard its harsh \ntreatment of its leading political dissident, we are here to honor a \ntrue democrat. We should honor true democrats and democracy anywhere, \nand under any circumstances. We can and should promote human rights \npractices and democracy abroad just as we pursue other important \nnational interests.\n  Our foreign policy must express both our values and our interests. \nThat is why we must continue to support the development of political \nand economic reforms abroad while endorsing those democracy-promoting \nprograms undertaken by such non-government organizations as the \nNational Endowment for Democracy [NED] and the Center for Democracy.\n  Wei Jingsheng's current prison term expires in the year 2009 but his \nhealth is reportedly so poor that he may not survive until then. \nKeeping Wei Jingsheng in prison under such difficult conditions would \nbe a permanent stain on China's claim that it is misunderstood by the \nrest of the world. To release this man and other prisoners of \nconscience would bring good will to China and assure the outside world\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\nthat China enjoys the self-confidence to change.\n  I join with my colleagues in the hope that Wei Jingsheng will be \nreleased from prison in the very near future.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4378-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO RELEASE WEI JINGSHENG--A POLITICAL \n                                PRISONER\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with a simple message, a \nmessage to the Government of China to release Wei Jingsheng. Who is Wei \nJingsheng? Born in China, Wei Jingsheng is a dreamer, a political \nactivist, a writer, a silenced leader, an inspiration, a nurturing \nolder brother, and one who possesses an unparalleled faith in democracy \nand its place in modern China. He is the kind of man who if living in \nAmerica would undoubtedly grace these Halls. But Wei Jingsheng does not \nlive in the United States, he lives in China, where the courage of his \nconvictions have not been appreciated, in fact quite the opposite, Wei \nJingsheng has been severely punished.\n  In speaking out for democracy and reform, Wei Jingsheng has suffered \ngreat consequences--consequences including nearly 18 years of solitary \nconfinement, torturous treatment, the lack of medical attention, and \nnumerous other methods known to squelch a man's spirits and weaken his \nconvictions.\n  Now that we know about his punishment, let us consider Wei \nJingsheng's crimes: numerous writings on democracy, a series of letters \nto China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping before his death, \ncommunicating with foreign journalists, participating in the 1979 \nDemocracy Wall movement, and most recently meeting with John Shattuck, \nthe United States Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human \nRights, and Labor in 1994. Frankly, these do not strike me as crimes, \nor actions that warrant any sanctions by the state, and most certainly \nare not at all commensurate with the punishment Wei Jingsheng has \nendured.\n  Respect for human rights is an international concept. We only need \nlook to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to see a sample of \nthe international consensus on human rights. While China may resent \nUnited States scrutiny on this topic, we do in fact have a legitimate \nright, as well as a moral obligation, to call for improved conditions. \nWe can and should have a human rights dialog with Chinese leaders, and \nI encourage the administration to make more opportunities for such high \nlevel discussions to take place.\n  Wei Jingsheng is reported to be near the end of his life--a life of \nstruggle and hardship. His recently published book ``The Courage To \nStand Alone: Letters From Prison and Other Writings'' underscore Wei \nJingsheng's struggle to promote democracy in China. I stand with my \nother colleagues in the Senate today to encourage the Government of \nChina to immediately release Wei Jingsheng.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4379-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues in \nsolidarity with a courageous Chinese advocate of human rights, Wei \nJingsheng.\n  Each year, the family and friends of Robert F. Kennedy, and those who \nhonor his legacy present a human rights award in my brothers name. In \n1994, Wei Jingsheng won that award.\n  Except for a brief period in late 1993 and early 1994, Wei has been \nimprisoned since 1979 because he dared to call for democracy and \nfreedom of expression in his country.\n  Wei never feared to tell the story of the abysmal conditions imposed \non those who dare to speak for human rights, democracy, and freedom of \nexpression in China.\n  He was an electrician at the Beijing Zoo in 1979, when he earned \ninternational praise during the Democracy Wall movement for his \ncourageous essays criticizing the Chinese leadership and calling for \ndemocratic reforms.\n  In his 1978 journal, ``Explorations,'' he publicly exposed the \ntorture of political prisoners. He later wrote one of the most famous \nessays of the democracy movement, arguing eloquently and powerfully \nthat democracy and free speech were preconditions for China's economic \nand social growth. In another essay, he challenged China's leader at \nthe time, Deng Xiaoping, saying: ``We cannot help asking Deng what his \nidea of democracy is. If the people have no right to express freely \ntheir opinions or to enjoy freedom of speech and criticism, then how \ncan one talk of democracy? * * * Only a genuine general election can \ncreate a government and leaders ready to serve the interests of the \nelectorate.''\n  For his refusal to remain quiet, he was arrested in 1979, tried \nsecretly, and sentenced to 15 years in prison--most of which he spent \nin solitary confinement. He was repeatedly tortured.\n  In September 1993, Wei was released as part of China's public \nrelations attempt to win the opportunity to host the Olympic Games in \nthe year 2000. Upon leaving prison, Wei immediately resumed his leading \nrole in the democracy movement.\n  On April 1, 1994, after Wei met with Assistant Secretary of State for \nHuman Rights, John Shattuck, he was arrested again and held \nincommunicado for 20 months. He was formally charged in November 1995 \nand, after a 1 day trial, was convicted of ``engaging in activities in \nan attempt to overthrow the Chinese Government.''\n  Wei is now in a prison cell serving a 14-year sentence. His health is \npoor, his conditions are deplorable, and he is repeatedly tortured.\n  Today we celebrate the latest publication of his writings, ``The \nCourage to Stand Alone.'' Wei has often stood alone against the Chinese \nGovernment. But he does not stand alone, and he will not stand alone in \nthe wider world. He will never stand alone, as long as there are those \nwho care about human rights and who are willing to speak out on his \nbehalf. We will go on doing so until Wei is released, all political \nprisoners in China are released, and the basic human rights he so \nbravely fights for are enjoyed by all the people of China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4379-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4379-S4380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MR. WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important \nissue of political prisoners in China. I want to thank Senators Helms, \nMoynihan, Kennedy, and Wellstone for focusing the Senate's attention on \nthis topic.\n  As we consider United States-China relations, respect for human \nrights must be at the top of our Nation's agenda. In that regard, today \nI call on the Government of China to release Mr. Wei Jingsheng from \nprison so that he may receive the immediate medical care he desperately \nneeds.\n  Further, I call upon President Clinton to make the release of Mr. Wei \nJingsheng, and all Chinese political prisoners, such as the Tibetan \nprisoners of conscience, a top priority as our Nation discusses our \nrelationship with China.\n  The first amendment of our Constitution guarantees citizens of the \nUnited States freedom of speech, the right of people to peaceably \nassemble and the right to petition the government for a redress of \ngrievances. Mr. Jingsheng does not have these rights, and so I join my \ncolleagues asking for his freedom.\n  In the United States of America ``We hold these Truths to be self-\nevident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their \nCreator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \nLiberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.''\n  That all men are created equal. This is one of our Nation's \nunswerving principles and we have never and should never be willing to, \nas President John F. Kennedy stated in his inaugural address, ``permit \nthe slow undoing of human rights to which this nation has always been \ncommitted.'' And, as my colleagues know, there is a tragic lack of \nrespect for human rights in China, which is why we are making these \nstatements today.\n  Mr. Wei Jingsheng's courage and conviction should be a beacon to all \nof us. He has received the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award and I \nwould like to quote Senator Robert F. Kennedy:\n\n       Some men see things as they are and say ``why?''\n       I dream things that never were and say ``why not?''\n\n  Mr. Jingsheng has that courage to ask ``why not.'' So today, Mr. \nPresident, I rise and ask the Government of\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\nChina: Why not--why not release Mr. Wei Jingsheng.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4379-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to call for the immediate \nrelease of Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent political prisoner.\n  Wei Jingsheng is no stranger to harsh unjust treatment. He has spent \nall but 6 months of the last 18 years in prisons or in labor camps, \noften in solitary confinement. Now serving his second sentence of 14 \nyears for the crime of peacefully advocating democracy and human \nrights, Wei Jingsheng is terribly ill. His expected release date is 12 \nyears from now--the year 2009--and that is assuming he lives that long.\n  At 46 years of age, Wei suffers from life-threatening heart disease, \nhe cannot lift his head, and he complains of severe back pain. His \nrequests for medical attention have gone unfulfilled and all \nindications are that he has not seen a doctor in more than a year.\n  A former electrician at the Beijing Zoo, Wei has been one of the \nstrongest voices of China's democratic movement. In recognition of his \nefforts, Wei was named the 1994 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award \nlaureate and, every year since 1995, Members of Congress have nominated \nhim for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n  While in prison serving his first sentence, Wei was allowed to write \nletters on certain topics to his family, prison authorities, and \nChina's leaders. Because most of these letters urged democratic \nreforms, they were seized by authorities and never sent. Wei was later \nable to retrieve them and release them publicly, and they have now been \ntranslated and published as a book. Today, May 13, is the publication \ndate of this book, ``The Courage To Stand Alone: Letters From Prison \nand Other Writings.'' This book states what is obvious to Wei and \nshould be clear to Americans: China needs democratic freedoms. \nUnfortunately, China's leaders continue to show a flagrant disregard \nfor human rights.\n  In 1994, over the strenuous objections of those of us concerned over \nChina's atrocious and repeated violations of international standards of \nhuman rights, the administration delinked granting of most-favored-\nnation trade status to China to improvements in its human rights \nrecord. The administration argued then that through constructive \nengagement on economic matters, and dialog on other issues, including \nhuman rights, the United States could better influence Chinese \nbehavior. That was a mistake.\n  Let those who support constructive engagement visit the terribly ill \nWei Jingsheng in his prison cell, and ask him if developing markets for \ntoothpaste or breakfast cereal will help him win his freedom or save \nhis life. I do not see how closer economic ties alone will somehow \ntransform China's authoritarian system into a more democratic one. \nUnless we press the case for improvement in China's human rights \nrecord, using the leverage afforded us by the Chinese Government's \ndesire to expand its economy and increase trade with us, I do not see \nhow conditions will get much better.\n  In fact, the harsh prison conditions and lack of medical attention \nprovided to Mr. Wei demonstrate that, after nearly 4 years, dialog and \nconstructive engagement have made no impact on Chinese behavior. We \nshould make it clear that human rights are of real--as opposed to \nrhetorical--concern to this country. Until Wei Jingsheng and others \ncommitted to reform in China are allowed to speak their voices freely \nand work for change, American-Chinese relations should not be based on \na business-as-usual basis. I hope the administration will do everything \npossible to demand the immediate release of Wei Jingsheng and urge \nChinese authorities to provide him with access to medical care that he \nurgently requires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4380-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call for the release of \nWei Jingsheng who has been imprisoned for almost 18 years under the \nharshest of circumstances in China. Mr. Wei was first jailed in 1979 \nfor advocating democratic reform in China. Can you imagine? The free \nexchange of such ideas which we take for granted every day in the \nUnited States cost Mr. Wei his freedom.\n  Mr. Wei was released in 1993 in an act which curiously coincided with \nan upcoming vote by the International Olympic Committee on China's \napplication to host the Olympic games in the year 2000. China's bid for \nthe Olympic games was unsuccessful and shortly thereafter Mr. Wei was \nimprisoned again. He is not scheduled for release until 2009. This \novertly politically motivated move is unconscionable.\n  Through these years of personal terror Mr. Wei has frequently been \nheld in solitary confinement. He was been the victim of cruelty and \nmistreatment which had a serious effect on Mr. Wei's health. I am told \nthat Mr. Wei is suffering from heart disease but does not have access \nto proper medical care. This treatment is simply wrong.\n  The People's Republic of China wants to assume the status of a \nresponsible nation in the world community. And yet they continue to \nsubjugate the people of Tibet. As a case in point, I spoke earlier this \nyear on the floor about Ngawang Choephel, a former Fulbright scholar at \nMiddlebury College and a friend of the United States, who is serving an \n18-year prison term for supposed espionage activities.\n  The People's Republic of China wants to assume the status of a \nresponsible nation in the world community. And yet they continue to \nsubjugate their own people as well. Mr. Wei is a case in point. The \nState Department in its annual human rights record for 1996 hit the \nnail on the head. It said that China ``continued to commit widespread \nand well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of \ninternationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' \nintolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy \nof laws protecting basic freedoms.''\n  Mr. President, Mr. Wei has suffered enough. The people of Tibet have \nsuffered enough. The people of China have suffered enough. It is time \nfor a change. We must work for that change in areas we can influence. \nAnd let's start by calling for the release of Mr. Wei.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4380-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4380-S4381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE UNJUST IMPRISONMENT OF WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today it is my unhappy duty to note the \ncontinued imprisonment of Wei Jingsheng by the Government of China. In \nan attempt to silence his bold voice for democracy, Mr. Wei has been \njailed in solitary confinement or forced to work in a labor camp for \nall but 6 months of the past 18 years. As a result of his mistreatment, \nhe suffers from a life-threatening heart condition and cannot lift his \nhead due to a neck injury. Today I join my colleagues to call for his \nimmediate and unconditional release, and urge the Government of China \nto provide him with medical attention.\n  Mr. Wei's commitment to democracy and freedom despite such \nmistreatment is a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the \npower that words hold over the human soul. He was first jailed in 1978 \nafter founding an independent magazine and daring to call for \ndemocracy. Despite the hard conditions of prison life, Mr. Wei refused \nto abandon his beliefs. Over the next decade, he wrote many letters--\nsome to his family telling of his daily life, others to the leaders of \nhis nation urging them to take immediate steps toward democracy. \nVirtually all were confiscated by prison authorities and never sent. \nReleased as a result of international pressure in 1993, Mr. Wei \nimmediately resumed his advocacy of democracy despite all that he had \nsuffered. Within 6 months he was sentenced to another 14 years in \nprison. Today Chinese officials consider his writings so threatening \nthat he is constantly monitored by criminal inmates whose job it is to \nensure that he puts no words down on paper.\n  Despite these measures, Mr. Wei's words have echoed throughout China \nand the world. In 1989, demands for his release helped to stir the \ndemonstration in Tiananmen Square. He also has been honored with the \nRobert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom, \nand been nominated many times for the Nobel Prize for Peace.\n  I am confident that the Chinese Government's attempts to silence Mr. \nWei will not succeed. Mr. Wei's letters,\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\nwhich he reclaimed as a condition of his release in 1993, are published \nin ``The Courage To Stand Alone: Letters From Prison and Other \nWritings,'' to be released today. It is my hope that these words will \ncontinue to echo throughout the world, and help to bring freedom and \ndemocracy to the people of China.\n  Thinking of Mr. Wei, I am reminded of the words of another man \nimprisoned for his uncompromising beliefs. As he wrote from his cell:\n\n       Only one thing has remained: the chance to prove--to \n     myself, to those around me and to God--that . . . I stand \n     behind what I do, that I mean it seriously and that I can \n     take the consequences.\n\n  Today I will meet the writer of those words, President Vaclav Havel \nof the Czech Republic. I am filled with hope as I think of President \nHavel's extraordinary life and his path from political prisoner to \npresident. I know that Mr. Wei shares President Havel's determination \nto stand behind his beliefs. It is my hope that one day he also will be \nfree to travel to Washington and that this day will come soon. Mr. \nWei's unjust imprisonment must end, and I appeal to the Government of \nChina to release him immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4380-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CALLING FOR RELEASE OF CHINESE DISSIDENT WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today marks the publication date of a \nremarkable compilation of letters from a remarkable man, imprisoned \nChinese political dissident Wei Jingsheng. His book, ``The Courage To \nStand Alone: Letters From Prison and Other Writings,'' should be \nrequired reading for anyone who takes for granted the freedoms \nenshrined in our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Wei is currently \nserving 14 years for the crime of advocating democracy in a country \nwhere freedom of speech does not extend to criticism of government \nauthorities.\n  An electrician by training, Wei lacks the formal education of some \nother famous 20th century champions of democracy and civil rights--\nVaclav Havel, Andrei Sakharov, or Martin Luther King--but whatever he \nmay lack in sophistication, he more than makes up for with his blunt \neloquence.\n  Just days before the Chinese crackdown against pro-democracy \nprotesters in Tiananmen Square, Wei offered some candid advice for \nChina's top leaders from his prison cell, urging them to ``take great \nstrides to implement a democratic government as quickly as possible.'' \nA great tragedy might have been avoided if Beijing's gerontocracy had \nheeded Wei's call.\n  Wei was first imprisoned from 1979 to 1993 on charges of ``counter-\nrevolutionary propaganda and incitement,'' the result of his \nparticipation in the Democracy Wall Movement. During this brief \nflowering of officially authorized political dissent in China, Wei had \nthe nerve to argue that China's modernization goals could not be met \nwithout democratic reform. For this affront, he was severely punished.\n  In 1993, on the eve of the International Olympic Committee's decision \nabout whether to award the 2000 Olympics to Beijing, China briefly \nreleased Wei in an effort to strengthen its Olympic bid. On April 1, \n1994, just days after meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State \nfor Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, John Shattuck, Wei was detained \nonce more.\n  He was subsequently sentenced to 14 years for trying to ``overthrow \nthe Chinese Government.'' The actions cited as proof of Wei's \n``counter-revolutionary'' intent included publishing articles critical \nof the government and raising funds for the victims of political \npersecution in China.\n  Wei has spent most of his last 18 years in solitary confinement, \nenduring a variety of physical and psychological hardships. He is now \nwidely reported to be in very poor health, suffering from heart and \nback ailments that require urgent medical attention. Attention he is \ncurrently denied.\n  Today, I join with my colleagues to urge the Chinese Government to \ntake all necessary steps to release Wei Jingsheng from prison on \nhumanitarian grounds. Chinese authorities should ensure that Wei \nimmediately receives the medical care he requires. Wei's imprisonment \ncomes as a result of his peaceful advocacy of democracy and basic human \nrights. His words warrant our admiration, not a death sentence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4381-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4381-S4382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WEI JINGSHENG\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today is the publication date of a book of \nprison letters by Wei Jingsheng, ``The Courage to Stand Alone: Letters \nFrom Prison and Other Writings.'' Wei's book is the subject of a May 5 \neditorial in the New York Times; I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Wei is China's most prominent dissident. \nPerhaps I should say that he is China's most prominent dissident in \njail. In any event, there are no active dissidents in China, according \nto this year's State Department human rights report--they are all in \njail, or silent.\n  Wei became famous for his powerful, articulate statements during the \nDemocracy Wall movement. After his release in 1993, he returned his \nadvocacy of democratic reform. After 6 months, he was rearrested and \nheld incommunicado for almost 2 years before being sentenced to another \n14-year prison term in 1996.\n  Wei shows no concern for himself. His health is poor, threatened by \nheart problems. Yet he continues to stand up to the Chinese Government, \ndemanding freedom and democracy for the people of China.\n  Wei's letters reveal courage in the face of a brutal and immoral \nregime. His example is bound to humble any one who dares take for \ngranted the freedoms enjoyed by the American people.\n  I hope that, somehow, Wei will learn of the enormous respect and \nsupport he has from the American people. I urge Senators to join in \ncalling upon the Chinese Government to release Wei and immediately \nprovide him with the medical treatment he so badly needs.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the New York Times, Monday, May 5, 1997]\n\n    Letters From a Chinese Jail--The Blunt Demands of Wei Jingsheng\n\n                          (By Tina Rosenberg)\n\n       For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has sought to \n     silence one of the world's most important political \n     prisoners, Wei Jingsheng. Once an electrician in the Beijing \n     Zoo, Mr. Wei is the strongest voice of China's democracy \n     movement. He has spent all but six months of the last 18 \n     years in prisons and labor camps, most in solitary \n     confinement in conditions that would have killed a less \n     stubborn man long ago and may soon kill Mr. Wei, who is 46 \n     and very ill.\n       Now serving a second long sentence, he is watched around \n     the clock by non-political criminal prisoners who insure he \n     does not put pen to paper. But during his first imprisonment \n     he was permitted to write letters on certain topics to his \n     family, prison authorities and China's leaders. Most were \n     never sent. But they have now been translated and published. \n     They form a remarkable body of Chinese political writing.\n       The book, ``The Courage to Stand Alone,'' is published by \n     Viking. It shows why the Chinese Government is so afraid of \n     Mr. Wei. His weapon is simplicity. Unlike other Chinese \n     activists, Mr. Wei does not worry about tailoring his \n     argument to his audience and does not indulge in the Chinese \n     intellectual tradition of flattering the powerful. He does \n     not worry about being seen as pro-Western, or a traitor to \n     China. He writes as if what is obvious to him--that China \n     needs democratic freedoms--should be clear to anyone.\n       ``Dear Li Peng: When you've finished reading this letter, \n     please pass it on to Zhao Ziyang and Deng Xiaoping,'' begins \n     one typical letter to three top Chinese leaders. ``I would \n     like to offer several concrete suggestions.'' The first \n     suggestion: ``take great strides to implement a democratic \n     government as quickly as possible.''\n       He wrote this letter on May 4, 1989, one month before the \n     massacre in Tiananmen Square, ordered by Li Peng and Deng \n     Xiaoping.\n       Although he was not allowed to write of his worst \n     mistreatment, his letters describe his health and request \n     books, a heater, medicine or a hutch to breed rabbits when he \n     is in a labor camp. The Government expected Mr. Wei to show \n     he was being ``re-educated.'' Instead, he wrote essays on \n     democratic restructuring of the Government.\n       Mr. Wei has always been uncompromising. In 1978, Mr. Deng \n     was fighting for control of the leadership and encouraged \n     reformist thinking. The activists created a Democracy Wall \n     along a highway outside Beijing, where writers put up posters \n     with their thoughts. Mr. Wei wrote the boldest poster, a \n     tract arguing for real democracy and criticizing Mr. Deng, \n     who was then revered by the activists. Mr. Wei then founded \n     an independent magazine. He was arrested in March 1979, given \n     a show trial and sentenced to 15 years.\n       He was released six months before completing his sentence, \n     as part of China's bid to\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\n     win the Olympics in 2000. He refused to leave before getting \n     back letters the prison authorities had confiscated. Once \n     free, he immediately resumed his work for democracy. He was \n     rearrested, and after a 20-month incommunicado imprisonment \n     he was sentenced to another 14 years.\n       Although censorship insured that few Chinese heard of Mr. \n     Wei after 1979, he has remained a touchstone of the democracy \n     movement. In January 1989, Fang Lizhi, the astrophysicist, \n     wrote a public letter to Mr. Deng asking for amnesty for \n     political prisoners, mentioning only Mr. Wei by name. That \n     letter touched off more letters and petitions and was one of \n     the sparks of the student movement and the occupation of \n     Tiananmen Square.\n       There is no visible dissent in China today. Some of the \n     activists went into exile, many were arrested, others gave up \n     politics and turned their talents to commerce.\n       The moral force of Mr. Wei's writing recalls the prison \n     letters of other famous dissidents, such as Martin Luther \n     King Jr.'s ``Letter From the Birmingham Jail,'' Adam \n     Michnik's ``Letters From Prison'' and Vaclav Havel's \n     ``Letters to Olga.'' Mr. Wei's letters are less eloquent, \n     however. He is not a man of words, and he was probably not \n     writing with an eye to publication.\n       But the most important thing the others had that Mr. Wei \n     does not is widespread international support. Mr. King, Mr. \n     Michnik and Mr. Havel knew that people all over the world \n     were looking out for them and their governments were under \n     pressure to free them, treat them well and heed their cause.\n       This security is as important to a political prisoner's \n     survival as food and water, and Mr. Wei and his fellow \n     Chinese dissidents do not have it. Their names are not widely \n     known. While some American and other officials have brought \n     them up during talks with Chinese leaders, in general the \n     outside world treats Beijing officials with the deference due \n     business partners.\n       Today Mr. Wei suffers from life-threatening heart disease. \n     Because of a neck problem, he cannot lift his head. All \n     indications are that he has not seen a doctor in more than a \n     year. He is due to be released in 2009--if he lives that \n     long.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, most of the time when I stand on this \nfloor following Senator Wellstone, I will be on the opposite side of \nSenator Wellstone's comments. This evening, I would like to associate \nmyself with the comments that Senator Wellstone made. I think between \nthe two of us, we pretty well cover the political spectrum as we stand \ntoday on the floor of the United States Senate and call for the \nimmediate release of Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent political \nprisoner.\n  Because of his courageous stand as a voice for democracy and human \nrights, Wei Jingsheng was sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in prison. He \nserved 14\\1/2\\ years of his term and was released in September 1993 as \npart of China's bid to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000. Wei \ncontinued to speak out for human rights and was detained, again, by the \nChinese Government less than 6 months after his release.\n  Wei Jingsheng was first jailed in 1979 because of his peaceful \nactivities and writings during China's democracy wall movement, notably \nhis famous essay, ``The Fifth Modernization--Democracy.'' Following his \nrelease from prison in September 1993, he met with journalists and \ndiplomats, wrote articles for publications abroad and continued to \nassert the rights and aspirations of the Chinese people.\n  Mr. President, on December 13, 1995, Wei Jingsheng was tried and \nconvicted of the totally unfounded charge of conspiring to subvert the \nChinese Government. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison and 3 years \ndeprivation of his political rights.\n  Human rights organizations and governments around the world have \ncondemned the trial and severe sentence. We, the Congress, have \nunanimously adopted resolutions calling for Wei's immediate and \nunconditional release. The European Parliament has also called for his \nrelease, declaring that Wei had been ``persecuted because he was \ndemanding democratic rights for Chinese people.''\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that Wei's family has appealed \nto the United Nations for help, increasingly concerned about his \nfailing health, which has further deteriorated. Though he is no longer \nin solitary confinement, Wei is under constant surveillance from other \ninmates while cell lights are on 24 hours a day, visits by his family \nare restricted, and he has no access to outside medical care.\n  Wei Jingsheng remains a symbol of hope in China for those within \nChina who are voiceless. They have steadfastly refused to give up their \nbeliefs, their principles and their commitment to democratic reforms, \ndespite the suffering and punishment that they have endured.\n  I believe that by honoring Wei for his courageous commitment to human \nrights and fundamental freedoms, we will draw attention to the ongoing \nstruggle for fundamental human rights in the People's Republic of China \nat a crucial time in that nation's history. Calling for the immediate \nrelease of Wei sends a strong message to China on behalf of the entire \ninternational community.\n  On Friday of last week, I joined a bipartisan and bicameral effort in \nhonoring Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, along with Mr. Harry Wu, at the third \nanniversary of the Vietnam Human Rights Day. As I speak today, Dr. Que \nstill remains in prison unable to leave Vietnam to seek medical \nattention and unable to speak freely about the abuses he has suffered \nat the hands of the Vietnamese Government. Of course, Mr. Wu, who \nfought for representative government and human rights in China for many \nyears, was persecuted and held as a prisoner of conscience by China's \nCommunist dictatorship. He was eventually allowed to emigrate to the \nUnited States where he has, thankfully, continued his efforts to help \nthe Chinese people gain liberty and human dignity.\n  On August 25, 1995, Mr. Wu was expelled from China and returned \nsafely to San Francisco. While this case was notable because Mr. Wu is \na naturalized American citizen, the Chinese Government holds many \nthousands of prisoners who, like Mr. Wu and Wei Jingsheng, are guilty \nof nothing more than speaking out in defense of human liberty.\n\n  While the cases of Mr. Wu, Wei Jingsheng and Dr. Nguyen Dan Que\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\nmay differ, they are all representative of human rights abuses around \nthe world, and especially by the Chinese Government.\n  For too many years, Mr. President, these courageous individuals have \nbeen deprived of the opportunity to exercise the right to self-\ndetermination concerning fundamental human and political aspirations. I \nsay again, for too many years, they have been denied those rights.\n  Furthermore, it has been almost 3 years since the United States \nformally delinked American trade with China from its human rights \nperformance of abuse. I say to my colleagues that much has changed in \nChina, but it has not changed for the better. We now see a human rights \nsituation that is worse by every measure: persecution of Christians, \nforced abortions, sterilization of the mentally handicapped and \nkangaroo courts for democratic dissenters.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned with the mounting campaign of \nreligious persecutions waged by the rulers of China. The Roman Catholic \nChurch has effectively been made illegal in China. Priests, bishops, \nand people of faith have been imprisoned and harassed.\n  China's recent moves have menaced Hong Kong, in violation of their \nagreements with Britain and their assurances to the United States. \nForty percent of education and social services in that colony are \ncurrently run by church-related agencies. China's action in suspending \nthe Hong Kong Bill of Rights threatens the freedom of speech, the \nfreedom of assembly and the freedom of religion.\n  I believe that these arguments will come to a boil again in coming \nweeks, when this Congress votes once more on most-favored-nation status \nfor China. It is the obligation of the American Government to uphold \nthe principles of democracy and freedom for all peoples. We must not \nturn a blind eye to the oppressed in the interest of expanded trade \nopportunities. The idea that expanded trade would somehow result in \nimproved human rights conditions in China has been disproved. It simply \nhas not happened.\n  Today's statements calling for the immediate release of Wei Jingsheng \nheeds hope for those who are victims of oppression. I look forward to \nthe day when all peoples enjoy the countless freedoms that we have in \nthe United States. I salute the efforts of Wei Jingsheng, Mr. Harry Wu, \nDr. Nguyen Dan Que, and I urge my colleagues to stand up and voice \ntheir opposition to the treatment of these political dissenters and \nthese defenders of liberty and, furthermore, we should stand against \nall human rights abuses around the world.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak as in morning business for as long as necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to begin the debate on the \nissue of partial-birth abortion. This is an issue that, obviously, has \ngarnered a lot of attention over the past couple of years, both in the \nHouse and Senate and across the country. While the bill is not formally \nbefore us tonight, the bill will come up tomorrow. I have been informed \nthat it will come up approximately at noon tomorrow, when we can \nactually begin debate on the bill itself.\n  So the debate on partial-birth abortion will begin tomorrow in the \nU.S. Senate. For those who have been following this issue, the \nquestions that I have been asked, and Members are being asked on both \nsides of this issue, is not whether this bill will pass. I believe this \nbill will pass. The question is whether we are going to have sufficient \nvotes to override what appears to be an almost certain Presidential \nveto.\n  In the House a few weeks ago, the House passed the legislation with \n295 votes, more than the 290 needed to override the President's veto. \nWe only need 67 votes in the U.S. Senate to be able to override the \nPresident's veto.\n  At this point, I think by all accounts, we are not there yet. We are \nstill several votes short of the 67 votes committed publicly to \nsupporting this legislation on final passage and supporting it in the \nface of a Presidential veto.\n  I will say we are at least four or five votes short at this time, and \nwe are narrowing down the time here in which decisions have to be made.\n  So while I am not particularly optimistic of our opportunities at \nthis point to get the votes necessary to override the President's veto, \nI think this is an issue that is going to continue to percolate, not \nonly from the time that we debate in the Senate over the next few days, \nbut also after the vote is taken, during the time that the President is \nconsidering it, and when the bill comes back here. So there will be \nplenty of opportunities for further debate, further evaluation as to \nwhether the votes cast by all the Members are the votes that, in fact, \nwill be the votes on the override vote itself.\n  What I would like to do in starting the debate is to fill in for \nthose Members who may not have been involved in the partial-birth \nabortion debate--and we have a lot of new Members this year--to fill in \nthe who, what, when, where, why, how and how many. All of the questions \nthat normally would be asked about anything, let's ask them about the \nissue of partial-birth abortion.\n  This has been an interesting topic of discussion only because of the \nfabrications that have been built around what this procedure is about, \nwhen it is used, how often it is used, who it is used on, where it is \nused, how many there are. Those have been the subject of a lot of \npublications and debate about how the people who oppose this \nlegislation have constructed a fantasy, if you will, as to what this \nprocedure is all about.\n  So today, as I tried to in the previous debate, I am going to attempt \nto lay out the truth as we know it. I say as we know it, because a lot \nof the truth is based upon what the opponents of this legislation tell \nus is the truth. An example of that is how many of these abortions are \nperformed. The Centers for Disease Control do not track how many \npartial-birth abortions are done. They only track the abortions and \nwhen they are done. They do not track the procedure that is used to \nperform the abortion. The only people who track that, at least we are \ntold the only people who track that, are the abortion clinics \nthemselves who oppose this legislation vehemently. They are the ones \nthat those of us who have to argue for its passage have to rely upon \nfor the number of partial-birth abortions that are done. That is hardly \na comforting position when you have to rely on your opponent for the \ninformation that you are to use in challenging the procedure.\n  But let me, if I can, walk through first what is a partial-birth \nabortion. I caution those who may be listening, this is a graphic \ndescription of this procedure. I just want to alert anyone who might be \nwatching who might feel uncomfortable with that.\n  A partial-birth abortion is, first, an abortion that is used in the \nsecond and third trimester, principally in the second trimester. It is \nused at 20 weeks gestation and beyond by most practitioners of partial-\nbirth abortion. So, by definition, it is later term, you are into the \nfifth and sixth month of pregnancy.\n  The procedure is done over 3 days. You will hear comments by Members \nwho come to the floor of the Senate and suggest this procedure needs to \nremain legal to protect the life and the health of the mother. First, \nthere is a life-of-the-mother exception in the bill. Very clear. It \nsatisfies any definition of what life-of-the-mother exception needs to \nbe.\n  Second, health of the mother. I just question anyone, just on its \nface, not as a medical practitioner, which I am not, but on the face of \nit, if the health of the mother is in danger, particularly if there are \nserious health consequences, why would you do a procedure that takes 3 \ndays? That is what this procedure takes. It is a 3-day procedure. You \nhave a mother who is at 20 weeks, or more, gestation, who has to have \nher cervix dilated. In other words, they have to create the opening \nthrough which the baby can come in the womb, in the uterus. And so it \ntakes 2 days of drugs given to the mother. She does not stay at the \nhospital. It is not an inpatient procedure. She takes the drugs and \ngoes home. If there are complications they happen at home, not anywhere \nelse.\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\n  The cervix is dilated. When you dilate the cervix, that opens the \nwomb up to infection, but for a 2-day period, the cervix is dilated. On \nthe third day, after a third day of dilation, the mother comes into the \nabortion clinic. The procedure then proceeds as follows.\n  The doctor is guided by an ultrasound, and the abortionist reaches up \nwith forceps and grabs the baby, which is normally in a position head \ndown, grabs the baby by its foot, turns the baby around in the uterus, \nin the womb, and then pulls the baby out feet first in what is called a \nbreech position. You may have heard of breech birth and the danger of \nbirthing in a breech position. Here we have a doctor who deliberately \nturns the baby around and delivers it in a breech position.\n\n  You may want to ask the question, why do they go through the trouble \nof pulling the baby out feet first? Why do they not simply deliver the \nbaby head first and do what I will describe later? The reason they pull \nthe baby out feet first and deliver the baby, as the next chart will \nshow, all but the head--they deliver the baby out of the mother, with \nthe exception of the head.\n  Why do they leave the head? Why do they not take the head out first, \nwhich would be a normal delivery, a safer delivery? The reason they do \nnot deliver the head first is because once the head exits the mother, \nit has constitutional protection and it cannot be killed, because once \nthe head exits the mother, it is considered a live birth and you cannot \nkill the baby. So they take the baby out feet first so they can then \ntake a pair of scissors, puncture the back of the baby's skull to \ncreate a hole, open the scissors up to create a hole large enough for a \nsuctioning tube to be put in the baby's head, and the brains suctioned \nout, thereby completing the murder of this baby and then having the \nbaby delivered.\n  I just remind you the reason they do not do it head first is because \nif they did it head first, which would be safer than reaching in with \nforceps and grabbing the baby out from a breach position, if they did \nit head first, they could not do this, because once the baby is outside \nthe mother they could not kill the baby.\n  Who is this procedure used on? It is used on fully formed babies from \n20 weeks on. Now, we will discuss what has been said in the past about \nwho this has been used on. The abortion industry has made claims that \nthis procedure was a rare procedure that was just used--and I will read \nsome quotes--quoting from the Feminist Majority Foundation, ``A \nprocedure used less than 600 times a year, and in every case, to \nprotect the life or health of the woman.'' ``The procedure is used \nonly,'' according to the Feminist News, ``600 time a year to save the \nlife, health, or future fertility of the woman and in cases of severe \nfetal abnormality.'' Here is another feminist news article, ``used less \nthat 500 times a year when necessary to protect the health of the woman \nfacing severe problems due to the pregnancy.'' This is the National \nAbortion Federation factsheet on February 26, 1997: ``This particular \nprocedure is used in about 500 cases per year, generally after 20 weeks \nof pregnancy, and most often when there is severe fetal anomaly or a \nmaternal health problem detected late in pregnancy.''\n  The Alan Guttmacher Institute, as well as Planned Parenthood, the \nNational Organization for Women [NOW] Zero Population Growth Fund, \nPopulation Action International, and the National Abortion Federation \nsent a letter October 2, 1995, to the Congress that said, ``This \nsurgical procedure is used only in rare cases, fewer than 500 per year. \nIt is most often performed in the cases of wanted pregnancy gone \ntragically wrong, when a family learns late in pregnancy of severe \nfetal anomalies or a medical condition that threatens the pregnant \nwoman's life or health.''\n  Kate Michelman, President of NARAL, on June 2, 1996: ``These are rare \nterminations. They occur very rarely. They occur under the most \ndifficult of circumstances. As I said, these are pregnancies that have \ngone awry.''\n  Let me tell you what Members of the Congress said. From Pat \nSchroeder, ``There are very, very, very few of these procedures. These \nprocedures are heart-break procedures.'' Senator Kennedy, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, said, ``The procedure involved in this case is \nextremely rare. It involved tragic and traumatic circumstances late in \npregnancy, in cases where the mother's life or health is in danger.'' \nSenator Feingold, ``In fact, these abortions take place only when the \nlife or health of the mother is at risk.'' Senator Daschle, ``This is \nan emergency medical procedure reserved for cases where the life and \nhealth of the mother could be endangered or where severe fetal \nabnormalities are a major factor in the decision made by a woman and \nher physician.'' Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, ``Partial-birth abortion \nis a rare medical procedure used to terminate pregnancies late in the \nterm of when the life and health of the mother is at risk or when the \nfetus has severe abnormalities.''\n\n  That is what we were told over and over. That is what the media \nbought. That is exactly how they covered this issue. They covered this \nissue as a very tragic, rare procedure used only in cases of life, \nhealth, and fetal abnormality--in only a few hundred cases.\n  Now, we knew different. I argued it. Check the record from the last \ndebate, that this was not as rare as they suggested. In fact, I entered \ninto the Record an article written last fall by the Bergen County \nSunday Record in New Jersey, where a reporter who took the time to do \nsomething reporters usually do not do on debate, particularly when it \nhas to do with checking people in the abortion industry on their facts. \nShe actually checked the facts. This reporter checked at an abortion \nclinic in northern New Jersey how many of the procedures were \nperformed, and the reporter talked to two doctors, two abortionists, \nwho said that they performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions every year, \nand not on fatally defective babies or not on unhealthy mothers or \nunhealthy babies, but usually in the fifth and sixth month for no \nhealth reasons at all--healthy moms, healthy babies, healthy \npregnancies.\n  We had that article already printed. That did not deter the President \nfrom saying what he said. We have quotes from the President here. ``I \ncame to understand that this is a rarely used procedure, justifiable as \na last resort when doctors judge it is necessary to save a woman's life \nor to avert serious health consequences to her.''\n  Now, the President knew better when he said that. That information \nwas available to the President. It is available to him now. But what \nhappened between now and then that has caused such a stir? Well, I can \ntell you, unfortunately, the media has not done a very good job of \nexposing this. I do not know of any other reporters who made calls to \ntheir abortion clinics. They will not tell me or National Right-to-Life \nwhen they call, but they might. Sometimes they do not. I know of a \nreporter at the Baltimore Sun who tried to contact abortion clinics in \nBaltimore, and at least what she related to me was they would not talk \nto her, they would not tell her. I do not know of any reporters who \nhave taken the time to actually check the facts.\n  What are the facts as we know them now? Well, thanks to Ron \nFitzsimmons, who heads up an organization of abortion clinics--let me \nrepeat this, a man who runs an association here in the Washington \narea--that represents some 200 abortion clinics all over the country, \ncame out just a couple of months ago and said that he had lied through \nhis teeth and he could not live with it anymore. He had lied through \nhis teeth about what had been said by the abortion industry about the \nissue of partial-birth abortions. He said that this was not, in fact, a \nrare procedure, used only in the late term for unhealthy pregnancies \nand for maternal health reasons or because of a severe fetal \nabnormality, but this was a procedure used principally in the fifth and \nsixth month on healthy babies and healthy mothers. In fact, I think the \nfigure 90 percent was used. Then he said, ``We estimate the number of \nthese procedures that are done at between 3,000 and 5,000, not 500.'' \nHe said, ``We have known this all along.'' He said as soon as the bill \nwas introduced he called some of his providers, and he knew this from \nday one of this debate, of, now, I think, 2 or 3 years ago. Yet the \nindustry, knowing this, up until literally the day before, and in fact \non the Web page of some of the abortion rights groups, you still find \nclaims that this is a rare procedure used only in the cases of fetal \nabnormality. So they\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\ncontinue to try to perpetrate the lie, and they certainly did until Ron \nFitzsimmons blew the whistle.\n  So what do we know now? I am not too sure we know too much. We know \nfrom the Abortion Provider Organization that they are willing to admit \nto 3,000 to 5,000. There is no check on what that number is. It could \nbe 3,000 to 5,000, 5,000 to 10,000, 10,000 to 20,000, 20,000 to 30,000. \nThere is no independent verification of that number, and we have to \nrely on the organization that is here fighting this bill to give us the \ninformation which we want to fight over. So we know of at least 3,000 \nto 5,000, but we also know that in one abortion clinic alone 1,500 were \nperformed last year, and the doctors who were interviewed for that \nstory in the Bergen County Sunday Record said they had trained other \nabortion doctors in the New York area who also performed the procedure. \nThe other people who were known to perform the procedure and teach it \ndo not reside in the New York area. And we also have reports from a \ndoctor in Nebraska who said that he has performed 1,000 of these \nabortions.\n\n  So I just caution, as we begin the debate here, that we are debating \non some very soft ground when it comes to how many of these abortions \nare performed, when we make this claim that it is only a few thousand. \nMaybe I am making too much of the fact that it is a few thousand as \nopposed to a few hundred. I guess I make the point because it points \nout the inaccuracy of the opposition's information. Frankly, if it was \none, it is as much of a crime, in my mind, and I hope in most \nAmericans' minds. If we subject one baby unnecessarily to this \nbarbarism, is that not enough? Do we need 500? Do we need 1,000? Do we \nneed 3,000 to 5,000? Is that the threshold where Americans will look up \nand say maybe we should do something about it? One is not enough. It \ndoes not stir up moral outrage if it is only 1, 2, 200, or 500.\n  Why is this procedure used? As I said before, they suggested that \nthis procedure was used to protect the life and health of the mother. \nThat was the argument being used. As I said before, 90 percent of the \nabortions, according to the people who oppose this bill, 90 percent of \nthe abortions, are performed electively, for no reason other than the \nmother decides late in pregnancy that she does not want to carry the \nbaby.\n  The question is, is it ever medically necessary to use this? Because \nthat is the argument, that we need to keep this procedure legal because \nit is medically necessary to protect, as the amendment from the Senator \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, which we anticipate being offered, it \nis necessary to keep this procedure legal to protect the life and \nhealth of the mother. But we have the life-of-the-mother exception in \nthe bill. So we have taken care of the first issue. Although, as I said \nbefore, I cannot imagine--and I have asked on the floor this question, \nand I ask it again--any circumstance where a mother presents herself in \na life-threatening situation where you would then conduct a procedure \nthat takes 3 days in which to abort the child. Again, I am a lay person \nhere, not a physician. I have talked to physicians, and they say there \nis no such situation. But as a lay person, you don't have to be a \ndoctor to figure this one out. You are rushed and presented to a doctor \nwith a life-threatening situation and they say, let me give you \nmedicine and come back, and then give you medicine again and come back, \nand they give you more medicine and send you home. That isn't going to \nhappen. But to take care of those who have an objection, we put a life-\nof-the-mother exception in there.\n\n  Now they want a health-of-the-mother exception. Let's first look at \nwhether this would be used to protect the health of the mother. I have \ntalked to a lot of physicians, obstetricians who have stated very \nclearly to me that a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to \nprotect the life or health of a mother. That is a group of more than \n400 obstetricians, principally obstetricians and gynecologists, and \nsome other physicians, including C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States, who, prior to his fame as Surgeon \nGeneral, was a well-respected and well-known pediatric surgeon who \ndealt with children shortly after birth, trying to fix some of the \nproblems that they were born with. So we have clear medical judgment \nthat this procedure is never necessary to protect the health of the \nmother. In fact, they make the argument that it is contraindicated, \nthat it, in fact, threatens the health of the mother for a variety of \ndifferent reasons. So we have doctors who say that this is not \nnecessary to protect the health of the mother.\n  Now, I will ask--and I have asked Members on the other side of this \nissue--when would this procedure be used to protect the health of the \nmother? Remember, it is a 3-day procedure. I have talked to physicians \nwho say there are times when the life of the mother is in danger or the \nhealth of the mother is in danger and they need to separate the child \nfrom the mother. But in none of those cases is it necessary to \ndeliberately kill the baby. They can induce labor, deliver the child \nvaginally and give it a chance to live. They can do a Cesarean section \nand deliver the child that way and give the child a chance to live. At \nno time is an abortion necessary that kills the baby in order to \nprotect the health of the mother. And so why is it performed?\n  The answer is very simple. It was given by the person who designed \nthe procedure, who is not an obstetrician. He is a family practitioner \nwho does abortions. He designed this procedure, very candidly, because \nthis was a procedure that he could do on an outpatient basis. The woman \nwould present herself after 3 days of having her cervix dilated, and he \nwould be able to quickly do this procedure, so that he could do more in \none day. It is done for the convenience of the abortionist. That is \nwhy. It is not done to protect anybody's life or health. It is done to \nmake it easier on the abortionist. And it is used, again, on healthy \nmoms, healthy babies in the fifth and sixth month of pregnancy, in \nalmost all cases.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Where is this procedure done? Will you find this \nprocedure done in the finest hospitals in this country? Will you find \nit even described in a medical book? Will you find it taught at any \nschool in this country? The answer to all of those questions is ``no.'' \nThis is not taught anywhere. This has not been peer-reviewed anywhere. \nThis is not used in any major medical center. It is used in abortion \nclinics exclusively. No hospital will get near this procedure. It is \nnot a peer-reviewed procedure. It is not an accepted medical procedure. \nIt is not in any textbooks or in any kind of educational literature. It \nis a fringe procedure by someone who wanted to make it easy on \nthemselves to do more late-term abortions and do more of them in 1 day.\n\n  So that sort of sums up the who, what, when, why, where, and how many \nof this procedure. Now, why do we think it is important to outlaw this \nprocedure? Well, there are lots of reasons why I think we should outlaw \nthis procedure. No. 1, because it is a barbaric procedure. I hope that \nit would shock the consciousness of every Member of the Senate that we \nwould allow innocent human life to be treated in such a deplorable \nfashion, to be manhandled and destroyed, as we would not even allow a \ndog to be destroyed. So, on the surface of it, the obvious reason is \nthat this goes beyond the pale of what should be acceptable in our \nsociety. I can't imagine a Senator from the United States of America \nstanding on the floor of the U.S. Senate 30 years ago with these charts \nand having to argue--argue--that this should be illegal in our country. \nAbsolutely incomprehensible. Yet, 30 years later, as a result of Roe \nversus Wade, we have become so desensitized to the humanity of a baby \ninside the mother that we will allow this to occur--and defend it, \ndefend it, vehemently defend it as a right.\n  The abortion debate in this country since Roe versus Wade has focused \non the issue of rights, of choice. The reason I think the abortion \nindustry and abortion rights advocates are so upset about this debate \nis because, in a partial-birth abortion, you can't miss what is at \nstake here. This is not about a right. It is about a baby. You can't \nmiss the baby here. It is right here before your eyes. It is right \nthere where you can see it. It is outside of the mother and you can't \navoid it. That is why they just cringe when this bill\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\ncomes to the floor, because now we are talking about the dirty little \nsecret we have had in this country for a long, long time, that \nabortion--and I will use the words of Ron Fitzsimmons--``One of the \nfacts of abortion is that women enter abortion clinics to kill their \nfetuses. It is a form of killing. You're ending a life.'' Bravo for Mr. \nFitzsimmons for stating the obvious. But that is something that the \nabortion industry has steadfastly avoided. He is talking about what \nabortion really is. It is about ending a life. And in this case, you \ncan't miss the life. It is right here, right before your eyes, fully \nformed. The argument about just a blob of tissue or some protoplasm \ndoesn't hold up at this late stage of a pregnancy. This is a baby. It \nis a fully-formed little baby. In many cases, it's a viable little \nbaby.\n  I mentioned Roe versus Wade. There are some people who will argue \nthat this goes over the line, that this violates the provisions of Roe \nversus Wade. Let me address that issue very briefly and I will refer \nnot only to the committee report in the House, the House Judiciary \nCommittee report, but also the remarks made by my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, on this issue. It was one of the reasons \nhe supports the ban. When the baby is here in the mother's uterus, Roe \nversus Wade applies. Roe versus Wade says that, basically, for the \nfirst two trimesters, the woman has the right to do whatever she wants \nto do with that child in her womb. That is what Roe versus Wade says. \nThey said, in the third trimester--it is definitely implied if not \nstated--because of the fetus', the baby's, potential viability, the \nrights of the baby come into play and there are limitations on \nabortion.\n  Well, see, we have an interesting case here because this procedure \ntakes the baby outside. The baby is not only outside of the uterus, \nexcept for the head, but outside of the mother almost completely, and \nis in the process of being born. In fact, the baby is almost completely \nborn, hence the procedure's name, ``partial birth.'' So the baby is no \nlonger completely within the domain of the uterus and then ruled by Roe \nversus Wade. By leaving the uterus, the baby gains rights that it \ndidn't have inside.\n  As an aside, don't you find it an interesting irony that inside the \nmother's womb this little baby, surrounded by fluid and warmth, is the \nmost vulnerable to be killed and has no protection against someone who \nwants to kill it. Once it leaves what would be seen by the baby as a \nsafe environment, then it could be protected. But in the place where \nyou would think that the baby would be most secure is the one place \nwhere it is the most vulnerable to being killed, and only because this \nprocedure involves partial birth, only because the baby leaves the \nmother does Roe versus Wade not apply. And so those who argue that we \nbanned second-trimester abortions by banning this procedure--and we \nwould because most do take place in the second trimester--that we \nviolate Roe versus Wade, they don't understand Roe versus Wade. That \nchild is no longer in the uterus and that child, now that it is born \nand still alive, still feeling, able to feel pain, cannot be killed; or \nat least we can ban it under Roe versus Wade because it has rights. The \nbaby has rights.\n  So we very strongly believe that these spurious arguments that \nsomehow or another Roe versus Wade is being violated--by the way, there \nis nothing more I would rather see than Roe versus Wade being violated, \nbut it doesn't do it here. This procedure does not do it. This \nprocedure falls well within the constitutional boundaries of Roe versus \nWade and Doe versus Bolton.\n  Another issue that is being charged against this procedure--or it \ncomes out in favor of this procedure--is the issue of a fetal \nabnormality. I am going to have a lot to say about the issue of fetal \nabnormality. But let me just say this for now. We have had Members of \nthe U.S. Senate stand here in some of the finest hours of the U.S. \nSenate, and argue forcefully, gallantly, to protect the rights, the \nhealth, the safety, the security of disabled children. We passed the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act. We are debating ironically--the irony \nis not lost--IDEA, which has the rights of disabled children in our \ndiscussion today. That bill is actually the bill before us as I speak. \nYou will hear such passion. You should listen to some of the debate--\nthose of you who did not--the passion of the Senators defending the \nright for children with disabilities to have access to educational \nopportunities so they can maximize their human potential. Yet, \nunfortunately some of the most passionate speakers on that issue--turn \naround and passionately argue that because of their disability we \nshould be able to kill them before they are born.\n  Abraham Lincoln used a Biblical verse. ``A house divided against \nitself cannot stand.'' How can you with any kind of reflective \nconscience argue that the right to be so that children with \ndisabilities have the ability to maximize their human potential and the \nGovernment should be there to ensure that their rights are not trampled \nupon and then not be willing to give them the most precious of all \nrights, the right to live in the first instance? How can you be a \nchampion of the disabled when you will use fetal abnormality as an \nexcuse to kill them in the first place?\n  It is a shocking realism in this country that goes back to what I \nsuggested before, which is we have become so desensitized to human life \nto kill a little baby, that unseen, unborn child, that because it is \nunseen you can just put it out of your mind, it is not really seen. \nThat desensitization has consequences. We are seeing the consequence \nright now. We are debating this procedure. It is incredible to me that \nwe even have to debate this. But it is here because people just have \nforgotten what life is all about, and what life means.\n  We have across the street, at the Supreme Court, the issue of doctor-\nassisted suicide. We have had lower courts say that doctor-assisted \nsuicides are OK. We have massive organizations --I do not know how \nmassive--at least organized organizations that advocate for allowing \npeople to kill themselves and to have doctors help them. Again, I look \nback at 20 or 30 years ago and wonder whether that debate could have \noccurred at this time. But do not be surprised, particularly if this \nbill is unsuccessful, if we send the message out to the country that \nsays human life isn't really that valuable, that we can in fact \nbrutalize the most innocent children who have done nothing wrong to \nanybody.\n  It is amazing. You can describe this procedure. I saw a television \ncommercial put out by one of the groups who showed a prisoner shackled, \nboth arms and legs, walking down death row and being put in a chair. \nWhile he was walking and he was led to the chair, what if a voice \ndescribes the procedure, describes taking the scissors and puncturing \nthe base of the skull and sticking a vacuum tube in the base of the \nskull and suctioning the brain out? The courts would clearly find that \ncruel and unusual punishment and violative of the Constitution. But you \ncan do that to a little baby who hasn't killed anybody. It hasn't \nrobbed, raped, stolen, nor harmed a soul. And then we wonder what is \nhappening to our culture. We wonder, as we sit at home and we listen to \nthe news, and we listen and we read the papers, and we see the young \npeople out there, and we wonder. Why have they gone astray? What is \nhappened to the fabric of our culture? Why don't they have respect for \nour country, for people's goods, for other people's lives? Why, indeed? \nYou need to look only this far: 1.5 million abortions a year, as \npublic, and as customary, and as usual, and, as a matter of fact, as \nany number you will hear on the U.S. floor--1.5 million abortions.\n  OK, what is next? You will hear it discussed in the news: Abortion. \nIt is a matter of choice. It is someone else's decision. I do not want \nto get involved. It has nothing to do with me. Look around you. Things \nare coming to roost in this country. When you have such disdain for \nhuman life that we are seeing exemplified, magnified, by allowing this \nprocedure to go forward, by allowing this innocent little baby to be \nmutilated, butchered in such a way. People who vote for this to remain \nlegal have answered their own question as to why our culture is the way \nit is, because the great, great leaders of our country, the role \nmodels--that is what we are, whether we like it or not. Every Senator \nwho goes into a school--and I go into a lot of them--particularly young \nkids. I am sure the Presiding Officer now sees this as a new Member of \nthe Senate. Oh, they would love\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\nto have your autograph. They want to have your picture taken with them \nbecause you are someone to look up to. You are someone who has achieved \na level of excellence that we admire in this country. You are in a \nposition of authority. What you say and think matters. And they look up \nto us.\n\n  Is this what you want them to see? Is this what you want to teach the \nnext generation, that this kind of brutality is OK, and then you wonder \nwhy you see random acts of violence and you wonder why you see no \nrespect for human life? The consequences are real. They are here. We \ndon't have to speculate as to what the consequences of this are. They \nare here, and we are living with it.\n  All we want to do here is to take one little step in creating some \ndecency again, one meek little message for the people in this country \nthat life should be respected, that children should not be brutalized \nunnecessarily. That is what this procedure does.\n  You will hear arguments that this will not stop abortions. It may be \ntrue. I wish I could say this would stop hundreds and thousands of \nabortions. But I am not too sure that it will.\n  What I am sure of is that this brutality will stop and we will send a \nvery clear, positive message to Americans and to the world that this \nkind of barbarism has no place in American culture, certainly no place \nin the laws of our country.\n  So I hope that as Members come tomorrow and we begin the formal \ndebate on this bill that they will come with open minds and open \nhearts, that they will seek the truth. This debate has been surrounded \nby lies from those defending the procedure. Hopefully those admissions \nof lies will give people the opportunity to look anew at what the facts \nare, not just the facts of when this is used, but how it is used. I \nwent through all of those things--but what the ramifications are for \nthis country and for our society.\n  The abortionists are probably right. We are not going to stop a lot \nof abortions. There are other methods of abortion available if we \noutlaw this. Abortions unfortunately on babies this age will continue. \nBut we send a signal, as small as it is.\n  That is why I guess I am so shocked at the vehemence of the \nopposition, the opposition that says this will not stop abortions, the \nopposition that admits that this is rare and that this is a fringe \nprocedure. They admit it is not a commonly used procedure, that it is \nnot in the medical literature. They know all of that. Yet, they stand \nhere, backs to the wall, fighting for every last inch of not defendable \nterritory. Folks, this is not defendable territory.\n  We may not win this time. I don't know what God has planned for this \ndebate. But we may not win this time. That is OK. We will be back.\n  This is wrong. So when people in the U.S. Senate who believe \nsomething is wrong don't stand up and fight to overturn that wrong, we \nwill be in for very serious, even more serious, consequences for this \ncountry.\n  So I hope that my colleagues, enough of my colleagues, would share my \nconcern, would look at the new evidence. There are new facts that are \naccurate to the degree they can be accurate relying on the other side. \nThere are more accurate facts available now on this debate. There is \nample reason to reconsider this vote.\n  I hope that they would be led by both their hearts and their minds \nbecause on both scores we win. There is no medical reason for this \nprocedure to occur. You will not find any physician anywhere describing \nany condition where this procedure is necessary and is the only one \navailable to be used for whatever situation. In fact, as I said before \nand I will say over and over again, this is a 3-day procedure. Why \nwould it ever be used in a life-threatening situation when there is \nimminent health damage? It would not be used. We have hundreds of \nphysicians who have testified via letters that this procedure is never \nmedically indicated.\n  So on the facts, on the medical facts, using their brain only, this \nis not only unnecessary, unwarranted, but unhealthy.\n  I will share one other statistic from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, \none of the signatories of the letter I referred to earlier with NOW and \nNARAL. This is an organization which is very much proabortion. This is \na very, very radical group. And here is what their numbers say. After \n20 weeks gestation, after roughly 4 and a half months, abortion is \ntwice as dangerous to maternal health as delivering a baby. So to even \nsuggest that abortion is necessary in cases of whatever, fetal \nabnormality or just because you do not want to have the child, that \nthat is safer for the mother than delivering the baby either via \nCesarean section or by vaginal delivery, the pro-choice institute, Alan \nGuttmacher Institute, says that it is twice as dangerous to the life of \nthe mother to have an abortion after 20 weeks as it is to deliver the \nbaby.\n  So if you are really wrapped up on this issue of health, abortions \nare more dangerous than delivering the baby. There is no health reason \nto do this procedure. In fact, because it is a blind procedure--the \nabortionist cannot see the base of the skull, and so they have to \nfeel--as you see, they have to feel with their hands and then take a \nblunt instrument and puncture the base of the skull, which can cause \nbone fragments. This is a very blood-rich area, a lot of veins exposed. \nThere can be damage done by doing this blind procedure. This is not a \nprocedure that protects the health of the mother.\n  So using your brain, looking at the facts, this is a no. We should \nnot allow this. This is dangerous. This is wrong. And I would think--I \ncannot speak to the heart, but I would think that your heart and that \nyour conscience and the reason that so many Members have struggled so \nhard with this--and I know they have, people who I know believe deeply \nin this right of privacy and the right to abortion as enumerated in Roe \nversus Wade, that they have made their moral judgment that this is OK, \nbut even to those Members this stirs a disquiet. This stirs some \nuncomfortableness in them. Follow your heart. Your brain is there. If \nyou look at the facts, the brain is going to be there. The only thing \nstopping you is your heart. Open your heart to these babies. Do not let \nthis kind of barbarism continue. Stop the murder, stop the infanticide, \nand you will not be violating Roe versus Wade, not one word of it.\n  So as we start this debate tomorrow, I intend to debate the facts. I \nintend to stand up and go through all of the arguments not only on this \nprocedure but on Senator Daschle's amendment, Senator Boxer's \namendment, and talk about why those two amendments, particularly the \nDaschle amendment, I might add, not only is a sham in the sense it is \njust political cover, which is exactly what it is, it does not \naccomplish anything. The Daschle amendment which we will debate, I am \nsure, tomorrow will not stop one partial birth abortion, not one. The \nDaschle amendment will not stop any abortion. In fact, I will argue \ntomorrow, and I think I can point out clearly from the language of the \ntext, the Daschle amendment expands Roe versus Wade. Yes, this \namendment which is supposed to be a compromise--interesting we use the \nterm ``compromise'' when the Democratic leader never talked to anybody \non our side of the issue. You would think when you are trying to \ncompromise with someone you would talk to the other side in reaching a \ncompromise.\n  That did not happen. I did not receive one phone call or even the \nhint of a phone call. No one else that I know of who supports the \nbill--of the 42 cosponsors of the bill, it is my understanding none of \nthem received a phone call. And so this compromise, which was drafted \nby people who oppose this bill to give political cover by saying things \nlike, well, we are going to ban all postviability abortion, then leaves \nit to the abortionist to decide what is viable and what is a health \nexception because they have a health exception--we will ban all \npostviability abortions except for life and health. Who determines \nhealth? The person performing the abortion.\n\n  Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You have someone performing \nan abortion. They are doing it. They are performing an abortion on a \nclient. They are killing a baby. After they finish killing the baby, \nthen they have to certify whether this baby was either viable or there \nwas an exception for the life or health of the mother.\n  Put yourself in the position of the abortionist. Are you going to say \nthe baby was viable and I killed it? There\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\nwas no health exception and I went ahead and killed the baby. Raise \nyour hands. How many people think that the abortionist is going to \nclaim that they violated the law? Because they are the only ones who \ncertify to it. No one else can. Many times I have seen in the paper \nthis debate has been analogized to the debate on the second amendment, \nthe right to bear arms.\n  Let me give you this analogy. It is like passing a piece of \nlegislation on assault weapons. That was a very popular topic. It is \nlike passing a piece of legislation on assault weapons and saying that \nthe gun dealer will define what an assault weapon is for purposes of \nwhether they break the law.\n  That is exactly what this bill does. It allows the doctor to define \nwhat the law is, in other words, what the exceptions to the law are, \nand no mentally competent abortionist who has just aborted a baby is \ngoing to claim they broke the law, just like no mentally competent arms \ndealer is going to sell a howitzer and say it is an assault weapon. \nThey are not going to say it is an assault weapon. I broke the law. You \nlet me certify it. A howitzer is not an assault weapon. And under the \nDaschle bill, if we could apply it to guns, the arms dealer is OK. Wait \na minute. We have the certification here. No problem. He certified it \nis not a howitzer. He said it is not an assault weapon. He said it is \nsomething else.\n  Again, just remember the people offering this amendment have a 100 \npercent voting record against pro-life issues. They have vehemently \nopposed this bill from day one. You can always tell the validity of \nthis kind of legislation by who supports and who opposes.\n  Now, you would think that an industry--and that is what abortion, \nunfortunately, has turned into with 1.5 million a year. It is an \nindustry. You would think that an industry that has gone to tremendous \nlengths and expense to oppose a ban on a procedure which they admit is \ninfrequent, that does not happen very often, that is only an \nalternative and others could be done in place of it, that they argue is \nnot going to stop one abortion, that they would fight vehemently \nagainst this that will not, in their own words, stop one abortion, they \nargue against this, yet they support Senator Daschle's proposed \namendment.\n  Now, wait a minute. If Senator Daschle's proposal actually stopped \nabortion, do you think they would support it? I think you can answer \nthat for yourself. The people who oppose it are people like myself who \nunderstand what it is. It is a sham. The proposal does nothing except \none potentially very dangerous thing. By giving the abortionist the \nright to determine what health and viability is, you expand Roe versus \nWade because under Roe versus Wade at least third-trimester babies are \nsomewhat protected. Under the Daschle proposal, there is no protection, \nnone. It is whatever the abortionist wants to do and the mother agrees \nto do at any time. Oh, you can probably string the viability issue \nalong to 35 or 36 weeks and you probably have to admit that after 35 \nweeks that baby is viable. But the health, there is all sorts of health \nthings that can go on even at that late time.\n\n  So I would just caution my colleagues who are considering this \nlegislation that this is a real change in the law. This will have an \nimpact on stopping a procedure that has no place in American society. \nThe Daschle proposal not only does not change the face as far as the \nexisting rights of abortionists and abortion, I have argued and will \ncontinue to argue that it expands the right to abortion. Anyone voting \nfor the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota will vote to strike \nthis procedure--in other words, vote against this procedure because his \namendment which will be offered tomorrow strikes this procedure from \nthe bill. In other words, cuts it, amends it out and replaces it, \nsubstitutes it with his phony ban which not only does not ban anything \nbut expands the right to an abortion.\n  So I would just caution Members when they vote on Senator Daschle's \namendment that they are doing two things, one of which they will admit \nthey are doing. They are getting rid of this legislation. That is No. \n1. So they will be voting against this procedure being banned. And No. \n2, they will be expanding the rights of abortionists and abortion \nbeyond what Roe versus Wade currently does by allowing the abortionist \nto have complete authority over what is a health exception, what is \nviability.\n  So, this is really a very clear debate, and we will commence tomorrow \nin formality between those who want to at least take a procedure and \nsay this goes too far, that the right to an abortion is not so absolute \nas to allow this kind of barbarism to occur, and others who believe \nthat Roe versus Wade did not go far enough. In spite of all the \nrhetoric we will hear tomorrow, the bottom line, with the amendment of \nthe Senator from South Dakota, is that he will be arguing in fact--not \nby his words, because I am sure he will not agree with that--but in \nfact--read the language, his amendment will loudly say that Roe versus \nWade is not broad enough, that we need more access to abortion than we \nhave today.\n  I think, of anything that I have learned in dealing with this issue, \nparticularly when it comes to children who are in utero, with \ndisabilities, that the issue is not the ability to get an abortion in \nthis country. If you have a child with a disability, and it is \ndiagnosed in utero, I guarantee not only will the abortion option be \nmade available to you, because they are legally required to do that, \nbut if they see a badly deformed baby, they will do everything, most of \nthe physicians, most genetic counselors, will do everything to \nencourage you to have an abortion.\n  I will talk about one such instance tomorrow. For those Members I \nspoke about earlier who can come to terms with this debate on the \nintellectual level and have trouble crossing the threshold of the \nheart, I will put a face on partial-birth abortion. It will put a face \non what is going on out in our country, with doctors who are so afraid \nof malpractice, so afraid of difficult and complicated deliveries that \nthey choose the easy way out. ``Let's get her to abort the baby now so \nwe don't have to deal with this.''\n  Many of you are thinking, ``Oh, I can't believe that.'' Believe it. \nBelieve it. It happens every day. You do not see any wrongful death \nsuits, do you, against abortionists for terminating a pregnancy? I am \nnot aware of any. But you will see wrongful birth suits for children \nborn, and their parents, incredibly, believe that their child was \nbetter off dead than born.\n  So, for doctors, as normal human beings, risk averse, it is easier to \nabort. You can't get sued when you abort. They sign all these waivers \nand consents. We will be fine. But they can sue us if we do not do \neverything we can to get them to abort beforehand and we have a \ncomplicated delivery and things happen, or the baby is deformed and we \ndid not explain maybe well enough how deformed the baby was.\n  I would argue it is easier to get an abortion in this country when \nyou are carrying a child with a fetal abnormality than it is to find a \ndoctor who will deliver it. I will tell you a story tomorrow of exactly \nthat case. I am sure there are other cases out there. In fact, I know \nthere are other cases out there.\n  It goes back to the point I was making. Not only do we as a society, \nbut unfortunately the people who are most responsible for delivering \nour children become so callous, many of them--not all of them. \nCertainly not all of them. I hope most would understand the \nsignificance of a human life and protect it and honor it and dignify \nit. But, sadly, that is not the case in far too many instances with the \nprofessionals in the field of genetics counseling.\n  My father-in-law, Dr. Kenneth Garver, went into genetic counseling \nwhen he was a pediatrician in Penn Hills, PA. He decided to go into \ngenetic counseling and medical genetics. I know one of the reasons that \ndrove him to do so was not only the fascinating developments in medical \ngenetics, which were certainly a lure to someone as bright as he and as \ninterested as he was in the subject, but a fear, that has been borne \nout to be a legitimate fear, that the people who have been drawn to \nthat field are people who do not believe that that baby has a right to \nlife, who very much believe in abortion and counsel for it and, in far \ntoo many cases, encourage it. It is a field that he got into because he \nwanted at least someone--someone--where men and women who are going \nthrough a difficult pregnancy could come and not be browbeaten into \nhaving an abortion.\n\n  You say, ``Oh, Senator, you are being extreme here.'' I will tell you \nthe story\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\nof little Donna Joy Watts and you tell me how extreme I am. And I will \ntell the stories of people who have written to me and talked to me and \ncalled me and e-mailed me about situation after situation where those \nsame set of facts have come forward. What have we come to when we \nencourage people who desperately want to hold onto their children that \nthis is the only way?\n  Some will say it is by ignorance. I suggest in many cases it is \nignorance, but in many cases it is ignorance of convenience that a lot \nof these physicians would just rather not have to deal with the \nsituation. So the first knee-jerk reaction is, ``Well, the baby is not \ngoing to live long. Abort it.'' Or, ``The baby is going to have all \nsorts of complications. Abort it.''\n  All we are trying to do here is to say stop the infanticide. That is \nthe term used by the Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, and I \nbelieve the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter--both of whom \nare generally on the opposite side of the issue on the issue of \nabortion. But they recognize that when a baby is outside the mother's \nwomb and, as nurse Brenda Shafer said, moving its arms and legs, in the \ncase that she described, the partial-birth abortion she described, the \nbaby had the face of an angel. It was a perfectly healthy, normal baby.\n  It thought--and yes, thought, because babies have brains; they are \nhuman beings--thought as it was leaving this environment that was so \nwarm and protected, little did it know that it would meet with this \nkind of brutality. Folks, it's not just once, or twice, or 10, or 20, \nor 100, or 500--thousands. Untold thousands.\n  I am hopeful that, as a result of all the things that were discussed \nfor the past several months as a result of the statements by Ron \nFitzsimmons, Members of this Senate will look again, look at this \nprocedure, look at the consequences, real consequences of what the U.S. \nSenate and the Government of the United States will convey to the young \npeople of our country, to any person in our country, that we will allow \nthese innocent babies to be murdered like this.\n  If we send that kind of message, I guarantee I will be down here when \none of the Senators who did not support this stands up and beats his \nbreast, complaining about why the crime rate is so high, why there is \nno respect for property, why there is no respect for life, why there is \nno respect for--you name it.\n  Kids aren't dumb. They pay attention. I have a 6-year-old and a 4-\nyear-old and a 1-year-old. It frightens me how much they pay attention \nto everything you do, whether you know it or not. They pick up so much.\n  You see yourself. You know. You see yourself in your kids so much you \njust don't even realize all the little things that you do that they \nsee. They will see this. They will understand what this means. They \nwill understand that life is not important, that, unless you are big, \nstrong, healthy, able to protect yourself, there is no protection. It \nis survival of the fittest. We wonder why we have a cynical generation \nX; everyone believes they are out for themselves, that everyone does \nthings in their own self-interest. What could be more in self-interest \nthan this? What can be more selfish than this? What kind of message are \nwe conveying? This is ultimate selfishness. It was not convenient. I \nwas not ready. I--I--I--I.\n  This is a baby. It is not ``I,'' it is ``we.'' But we have told the \nmessage to the young people, only ``I'' matters. Then we wonder why \nthey feel the way they do. We wonder why they act the way they do. We \nwonder what has happened to our culture, what has happened to our \nsociety. You need only look this far. You need only look at the \nselfishness, the individual self-centeredness of this procedure. A \nprocedure we would not do on Jeffrey Dahmer, a procedure we would not \ndo on the worst criminal in America, we will do on a healthy little \nbaby.\n  I hope the Senate says no. I hope the Senate can just muster the \nmoral courage to say no and live up to the dignity of this place. It is \nan impressive place. Great men and great women have stood in this hall \nand fought for noble causes. I cannot think of any more noble a cause \nthan protecting a helpless, beautiful--whether deformed or not, in the \neyes of God, beautiful baby.\n  I ask everyone within the sound of my voice to pray that that \nhappens, that the Senate says no more, this is where we begin to draw \nthe line. I ask you not only to contact your Senators by e-mail or \nwrite or call or drop by their offices, I ask you to pray that somehow \ntheir eyes will open to what the consequences of our actions are, what \nit means to us as a society, as a culture. What the reporters are \nwriting today is this bill will fall short of the 67 votes needed to \noverride the President's veto. If you do, those things I have asked, \nwho knows?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4383-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATIONS TO FATHER THOMAS J.

Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to draw the \nattention of my distinguished colleagues\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\nto a very special event which will take place in Atlanta this coming \nSunday, May 18--the Fifth Annual Lauren's Run.\n  Lauren's Run is a fantastic kids-only fun run which is held every \nyear at Zoo Atlanta. The purpose of the event is to raise funds for the \nLauren Zagoria Pediatric Cancer Research Fellowship at City of Hope \nNational Medical Center in Duarte, CA. The fellowship assists in the \nfight against pediatric cancer in all its forms through advanced \nresearch and clinical treatments at City of Hope, an institution \nrenowned for the compassionate care it brings to children suffering \nfrom life-threatening diseases.\n  Mr. President, all of us in this body have undoubtedly devoted \nourselves at one time or another to worthy causes and humanitarian \nendeavors. But in my opinion, Lauren's Run is a truly special cause, \nand this is so for two reasons.\n  First, because it honors a very special and beautiful little girl \nnamed Lauren Zagoria who was diagnosed when she was only 21 months old \nwith neuroblastoma, a rare and fatal form of pediatric cancer. Lauren's \nparents, Janis and Marvin Zagoria, watched as their precious daughter \nwas transformed not only by the ravages of the disease, but also by the \nordeal of radiation treatments, bone marrow biopsies, and surgery. As \nJanis and Marvin have written about Laura, ``She never complained; she \nnever quit; she never stopped loving or trusting those who cared for \nher. After 14 months of struggling, the disease was just too big for \none little girl.''\n  Lauren's Run was borne of that child's tragic and painful struggle. \nDetermined to honor Lauren's life and to sustain her legacy, Janis and \nMarvin Zagoria began to lay the groundwork for the children's run just \n2 months after her death in March 1992. The first Lauren's Run was held \nin 1993.\n  I will have the honor of attending the Fifth Annual Lauren's Run on \nMay 18, and I will be presenting an American Hero award to Janis and \nMarvin Zagoria on that occasion. They are truly two wonderful points of \nlight--people who inspire others in their community to do what is right \non behalf of those in need.\n  Mr. President, the other reason that I believe Lauren's Run is a \nspecial cause is because little Lauren Zagoria could have been any \nchild in America today. We owe it to Lauren and to all the children we \nknow and love to do everything in our power to eradicate the scourge of \npediatric cancer. At City of Hope, pioneering work is underway to \nincrease the long-term survival rate of children suffering from such \nillnesses. There is hope indeed that one day we may overcome the \ntragedy of pediatric cancer--provided that we open our hearts and, yes, \nour pocketbooks to enable research to discover the cures which are \nsurely within reach.\n  Mr. President, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring the \nmemory of Lauren Zagoria and the work of two great Americans, Janis and \nMarvin Zagoria. And I ask that this body recognize the special \nsignificance and importance of the Fifth Annual Lauren's Run on May 18 \nin Atlanta.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4389-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last year Massachusetts was ranked 48th \nin the Nation in networked classrooms. Only 30 percent--700 out of our \nmore than 2,400 schools--had adequate computer technology and wiring. \nIn a State with such a critical mass of knowledge-based industries \nrequiring a highly-trained, highly skilled work force, this was \nunacceptable.\n  So in May 1996, we created the MassNetworks Educational Partnership \nas a nonprofit collaborative effort to assist our schools in becoming \nwired to the Internet, and to coordinate what are now called NetDays \nnot only in Massachusetts but all across the country.\n  We began this effort, to be sure, with an advantage over most other \nStates. Our information technology industries have grown rapidly in \nrecent years. We enjoy strong labor unions and highly dedicated \nteachers, principals and superintendents, which have combined their \nexpertise to allow us to accomplish much in a brief amount of time.\n  For our two State NetDays since last May, we have had more than \n14,000 volunteers help wire over 800 additional schools in \nMassachusetts. These volunteers, aided by 15 million dollars' worth of \ndonated and discounted goods, services, and technical support, already \nhave had an enormous impact on the future of Massachusetts. We have \ntruly become a model to the Nation.\n  However, this effort is not limited to these two NetDays, and we are \nfar from finished. All across the State, parents, children, educators, \nlabor leaders, businesspeople, public servants, and others who care so \ndeeply about education will be continuing to work together to wire more \nschools, train more teachers and install more hardware throughout the \nrest of the school year and summer.\n  The investment we are making will continue to pay off in better \nresults in our schools--students with sharper skills, improved grades, \nlower absenteeism, improved grades, reduced drop-out rates, and \nimproved standards of living when they enter the work force. Studies \nshow that in the year 2000, 70 percent all new jobs will require the \ntype of high-technology skills that only 20 percent of our work force \ncurrently possess. If we are to succeed in our endeavor, we must \nprepare our children with the knowledge they need to be competitive in \nthe next century.\n  Toward that end, I will work to help Massachusetts be the first State \nin the Nation to meet President Clinton's goal of wiring all of \nAmerica's schools to the Internet by the year 2000.\n  The Internet is the ticket to the information superhighway. The \neffort taking place in Massachusetts is putting this incredible \nresource within reach of all students. I strongly commend all those \ninvolved.\n  Education is one of the best investments we can make in the future of \nthis State, and wiring students to the Internet is one of the wisest \nforms our investment can take. The Internet is the blackboard of the \n21st century, and we should be prepared to use it to the fullest of our \ncapability. The Internet is the newest world of information, and the \nnewest frontier to conquer. Much like the shot heard around the world, \nour dedication to our students must be heard all over the globe.\n  Ultimately, the strength of this effort comes not from computers and \nwire, but from our ability to help schools teach and help students \nlearn in new ways. I am confident that we will make the most of the \ntremendous opportunity that is at hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4390-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4390-S4391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FAMILY CHILD CARE APPRECIATION DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President last Friday, May 9, was ``Family Child Care \nProvider Appreciation Day'' in Utah and perhaps in other States as \nwell. It is fitting to pay tribute to family-based child care providers \nwho are an essential component of our child care system, both in Utah \nand throughout the United States.\n  Family Child Care Providers are self-employed business people caring \nfor up to six children at a time in their own homes for as much as 50 \nhours per\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\nweek. Utah has over 2,000 family child care homes which service about \nhalf of the children in child care. Currently, it is estimated that 65 \npercent of mothers with children under 5 work outside the home, so the \nneed certainly exists for a variety of child care options. Child care \nprovided in individual family homes is one such option.\n  Some parents for a variety of reasons prefer home environments for \ntheir children. Debbie, a child care provider in West Valley City, UT, \nwatched a 2-year-old who was on a feeding tube. It is often very \ndifficult to find care for sick or disabled children; but, in the \nflexible setting of her home, Debbie was able to provide the personal \nattention and care needed, making this particular child's experience as \npositive as possible.\n  Vicki is a family child care provider in Cedar City, UT. She has \nprovided help for parents who are trying to rebuild their lives. In one \ncase, she provided care for a little girl while her father was in jail \nand her mother was working, but not earning a lot. Vicki says this \nfamily is doing better now. The father is out of jail and holding down \na job. Vicki is still caring for their son while his mother works. \nVicki says she likes to help families to get off of welfare and to \nbuild a better future.\n\n  Family child care providers help families like these to achieve the \nAmerican Dream. Family child care not only helps parents in the work \nforce with peace of mind, but it also provides a supplemental income \nfor mothers who want to be home with their own children.\n  But do not confuse family child care providers with babysitters. \nFamily care providers in Utah follow the highest of standards; they \nrenew their licences every year by taking 12 credit hours of classes \nand updating certification in both CPR and first aid on a yearly basis. \nUtah has over 2,000 family child care homes which service about half of \nthe children in child care. These statistics as well as the level of \nprofessionalism in which family child care providers operate is very \nimportant when it comes to quality care for our children.\n  The future of our country depends on the quality of the early \nchildhood experiences provided to young children today.

This report is submitted pursuant to \nsection 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1703(c) (IEEPA). This report covers events through March 31, \n1997. My last report, dated November 14, 1996, covered events through \nSeptember 16, 1996.\n  1. The Iranian Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 535 (IACR), \nwere amended on October 21, 1996 (61 Fed. Reg. 54936, October 23, \n1996), to implement section 4 of the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation \nAdjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement \nAct of 1996, by adjusting for inflation the amount of the civil \nmonetary penalties that may be assessed under the Regulations. The \namendment increases the maximum civil monetary penalty provided in the \nRegulations from $10,000 to $11,000 per violation.\n  The amended Regulations also reflect an amendment to 18 U.S.C. 1001 \ncontained in section 330016(1)(L) of Public Law 103-322, September 13, \n1994, 108 Stat. 2147. Finally, the amendment notes the availability of \nhigher criminal fines for violations of IEEPA pursuant to the formulas \nset forth in 18 U.S.C. 3571. A copy of the amendment is attached.\n  2. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the ``Tribunal''), \nestablished at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers Accords, continues to \nmake progress in arbitrating the claims before it. Since the period \ncovered in my last report, the Tribunal has rendered eight awards. This \nbrings the total number of awards rendered to 579, the majority of \nwhich have been in favor of U.S. claimants. As of March 24, 1997, the \nvalue of awards to successful U.S. claimants from the Security Account \nheld by the NV Settlement Bank was $2,424,959,689.37.\n  Since my last report, Iran has failed to replenish the Security \nAccount established by the Algiers Accords to ensure payment of awards \nto successful U.S. claimants. Thus, since November 5, 1992, the \nSecurity Account has continuously remained below the $500 million \nbalance required by the Algiers Accords. As of March 24, 1997, the \ntotal amount in the Security Account was $183,818,133.20, and the total \namount in the Interest Account was $12,053,880.39. Therefore, the \nUnited States continues to pursue Case A/28, filed in September 1993, \nto require Iran to meet its obligation under the Algiers Accords to \nreplenish the Security Account. Iran filed its Rejoinder on April 8, \n1997.\n  The United States also continues to pursue Case A/29 to require Iran \nto meets its obligation of timely payment of its equal share of \nadvances for Tribunal expenses when directed to do so by the Tribunal. \nThe United States filed its Reply to the Iranian Statement of Defense \non October 11, 1996.\n  Also since my last report, the United States appointed Richard Mosk \nas one of the three U.S. arbitrators on the Tribunal. Judge Mosk, who \nhas previously served on the Tribunal and will be joining the Tribunal \nofficially in May of this year, will replace Judge Richard Allison, who \nhas served on the Tribunal since 1988.\n  3. The Department of State continues to pursue other United States \nGovernment claims against Iran and to respond to claims brought against \nthe United States by Iran, in coordination with concerned government \nagencies.\n  On December 3, 1996, the Tribunal issued its award in Case B/36, the \nU.S. claim for amounts due from Iran under two World War II military \nsurplus property sales agreements. While the Tribunal dismissed the \nU.S. claim as to one of the agreements on jurisdictional grounds, it \nfound Iran liable for breach of the second (and larger) agreement and \nordered Iran to pay the United States principal and interest in the \namount of $43,843,826.89. Following payment of the award, Iran \nrequested the Tribunal to reconsider both the merits of the case and \nthe calculation of interest; Iran's request was denied by the Tribunal \non March 17, 1997.\n  Under the February 22, 1996, agreement that settled the Iran Air case \nbefore the International Court of Justice and Iran's bank-related \nclaims against the United States before the Tribunal (reported in my \nreport of May 17, 1996), the United States agreed to make ex gratia \npayments to the families of Iranian victims of the 1988 Iran Air 655 \nshootdown and a fund was established to pay Iranian bank debt owed to \nU.S. nationals. As of March 17, 1997, payments were authorized to be \nmade to surviving family members of 125 Iranian victims of the aerial \nincident, totaling $29,100,000.00. In addition, payment of 28 claims by \nU.S. nationals against Iranian banks, totaling $9,002,738.45 was \nauthorized.\n  On December 12, 1996, the Department of State filed the U.S. Hearing \nMemorial and Evidence on Liability in Case A/11. In this case, Iran \nalleges that the United States failed to perform its obligations under \nParagraphs 12-14 of the Algiers Accords, relating to the return to Iran \nof assets of the late Shah and his close relatives. A hearing date has \nyet to be scheduled.\n  On October 9, 1996, the Tribunal dismissed Case B/58, Iran's claim \nfor damages arising out of the U.S. operation of Iran's southern \nrailways during the Second World War. The Tribunal held that it lacked \njurisdiction over the claim under Article II, paragraph two, of the \nClaims Settlement Declaration.\n  4. Since my last report, the Tribunal conducted two hearings and \nissued\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\nawards in six private claims. On February 24-25, 1997, Chamber One held \na hearing in a dual national claim, G.E. Davidson v. The Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, Claim No. 457. The claimant is requesting \ncompensation for real property that he claims was expropriated by the \nGovernment of Iran. On October 24, 1996, Chamber Two held a hearing in \nCase 274, Monemi v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, also concerning the \nclaim of a dual national.\n\n  On December 2, 1996, Chamber Three issued a decision in Johangir & \nJila Mohtadi v. the Islamic Republic of Iran (AWD 573-271-3), awarding \nthe claimants $510,000 plus interest for Iran's interference with the \nclaimants' property rights in real property in Velenjak. The claimants \nalso were awarded $15,000 in costs. On December 10, 1996, Chamber Three \nissued a decision in Reza Nemazee v. The Islamic Republic of Iran  (AWD \n575-4-3), dismissing the expropriation claim for lack of proof. On \nFebruary 25, 1997, Chamber Three issued a decision in Dadras Int'l v. \nThe Islamic Republic of Iran (AWD 578-214-3), dismissing the claim \nagainst Kan Residential Corp. for failure to prove that it is an \n``agency, instrumentality, or entity controlled by the Government of \nIran'' and dismissing the claim against Iran for failure to prove \nexpropriation or other measures affecting property rights. Dadras had \npreviously received a substantial recovery pursuant to a partial award. \nOn March 26, 1997, Chamber Two issued a final award in Case 389, \nWestinghouse Electric Corp. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force \n(AWD 579-389-2), awarding Westinghouse $2,553,930.25 plus interest in \ndamages arising from the Iranian Air Force's breach of contract with \nWestinghouse.\n  Finally, there were two settlements of claims of dual nationals, \nwhich resulted in awards on agreed terms. They are Dora Elghanayan, et \nal. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran (AAT 576-800/801/802/803/804-3), in \nwhich Iran agreed to pay the claimants $3,150,000, and Lilly Mythra \nFallah Lawrence v. The Islamic Republic of Iran (AAT 577-390/381-1), in \nwhich Iran agreed to pay the claimant $1,000,000.\n  5. The situation reviewed above continues to implicate important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents an unusual challenge to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. The Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 12170 continue to play \nan important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in \nenabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords. I \nshall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these \nproblems and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on \nsignificant developments.\n\n                                             William J.

A bill to convey real property within the Carlsbad project in \nNew Mexico to the Carlsbad Irrigation District; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the carlsbad irrigation project acquired land transfer act\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that will convey tracts of land, referred to as ``acquired \nlands,'' to the Carlsbad Irrigation District in New Mexico. These are \nlands that were once owned by the beneficiaries of the irrigation \nproject, and acquired by the Federal Government when the Bureau of \nReclamation assumed the responsibility of construction and operation of \nthe irrigation project in the early part of this century. Since that \ntime, the Carlsbad Irrigation District has repaid its indebtedness to \nthe Federal Government, which included not only its contractual share \nof construction costs, but also all costs associated with the project \nland and facilities that were acquired from the project beneficiaries.\n  This legislation is specific to the Carlsbad project in New Mexico, \nand directs the Carlsbad Irrigation District to continue to manage the \nlands as they have been in the past, for the purposes for which the \nproject was constructed. It will accomplish three things: First, convey \ntitle to acquired lands and facilities to the District; second, allow \nthe District to assume the management of leases and the benefits of the \nreceipts from these acquired lands; and third, provide authority for \nthe Bureau of Reclamation to cooperate with the Carlsbad Irrigation \nDistrict on water conservation projects at the Carlsbad project. This \nbill protects the interests that the State of New Mexico has in some of \nthose lands.\n  During the 104th Congress, the Carlsbad Irrigation District presented \ntestimony related to the transfer of acquired lands before the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources on one occasion, and before \nthe House Committee on Resources on two occasions. Additionally, the \nadministration expressed on several occasions before these two \ncommittees that they want to move forward with acquired land transfers \nwhere they make sense. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, \nEluid Martinez, has informed the district and me that he believes that \nthe Carlsbad project is one of several projects where the Bureau would \nlike to pursue transfer opportunities. With this in mind, I believe \nthat the legislation I am introducing today will provide the Bureau \nwith the ability to accomplish their stated goal in a fair and \nequitable manner.\n  Mr. President, I understand that similar legislation will soon be \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Joe Skeen, \nand I am hopeful that we will be able to move this bill through \nCongress, and coordinate our efforts with the administration's stated \nobjectives.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to the products of the \nPeople's Republic of China; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  china trading relations legislation\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator Baucus to \nintroduce legislation authorizing the President to extend most-favored-\nnation, or normal trading relations, status to China on a permanent \nbasis.\n  Since 1989, Congress has engaged in an annual, and very public, \ndebate about the extension of MFN to China. These debates have been \nhighly charged. But over the years, the repetition of this debate has \ncarried a heavy price tag, with little to no positive results to show \nfor it.\n  In fact, the constant debate as to whether or not the United States \nshould continue normal trade relations with China has come at great \nexpense to the overall health of the bilateral relationship between \nthese two great and powerful nations. And that, in turn, has had real--\nand negative--repercussions for the United States, its citizens, and \neven the Chinese people themselves. We need to look toward a day where \nthis annual MFN rollercoaster will be replaced by a stable, long-term \neconomic foundation between these two superpowers. It is toward that \nend that we are introducing this legislation.\n\n\n conditioning mfn in order to influence china's behavior has not worked\n\n  China has received MFN treatment every year since 1980. In 1989, \nhowever, after the brutal suppression of demonstrators at Tiananmen \nSquare, some legislators proposed trying to influence Chinese behavior \nby threatening to revoke China's MFN status, starting this cycle of \nhighly charged--and often political--debates.\n  But is MFN an effective tool for influencing Chinese behavior, as \nthose legislators hoped? No. We saw that all too clearly in 1993, when \nPresident Clinton attempted to condition further renewal upon \nimprovements in human rights. Were there improvements during that time? \nNo. Finally, in 1994 the President came to the conclusion that \nretaining MFN, rather than threatening its removal, ``offers us the \nbest opportunity to lay the basis for long-term sustainable progress in \nhuman rights, and for the advancement of our other interests with \nChina.''\n  It is clear that revoking MFN is not an effective tool for promoting \nchange in China--a fact other nations recognized long ago. Therefore, \nwe should begin removing MFN entirely from the debate, and eventually \nrender it permanent.\n\n\n   annual mfn debate overall has not been productive for the united \n                       states-china relationship\n\n  Not only is MFN status a poor tool for spurring change in China, but \nthe annual debate itself has contributed to poor United States-China \nrelations. By focusing solely on the renewal of MFN, we in the United \nStates have found ourselves distracted from the larger, critically \nimportant issues involving the United States-China bilateral \nrelationship. Indeed, I believe that for the past 8 years, the ability \nof the two nations to work together productively has been partly \nparalyzed by the ongoing MFN debate.\n  Progress on important matters--both those in which we and China have \na common interest, such as stability in Asia, and those in which our \ntwo nations do not see eye to eye--such as international involvement in \nhuman rights--has not been helped by the continuing controversy over \nMFN. The Chinese, who, as history has shown, tend to react negatively \nto public confrontation, have been less open to working with the United \nStates to address issues of common concern. The United States, which \nmust continue to deal with China as an emerging superpower, has been \nforced on the defensive when dealing with the Chinese.\n  This state of affairs cannot continue indefinitely. We need to move \ntoward removing MFN as a factor in our already complicated and complex \nbilateral relationship with China if we want to stabilize that \nrelationship and make progress on issues that matter to the American \npublic. Too much else is at stake--for both nations.\n\n\nthe stability of the united states-china relationship is important for \n                 americans--and for the chinese people\n\n  Why is a stable United States-China relationship important for \nAmericans? For a number of reasons.\n  First, Americans traditionally have worked to promote democratic \nideals around the globe. As a society, we have an interest in \nencouraging such ideals as respect for human rights in other nations. A \nsolid, stable relationship with the Chinese can, over time, bring such \nimprovements to pass--with great benefit for the Chinese people.\n  Second, American have a vested interest in promoting international \nsecurity. Securing nuclear nonproliferation and defusing regional \nconflicts overseas mean a great deal to the overall well-being of \nAmericans and their families. If we want to see these goals advanced, \nwe must work with China, an emerging superpower.\n  Third, and very importantly, Americans have a direct economic tie to \nthe Chinese economy. We now export some $12 billion worth of goods to \nChina--exports that include plastic packaging systems made by the 125 \nemployees at Marshall & Williams Co. in Providence, Rhode Island. And \nwe import nearly four times as much--$46 billion--from China--imports \nthat include toys for children. Not only do families across the United \nStates buy those toys, but the 1,600 workers at Hasbro in Pawtucket, \nRI, rely on those sales to keep their company strong and their jobs in \nplace. Clearly, there is much to do to address the enormous trade \nimbalance between our two nations. But notwithstanding that imbalance, \nthe current level of the United States/China economic interaction is so \nsignificant that if it were disrupted, the negative repercussions for \nour own economy would be staggering.\n  In sum, we have many important challenges facing us that require a \nsteady, stable United States/China relationship. Whether it is nuclear \nnon-proliferation, adherence to human rights, security around the \nglobe, protection of intellectual property, or the transition of Hong \nKong, we must continue to work with the Chinese, using the tools of \ndiplomacy and of laws that are tailored to those purposes.\n\n\nPERMANENT MFN WILL BE ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE AS CHINA ENTERS THE GLOBAL \n                             TRADING SYSTEM\n\n  The eventual adoption of permanent MFN for China is in the interests \nof the United States. Our actions today are\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\nmeant to encourage Congress and the administration to begin \nconsideration of that next step. We do not expect or intend for this \nbill to be considered this year.\n  But our action does come at an important time. The Chinese Government \nnow is taking steps to join the world community and its institutions. \nChief among these steps is China's bid to join the global trading \nsystem known as the World Trade Organization. If successful, this move \nwill bring China into line with the trading practices of the 120-plus \nnations that now are WTO members.\n  To be successful, China will have to agree to accede to the WTO on \nterms that are commercially viable--or to put it more simply, that are \nfair to other nations in terms of market access, nondiscrimination, \nenforcement, and other important areas. Should China enter the global \ntrading system on such terms, it would be a natural point at which the \nUnited States could move forward with permanent MFN.\n  If we begin considering this issue now, it may ripen at a time that \nis beneficial to both the United States and China.\n\n\n  SUMMARY: PERMANENT MFN IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  In sum, the permanent grant of MFN to China is in the best interest \nof the United States and her citizens. It will end for once and for all \nthe annual debate that is actively hindering--not helping--the \nachievement of important American goals, thereby allowing the \nestablishment of a stable relationship that would bring prosperity and \ngrowth to both nations. Over the next year, as China takes serious \nsteps toward full integration in the global economy, the granting of \npermanent MFN will make more and more sense. We think the United States \nshould begin laying the groundwork now, and we are introducing our bill \ntoday toward that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, during the Memorial Day weekend, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars Post 280 in Columbia, MO will recognize a \ngroup of heroic men. Until recently, few people knew of the secret \noperation code named ``Exercise Tiger,'' because the details of the \ntragedy were not disclosed until after the Battle of Normandy and even \nthen proper recognition was not given.\n  In December 1943, several training operations began in order to \nprepare for the Battle of Normandy. These operations, organized by the \nUnited States Army, were undertaken off a beach in Devon, England. It \nwas known by all participating parties the dangers they could \nencounter. At the time, several German ships patrolled this stretch of \nwater looking for American and English ships. One such evening during \npractice operations, with only one English ship to guard, there was a \nsurprise attack on the American ships.\n  On April 28, 1944, the German Navy ``E,'' patrolling the English \nChannel, attacked the eight American tank landing ships who became \naware of the attack only after the U.S.S. LST-507 was struck by an \nincoming torpedo. Next, the U.S.S. LST-531 was attacked and sunk in a \nmatter of minutes. The convoy returned fire and the last ship to be \ntorpedoed, the U.S.S. LST-289, made it safely to shore.\n  Even after this frightening turn of events, to it's credit, Exercise \nTiger continued operations and remained on schedule. Normandy was \nattacked as planned and the D-day invasion was a success.\n  Information of the fatalities was not released until after the D-day \ninvasion due to the secrecy of the mission and in order to keep the \nGermans from becoming aware of the impending strike. It took many \nyears, and the passage of the Freedom of Information Act, to learn of \nthe significance of these missions. I feel now is the time for these \ncourageous men to get the long awaited recognition they deserve.\n  Four thousand men partook in this operation and of those, nearly a \nquarter was reported missing or dead. Records from the Department of \nDefense estimate 749 men died in addition to 441 Army and 198 Navy \ncasualties. Approximately 200 of these men were from my home State of \nMissouri.\n  This Memorial Day weekend commemorates the heroic actions of the men \nwho participated in Exercise Tiger and particularly the ones who lost \ntheir lives in this crucial preparation for the D-day invasion. VFW \nPost 280 has the great privilege of being the first in the State of \nMissouri to recognize these brave individuals.\n  In the words of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, ``Old soldiers never die, \nthey just fade away * * * .'' I hope that through this long delayed \nacknowledgment of these fine soldiers, their memory will not fade away, \nbut will remain in our minds and hearts for years to come. These men \nwere an example for all American soldiers to live by and a credit to \nthe United States as it remains the free and great country that it is \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/13/senate-section/article/S4399-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4399-S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PAUL CHARRON ON CHILD LABOR\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on April 17, 1997, a momentous \noccasion took place at the White House when a group of apparel \nmanufacturers, importers, labor officials, and President Clinton \nannounced their actions to reduce the incidence of abusive child labor \nin the manufacturing of imported articles into the United States. As \none who has been working on this issue for many years, I am pleased \nwith the progress that is being made, although I recognize we have a \nlong way to go. Most importantly, we need leaders in the apparel \nindustry who are willing to take that step forward and work to include \nall manufacturers and importers in this effort to ban abusive and \nexploitative child labor. In the recent past, many apparel \nmanufacturers have resisted this effort, supposedly in the name of \n``free trade,'' but I suspect there was probably another reason. On the \nother hand, there have been manufacturers and importers, who have \nstepped forward to courageously take the different course and that is \nto do everything they can to ensure that their products are not made \nwith exploitative child labor.\n  One such person is Mr. Paul Charron, the chief executive officer of \nthe Liz Claiborne Corp. He has been in the forefront of the fight to \nban the use of exploitative child labor in the manufacturing of wearing \napparel. Mr. Charron gave remarks at the White House that day, which I \nfound to be most encouraging. His comments, indeed, echo my feelings, \nand I know the feelings of President Clinton when he said that ensuring \nhuman rights is the right thing to do, and it is the smart thing to do. \nGood working conditions are productive working conditions. He is \nabsolutely right, and I want to applaud Mr. Charron and thank him for \nhis courageous stance and leadership on this issue. I would also like \nto encourage the participants of the White House Apparel Industry \nPartnership to take the next step and adopt a labeling system giving \nconsumers the information they need and companies the recognition they \ndeserve.\n  At this point, I submit Mr. Charron's remarks into the Record, and I \nurge my colleagues and their staffs to review his remarks.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   Remarks for the White House Apparel Industry Partnership: Paul R. \n                        Charron, April 14, 1997\n\n       Thank you, Linda.\n       And thank you, Mr. President, for having the foresight to \n     recognize that companies could work together with labor, \n     human rights and consumer organizations towards the common \n     goal of improving labor conditions around the world.\n       But let's not forget the contributions of this \n     administration, particularly the Department of Labor and \n     former Labor Secretary Robert Reich. I also want to \n     acknowledge the tireless efforts of Maria Echaveste and Gene \n     Sperling.\n       Furthermore, I would like to express my deep appreciation \n     to all those from the industry, labor, human rights, consumer \n     groups who contributed to this effort. And, of course, I \n     would like to thank Roberta Karp, Liz Claiborne's general \n     counsel, who co-chaired the task force.\n       The standards and processes developed by the Apparel \n     Industry Partnership are groundbreaking. Together we have \n     built a framework to more credibly address a serious and \n     complex problem.\n       But the success of the Partnership's framework for \n     improving working conditions depends upon the industry's \n     ability to recruit its peers.\n       We must be realists. We must be problem solvers. And our \n     first challenge is this: persuading our colleagues in the \n     apparel and footwear industries--colleagues who are not \n     represented here today--to join the fight.\n       In short, we have come here not to announce victory, but to \n     proclaim a new challenge. And that is to make this a truly \n     industry-wide effort. There is no other way.\n       The skeptics may ask--why do this? The answer is simple: \n     it's good business. Some in the industry may think the \n     companies standing here are taking an unnecessary risk; they \n     may wonder how we can afford to make this commitment.\n       I would ask them in return--how can we afford not to?\n       Ensuring human rights is the right thing to do, and it is \n     the smart thing to do. Good working conditions are productive \n     working conditions.\n       Let me emphasize that we are faced with a unique \n     opportunity to make further progress, and, again, our goal is \n     to make this into an unprecedented industry-wide effort. This \n     is only the start--the truly great accomplishments are yet to \n     come.\n       Please join us to help this Partnership fulfill its \n     potential.\n       And now, it is my great honor to introduce the President of \n     the United States. Mr. President. . . .\n\n                 THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRANSISTOR\n\n   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to mark one of \nthose rare discoveries which not only make history, but actually change \nhistory. On\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nDecember 16, 1947, three Bell Laboratories scientists, Nobel Prize \nwinners John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley, working in \nMurray Hill, NJ, successfully operated the world's first transistor. \nThe transistor allows the flow of electrons through solid materials to \nbe controlled without requiring any moving parts.\n  Mr. President, I'm not a scientist, so I don't completely understand \nthe technology that makes this tiny device work. But I do understand \nthat, without it, an amazing array of products which have \nrevolutionized our lives could simply not work. In fact, the \ntransistor's impact on microelectronics, computers, telecommunications, \nand so much more reminds me of the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ``The \ncreation of a thousand forests is in one acorn.'' And the forests of \nproducts which have sprung from the transistor is indeed dazzling.\n  Mr. President, not only is the transistor practically ubiquitous in \nour society, there is neither an individual nor an industry that has \nnot benefited from this device. It has helped us advance the study of \nbiology and medicine, permitting us to understand and heal the human \nbody in ways that our ancestors could never even have imagined. It has \naltered our sense of community by permitting us to negate the effects \nof both time and distance through the development of worldwide \ncommunication networks. By doing so, the transistor changed the way we \nlearn by instantly placing knowledge at our fingertips. And it has \nallowed us to explore the depths of the ocean, walk on the moon, and \nchart the solar system and the invisible domains of the universe. \nObviously, the transistor not only revolutionized our lives, it has \nhelped to lengthen our lives, enrich our lives, and provide our lives \nwith greater meaning.\n  Mr. President, the tradition and tenacity of Bell Laboratories lives \non in its linear descendent, Lucent Technologies. The men and women of \nLucent continue to make innovative communications products using solid \nstate technologies that are an outgrowth of the transistor's \ndevelopment.
