Mr. President, both the House and the Senate are \nworking on what is likely to be a final tax bill for this Congress. As \nwe go about considering tax bills, I hope my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle will be thinking about the long-term economic effects of \nthe legislation.\n  Let me start, of course, by making a distinction that should be \nobvious to all of us who work around here. That is the distinction \nbetween tax bills that are paid for and tax bills that are not paid for \nand that instead obtain the revenue for the tax cuts from the surplus \nthat we anticipate.\n  I agree with the President that if we do a tax bill this year--and I \nhope we are able to do a tax bill--that we will pay for the tax bill, \nthat we take whatever revenue is required to make those cuts in taxes, \nand that we will find revenue in the current budget with which to do \nthat.\n  I do not think the American people want us to go ahead and begin to \nspend an anticipated surplus which we have not even realized as yet. \nUnfortunately, some of the tax proposals--particularly the one passed \nby the House on Saturday--have that very major defect.\n  But let me get back to the primary subject of my comments, which is \nthat if we pass tax legislation we need to be thinking about the long-\nterm economic effects of such legislation. Will such bills enhance our \neconomy by promoting sound investments and sustained future economic \ngrowth? Or, instead, will they threaten our projected budget surplus \nand Social Security without\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\nreally doing anything for the future economic well-being of the \ncountry?\n  I raise these questions because there is one crucial element of our \nTax Code, more than any other provision in the code, that is directed \nat our future economic growth. In all the discussions of taxes that \nhave occurred over the past few months, that provision appears to have \nbeen given very short shrift. I am referring to the research and \nexperimentation tax credit, commonly called the R tax credit, which \nis slated for yet another minimal, temporary extension, the way tax \nbills seem to be evolving here today.\n  As I am sure most of my colleagues are well aware, investment in \nresearch and development is the single largest contributing factor to \nour past, present and future economic growth. In an economy that is \nincreasingly knowledge-based and increasingly globalized, it is also an \nimportant factor in the competitiveness of American industry. Research \nleads to improved productivity, economic growth, better jobs and new \ntechnologies--technologies that have spawned entire new industries and \nrevolutionized the way people do business around the world. But our \nresearch tax policy has not been keeping pace with today's economic \nrealities.\n  Research investment is of greater and greater importance to American \nindustry. But the on-again-off-again research credit is becoming less \nand less certain. It was allowed to expire for the ninth time this past \nJune, and is slated for a renewal for less than 2 years.\n  Research is being done by large and small businesses in a growing \nvariety of different industries. The way that the credit is currently \nstructured, some companies derive incentive value from it, but others, \neven though they may be making identical research investments, do not \nget value.\n  Research is also being done increasingly in partnerships. Without \npartnerships between industry and Federal laboratories, we would never \nhave created the Internet. Without collaborations between independent \nindustry and universities, we would never have biotech. Without \nalliances among large and small firms, and in broad-based research \nconsortia, we would not be seeing the efficiency gains in our \nmanufacturing base that have been bridging the benefits of \ntechnological advances to every corner of our economy. But the research \ncredit, as it is currently structured, does little, if anything, to \nencourage these partnerships.\n  Research is changing. It is important to American business. Its \nimportance to American business is growing. Yet, our policy is stuck in \nan outdated status quo.\n  We have an R tax credit that is complicated and difficult for many \ncompanies--especially small companies--to use. We have an R tax \ncredit that offers almost no incentive--less than three cents per \nadditional dollar of research investment--for many of our, \nhistorically, most innovative research-intensive companies. We have an \nR tax credit that does nothing to encourage the interchange of ideas \nbetween industry and our great universities, Federal laboratories and \nother companies. We have an R tax credit that cannot even be relied \nupon as an incentive that will last for more than 1 or 2 years at a \ntime. So the obvious question is: What kind of a commitment is this to \nAmerica's economic future?\n  The U.S. Senate has an opportunity, as we consider tax legislation in \nthe remaining days of this Congress, to move beyond this sorry status \nquo. Improvements to our research tax policy could not come at a more \ncritical time--while our economy and our Federal finances are in good \norder but as we look with some anxiety toward prospects for continued \nprosperity.\n  I introduced legislation this summer--Senate bill 2268--to improve \nthe research credit. As the ranking member of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, I then organized a workshop in conjunction with the Senate \nScience and Technology Caucus on the topic of R tax credits. That \nworkshop received the views of a broad range of experts from \ngovernment, industry and universities who have studied the problems of \nthe current R tax credit, and have proposed changes to make it more \neffective.\n  Invitations to attend the workshop on the tax issues were sent to \nlegislative assistants from every Member in the Senate. As a result of \nthat workshop, and the input that I have received from other experts in \nresearch groups and small businesses, I have developed an improved \nresearch and development tax credit proposal that adds to Senate bill \n2268 provisions that will make the bill even more effective in \nstimulating partnerships through public-benefit research consortia, and \nthat will provide small, high-tech businesses with tax credits for \npatent filing so that small businesses can more effectively defend \ntheir inventions, both here and abroad.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this new \nproposal be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Some of my colleagues will undoubtedly be concerned \nabout the cost of improving and making permanent the R tax credit, \neven though improvements like those in S. 2268 are long overdue. But I \nthink there is an even more important cost to consider. What will it \ncost us if we don't improve the R tax credit?\n  Limiting an extension of the R tax credit to 20 months, as has been \nproposed in some of the legislation working its way through Congress, \njust because of the budgetary scoring consequences, and with full \nknowledge that we will be back in 20 months with another temporary \nextension that will also be limited by scoring considerations, is a \nfalse economy. The long-term revenue cost to the Treasury of ten one-\nyear extensions of the credit, or five two-year extensions, or one ten-\nyear extension are all the same. We are kidding ourselves if we think \nwe were really saving any money by continuing with these piecemeal, \ntemporary extensions. In fact, this scoring-driven strategy of repeated \nshort-term extensions is worse than a fiscal parlor-trick. It is \nirresponsible public policy. Why? Because the unpredictable, on-off \nnature of the short-term extensions keeps America from fully realizing \nthe long-term investments that a R tax credit should produce. Thus, \nwe are failing to maximize the public benefits of the tax credit, we \nare reducing the degree to which it can stimulate research and \ninvigorate our economy, and we are losing future tax revenues that \nwould come from R economic growth.\n  Our current policy, of piecemeal extension of an archaic, \ndecreasingly effective tax structure, has gone on for 17 years now--a \nlittle longer than I have served in the Senate--and I am not the first \nto propose that we take a better approach. My colleague, the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, has proposed similar improvements to the R \ntax credit. Improving and making permanent the R tax credit should be \na bipartisan cause. When the Senate considers tax legislation, I look \nforward to working on this issue with all of my colleagues who care \nabout our economic future, and I urge the members of this body to treat \nresearch and development as an urgent priority in our upcoming \ndeliberations.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     SEC.  1.

Madam President, Senator Feinstein and I have been granted \ntime in this period of morning business to discuss a matter that we \nbegan working on about 2\\1/2\\ years ago, and we wanted to give a report \nto you, to the Members of the U.S. Senate, and, frankly, to all \nAmericans who are interested in the subject of victims' rights.\n  In April of 1996, during National Victims' Rights Week, along with \nRepresentative Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nwe introduced a Federal constitutional amendment to guarantee certain \nrights, fundamental constitutional rights, to all victims of violent \ncrime. Since that time, we have worked with victims' rights groups \nacross the country, with law enforcement officials, with our colleagues \nin the House of Representatives and here in the Senate, of course, with \nthe Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and even the President \nof the United States, to craft an amendment that could gain acceptance \nin the two legislative bodies, and then be adopted by the people of the \nUnited States as an amendment to the Constitution. We have come a long \nway since that time.\n  I want to take this time to join with Senator Feinstein in giving a \nbrief report about our progress, with the conclusion that we are not \ngoing to be presenting this amendment at this late date in this session \nof the Congress, but that we do hope to have a vote on this amendment \nin the U.S. Senate early next year.\n  I want to begin by thanking my colleague, Senator Feinstein from \nCalifornia. She has been an extraordinarily important proponent of \ncrime victims' rights around the country; therefore, it was important \nfor her to be one of the prime sponsors of this constitutional \namendment. Her experience brought to bear on the subject made it much \neasier for people to join with us in the effort, and the work she had \ndone with victims' rights groups before we introduced the amendment was \nimportant in galvanizing the support of those groups around the country \nto support this amendment and to work on the versions of it as we had \nto hone the language to meet the objections and concerns of various \npeople around the country. I want to thank her also for her patience in \nworking with me and her willingness to spend many, many long hours in \nworking out the details of this amendment and meeting with various \ngroups, trying to gather support among both the outside groups and our \ncolleagues that would guarantee passage of the amendment.\n  In the final version that passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nJuly of this year by a bipartisan vote of 11-6, we had sponsorship by \n30 Republicans and 12 Democrats. You can see by this bipartisan vote of \n11-6 it required cooperation of Republicans and Democrats to move this \nmatter forward. So there is nothing partisan about the matter of \nvictims' rights.\n  I mentioned the fact that we had over 60 drafts of this amendment. \nWhat that demonstrates I think is that Senator Feinstein and I have \nbeen willing to meet with anyone at any time to hear their concerns, \nand objections in some cases, about what we are trying to do in \nspecifics. We have been able to mold an amendment which meets their \nconcerns to the extent that we have this strong, strong support.\n  I note that in a brand new publication from the Department of Justice \ncalled ``New Directions From the Field: Victims' Rights and Services \nfor the 21st Century,'' hot off the press, the very first \nrecommendation of this report from the Department of Justice is that \nvictims' rights should be embodied in an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I would like to read from this report for a moment, if I might, \nbecause this is recommendation from the field No. 1.\n\n       The United States Constitution should be amended to \n     guarantee fundamental rights for victims of crime.\n\n  What are these rights? They are the same ones that Senator Feinstein \nand I propose in our amendment.\n       Constitutionally protected rights should include the right \n     to notice of public court proceedings and to attend them; to \n     make a statement to the court about bail, sentencing, and \n     accepting a plea; to be told about, to attend, and to speak \n     at parole hearings; to notice when the defendant or convict \n     escapes, is released, or dies; to an order of restitution \n     from the convicted offender; to a disposition free from \n     unreasonable delay; to consideration for the safety of the \n     victim in determining any release from custody; to notice of \n     these rights; and to standing to enforce them.\n\n  I would like to read on from this report the reasons stated for the \nconclusion that we need a Federal constitutional amendment, because \nthese reasons summarize a great deal of testimony that we heard in the \nhearings we held which demonstrated that mere State statutes, or State \nconstitutional provisions, are not adequate to provide a uniform floor \nof rights for all victims of serious crime in the United States.\n  Here is what this report goes on to say:\n\n       A federal constitutional amendment for victims' rights is \n     needed for many different reasons, including: (1) to \n     establish a consistent ``floor of rights'' for crime victims \n     in every state and at the federal level; (2) to ensure that \n     courts engage in a careful and conscientious balancing of the \n     rights of victims and defendants; (3) to guarantee crime \n     victims the opportunity to participate in proceedings related \n     to crimes against them; and (4) to enhance the participation \n     of victims in the criminal justice process.\n\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       A victims' rights constitutional amendment is the only \n     legal measure strong enough to rectify the current \n     inconsistencies in victims' rights laws that vary \n     significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction on the state \n     and federal levels. Such an amendment would ensure that \n     rights for victims are on the same level as the fundamental \n     rights of accused and convicted offenders. Most supporters \n     believe that it is the only legal measure strong enough to \n     ensure that the rights of victims are fully enforced across \n     the country. They also believe, however, that the efforts to \n     secure passage of a federal constitutional amendment for \n     crime victims' rights should not supplant legislative \n     initiatives at the state and federal level.\n       Granting victims of crime the ability to participate in the \n     justice system is exactly the type of participatory right the \n     Constitution is designed to protect and has been amended to \n     permanently ensure. Such rights include the right to vote on \n     an equal basis and the right to be heard when the government \n     deprives one of life, liberty, or property.\n  Madam President, hot off the press from the Department of Justice, \nthe No. 1 recommendation is a Federal constitutional amendment to do \nthe things that the amendment which Senator Feinstein and I have \nintroduced would do for crime victims around this country.\n  I know Senator Feinstein is going to talk for a moment about how the \nscales of justice are imbalanced, and what our amendment is intended to \ndo is right that imbalance between the legitimate rights of the accused \non the one hand and the legitimate rights of victims on the other hand.\n  Let me get to the bottom line for those who have been wondering what \nthe status of this amendment is and where we are going to go from here.\n  In July, as I said, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed out on a \nbipartisan basis, 11 to 6, the latest version of the amendment that \nSenator Feinstein and I have proposed. As noted, it has some 42 \ncosponsors. Since that time, we have sought to obtain floor time to \ndebate and eventually vote on our constitutional amendment.\n  Madam President, as you are aware, it has been very difficult, in the \nwaning weeks of this congressional session, to get floor time to take \nup even the most mundane of bills, because the Senate is very much \nconcentrated on getting the appropriations bills passed so that we can \nfund the Government for the next year. And, of course, with the \ncampaign coming up, leaders are very definitely committed to an \nadjournment date of around October 9 or 10.\n  Senator Feinstein and I conferred with the various leaders of the \nvictims' rights movement and with our colleagues to determine what the \nbest course of action would be. We understood that for something as \nimportant as amending the Constitution, we wanted to do it right. The \nlast thing that Senator Feinstein or I would ever do is to try to hurry \nan amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to try to push this through \nwithout an adequate debate, without giving everyone an opportunity to \nhave their say.\n  As I said, we have made changes to the extent of 62 different drafts, \nwhich I think establish our bona fides in wanting to hear from everyone \nwith an interest in this important subject.\n  We determined, under the circumstances, rather than trying to amend \nanother piece of legislation\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\nwith our amendment or to try to rush this through in some way, that we \nwould continue to work at the grassroots level with organizations that \nsupport the amendment, continue to work with the administration, whose \nsupport for an amendment has been very helpful, and continue to work \nwith our colleagues to gain even more support in terms of \ncosponsorship, so that when we do bring it to the floor, we will have \nhad the widest possible discussion and opportunity for everyone to \nparticipate. We understand that will make it more likely that this \nimportant effort will have quick success in the House of \nRepresentatives and, importantly, in the State legislatures, which \nwould then have to ratify the amendment.\n  Madam President, we decided that under the circumstances it was \nbetter for us not to try to rush that amendment to the floor here in \nthe waning days, literally, of this Congress, but that we would be \nwilling to defer action until early next year. I know that both Senator \nFeinstein and I would like to see this matter dealt with perhaps during \nCrime Victims Week in April of next year.\n  But whatever the timing that is appropriate, we will be urging our \ncolleagues early in the year to join us in cosponsoring the amendment \nin its final version and ensuring quick passage out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, again because, of course, we will be in a new Congress and \nwe will need to act anew on the legislation because of that and to \nsecure the support of the leadership to quickly bring the amendment \nthen to the floor of the Senate so that we can have a thorough debate \nand, hopefully, to pass the amendment out, sending it to the House for \nits subsequent action.\n  We hope that with that kind of a timetable, with that kind of an \nopportunity for everybody to participate, we will in the year 1999 have \nadopted a constitutional amendment that can then be acted upon by the \nStates once and for all to protect the rights of crime victims around \nthis country.\n  I want to close these brief remarks by again thanking Senator \nFeinstein and all of the others who have been so active in this effort. \nThe outside groups I will name at another occasion, because they \ndeserve very special recognition for all of the effort that they have \nput into this.\n  But, frankly, the amendment would not have gotten to this point \nwithout the strong and active support of one of the strongest \nsupporters of victims' rights that I know in the United States, my \nfriend and colleague from California, Senator Feinstein.\n  At this point, I would be happy to yield for her to make comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from \nArizona.\n  I want Senator Kyl to know that it has really been a very great \npleasure for me to work with the Senator over these past 2 years. I \nthink it has been for me one of the best experiences I have had in the \ntime I have been in the Senate, and that is two Senators from different \npolitical parties sitting down to try to work out something which is \nenormously difficult to do, and that is the drafting of a new \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The Senator mentioned that we have done 60-plus drafts, and that we \nhave met with the Attorney General, the White House, met members of \nvictims' groups. The Senator brought in the counsel for victims. Larry \nTribe, from Harvard University, worked with us, and we believe, I \nthink, that we have an amendment that will now stand the test of public \nscrutiny and stand the test of time.\n  I want to share, Madam President, with the Senate how I first became \ninvolved in victims' rights. It was in the mid-1970s in San Francisco \nwhen a man broke into a home on Portrero Hill. He tied the man in the \nhome to a chair and murdered him by beating him with a hammer, a \nchopping block and a ceramic vase. He then repeatedly raped his 24-\nyear-old wife, breaking several of her bones. He slit her wrist and \ntried to strangle her with a telephone cord before setting their home \non fire and leaving them to go up in flames.\n  Miraculously, this young woman, whose name I purposely left out of \nthis, is still alive. She testified against him. He is still in State \nprison, to the best of my knowledge. But when I became mayor she used \nto call me every year and say, ``I'm terrified that he might get out. I \ndon't know if and when he will get out. His parole is coming up. Could \nyou help me?''\n  I recognized then that there really were no rights that victims had. \nIn 1982, California became the first State in the Union to apply some \nvictims' rights. It was a bill of rights. It passed the electorate \noverwhelmingly. That is the reason when people saw the family of Nicole \nBrown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in court it wasn't because they had \nFederal rights or constitutional rights; it was because the \nconstitution of the State of California provided that right in 1982. \nSome 28 other States have followed.\n  So you might say, ``Well, what's the problem?'' The problem is each \nState is different, and there is no basic floor of rights guaranteed to \nevery victim. Therefore, if rights come in conflict, obviously, the \nrights provided in the Constitution prevail.\n  Now, what rights are in the Constitution? These are the \nconstitutional rights today. You will see the rights of the accused, 15 \nspecific rights guaranteed in the Constitution: the right to counsel, \nthe right to due process, to a speedy trial, to a prohibition against \ndouble jeopardy, self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures, to have warrants issued only on probable cause, a jury of \nyour peers, to be informed of accusations, and so on. You will then on \nthe other side see the rights granted to victims are ``none.''\n  Well, one has to look back and say, how did this happen? I have \nlooked back, and how it happened is very interesting. Our Founding \nFathers, when they included the rights of the accused in the \nConstitution, did not think to include the rights of crime victims. \nThen again in 1789 there were not 9 million victims of violent crimes \nevery year. As a matter of fact, there were not much more than 4 \nmillion people in all of our colonies. In fact, there are more victims \nof violent crime each year, by far, than there were people in the \ncountry when the Constitution was written.\n  Additionally, the way the criminal justice system worked then, \nvictims did not need a guarantee of these rights. In America, up to the \nlate 18th century and well into the 19th century, the concept of the \npublic prosecutor did not exist. Victims could and did commence \ncriminal cases themselves, by hiring a sheriff to arrest the defendant \nand then initiating a private prosecution. The core rights in our \namendment--to notice, to attend, to be heard--were inherently made \navailable to the victim.\n  As Juan Cardenas, writing in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public \nPolicy, observed:\n\n       At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the \n     prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as \n     their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often \n     hired a prosecutor.\n\n  Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of private \nprosecution. With the explosive growth of crime in this country in \nrecent years--the rate of violent crime has more than quadrupled in the \nlast 35 years--it became easier and easier for the victim to be left \nout of the process.\n  Another scholar noted:\n\n       With the establishment of the prosecutor, the conditions \n     for the general alienation of the victim from the legal \n     process further increase. The victim is deprived of his \n     ability to determine the course of a case and is deprived of \n     the ability to gain restitution from the proceedings. Under \n     such conditions, the incentives to report crime and to \n     cooperate with the prosecution diminish. As the importance of \n     the prosecution increases, the role of the victim is \n     transformed from principal actor to a resource that may be \n     used at the prosecutor's discretion.\n\n  So there was no need to guarantee those rights in 1789, and, as we \nall know, the Constitution protects people from government rather than \nproviding most people with certain basic rights. But the criminal \njustice system has changed dramatically since then and the prevalence \nof crime has changed dramatically. So we believe that the need and \ncircumstances both combine to restore balance to the criminal justice \nsystem by guaranteeing the rights of violent crime victims in the \nUnited States.\n  I am very proud to have 12 coauthors on the Democratic side for this \nconstitutional amendment, and I am particularly proud to have the \nsupport of Senator Biden of Delaware. Senator\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\nBiden of Delaware was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I say to \nthe Senator from Arizona, when I came on that committee back in 1992 \nand was very helpful to me in learning the ropes of the committee. I \nhave great respect for him. So it was very significant to me when we \nworked with him, made certain compromises in the amendment, and gained \nhis support.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I just interrupt the Senator to also note that, as \nsupporters of the amendment, we have the current chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and also, as I indicated earlier, \nthe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Hyde. So \nthis amendment certainly has the support of the people who have been in \nthe leadership of the committee as well as the current leadership of \nthe committee.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is right. And I am delighted the Senator is in \nthe Chamber, because many people have said about this amendment, \n``Well, why isn't Federal law enough?'' And if the Senator will recall, \nwe both voted for the Federal clarification law in the case of Oklahoma \nCity that would give victims the right to be notified, to be present in \nthe courtroom, and to make a statement. And even after we clarified the \nlaw, the Federal judge held that if a victim was present, that victim \ncould not make a statement. So this again is, I think, an additional \nrationale for this constitutional amendment.\n  I do want to point out the valuable support of Professor Laurence \nTribe of the Harvard Law School, and I would like to just briefly quote \nportions of his testimony last year before the House hearing on the \namendment.\n\n       The rights in question--rights of crime victims not to be \n     victimized yet again, through the processes by which \n     Government bodies and officials prosecute, punish, and \n     release the accused or convicted offender--are indisputably \n     basic human rights against government, rights that any \n     civilized society of justice would aspire to protect and \n     strive never to violate.\n       Our Constitution's central concerns involve protecting the \n     rights of individuals to participate in all those \n     governmental processes that directly and immediately involve \n     those individuals and affect their lives in some focused and \n     particular way . . . The parallel rights of victims to \n     participate in these proceedings are no less basic, even \n     though they find no parallel recognition in the explicit text \n     of the Constitution of the United States.\n       The fact that the States and Congress, within their \n     respective jurisdictions, already have ample affirmative \n     authority to enact rules protecting these rights is . . . not \n     a reason for opposing the amendment altogether . . . The \n     problem, rather, is that such rules are likely, as experience \n     to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection \n     whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, \n     traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an \n     accused's rights regardless of whether those rights are \n     genuinely threatened.\n\n  So, in a sense, this is all the heart of our argument. Today, the \naccused, the defendant, has 15 specific rights in the Constitution.\n  The victim of a violent crime, or any other crime, has no rights in \nthe Constitution. Consequently, there is no protected, no basic floor \nof rights across this Nation. Each State varies. And when one of these \nrights conflicts with a right guaranteed to a victim by a State \nconstitutional amendment, the Federal Constitution will always prevail. \nWe believe very strongly that 15 rights should be balanced by the 7 \nrights that we would provide to victims under this constitutional \namendment.\n  ``The right to receive notice of the proceedings.'' What could be \nmore basic? Somebody assaults you, somebody has raped you, somebody has \nrobbed you--at least you receive a notice to the hearing.\n  ``The right to attend the trial, and any other public proceeding at \nwhich the defendant is present.''\n  ``The right to be heard at certain stages in the proceeding: The \nrelease of the offender; acceptance of a plea bargain; and sentencing.\n  ``The right to be notified of the offender's release or escape.''\n  This is something for me which goes back to the 1974 case of a woman \nhaving to call to plead to know when her husband's murderer and her own \nattacker would be released, and because she does not have that \ninformation to this day guaranteed to her, to this day she lives in \nanonymity. She has changed her name and she has changed her place of \nresidence because she believes one day he will get out and one day he \nwill come after her. No American should have to live that way. That is \na basic right we provide in this constitutional amendment.\n  ``The right to an order of restitution, albeit $1, presented by a \njudge,'' which is significant to every victim. We had interested \nvictims testify to this. Senator Kyl, I am sure, will remember how \nmeaningful and important just the simple act of restitution was to \nthem.\n  ``To have the safety of the victim considered in determining a \nrelease from custody.'' These are, in essence, the basic rights that we \nwould provide to begin to balance this scale of justice throughout \ntime. The only way it can be done is by adding a constitutional \namendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  I, once again, thank Senator Kyl. It has been a great pleasure for \nme. I hope we will have the time to debate this fully on the floor and \nhave a vote. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me just add some additional thanks to \nthose that Senator Feinstein has indicated here. Before I do, I note \nthe illustrative chart that Senator Feinstein has been referring to \nrefers to the rights of the defendants there. I think it is instructive \nthat for those who say we should not be providing victims' rights by \namending the U.S. Constitution, it is very instructive that most of \nthose rights for defendants were added by amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. They were not embodied in the original text of the \nConstitution. So, as times changed and as we determined that rights \nneeded to be added, we did that for the defendants. Now, as Senator \nFeinstein has pointed out, it is time to add some coequal rights for \nvictims of violent crime.\n  There are some additional people I think we would be remiss in not \nthanking at this time. Laurence Tribe certainly was mentioned by \nSenator Feinstein; Professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah was \nequally helpful to us, in drafting language changes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator will yield for just one moment?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, of course.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. On Paul Cassell, I think the Senator will remember, \nin the Judiciary Committee he had very compelling testimony and he \nsubmitted a brief which he had written particularly on this. I found it \nvery, very compelling. I would like to refer to it in the text of our \nremarks, so people who might be interested would go back and read that \nbrief.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank Senator Feinstein. I might add, anyone interested in \nobtaining more information about what we are doing, and in getting \ninformation about the specific provisions, the testimony of the \nwitnesses who answered a lot of the questions that, frankly, our \ncolleagues had, they can contact us. We can provide them transcripts of \nthe hearings, very erudite writings of the people like Laurence Tribe \nand Paul Cassell who have been working for a long period of time and \nhave so much to contribute, as well as information from people at the \nDepartment of Justice and others.\n\n  I would also like to thank Steve Twist, an attorney in Arizona, who \nhas spent thousands of hours pro bono, a lawyer who has spent much of \nhis career in advancing the cause of victims' rights and who, frankly, \nwas one of my mentors in learning about this subject and who has also \nhelped us throughout this process.\n  Also, there are two particular brilliant lawyers on our staff who \ndeserve a lot of credit, Neil Quinter, a member of Senator Feinstein's \nstaff with her today, and Stephen Higgins, a member of my staff; both \nlawyers who have spent far more than the usual amount of time on a \npiece of legislation, working this, because not only is it a very \ninteresting legal challenge but also a personal commitment on their \nparts as much as it is for us.\n  I indicated we would probably thank a lot of people at another time. \nCertainly the victims' rights groups and representatives who have been \nso important in advancing this cause at the grassroots level. But I \nthought it important, at least at this time as we wind up this session, \nto note the people who have, professionally, been so helpful to us. We \nwill be working on this over the next 2 or 3 months as we prepare for \nthe next legislative session.\n  I will allow Senator Feinstein to close. I am pleased to announce \nthat\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\nwhile we have not been able to get this amendment to the floor for \nconsideration by our colleagues today, or this year, I am quite \noptimistic we will be able to do that early in the next session of the \nSenate. I think the additional time we take to allow everyone to have \ntheir say, to ask the questions they need to ask, that will allow this \nto come at a time when we can have a full debate, that that will permit \nus to adopt this amendment next session and send it to the States for \nratification.\n  Again, I thank Senator Feinstein for her wonderful cooperation and \ninspiration on this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator will yield on one point, I would like \nto add to those thanks, and thank him for being so generous. I would \nlike to add Roberta Roper of the National Victims Constitutional \nAmendment Network, who worked with Steve Twist so actively; David \nBeatty of the National Victims Center; and John Stein and Marlene Young \nof the National Organization for Victim Assistance.\n  If I might say this: Some people have pooh-poohed--maybe pooh-poohed \nis not a good senatorial word--let me say denigrated this concept. As \none who sat on 5,000 cases, sentencing them, setting sentences and \ngranting paroles for 6 years of my life, I can tell you that I believe \nthis constitutional amendment will make more of a difference in the \ncriminal justice system than virtually anything else that could be \ndone. I think it is extraordinarily important. I know the Senator joins \nme in this, and I hope we will be able to have that full debate early \non in the next Congress.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, it seems like there is always one more \nthing we want to say on this important subject. Again, we cannot \npossibly thank everyone here today, but one of the organizations--now \nthat Senator Feinstein mentions a couple of other people--Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving have been enormously helpful at the grassroots, \nworking with our colleagues gaining cosponsorships. I would be remiss \nif I did not mention them.\n  Again, we will have many more opportunities to discuss this. I urge \nanyone who has questions about it to be in touch with us. But it is \ncertainly an effort that I am going to be pleased to work on in the \nnext session.\n  Mr. Bumpers addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is there any particular order, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11010-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11013-S11014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TAX CUT AND THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I want to speak for just a few minutes \non what the House did last Saturday in announcing that they had passed \nan $80 billion tax cut. To tell you the truth, I take a lot of ribbing \naround here about the length of this cord. And to really say everything \nI need to say and want to say about what the House did Saturday would \ntake another 10 feet on this cord, because I really think it is one of \nthe most irresponsible acts--knowingly irresponsible acts--I have ever \nseen since I have been in the Senate. To add insult to injury, I heard \na young Congressman Saturday evening on the news saying, ``After all, \nthe Republicans created this surplus. They ought to have some say so \nabout how it is going to be used.''\n\n  I have heard hyperbole in my day, but I think that exceeds anything I \nhave ever heard in my life, because it was in 1993, on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate, where we had to bring the Vice President of the United \nStates over to pass a bill that President Clinton had submitted to us \nunder which he promised would result in balanced budget. When he ran \nfor President in 1992, he didn't promise a balanced budget. What he \npromised was that he would reduce the annual deficit by 50 percent \nduring his first 4 years in office.\n  Bear in mind that the 2 years before President Clinton took office, \nunder President Bush--and you can go back as far as 1981--the deficits \nstarted running totally out of control, as every economist in the \nNation said they would, after we cut taxes and increased spending in \n1981 as a part of the Reagan revolution.\n  By the time George Bush finished his term, if I am not mistaken, the \nlast two deficits for 1991 and 1992 were about $250 billion to $300 \nbillion a year. It was frightening. I am just 1 of 100 Senators here, \nbut I can tell you, I had decided that the place was utterly out of \ncontrol.\n  So when the President promised the American people he would cut the \nannual deficits in half and submitted what was called OBRA 93, the \nOmnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, it did, in fact, raise taxes and it \ncut spending by an equal amount. We were supposed to raise taxes by \n$250 billion and cut spending by $250 billion for an impact over the \nensuing 5 years of a reduction of the deficit by $500 billion.\n  The people of the country, shortly thereafter, became rather excited \nabout it. The bond daddies in New York City, who pretty much determine \neconomic policy in this country, were excited, too. After all, they \nsaid, maybe these clowns really are serious for a change.\n  I will tell you how serious it was. As I said, when we tallied up the \nvote, it was 50 ayes and 50 nays. Vice President Gore sat in the Chair \nof the Presiding Officer, which is his constitutional duty, and untied \nthe vote. So the Clinton bill, OBRA 93, passed 51 to 50 without one \nsingle Republican vote. Not one. It had come from the House of \nRepresentatives to us where it had passed the House of Representatives \nwithout one--without one--single Republican vote. The bill passed the \nentire Congress, House and Senate, without one Republican vote on \neither side, and this young House Member stood up on the floor of the \nHouse on Saturday and announced to the world, ``After all, the \nRepublicans created this surplus.''\n  When President Clinton became President and we passed that bill, OBRA \n93, in August of 1993, we made it retroactive. Not fair. It really \nwasn't fair. I didn't like it myself, but I voted for it. A lot of \nfairly wealthy people--and I have a few wealthy friends, my brother one \nof them, and he practically threatened to cut me out of his will \nbecause we made it retroactive.\n  What happened as a result of making it retroactive? I will tell you \nprecisely what happened. Instead of the projected $290 billion deficit \nfor 1994, it turned out to be $254 billion, $36 billion less than had \nbeen anticipated, $36 billion less than each of the 2 preceding years \nof the Bush administration. The projections for 1994 had been $290 \nbillion to $300 billion. That year, it turned out to be $207 billion, \nand people began to get excited about the deficit suddenly going down \nfor a change. People's confidence level rose. The unemployment rate \nbegan to go down. When people have confidence, they spend money. The \neconomy began to really soar, and the more it soared, the more taxes \npeople paid.\n  When 1995 rolled around, it went from--it wasn't $290 billion, as had \nbeen predicted the preceding 4 years. It was down to $154 billion in \n1995. People were really getting excited. These are sort of round \nfigures. I am not sure of the precise figures, but they are close \nenough.\n\n  In 1996, the deficit went to $107 billion, and in 1997, $22 billion. \nBy this time, the whole country is absolutely incredulous. They cannot \nbelieve that a country that had shown every sign of taking leave of its \nsenses had suddenly come to its senses, and the deficit, which was $300 \nbillion a year as far as the eye could see the day Bill Clinton was \ninaugurated, was suddenly $22 billion last year.\n  Right now, 3 days from now, on Thursday of this week we feel--OMB and \nthe Congressional Budget Office feel--that the surplus could run \nbetween $50 billion and $63 billion. It is the first time in 30 years, \nand the only reason we did it 30 years ago was because Lyndon Johnson \ndumped the Social Security trust fund into the budget, and the Social \nSecurity trust fund caused us to have a surplus in 1969. We haven't had \none since until this year, which hopefully will materialize on \nThursday. And this young House Member says the Republicans created this \nsurplus, that they have some rights about what to do with it. They have \nsome rights, of course, but I cannot tell you how offended I am by that \nwhen the 1993 bill is the very thing that cost the Democrats control of \nCongress.\n  Two of the finest Senators I have ever known in my life, good \nfriends,\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\nlost their seats because they voted for that bill. The House Members \nwere swept out totally because of that bill. I have said on the floor \nbefore and I will repeat it, if that is what it took--no matter how \ntraumatic it is to me that the Democrats lost control and still don't \nhave control of Congress--that it was not too big a price to pay to get \nour fiscal house in order. And here are the Republicans, again, at the \nsame old stand with the same old economic policy saying, ``We've got to \ncut taxes.''\n  What is the tax cut? It is the same old tax cut: 53 percent of it \ngoes to the wealthiest 15 percent of the people in America. If I were \nrich, I would be a Republican, too. No, I wouldn't. My father would be \nwhirling in his grave if I did a thing like that.\n  Well, let me give you the bad news. The bad news is, the surplus is \nnot real. It is not a certifiable surplus. Do you know why? Because we \nstill use Social Security in the budget. If we had truth in budgeting \naround here, where all the trust funds--the Social Security trust fund, \nthe highway trust fund, the airport trust fund, the pension funds--if \nall of those funds were taken out of the budget, not only would we not \nbe looking at a surplus, we would be looking at a very healthy deficit.\n  And so as rhapsodic and euphoric as most people are about what we \ncall a surplus for the first time in 30 years, it is not a surplus. \nThere is $100 billion in the budget this year that is money right out \nof the Social Security trust fund. You take the $100 billion Social \nSecurity trust fund out, and you have a healthy $40- to--I don't know \nwhat the figure is--somewhere $40-plus billion deficit.\n  This is no time--we know that Social Security under the present \nsystem is going to be totally bankrupt in about the year 2029; and by \nthe year 2013, we are going to be paying out more every year than we \ntake in, which is a far cry from a $100 billion surplus we are getting \na year now. I think the Social Security trust fund in about the year \n2013 will have over $3 trillion in it--$3 trillion. You think about all \nthat money, but by the year 2029 it will be dead broke, it will be on a \npay-as-you-go basis. We will be taking in money one day and paying it \nout the next. There will be no trust fund.\n  So when the President said, ``Social Security first,'' he meant that.\n  What does ``Social Security first'' mean? It means that you do not \npay for tax cuts with Social Security trust funds. Right now, if we \nraid the surplus, we are raiding the Social Security trust fund.\n  As I said in the beginning, I need about 10 more feet of cord on this \nthing to say everything I want to say. I just do not speak well unless \nI have an opportunity to walk up and down this aisle. All I want to say \nto my brethren on the other side --good friends, people whom I like--\nand I am not in the business of giving Republicans political advice; \nthey have been doing reasonably well without me. But I will say this: \nThey should know--and they do know it, and I think they had a few \ndefectors over in the House the other day who said, ``I'm not about to \ngo home and face people and tell them that I have just voted for a tax \ncut for the wealthiest people in America and I did it out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund.'' I would love to run against somebody who voted \nthat way. I would do my very best to hammer them into the ground, \nbecause it is an honest accusation and it is pointing out to the \nAmerican people what irresponsible conduct this Congress is capable of \nengaging in.\n  So I do not think it is any secret to the Speaker of the House or any \nof the House Republicans who voted for it. And, quite frankly, I do not \nthink it is going anywhere in the U.S. Senate. And in the unlikely \nchance it should also pass the Senate, I do not think there is a chance \nin the world that President Clinton--I do not care how weak he is or \nhow weak he is perceived to be, I can almost give you an ironclad \npromise he will veto that bill. And I promise you, the veto will not be \noverridden.\n  While President Clinton has been a friend of mine for 25 years--I \nguess longer than anybody in the Senate--he is a friend of mine, I do \nnot deny that, has been; we come from the same State; we share the same \npolitical friends at home. I do not have any doubt about his absolute \ncommitment on things like this. I am trusting him completely when he \nsays he will veto the bill, and, as I say, I am going to do everything \nthat I can to make sure it never reaches his desk.\n  Having said that, let me say one final thing. Madam President, in \n1981, Ronald Reagan said he would balance the budget by 1984. Ray \nThornton--a former Member of the House, told me his 81-year-old father-\nin-law said one day somebody told him, ``Ronald Reagan is going to \nbalance the budget by spending more money and cutting taxes''--take in \nless and spend more. He said, ``What a dynamite idea. I wonder why \nnobody ever thought of that before.''\n  The day Ronald Reagan held up his hand and was inaugurated, the \nnational debt was $1 trillion; and 8 years later when he left, it was \n$3.2 trillion. He managed to triple it in 8 years. But you know \nsomething? I voted with the President in 1981, not quite the way he \nsuggested, but I voted for the spending cuts that he proposed and \nagainst the tax cuts. Fritz Hollings and Bill Bradley and I were the \nonly three Senators who voted that way, and we would have balanced the \nbudget in 1984 if everybody had voted that way. But, as you know, \neverybody did not vote that way.\n  So what happened was, we wound up doubling defense spending within 4 \nyears after Ronald Reagan was elected President--doubled it within 4 \nyears. That was back when we found out, after throwing all that money \nat the Pentagon, they we were paying $7,000 for toilet seats and $7,000 \nfor coffee makers--the same thing everybody does when you throw that \nmuch money at them.\n  Madam President, I have said about all I want to say except, I will \nbe lying prostrate at the end of this cord in this aisleway the day \nthat tax cut passes here. I plead with my colleagues, let's do \nsomething completely apart from politics. Let's not do something that \nis as irresponsible as that is. Nobody, I guess, ever lost an election \nby voting for a tax cut.\n  People here are getting pretty apprehensive about voting against a \nso-called marriage penalty. The one thing you never hear is that many \nmarried people already have a bonus. There is a marriage penalty for \nsome, but many married people are a lot better off filing joint returns \nthan they are filing as single persons.\n  I would not mind addressing the problem of what the House did the \nother day which, I think, amounts to an average of $240 a year. That is \nabout $20 a month. Well, that is not beanbag for some people, but it is \nnot enough to rape and pillage the Social Security trust fund for when \nthose very people we are trying to help are also concerned about that \nSocial Security trust fund being viable when they get to 65 years of \nage. And you ask them, ``Would you rather be assured that the Social \nSecurity trust fund will be there for you when you retire or would you \nrather have a $20-a-month tax cut?'' Talk about no-brainers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, as I understood the parliamentary \nsituation, at the hour of 2 p.m. there will be 1\\1/2\\ hours to debate \nthe motion to proceed to the Internet bill. Is my understanding of that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business until 3:30.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Until 3:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11013-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11014-S11017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MAIL-ORDER CATALOG SALES\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I rise today to once again address an \nissue that I have addressed a number of times here in the U.S. Senate. \nIt deals with mail-order catalog sales. Everybody within earshot of my \nvoice knows what I am talking about because when they come home at \nnight and pick their mail up, they will find mail-order catalogs. At my \nhouse, the average is about 6 to 10 mail-order catalogs on a daily \nbasis. You can buy anything under the shining sun. If you save all of \nthose catalogs, sooner or later you will\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\nget one to offer you every product that can be bought in any retail \nhouse in America.\n  Now, I have two reasons for my strong feelings about this. No. 1, I \nwas a small town Main Street merchant, as well as a practicing lawyer. \nMost people don't know it, but I was the only lawyer in town--you are \nlistening to the whole South Franklin Bar Association right now--in a \nlittle town of 1,200 to 1,500 people.\n  When I got out of law school, I knew I wouldn't be able to make a \nliving practicing law so I bought back a business that my father had \nowned before he and my mother were tragically killed in an automobile \naccident. I was in law school in Chicago at the time, and 3 years later \nwhen I got out of law school, I had no intention of going back to the \nsmall town. I had left Arkansas to go to Chicago law school because I \ndidn't think Arkansas was nearly big enough for me. But because of that \nand the fact that Mrs. Bumpers' family all lived in this little town, \nwe went home and I bought the hardware, furniture and appliance \nbusiness that my father had owned, hoping that it would sustain me \nwhile I built my law practice.\n  Believe you me, I needed a lot of sustaining while I was building a \nlaw practice. People would walk into my office and say, ``Aren't you \nsort of a lawyer?'' And I would have to grudgingly admit yes, that is \nexactly what I was--``sort of a lawyer.''\n  So I speak today as a former retail merchant in a little country town \nin Arkansas called Charleston. But I also speak as the former Governor \nof Arkansas where in 1971 I had to raise the income tax because we felt \nthat the sales tax, which is a regressive tax, was already about as \nhigh as we could make it.\n  That was quite an undertaking because some of the wealthy people in \nmy State, many years before, had seen to it that the constitution of \nArkansas provided that any tax other than a sales tax would require a \n75-percent vote of both houses of the legislature. You think about \nthat. If you wanted to raise the sales tax, which affects working \npeople and poor people more than anybody else, it would only require a \n51-percent majority; but if you wanted to raise the income tax, which \nhit the wealthy people, it required a 75-percent vote. I remember it \ntook nine votes in the Arkansas State Senate before we passed an income \ntax bill. That bill, which raised the marginal rate from 4 to 7 \npercent, is the thing that made my State--I don't say this to boast, \nbut every economist and every political scientist will tell you that it \nis the one thing that made Arkansas fairly stable economically \nthereafter.\n  Do you know something? While it is a very volatile thing, I got a lot \nof hate mail when I was championing it, but I got about 65 percent of \nthe vote next time I ran, which shows that people are not dumb, if you \ngo to them and explain your actions. You can always trust the American \npeople to do the right thing. Winston Churchill once said, ``You can \nalways depend on the American people to do the right thing once they \nhave explored all the other possibilities.''\n  The truth of the matter is, when you talk sense to the American \npeople, they respond sensibly. So this problem of mail-order catalog \nhouses is simply this: If you wanted to come into my store and buy a \n$500 refrigerator, the tax on that was 5 percent, or $25. If you want \nto order that refrigerator from a mail-order catalog house in another \nState, there is no $25 tax, no tax of any kind. If you want to buy \nalmost anything under the shining sun, from a toboggan to hunting \nboots, you can find a mail-order catalog that sells those items. A lot \nof these companies will tell you in their advertising that there is no \nsales tax. They tell you ``no sales tax,'' even though, actually, 45 of \nthe 50 States in this country have what is called a ``use tax,'' and \nthat applies to out-of-State purchases.\n  Do you know what the problem with that is? You might say, well, what \nare you up there shouting and shooting your mouth off about if there is \nalready a use tax in 45 out of 50 States. I will tell you why. It is \nvery simple. The tax is on the purchaser, not the seller. So if I buy \nthat refrigerator and they said ``no sales tax,'' that is a deception.\n  Arkansas has a use tax, which is a tax on anything brought into the \nState. But the only problem is, it is on me and I don't even know the \ntax exists. I promise you--I don't know how many people are within \nearshot of what I am saying, but I guarantee you that precious few of \nthem know there is a use tax on anything they buy from a mail-order \ncatalog house. They don't know it, so they don't pay it.\n  Maine has become so frustrated that they have a provision in their \nincome tax return requiring them to multiply .004 or .0004, by your \nadjusted gross income and send it in. That is to make up for anything \nyou bought out of a mail-order catalog, whether you bought anything or \nnot. I said, in 1995--the last time I offered this amendment--that I \nthink it is very suspect, from a constitutional standpoint, to tax \npeople on mail-order sales when you didn't buy anything. Yet, Maine has \nbeen doing that.\n  A lot of people--for example, Indiana--do a little auditing from time \nto time. Ten thousand people in Indiana--and 1994 is the latest figures \nwe have--paid some kind of a use tax for buying stuff from mail-order \nhouses in another State. But what they collect is just nothing. In \n1994--again, the last year we have figures for--if mail-order catalog \nhouses in this country had collected sales taxes on all the merchandise \nthey sold into these States, they would have paid the States, counties \nand the cities in the neighborhood of $3 billion. My guess would be \nthat 4 years later, that is in the vicinity of $4 billion-plus, because \nretail sales have skyrocketed since 1994.\n  But, look, in 1994--as I say, the last time I debated this subject \nwas in 1995--in 1994, my State lost $19.6 million, California lost $482 \nmillion, Illinois lost $233 million. That is the reason the National \nGovernors' Conference, National Conference of Mayors, and the National \nAssociation of Municipalities favor my amendment. I have a list of the \nvarious organizations that support my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to have printed in the \nRecord a list of organizations that favor my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            Organizations supporting the Bumper's amendment\n\n       The International Council of Shopping Centers.\n       Marine Retailers Association of America.\n       National Home Furnishing Association.\n       North American Retail Dealers Association.\n       World Floor Covering Association.\n       National Conference of State Legislatures.\n       National Governors' Association.\n       National League of Cities.\n       National Association of Counties.\n       United States Conference of Mayors.\n       International City/County Management Association.\n       Council of State Governments.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator Graham and I are going to offer this amendment, \nif we get a chance, on this bill.\n  What brought all of this about? Well, first of all, it was about \n1967, the Supreme Court, in a decision commonly referred to as the \nNational Bellas Hess case, a big mail-order house. I forget where they \nare located. The Supreme Court said: You States, you cities, and you \ncounties may not charge a use tax on mail-order sales coming into your \nState from another State unless that mail-order house has a physical \npresence in your State. Eddie Bauer used to be just a mail-order house. \nNow Eddie Bauer has outlets in just about every State in the Nation.\n  For example, if you order something out of the Eddie Bauer catalog \nand you are a Maryland resident, they will charge you sales tax. You \ncan't buy it without paying the sales tax because they have a physical \npresence in Maryland. But most of these people like Lands' End and L.L. \nBean don't have a physical presence in your State and they don't \ncollect sales taxes. But the Supreme Court said in the National Bellas \nHess case, you can't charge sales tax or use tax on mail-order sales \nbecause it violates the due process clause, and it is a violation of \nthe interstate commerce clause. That sounds like the end of the story.\n  However, in 1992, the State of North Dakota challenged the Bellas \nHess decision. They went to the Supreme Court and said we think the \ncase was wrongly decided, and lo and behold, the Supreme Court agreed \nwith them on 50\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\npercent of it. They said it was no longer a violation of the due \nprocess clause for a State to require a mail-order house in another \nState to collect sales taxes for them. But the Court found that there \nwas still a violation of the interstate commerce clause. The Supreme \nCourt throughout its history has been very, very zealous in making sure \nthat we didn't pass any laws, or that no State passed a law, that \ninterfered with interstate commerce.\n\n  In that decision 25 years later, Quill versus North Dakota, the \nSupreme Court said requiring companies to collect use taxes was still a \nviolation of the interstate commerce clause unless Congress gives the \nstates permission to collect these taxes. So that is what I am \nattempting to do.\n  Senator Wyden is a dear friend, and one of the finest men to ever \nserve in the U.S. Senate, in my humble opinion. However, his bill \nprevents the states from passing any taxes on the Internet for a two \nyear period. My amendment would not exempt the Internet. My amendment \nwould make it possible for the states to require out-of-state companies \nto collect use taxes whether the products were sold over the Internet \nor via mail order catalog.\n  I chaired the Small Business Committee for a long time. I made \nspeeches about being a small businessman a lot of times on the floor of \nthe Senate. But you tell me, is it fair for a Main Street merchant to \ncollect sales taxes on every single thing he sells, from a loaf of \nbread on up, to support the fire department, to support the police, to \nsupport the local schools, to support everything under the shining sun \nin that community, that county, that State--is it fair for a Main \nStreet merchant who is there with the people, contributing to \neverything that comes down the pike--is it fair to make him collect the \nsales tax, but his competitors, who are selling $300-plus billion worth \nof things over the Internet by the year 2002 and over $100 billion a \nyear on mail-order sales, not collect a dime?\n  I stand corrected. There are a very, very few who do charge sales \ntaxes, just because they are good citizens.\n  Let me digress a moment to tell you who one of those good citizens \nis--none other than our distinguished Senator from Utah, Senator \nBennett.\n  Senator Bennett and some of his colleagues a few years ago started an \noffice supply business. He told me that as they sat around discussing \nvarious aspects of that business and how they were going to form it, \nand so on, the question came up: What are we going to do about sales \ntaxes? He said they talked about it and they concluded that they would \nbe a lot better citizens and would feel a lot better about it if they \njust voluntarily collected taxes on all of the office equipment that \nthey sold.\n  Incidentally, this business has some retail outlets here in \nWashington and in Maryland. They would now be required to collect the \nsales tax because they simply have a physical presence. But they did it \nlong before they were a physical presence; at one time they were a pure \nmail-order house.\n  Senator Bennett joined the Small Business Committee when I was \nchairman of that committee. In a hearing one day, he said, ``Don't let \nthem tell you how complex this is and how difficult it would be for \nthem to collect taxes in every State for every State municipality and \nevery county in the country.'' Senator Bennett says it is the easiest \nthing in the world. At the end of the month, they push a button on \ntheir computer and the checks go out.\n  One thing Senator Graham and I would do would be to give companies \nthe option of collecting a blended rate which covers all state and \nlocal taxes. By giving the companies this option, we can reduce the \nburden on remote sellers when local sales taxes vary within a state.\n  But the point I am trying to make is, Senator Bennett told me it is \nnot complicated to collect use taxes. When the debate begins on this \namendment, if and when it ever does, I hope my colleagues will take \nstock of the fact that one of their own colleagues says that is a \nbogus, specious argument.\n  Madam President, sometimes these mail-order houses say, ``Well, we \ndon't ask for any services. We don't need police protection. We don't \nneed fire protection. Our kids don't go to school in your State. So why \nshould we be penalized and be required to pay taxes when we are not a \nburden in your community and in your State?''\n  With these mail-order catalogs, one of the biggest problems States \nand municipalities particularly have is disposing of the waste in their \nlandfills. You ask them: What is one of the biggest problems you have \nin your landfills and operating your landfills? They will tell you it \nis the unbelievable, staggering tonnage of mail-order catalogs. If I \nthrow 10 of them a day away, multiply that by the people of this \ncountry who get those things every day, then call your mayors back home \nand ask them why they are for the Bumpers-Graham proposal. I will tell \nyou exactly why they are for it. They are for it because they have to \ndispose of that stuff. They are for it because they don't believe it is \nright to penalize Main Street merchants by making them collect all the \ntaxes and these people mailing things through the mail every day are \ngetting a free ride.\n  Back to Senator Wyden. As I said a moment ago, I don't know of any \nSenator--certainly not many Senators in the Senate--for whom I have as \nmuch respect as I have for Senator Wyden. But I don't agree with his \nbill either. When you consider the fact that I have been fighting the \nbattle for years--this losing battle, I might add--for years I have \nbeen fighting that losing battle with mail-order houses, which have \nincreased their sales to well over $100 billion a year, and the States \nare getting whacked, because they are not collecting the taxes on it. \nBut I say that is just a pittance compared to Internet sales and what \nthey are going to be 3 years from now.\n  According to an article in Time magazine--the most comprehensive \narticle I have read was in Time magazine dealing with this very subject \nof Internet sales. You can buy an automobile on the Internet. You can \nbuy tapes. You can buy movies. You can buy anything on the Internet.\n  Amazon Books I don't think has ever made a dime, and their stock is \njust shooting through the roof. What do you think about Main Street \nbookstores in the country that are paying taxes for the books they sell \nin Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia, but not Amazon? And Amazon \nsales are soaring.\n\n  But the final point I want to make is that sales of merchandise over \nthe Internet, that you would otherwise buy from a Main Street merchant, \nare calculated by the year 2002, no later than 2003, to be $300 \nbillion. Now, 5 percent of that in sales taxes, which is about the \naverage, is $15 billion a year that the States are not collecting--$15 \nbillion in taxes that the Main Street merchant is not getting, and it \nis a travesty.\n  You should never say on the Senate floor, ``I don't think my \namendment is going to pass.'' Considering the fact that in 1995 I did \nnot get one single Republican vote, I think it is fair to say I \nprobably ``ain't'' going to pick up a bunch of them next time. But you \nknow something. Somebody asked me one time, ``Why are you quitting? Why \nare you not running again?'' And I said, ``Because I have tackled too \nmany losing causes. I don't enjoy it. I don't enjoy losing anymore than \nNotre Dame enjoys losing a football game, and the few victories I get \nand I have had in the Senate are simply not enough to offset the trauma \nof the many losses I have sustained.''\n  And that is not to denigrate anybody. We are all independent here. We \nthink freely. We are supposed to be representing our constituents back \nhome. And I guess most people just look at this differently.\n  So I may not win this one either, in fact I probably won't. And that \ndoes not dampen my enthusiasm for what I am talking about, nor does it \ndampen the meritorious nature of what I consider a meritorious cause. I \nam going back to the beginning because I used to be a small town \nmerchant. I had to compete with big companies. I had to compete with \nmail-order houses even back then, in the 1950s and 1960s. And I did not \nenjoy a minute of it. I was on the school board. I was president of the \nchamber of commerce. I was chairman of the annual banquet of the \nchamber. I was chairman of the Christmas parade. I did all of those \nthings. And yet I had to compete with people who did not have any of \nthose responsibilities and did not contribute one red cent to my \nhometown or my home State. And\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\nyet for some reason or other, as meritorious as it seems to sound right \nnow, I don't know how other people justify their vote against this \nwhen, as I say, the mayors, the Governors, the city councilmen, \nmunicipalities, everybody under the shining Sun charged with the \nresponsibility of making their hometown and their home State function, \nfavors mine and Senator Graham's amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to speak for a few moments \nabout the action that was taken by the House of Representatives last \nweek in passing a tax cut for the middle-income, hard-working \nAmericans. I commend the House for doing that and hope that the Senate \nwill follow suit. I think it is very important that every year we give \nthe taxpayers back something of what they have worked so hard to earn \nwhen we are looking at a surplus. That is, in fact, what we are looking \nat.\n  You know, if I had said to my constituents 5 years ago, ``I'm running \nfor the U.S. Senate, and I'm going to balance the Federal budget,'' \nmost of them would have probably smiled benignly and thought, ``Oh, at \nleast she is naive enough to think that she can make a difference.''\n  Well, in fact, that is exactly what has happened. I did run saying \nthat I wanted to work to balance the budget. I did not promise that I \nwould come to Washington and do it alone, but I did say that this is \nsomething I thought our Congress should do. In fact, in the Congress \nthat came in in 1994, we did make the promise and keep the promise that \nwe would balance the Federal budget. In fact, this year, we will see \nthat balanced budget.\n  So then, of course, the question comes, What are we going to do with \nthe new surplus? Of course, there are lots of ideas. Of what we think \nis going to be a $1.5 trillion surplus over the next few years, the \nlion's share should go toward making sure that Social Security is \nsecure--no question about it. But an $80 billion tax cut every year, I \nthink, will stimulate the economy, will do what is right by America, \nand will correct some inequities that we have found in the Tax Code--\nthe major portion of what the House passed is the bill that I \nintroduced with Senator Faircloth last year and the year before; and \nthat is to reduce the marriage tax penalty.\n  In fact, if a policeman who makes about $33,000 a year in Houston, \nTX, marries a schoolteacher in Pasadena, TX, they have a penalty of \n$1,000, or a little more; and every person in those income categories \nin our country has the same. In fact, the average is about $1,400. Now, \nthis is a young couple who gets married that wants to start saving to \nbuy a new house or buy another car, have their nest egg, get started in \nlife. And they get hit with a $1,000 penalty.\n  That is not what was ever intended. But the Tax Code, because there \nare more two-income-earner couples now than when the last revision of \nthe Tax Code was passed, in fact, has penalized those two-income-\nearning couples, many of whom have two incomes because they are trying \nto make ends meet. So we are taking away a part of their quality of \nlife. So I commend the House for saying it is time to correct that \ninequity and it is our highest priority. I am pleased that they passed \nthe bill that Senator Faircloth and I introduced. It is our highest \npriority.\n  It will also help ease the burden for small business owners and \nfarmers and ranchers and others who have been able to accumulate \nsomething to realize the American dream; and that is, that they would \ngive their children a better start than they had by increasing the \ninheritance tax--the death tax--exemption to $1 million starting \nJanuary 1 of next year. I think that is the right thing to do. It will \nbegin to ease the tax on the elderly. I think we should do that.\n  We have already eased the capital gains tax. I hope we can eliminate \nthat. But, Madam President, I think it is important that we, every \nyear, make a little bit more progress in giving the hard-working \nAmericans more of the money they earn back to them so they can decide \nhow to spend the money for their families rather than having Government \ndecide for them.\n  I hope the Senate will pass tax cuts. It is a high priority. I think \nwe can have two goals that are very clear: We are going to save Social \nSecurity; and we are going to give a little bit of the money people \nwork so hard to earn back to them to get our Government in perspective.\n  I think it is time that we lowered the opportunities for spending at \nthe Federal level, let the States and local governments have more \nleeway, have families have better opportunities to spend the money they \nearn, and to make sure that Social Security is secure. I think those \nare the right priorities for spending that surplus. I hope the Senate \nwill follow suit.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the subject about which my colleague \nfrom Texas just spoke and the subject addressed by a couple of my \ncolleagues earlier today, the question of a proposed tax cut, is one \nthat I think will engender a great deal of debate in the coming weeks, \nnot with respect to the question of whether the American people could \nuse a tax cut or deserve a tax cut, not about whose money it is. The \nissue, instead, is going to be, that there is an election 5 weeks from \ntomorrow.\n  On Saturday of this past weekend, the House of Representatives passed \nan $80 billion tax cut. And the discussion by many, including those on \nthe other side of the aisle, and by those on the other side of the \nCapitol, is about what to do with the so-called ``surplus.''\n  I want to make the point again, as I have made before, that there is \nnot at this point a budget surplus, evidenced by the fact that even \nthough there are those who say there is a budget surplus, the Federal \ndebt will increase this year to next year, and next year to the year \nafter.\n  Now, why would the Federal debt be increasing if there is a surplus? \nThe answer is, the Federal debt is increasing because there is not a \nsurplus. What is called a surplus, in fact, is the Social Security \ndedicated funds that are to go into a ``trust'' fund to be used on \nbehalf of future generations.\n  This chart shows that what is called a surplus can only be called a \nsurplus if you take these Social Security funds and put them over here. \nTake the Social Security moneys away, and you don't have a surplus in \nthe 5-year budget window. Instead, you are short $130 billion. The \npoint is that, without using the Social Security revenues in the trust \nfund, there is no surplus.\n  Now, there have been two arguments made in the last days about this \nsubject. One is we are not using Social Security trust funds; the \nsecond is that we are only using 10 percent of the surplus. Those \narguments don't mean very much to me. These numbers do not lie.\n  The Federal debt will increase. To those who argue for this tax cut \nby saying that there is a surplus, I would simply point to the \nfollowing fact: the Federal debt will continue to increase because \nthere is no surplus.\n  We have made enormous progress in tackling this Federal budget \ndeficit. Most people would not have predicted we would have been this \nsuccessful. And we have very nearly balanced the Federal budget, but \nnot quite. We will have truly and honestly balanced the Federal budget \nwhen you can call it ``in balance'' without using the Social Security \ntrust funds, and that is not now the case.\n  If we here in the Senate debate using Social Security trust funds for \nthis tax cut, we should be honest and call it theft. It will be a \ntheft; yes, theft. It will be a theft to use the trust funds to give a \ntax cut. If that debate exists, I will offer an amendment to take the \nword ``trust'' out of the trust fund. Why call it a trust fund if \npeople reach in and grab the money and use it for something else?\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\n  I happen to believe that most of the recommendations on tax changes \nare recommendations that I support: Eliminating or substantially \nreducing the marriage tax penalty makes good sense; full deductibility \nfor health insurance for sole proprietorship, and I've supported that \nfor years. I can go down the list. All of them, or almost all of them, \nmake good sense.\n  But none of them make good sense if they are paid for with Social \nSecurity trust funds, the funds that were taken from American workers' \npaychecks and pledged to go into a trust fund to be used for only one \ndedicated purpose.\n  What the supporters of this tax cut are saying is, let us use those \nfunds now, 5 weeks from election day, so we can tell the American \npeople we gave them an $80 billion tax cut in the coming 5 years. I \nbelieve that those who support it should have to say, we took $80 \nbillion out of the Social Security trust funds. We took that money \ndespite the fact we told you we were going to save it for your future. \nWe took it and we used it for something else.\n  That is not honest budgeting. Try to do that in a business, try to \nclaim in a business that you have now reached a break-even stage, or \nyou are even seeing profits in your business because you have been able \nto take your employees' retirement funds and show them as part of your \nbusiness profit, you would get sent off to 5 years of hard tennis at \nsome minimum security prison someplace. That is against the law. You \ncan't do that. That is stealing from the funds. You can't do that. And \nyou ought not be able to do it in Congress.\n  One thing the American people ought to be able to rely on is that \nwhen taxpayers put money into trust funds that comes straight from \ntheir paychecks, and which we promise is going to stay in this trust \nfund to be used for their future, we ought not allow this money to be \nused, 5 weeks from an election day, so that the majority party can brag \nto the American people that they handed out a tax cut.\n  If they do that, and if they brag about it, I want them to brag with \nfull disclosure. Let's see if they will brag about taking money out of \nthe Social Security trust funds. That would be theft in any other \navenue of public or private life, and it ought to be theft here as we \ndescribe it.\n  This will consume a fair amount of debate in the coming couple weeks \nof the closing days of this Congress. I would like to see a tax cut. I \nsupport most of the provisions of the tax cut that was debated this \nweekend, but I will not ever support a proposition that says take the \ntrust funds from the Social Security accounts and use those to give a \ntax cut 5 weeks before the election.\n  That is not good government, not good politics, not good for this \ncountry's future. I hope in the next 10 or so days of legislative \nactivity those of us who feel that way will band together and say to \nthis majority that appears determined to want to do this that we will \nnot let them. When this country has truly balanced its budget, when we \nhave finished the job--and we have come a long way and made a great \ndeal of progress on fiscal policy--then, and only then, is it time to \ntalk about the kind of tax cuts that are being discussed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to take note of the \nfirst signs of progess in the Middle East peace process in many months. \nThis morning, Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu of Israel, and Chairman \nYasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority met with President Clinton \nat the White House to try to move the implementation of the stalled \nOslo peace ageeements forward.\n  While no agreement was reached, these talks produced enough progress \nfor the President to decide to send Secretary of State Albright and \nSpecial Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross to the Middle East next \nweek to try to bring the parties to an agreement. Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and Chairman Arafat are expecting to return to Washington in \nmid-October, with the hope that they will be able put the finishing \ntouches on a deal at that time.\n  The progress representated by today's meeting is significant, I \nbelieve, for several reasons. First, it reminds us of the essential \nneed for there to be strong American leadership if there is to be \nprogress on the Middle East. No Middle East peace agreement has ever \nbeen concluded without high-level U.S. involvement, and this time is no \ndiffernt. The personal attention of the President of the United States \nand the Secretary of State are crucial to advancing this process, \nespecially at a time when the parties have reached an impasse.\n  Among supporters of Israel, who long for it to live at peace with its \nneighbors, there is broad recognition of the centrality of the American \nrole in Middle East peacemaking. That certainly is the view expressed \nby a group of over 100 senior Jewish community leaders from California, \nin a letter they sent to Presdient Clinton last week.\n  This letter is signed by 105 prominent Jewish leaders (rabbis, \ncommunity activists, academics, and philanthropists). It expresses what \nI believe to be the widespread feeling of the American Jewish \ncommunity. In clear language, they appeal to the President not to lose \nsight of the essential American role in helping Israel reach the peace \nit is longing for. They write:\n\n       We have been strongly supportive of your Administration's \n     efforts to narrow the gaps between the two parties and help \n     them to reach an agreement. As in past Arab-Israeli \n     negotiations, the American role in getting both sides to say \n     yes is indispensable. Although mediating this complex dispute \n     can be a thankless task, and some naysayers may urge you to \n     put the peace process on the back burner, now is not the time \n     to stop searching for ways to help both peoples resolve their \n     differences.\n\n  Today's meeting shows that the President shares their sense of \nurgency and is taking it to heart.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter and the 105 signatories be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Today's meeting is also important, not just because \nof what it says about the process and the U.S. role, but also for what \nthe prospect is that it can yield an agreement in just a few more days \nor a few weeks. Far too much time has been lost.\n  Israel and the Palestinians have been stuck for months on how to \ncomplete the interim agreements launched by the Oslo process, so that \nthey can move on to the critical final status talks. These interim \ntalks deal with hard and important questions: How much of the West Bank \nIsrael will redeploy from, what steps the Palestinian Authority will \ntake to ensure a sustained crackdown on terrorist groups, how the \nsecurity services of the two sides will work together to prevent acts \nof terrorism, and the understanding that both sides must refrain from \nunilateral actions that undermine the other side's confidence in the \npeace process.\n  Nothing about these talks is easy, but the time has long since come \nfor both sides to take politically difficult, but fundamentally \nnecessary, decisions that will allow this process to move forward. \nIsrael's security and Palestinian dreams of self-determination can only \nbe realized through a mutually agreed permanent peace agreement.\n  To the extent that today's meeting and the talks set for upcoming \ndays represent a chance to complete the interim agreements and begin \nfinal status talks, there is reason for hope. The final status talks--\nwhich are supposed to be completed by May 4, 1999, but will probably \ntake much longer--are going to be difficult enough. They will deal with \nthe hardest questions of all: sovereignty, settlements, refugees, \nwater, and Jerusalem.\n  Every day these final status talks are delayed, they only become more \ndifficult. Every day they are delayed, the temptation on each side to \ntake unilateral measures only increases. Every day they are delayed is \nanother opportunity for extremists on each side to use violence to try \nto destroy the chances for peace altogether.\n  If the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority are truly \ncommitted to peace, as I believe they are, they cannot let that happen. \nThey must work hard in the next several days to complete the interim \nagreement, and then move quickly to make progress in the final status \ntalks.\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\n  At this season of renewal in the Jewish calendar, when a new year and \nnew beginnings are at hand, it is my hope and prayer that a new day may \nat last be dawning in the lives of Israelis and Palestinians. For that \nto happen, their leaders, with the strong support of the United States, \nmust act to now to seize the opportunities that are before them.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 24, 1998.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As American Jews dedicated to Israel's \n     security and to a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, we want to \n     express our appreciation for your steadfast commitment to the \n     Jewish state and its quest for a secure peace.\n       As you face the many formidable challenges confronting your \n     Administration and our country, we urge you to reestablish \n     the Middle East peace process as an urgent American priority. \n     We believe it is important for the U.S. to encourage Israel \n     and the Palestinian Authority to redouble their efforts to \n     achieve an agreement on further Israeli redeployment and \n     enhanced security measures as soon as possible. The longer \n     this process drags on inconclusively, the greater the danger \n     of a total collapse of the entire peace process, which \n     inevitably will lead to more violence and bloodshed.\n       We have been strongly supportive of your Administration's \n     efforts to narrow the gaps between the two parties and help \n     them to reach an agreement. As in past Arab-Israeli \n     negotiations, the American role in getting both sides to say \n     yes is indispensable.

Polls consistently show that this position \n     reflects the widespread feeling in the American Jewish \n     community. We hope that, buoyed by this support, you will \n     keep striving to remove obstacles from the road to a secure \n     Arab-Israeli peace.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\nsignatories to letter to president bill clinton from california jewish \n                                leaders\n\n       Rabbi Mona Alfi, Sacramento; Eric Alon, Palos Verdes Estes; \n     Rabbi Melanie Aron, Los Gatos; Arnold J.

Madam President, on September 26, people all across \nAmerica joined in the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's ``Walk to Cure \nDiabetes.''\n  Today, approximately 16 million Americans suffer from diabetes. Heart \nand kidney disease, strokes, blindness, loss of limbs, and nerve damage \nare just some of the complications associated with this dread disease. \nAn estimated 179,000 people die from this deadly disease and its \ncomplications every year. Unfortunately, diabetes rates are growing \nworldwide.\n  I rise today to commend the ``Walk to Cure Diabetes,'' which is an \neffort to increase public awareness about this disease and to raise \nprivate sector funding for the search for a cure.\n  In Albuquerque, my hometown, hundreds of New Mexicans participated in \nthe ``Walk to Cure Diabetes.'' They joined thousands of Americans who \nwalked and ran to raise more than $40 million to support research for \nbetter diagnosis, treatment and, ultimately, a cure to diabetes.\n  I am heartened by the fact that participation in this grassroots \neffort is growing in New Mexico, where diabetes hits especially hard \namong our American Indian and Hispanic people. Among these populations, \nthis disease is exacting a devastating toll.\n  I would like to thank the ``Team Domenici'' runners, most of whom are \nassociated with Albuquerque's Mountainside YMCA, who will represent my \nsupport for this endeavor. These ``Walk to Cure Diabetes'' team members \nincluded: Mary Howell, Chris Howell, Loretta Koski, Rosanna Thomas, Kim \nBabb, Loren Schneider, Mike Green, Chrissy Dukeminier, Becky Voccio, \nStephanie Browne, Carole Smith, Jim Hughes, Debby Baness, and Lisa \nBreeden.\n  Where the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and other organizations work \nto shore up private sector support, I am pleased that Congress and the \nadministration have strengthened the federal government's investment in \ndiabetes treatments and the search for a cure.\n  When we negotiated the five-year Balanced Budget Agreement in 1997, I \nwas pleased to have initiated $30 million annually for a five-year \nIndian Health Service (IHS) diabetes treatment effort aimed at American \nIndian populations where diabetes rates are almost three times the rate \nin the general population. We also provided another $150 million over \nfive years for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for a similar \neffort aimed specifically at juvenile diabetes.\n  As part of these national efforts, new resources will be put toward \nunderstanding Type 1 diabetes, which adversely afflicts thousands of \nyoung Americans. This form of diabetes occurs when the insulin-\nproducing cells in the pancreas are inexplicably destroyed.\n  This infusion of federal resources will also allow the IHS and CDC to \nestablish a Diabetes Prevention Research Center in Gallup, N.M., to \ndevelop coordinated preventative efforts to help control the growing \nnumber of diabetes cases among American Indians.\n  Dr. Gerald Bernstein of the American Diabetes Association has \nreported that the gene that predisposes a person to diabetes is five \ntimes more prevalent in American Indians than in whites, and twice as \nprevalent in blacks, Hispanics and Asians than in non-Hispanic whites. \nIn the 1950's, the IHS officially reported negligible rates of diabetes \namong Navajo Indians. In less than 50 years, diabetes has gone from \nnegligible to rampant and epidemic.\n  In part, the diabetes problem in the United States can be helped by \nlifestyle changes among those people predisposed to the disease. A \nconcerted effort is needed to teach people how proper nutrition, early \ndetection and treatment can help save lives. This will not be easy. In \nthe case of Navajo and Zuni Indians, for example, prevention can be \ndifficult to incorporate into\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\ndaily reservation life. Exercise programs may not be readily available, \ndietary changes may be contrary to local custom for preparing foods, or \nsoft drinks may be routinely substituted for drinking water that is not \nplentiful or potable.\n  These kinds of factors in Indian life will be studied carefully at \nthe Gallup Diabetes Prevention Research Center. Recommendations and CDC \nassistance will be provided to IHS service providers throughout the \nNavajo Nation, the Zuni Pueblo, and other Apache and Pueblo Indians in \nNew Mexico and Arizona. The improved diagnostic and prevention programs \nwill flow from this Gallup center to all IHS facilities around the \ncountry.\n  Through these efforts we hope diabetes rates will drop, and not \ncontinually increase as they have for the past four decades. The number \nof U.S. diabetes cases reported annually between 1980 and 1994 has \nrisen steadily, from 5.5 million cases to 7.7 million cases. The number \nof diagnosed cases is up from 1.6 million Americans in 1958.\n  The human toll is devastating and the medical costs of treating \ndiabetes will continue to escalate unless our medical and prevention \nresearch efforts are more successful. While we still have not found a \ncure for diabetes, enough is known today to significantly control the \nnegative end results of diabetes like blindness, amputation, and kidney \nfailure.\n  The ```Walk to Cure Diabetes'' has been helpful in raising public \nawareness of the growing diabetes problem. I am pleased that we in the \nSenate join this effort through federal funding, policy initiatives and \nmoral support.\n  Madam President, I would encourage my colleagues to note the 1998 \n``Walk to Cure Diabetes.'' It is one step in the American quest to \nattack this awful disease and improve the situation for all the people \nwho are susceptible to the ravages of diabetes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11019-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11020-S11021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      URGENT SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I come to the floor not to discuss the \npros and cons of an urgent supplemental, or any of the ingredients \ncontemplated to be within it, but to render an accounting to the \nSenate, as best I can, of the request that the President has made for \nurgent supplemental funding that would come as an emergency funding, \nwhich means we would be spending the surplus that we have worked so \nhard to protect to pay for these items.\n  The calculations that the Budget Committee staff has worked up for me \nwould indicate that, as of now, the President's requests amount to \n$14.148 billion. That means that the President asks us to spend $14.148 \nbillion for such things as agriculture emergencies, Y2K emergencies--\nthe computer situation that may result in a disaster if we don't try to \nuse some new system and the purchase of new computers to alleviate the \nproblem that may occur in the year 2000--there is some Bosnia money; \nembassy security money; interior security, or terrorism money; state \nembassies money; treasury security; and an economic support fund. They \nare listed in detail in this statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this part of the budget bulletin, issued \nby the Budget Committee staff on September 28, which encapsulates these \nand then goes through a narrative as to how each one has occurred, be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Emergency, Emergency: Who's Got the Request?\n\n\n     President's pending request fiscal year 1998 emergency funding\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\n        Request                                                  Amount\nY2K, contingency..................................................3,250\nAgriculture:\n  President.......................................................1,800\n  Daschle/Harkin (net impact).....................................5,200\nDefense:\n  Bosnia \\1\\......................................................1,859\n  Embassy Security..................................................200\n  Disaster Recovery.................................................224\n  Disaster Recovery, contingency.................................... 30\nInterior--Security: Terrorism.......................................  6\nState--Embassies..................................................1,398\nJustice............................................................. 22\nTreasury--Security.................................................. 90\nFunds to President:\n  Economic Support Fund............................................. 50\n  Security Assistance............................................... 20\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Total......................................................14,148\n\n\\1\\ FY 1999 Emergency Funding.\n\n       In terms of how much emergency spending has come out of the \n     surplus, the Bulletin notes that $5.7 billion in FY 1998 \n     supplemental emergency appropriations has already been \n     enacted since the beginning of the year. The continuing issue \n     for this week is how much additional emergency spending does \n     the President thus far want to take from the surplus: $14.1 \n     billion for a 1998 total of $19.8 billion.\n       Last week's Bulletin, expected that the President's \n     requests for emergency appropriations for both Fiscal Year \n     1998 and 1999--but not yet acted upon by Congress--total $8.0 \n     billion.\n       Following last week's Bulletin, on Tuesday, September 22, \n     President Clinton made official the Administration's request \n     for emergency funding in a number of areas, that had been \n     assumed would be requested but had not been official \n     transmitted to Congress.\n       The Bulletin now believes it can accurately quantify the \n     President's emergency requests pending before Congress. The \n     table above allocates the pending $14.148 billion of \n     Presidential emergency request to each affected agency, \n     except for Y2K contingency appropriations. The Y2K emergency \n     appropriation request transmitted on September 2 would be \n     made available to the Office of the President for \n     unanticipated needs to be transferred as necessary to \n     affected agencies.\n       Officially, the September 22 emergency request for \n     agricultural programs was for $1.8 billion. However, \n     President Clinton states: ``The proposals I am transmitting \n     today do not include income assistance to farmers for low \n     commodity prices. On September 10, Secretary Glickman \n     communicated the Administration's support for such assistance \n     through Senators Daschle and Harkin's proposal to remove the \n     cap on marketing loan rates for 1998 crops.'' CBO estimates \n     the 1999 cost of such a proposal would reach $6.2 billion, \n     with repayments in 2000 of nearly $1.0 billion. Hence, the \n     table below includes a net cost for this Clinton supported \n     emergency proposal of $5.2 billion.\n       On September 22 the President requested $1.8 billion for \n     emergency expenses arising from the ``consequences of recent \n     bombings of our embassy facilities.''\n       The President has still not requested amounts anticipated \n     for defense readiness. The President did send a letter to \n     Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Strom Thurmond, on \n     September 22 stating that: ``I have asked key officials of my \n     Administration to work together over the coming days to \n     develop a fully offset $1 billion funding package for these \n     [defense] readiness programs.'' But this does not constitute \n     an official request for emergency defense funding from the \n     Administration.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I do not pass judgment on whether each \nand every one of these is something we should fund, nor whether each \nand every one of them is something we should not fund. I merely want to \nstate to the Senate, and to those who are interested, that there seems \nto be a big argument going on now as to what is happening to the \nsurplus and whether or not the Republicans in the U.S. House who want a \ntax bill are spending the surplus.\n  Actually, I will tell everybody that in the first year, the 1999 \nyear, that bill spends $7 billion of the surplus--if anybody is \ninterested. The President's request for supplemental funding, emergency \nfunding, not included in the budget--therefore, using the same fund--in \nthe first year already amounts to $14.148 billion, and I believe I can \nsay it is growing, because there is nothing in this number for special \nmoneys that the Defense Department might need. There is some indication \nof a billion dollars for readiness. But the President's people are \nquick to say that won't be new money, it will be offset. Well, we will \nsee what they are offsetting it with.\n  The chiefs of staff are meeting here in the Congress to tell us what \nthey think they need for readiness, and I understand their message is \nnot a good one. It is one that says we are really getting behind with \nreference to the kinds of things needed to keep a strong military which \nis totally built around voluntarism--such things as getting behind in \nthe amount of pay we are giving them, the kind of pensions we are \ngiving them, and the readiness equipment. So we don't have anything in \nthis accumulation that equals $14.148 billion. There is nothing for \nthat part of anything that would be an emergency.\n  I want to make one observation. Again, on this occasion, in speaking \nto the Senate and to anybody interested, I am not passing judgment on \nthe use of the surplus for any of these things, I am merely saying that \nthere is one surplus and there are two ways to use it. One is to spend \nit; one is to cut taxes.\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\n They both, in a sense, spend it, or some small portion of it. I just \nwant everybody to know that the President of the United States, who \nseems to be saying, ``Don't cut any taxes,'' is at the same time \nsaying, however, ``Give me $14.148 billion in new money,'' out of that \nsame surplus for things that the country needs that he calls \nemergencies. They are all listed and they are all detailed in this \nstatement that has been printed in the Record.\n  I repeat, I don't believe, from the surplus standpoint, that there is \nany difference between the two. In other words, if you want to spend a \nhuge amount of the surplus and you want to spend it for $100 billion \nworth of American programs, needed or otherwise, you have diminished it \nby $100 billion. If you choose to cut taxes by $100 billion, you have \ndiminished this surplus by $100 billion. It is the same diminution. It \nis the same reduction, the exact same effect. We estimate the surplus \nto be $1.6 trillion over the next decade. And now we will engage here \nand elsewhere in a debate with reference to these emergency \nsupplementals, which will be year long, which will spend some of \nthat. We will engage in a discussion of whether there should be some \nfor tax cuts.\n\n  I repeat. The tax cut bill that the House proposed in the first year \nis $7 billion. The new expenditures requested by the President is $14.1 \nbillion. It seems to me that deserves consideration when we start \nsaying we shouldn't have tax cuts, but we should spend the money.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11020-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11021-S11039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of debate of Senate bill 2176, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2176) to amend sections 3345 through 3349 of \n     title V, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Vacancies Act'') to clarify statutory requirements relating \n     to vacancies in and appointments to certain Federal offices, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, the Senate today will vote on whether \nto invoke cloture on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This \nlegislation, which enjoys bipartisan cosponsorship, is necessary to \nrestore the Senate's authority as an institution in the process of \nappointing important Federal officials.\n  Madam President, I request that I be allotted 20 minutes of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I want to make sure that we reserve \nplenty of time for the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd, who is really in many ways the author of this legislation \nand has been such a guiding light and firm supporter for so long a \nperiod of time.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides that\n\n       The President shall nominate, and by and with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other \n     public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court and \n     all other officers of the United States, whose appointments \n     are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be \n     established by law, but the Congress may by law vest the \n     appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, \n     in the President alone, in the courts of law, or the heads of \n     departments.\n\n  This is an important provision of the Constitution's system of checks \nand balances.\n  The Supreme Court, in 1997, said that the appointments clause ``is \nmore than just a matter of etiquette or protocol; it is among the \nsignificant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.'' By \nrequiring the participation of the Senate with the President and \nselecting officers, the framers believed that persons of higher quality \nwould be appointed than if one person alone made those appointments.\n  One of the ways in which those persons would be better would be in \nrespecting individual liberties.\n  So the appointments clause serves to protect better government \nadministration and the rights of the American people.\n  The appointments clause was also adopted because manipulation of \nofficial appointments was one of the revolutionary generation's \ngreatest grievances against executive power.\n  As participants in the appointments process, we Senators have an \nobligation, I believe, to ensure that the appointments clause functions \nas it was designed, and that manipulation of executive appointments not \nbe permitted. Nonetheless, we also need to recognize that despite the \nappointments clause, there will be times when officers die or resign in \noffice. Their duties should continue to be performed by someone else on \na temporary basis. It may not be possible as a matter of logistics that \neach temporary official serving as an acting officer in a position \nsubject to the appointments clause will himself or herself receive \nSenate confirmation. Early Congresses recognized the need for persons \nto serve temporarily in advice and consent positions when vacancies \narose, even when the person had not received Senate confirmation.\n\n  The Vacancies Act has existed one way or another since then, with \nlength of temporary service increasing to 120 days in legislation that \nwas passed in 1988. The 1886 Vacancies Act was intended to provide the \nexclusive means for filling temporary appointments. And it has operated \nthat way for several years.\n  However, in 1973, the Justice Department, in seeking to appoint a \ntemporary FBI Director in the midst of the Watergate scandal, appointed \nL. Patrick Gray without complying with the terms of the Vacancies Act. \nThe Department for the first time made a public declaration that its \norganic statute created an alternative method for designating temporary \nappointments at the Department of Justice not subject to any time limit \nwas there position. Since 1973 the Department has continued to make \nacting appointments outside the strictures of the Vacancies Act.\n  The Justice Department relies on its organic statute's ``vesting and \ndelegation'' provision, which states that the Attorney General can \ndesignate certain other powers to whomever she chooses in the \nDepartment, since specific statutory functions were not given to the \nsubordinate officials. The Department makes this claim although current \nlaw states that a\n\n       . . . temporary appointment . . . to perform the duties of \n     another under the Vacancies Act . . . may not be made \n     otherwise than as provided by the Vacancies Act.\n\n  But the Justice Department's organic statute was designed simply to \ncoordinate all Federal Government litigation, and did not change the \nVacancies Act.\n  The legislative history of the Department's organic statute confirmed \nthis. In 1988, Congress, recognizing that the Justice Department was \nnot applying the Vacancies Act as Congress clearly intended, sought to \namend the act to make it more clear. They changed the law to eliminate \nthis unsupported position of the Justice Department largely through the \nefforts of Senator John Glenn of Ohio. The Department of Justice, \nhowever, refused to read the language as Congress intended, relying on \nits same old arguments.\n  As a result, the Department of Justice believes that the Attorney \nGeneral can designate acting officers for 2 or even 3 years. The head \nof the Criminal Division--an important position with respect to \nguidance in Federal prosecutions, including independent counsel--was \nvacant for 2\\1/2\\ years without a nomination.\n  An acting Solicitor General served an entire term at the Supreme \nCourt, and no nomination for the position was ever sent to the Senate. \nEven the administration claims that an acting person can serve for only \n120 days. But after an acting person served for 181 days, the \nadministration designated another person to serve as the Acting \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n  Today all 14 Departments have similar language in their organic \nstatutes. Now many Departments, at DOJ's urging, are claiming similarly \nthat the Vacancies Act doesn't apply to them either as an exclusive \nmeans for filling vacancies.\n  There is no time limit on temporary services. That has been adhered \nto under the organic statutes, making both the Vacancies Act and the \nappointments clause effective nullities,\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\naccording to the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General disagrees \nwith the Justice Department's reading of current law, and all of the \nother Departments who have tagged along after the Justice Department.\n  Each Department has at least one temporary officer now who has served \nlonger than 120 days, allowed by the Vacancies Act. The nomination \nshould be able to be sent to the Senate within 4 months. Since the \nPresident lacks any inherent authority to make appointments for offices \nthat require Senate confirmation, the President's noncompliance with \nthe Vacancies Act means noncompliance with the Constitution.\n  As of earlier this year, when the Governmental Affairs Committee held \nits hearing on oversight of the Vacancies Act, of the 320 executive \nDepartment's advice and consent positions, 64 were held by temporary \nofficials. Of the 64, 43 served longer than 120 days before a \nnomination was even submitted to the Senate. Other Departments are \nfollowing Justice's lead.\n  The acting head of the Census Bureau is neither the first assistant, \nnor a person who has been confirmed by the Senate, which is what the \nVacancies Act currently requires.\n  Of the nine vacant advice and consent positions at Commerce, seven \nhave been filled by acting officers for more than 120 days. And one had \nbeen acting temporarily for 3 years.\n  It is true that the Senate has not always acted on nominees as soon \nas it should. But that issue should be addressed separately.\n  Many of the criticisms of the Senate's handling of the nominations is \nunwarranted since vacancies often remain open for lengthy periods \nbefore nominations are submitted.\n  The Senate is now being publicly criticized for holding up the \nconfirmation of Richard Holbrooke to be the U.N. Ambassador, for \nexample, when in fact the administration has not even submitted his \nnomination to the Senate. The fact is that the administration is under \na current statutory duty to have acting officers serve for 120 days, \nwhich can be extended simply by the administration sending the Senate a \nnominee.\n  That means that if the Senate does not act it has to bear the \nresponsibility for an acting person's service at that point. \nResponsibility is clearly placed where it belongs if an acting person \ncontinues to serve. But since the administration does not follow \nexisting law, the Senate in many instances never gets a chance to even \nconsider a permanent nominee.\n  Under the administration's view, the entire set of confirmed \nofficials in our Government could resign the day after they were \nconfirmed, and acting officials who have not received the advice and \nconsent of the Senate can run the Government indefinitely.\n  That situation is completely at odds with what constitutional scheme \nand the framers created to protect individual liberties.\n  There is another reason this bill should be enacted--the Court ruling \nrecently that undermines the Vacancies Act further. Under the current \nlaw, if a vacancy in a covered position occurs, the first assistant to \nthat officer becomes the acting officer for up to 120 days. In the \nalternative, the President can designate another Senate confirmed \nofficer to act as the acting officer for 120 days. The 120 days can be \nextended if the President submits a permanent nominee for the position \nto the Senate. That creates an incentive for the President to submit \nnominations to the Senate. Recent court interpretations have greatly \nconfined the operation of the Vacancies Act.\n  In March, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia circuit approved the legality of actions taken by an acting \ndirector of the Office of Thrift Supervision who had served for 4 years \nwithout a nomination for the position ever having been submitted to \nthis body. The Senate-confirmed director resigned in 1992 and purported \nto delegate all of his authority to OTS' deputy director for Washington \noperations. This person, who was neither the first assistant nor the \nSenate-confirmed individual, served as the acting director until \nOctober 1996.\n  The President then invoked the Vacancies Act to designate a confirmed \nHUD official to serve as the acting director and submitted the \nnomination to the Senate for the position within 120 days. The bank \nchallenging the legality of the acting officer's appointment argued \nthat the 120 days had expired 120 days after the Senate-confirmed \ndirector's resignation created a vacancy, long before the Senate-\nconfirmed person was named the acting officer. But the Court held that \nthe 120 days is a limitation only on how long an acting officer can \nserve, not a limitation on how soon after the vacancy arises that the \nPresident must submit a nomination.\n  It allowed the later Senate-confirmed director to ratify the actions \nof the prior acting director. Thus, if there is no first assistant, the \nPresident can wait for 4 years to send a nomination to the Senate while \nan acting official, in this case selected by the head of the agency, \nnot the President, runs an important agency. This is not what the \nframers thought that they had established. It runs contrary to the \nVacancies Act itself and corrective action therefore is necessary.\n  In any case, this administration, as stated above, has allowed many \nacting officers to serve for more than 120 days as permitted by the \nVacancies Act without submitting a nomination to the Senate. The \nVacancies Act presently has no enforcement mechanism, so once again the \nSenate's constitutional advice and consent prerogative is undermined. \nIn Federalist Paper 76 Hamilton cautioned that:\n\n       A man, who had himself the sole disposition of offices, \n     would be governed much more by his private inclinations and \n     interests than when he was bound to submit the propriety of \n     his choice to the discussion and determination of a different \n     and independent body; and that body, an entire branch of the \n     legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong \n     motive to care in proposing.\n\n  So by disregard of the Vacancies Act and installing at its sole \ndisposition numerous officials to important positions in the Government \nwho escape the independent body's review is contrary to the original \nintent of the framers. Without a possibility of rejection, there is \nmuch less care taken in the proposing. S. 2176 will restore the \nconstitutional balance and cloture should be invoked on the bill.\n  Madam President, let me briefly discuss the provisions of S. 2176. \nUpon the death, resignation or inability to serve of an officer of an \nexecutive Agency, the first assistant to the officer becomes the acting \nofficer subject to the bill's time limits. Because of additional \nbackground processing that is now required of nominees, the bill \nproposes lengthening the time of acting service from the current 120 \ndays to 150 days.\n  If the President so directs, a person who has already received Senate \nconfirmation to another position can be made the acting officer in lieu \nof the first assistant. This is basically the framework, Madam \nPresident, that is currently the law except we are extending the time \nperiod that the President has within which to make his decision. The \nfirst assistant has to have served 180 days in the year preceding the \nvacancy in order to be the acting officer, in order for someone to be \nput in in a very short period of time to be the first assistant so that \nthey may then be appointed the acting officer.\n  The acting officer may serve 150 days beginning on the date the \nvacancy occurs. The acting officer may continue to serve beyond 150 \ndays if the President submits a nomination for the position even if \nthat occurs after the 150th day. So at the 150-day expiration, the \nPresident still has it within his sole discretion to make the \nnomination; just simply send the nomination up and the acting officer \ncan come back once again and assume his duties. If a first or second \nnomination is withdrawn, rejected, or returned, the person can serve as \nthe acting officer until 150 days after the withdrawal, rejection, or \nreturn.\n  Recognizing the large number of positions that are to be filled in a \nnew administration, the bill extends the 150-day period by 90 days for \nany vacancies that exist when a new President is inaugurated or that \narise in the 60 days following a new Presidential inauguration.\n\n  The bill will extend the provisions of the Vacancies Act to cover all \nadvice and consent positions in executive Agencies except those that \nare covered by express specific statute that provide for acting \nofficers to carry out the functions and duties of the office. Forty-one \ncurrent statutes now allow\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\nthe President or the head of an executive Department to designate or \nprovide automatically for a particular officer to become an acting \nofficer. The bill also exempts multimember commissions, and it retains \nholdover provisions of current law.\n  The bill expressly states that vesting and delegation statutes do not \nconstitute statutes that govern the appointment of acting officers to \nspecific positions. The bill will thus end the specious argument of the \nJustice Department that it and other Departments' organic statutes \nprovide an additional means, and really a superseding means of \nappointing acting officials apart from the Vacancies Act.\n  The bill also creates an enforcement mechanism for the Vacancies Act, \nsomething that is also sorely needed. Today, acting officers regularly \nexceed the 120-day limitation without consequence. Under 2176, an \noffice becomes vacant if 150 days after the vacancy arises no \nPresidential nomination for the position has been submitted to the \nSenate. For offices other than the heads of Agencies, the functions and \nduties that are specifically to be performed only by the vacant officer \ncan be performed by the head of that particular agency. That means that \nall functions and duties of every position can be performed at all \ntimes. But if a nomination is not submitted within the Vacancies Act \nperiod, only the head of the Agency can perform the specific duties of \nthe vacant offices. Hopefully, that will create an incentive for the \nPresident to go ahead and submit a nomination. As soon as the \nnomination is submitted, the acting officer can then resume performing \nthe duties and functions of the vacant office. No one may ratify any \nactions taken in violation of the bill's vacant office provisions.\n  Madam President, this approach will not penalize the acting person in \nany way, but it will encourage the submission of nominees within 150 \ndays without jeopardizing the performance of any Government function if \nthat deadline is missed.\n  The Vacancies Reform Act also establishes a reporting procedure. Each \nAgency head will report to the General Accounting Office on the \nexistence of vacancies, the person serving in an acting capacity, the \nnames of any nominees, and the date of disposition of such nominee. The \nComptroller General will then report to the Congress, the President, \nand the Office of Personnel Management on the existence of any \nviolations of the Vacancies Act. This will provide useful information \nto the President so he will know the progress of the 150-day clock and \nwill benefit the Senate as well.\n  This bill has been modified to take into account objections raised by \nmembers of the committee and elsewhere as well as the administration. \nIn committee, we lengthened the Presidential transition period. We \npermitted the President to name an acting officer by submitting a \nnomination even after the 150-day period has expired. We agreed to \nconsider shortening the length of service prior to the vacancy a first \nassistant must satisfy to become an acting officer. This bill is \ninstitutional and not partisan. Members should vote for cloture in \nrecognition of the fact that the Senate and the Presidency will not \nalways be controlled by the parties that control these institutions \ntoday, and in recognition of the duty that we all share to uphold the \nConstitution and protect the legitimate prerogatives of this \ninstitution.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nlegislative fellow on my Governmental Affairs subcommittee staff, \nAntigone Potamianos, be granted floor privileges during consideration \nof S. 2176.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nWest Virginia as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Thompson, who is chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in the Senate. Let me commend him and his committee for \nreporting this bill. That committee has worked long and hard and very \nindustriously in an effort to craft legislation that, in its final \nanalysis, goes a long way toward protecting the prerogatives of the \nSenate under the Constitution, in particular with reference to the \nappointments clause, which appears in article II, section 2, of the \nConstitution.\n  Madam President, nearly two weeks ago, on September 15th, I had the \nhigh privilege of addressing my colleagues in the Old Senate Chamber as \npart of the Leadership Lecture Series sponsored by the distinguished \nMajority Leader. In my remarks, I emphasized two points which I thought \nwere important for all Senators to consider. First, I maintained that, \nif the legislative branch were to remain a coequal branch of our \ngovernment, then it must be eternally vigilant in protecting the powers \nand responsibilities vested in it by the Constitution. Secondly, I \nnoted that, throughout its history, the Senate has been blessed with \nindividuals who were willing to rise above party politics, and instead \nact in the best interest of this nation and this institution.\n  The legislation before us today goes to precisely the type of concern \nI raised in my remarks. S. 2176, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, \nwould strengthen existing law, thus protecting the Senate's \nconstitutional ``Advice and Consent'' role in the process of nominating \nand appointing the principal officers of our government. And, because \nthis bill speaks to the very integrity of the separation of powers and \nthe system of checks and balances embedded in our Constitution, it is a \nmeasure which I believe all Senators can support, regardless of party \naffiliation.\n  To give my colleagues some idea of the dimensions of this problem, \nearlier this year, I asked my staff to survey the various cabinet-level \ndepartments to ascertain how many of these so-called ``advice and \nconsent'' positions were being filled in violation of the Vacancies \nAct. I can report that the trend is disturbing: Of the 320 departmental \npositions subject to Senate confirmation, 59, or fully 18 percent, were \nbeing filled in violation of the Vacancies Act. At the Department of \nLabor, for example, one-third of all advice and consent positions were \nbeing filled in violation of the Vacancies Act. At the Department of \nCommerce, 9 of 29, or 31 percent, of those positions were being filled \nin violation of the Act. And, at the Department of Justice, 14 percent \nof the advice and consent positions were being filled by individuals in \ncontradiction of the Vacancies Act. Clearly a problem exists.\n  As my colleagues know, the process used by the President to staff the \nexecutive branch is laid out in the Appointments Clause of the \nConstitution. That clause, found in Article II, section 2, states, in \npart, that the President\n\n       . . . shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and \n     Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other \n     public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, \n     and all other Officers of the United States, whose \n     Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which \n     shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest \n     the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think \n     proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in \n     the Heads of Departments.\n\n  Because vacancies in these advice and consent positions may arise \nfrom time to time when the Senate is not in session, the Constitution \nalso provides that\n\n       The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies \n     that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting \n     Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next \n     Session.\n\n  Madam President, in an effort to secure the Senate's constitutional \nauthority under the Appointments Clause, Congress established a \nstatutory scheme that lays out not only the order of succession to be \nfollowed should one of these senior positions become vacant, but which \nalso sets a strict limit on the length of time an individual may \ntemporarily fill such a position. That legislation, which has been in \nplace since July of 1868, is known as the Vacancies Act, and is \ncodified in sections 3345 through 3349 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code.\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\n  For those who may not be familiar with the Vacancies Act, this is the \nessence of what it says. First, section 3345 provides that if the head \nof an executive department--a member of the President's Cabinet, for \nexample--dies, resigns, or is otherwise sick or absent, his or her \nfirst assistant shall perform the duties of that office until a \nsuccessor is appointed. Second, section 3346 states that when a \nsubordinate officer--generally those positions at the deputy and \nassistant secretary levels--dies, resigns, or is otherwise sick or \nabsent, that officer's first assistant also moves up to take over the \nduties of the office until a successor is appointed. And third, despite \neither of those self-executing methods for temporarily filling a vacant \nposition, section 3347 authorizes the President to direct any other \nofficer, whose appointment is subject to Senate confirmation, to \nexercise the duties of the vacant office. In any event, absent a recess \nappointment, those three sections of the Vacancies Act provide the \nexclusive statutory means of temporarily filling a vacant advice and \nconsent position.\n  But whichever method is used--either automatic succession, as \ncontained in sections 3345 and 3346, or presidential selection, as \ncontained in section 3347, Madam President, the key to protecting the \nSenate's constitutional role in the appointments process lies in \nsection 3348 of the Vacancies Act. That section plainly states that, \nshould one of these positions become vacant due to death or \nresignation, it shall not be filled on a temporary basis for more than \n120 days, unless a nomination is pending before the Senate. Originally, \nMadam President, when the legislation was enacted in 1868, the period \nof time was only 10 days. And then in 1891 that period was extended to \n30 days. And in 1988 that period was extended to 120 days.\n  It is precisely that time restriction on the filling of these vacant \npositions that is, I believe, the linchpin of this issue. Without that \nbarrier, without the 120-day limitation on the length of time a vacancy \nmay be temporarily filled, no President need ever forward a nomination \nto the U.S. Senate. Instead, the President--any President, Democrat or \nRepublican--can staff the executive branch with ``acting'' officials, \nwho may occupy the vacant position for months, or even years at a time, \nas the distinguished manager of the bill, Mr. Thompson, has already \nalluded to.\n  In short, to eliminate the time constraint in the Vacancies Act, or \nto effectively eliminate it by tolerating noncompliance, is to wholly \nundermine the integrity of the U.S. Senate's constitutional advice and \nconsent authority. So this is a serious matter.\n  Yet, despite the seemingly plain language of this 130-year-old Act, \nthe Department of Justice has challenged the force of the Act on the \ngrounds that those provisions are not the only statutory means of \nfilling a vacancy. In fact, for more than a quarter of a century, \nthrough Democratic administrations and Republican administrations, the \nJustice Department has simply refused to comply with the requirements \nof the Vacancies Act. Instead, the Department claims that the Act is \nsomehow superceded by other statutes which give the Attorney General \noverall authority to run the Department of Justice.\n  On December 17, 1997, I wrote to the Attorney General requesting \nclarification of the Department's position with respect to the \nVacancies Act. Specifically, I wanted to know whether or not the \nAttorney General believed that this 130-year-old statute had any \napplication to the Justice Department. On January 14 of this year I \nreceived a response to my letter in which the Department reiterated its \nposition that the Attorney General's authority under sections 509 and \n510 of Title 28 ``. . . is independent of, and not subject to, the \nlimits of the Vacancies Act.''\n\n  For the benefit of those who have never read those two sections of \nTitle 28, let me refer to the relevant language so that everyone will \nunderstand the fallacy of the Justice Department's argument. Section \n509 states that, with certain exceptions that are not at issue here \ntoday, ``all functions of other officers of the Department of Justice \nand all functions of agencies and employees of the Department of \nJustice are vested in the Attorney General. . . .'' Section 510, \nmeanwhile, states that ``the Attorney General may from time to time \nmake such provisions as he considers appropriate authorizing the \nperformance by any other officer, employee, or agency of the Department \nof Justice of any function of the Attorney General.''\n  Those two very broad, very general provisions--the first placing all \nfunctions of the Department under the control of the Attorney General, \nand the second allowing the Attorney General to delegate those \nfunctions--are being used to justify what amounts to an end run around \nthe Vacancies Act, which is protective of the Senate's rights under the \nAppointments Clause of the Constitution.\n  As I have noted, defiance of the plain language of the Vacancies Act \nis not an isolated case. In 1973, for example, the Department of \nJustice refused to admit that L. Patrick Gray, who had been appointed \nacting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation following the \ndeath of J. Edgar Hoover in May of 1972, was serving in that capacity \nin violation of the time limitation contained in the Vacancies Act. In \n1982, the Department's Office of Legal Counsel dismissed out of hand--\ndismissed out of hand the restrictions of the Vacancies Act as simply \n``inapplicable'' to the Department--meaning the Justice Department. In \n1984, the Department again asserted that ``. . . the specific \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 510 override the more general provisions \nof the Vacancies Act.'' And, in 1989, the Justice Department determined \nthat the Vacancies Act ``. . . does not extinguish other statutory \nauthority for filling vacancies and that the Act's limitations do not \napply to designations made pursuant to those authorities.''\n  Madam President, I submit that that position is untenable, and is \nuntenable for two simple reasons: First, there is no historical basis--\nabsolutely none--for the suggestion that Congress ever meant sections \n509 and 510 of Title 28 to exempt the Department of Justice from the \nrequirements of the Vacancies Act. And, secondly, the logical extension \nof the Department's argument--now get this, the logical extension of \nthe Department of Justice's argument would render meaningless--\nmeaningless the entire advice and consent prerogative contained in the \nAppointments Clause, article II section 2, of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Turning first to the Department's claim that sections 509 and 510 of \nTitle 28 somehow preempt the Vacancies Act, I note that those \nprovisions trace their origin to, and are a codification of, a 1950 \ncongressional action known as Reorganization Plan No. 2. As my \ncolleagues may know, throughout the 1950's, Congress passed a series of \nplans designed to reorganize the various executive branch departments. \nThe purpose of Plan No. 2 was to establish direct lines of authority \nand responsibility within the Department of Justice, and to give the \nAttorney General overall responsibility for the effective and economic \nadministration of the Department.\n  However, there is nothing--I repeat, absolutely nothing--in the \nlanguage of Plan No. 2 that would indicate that it was ever meant to \nsupersede the Vacancies Act. On the contrary, as the Senate's report \nwhich accompanied the measure made clear at that time, and I quote from \nthat committee report, ``Plan No. 2 does not give to the Department of \nJustice any more powers, authority, functions or responsibilities than \nit now has.'' What could be more clear?\n  Finally, it is worth noting that the general language contained in \nPlan No. 2 is virtually identical to language found in the \nreorganization plans for the Departments of the Interior, Labor, \nCommerce, and Health and Human Services. In fact, every one of the 14 \ncabinet-level departments has these general provisions in its basic \ncharter. Every one! Every one of the 14 cabinet-level departments. And \nit is precisely that common linguistic thread that leads to the second \nfatal flaw of the Justice Department's analysis.\n  If we accept this fallacious argument--that these broad, housekeeping \nprovisions somehow override, or are, in the Department's words, \n``independent of, and not subject to'' the more specific provisions of \nthe Vacancies Act--then any executive branch department--any executive \nbranch department whose functions are vested in the department's head, \nwho, in turn, can\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\ndelegate those functions to subordinate officers, would be exempt from \nthe provisions of the Vacancies Act. Of course, exemption from the \nVacancies Act would then mean that an individual could be appointed to \nan advice and consent position for an indefinite period of time. Who \nthinks that the Founding Fathers meant for that to be?\n  Consequently, to accept the position of the Department of Justice is \nto accept the position that the United States Senate--that is this \nbody--with the concurrence of the House of Representatives, has \nsystematically divested itself of its constitutional responsibility to \nadvise and consent to Presidential nominations.\n  Madam President, I wonder how many Senators believe that. I wonder \nhow many of my colleagues are prepared to accept such a specious \nargument. How many of my colleagues truly believe that the Senate has \nsimply handed over one of the most effective checks against the abuse \nof executive power? How many will agree that we have given away what \nthe Supreme Court has rightly characterized as ``. . . among the \nsignificant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme''? It \nwas referring to the Appointments Clause in the Edmund v. United States \ncase of 1997.\n  I, for one, do not subscribe to that specious argument, nor do I \nbelieve that any other Senator would support such a contention.\n  After all, don't we swear an oath, ``so help me God,'' to support and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States, before we enter into \noffice?\n  At the same time, it is not fair to say the fault for this situation \nlies entirely in the executive branch; a part of it lies with us. An \nhonest assessment of this matter will show that Congress must bear a \ngood deal of the responsibility for its failure to aggressively demand \nstrict compliance with the provisions of the Vacancies Act.\n  For 46 years I have been in the Congress, and I have noticed a steady \ndecline in the desire, the willpower, and the determination of Members \nof Congress to speak out in protection of the powers of the legislative \nbranch.\n  When I came here it wasn't like that, but more and more and more, it \nseems that there is an inability, or at least an unwillingness, on the \npart of Congress to stand up in support of its constitutional powers \nagainst the executive branch and those in the executive branch who \nwould make incursions into and upon the constitutional powers of the \nCongress.\n  Each of us, individually and collectively, must concede that this \ninstitution, this Senate, and the other body, have been less than \nstrenuous in protecting the constitutional rights and powers of the \nlegislative branch.\n  Congress did, of course, make an attempt to assert the supremacy of \nthe Vacancies Act when it last amended the statute some 10 years ago. \nThat was the second year of the 100th Congress. I was majority leader \nin the Senate at that time, and on April 20, 1988, the Senate's \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, in a report accompanying a broader \nbill of which the Vacancies Act amendments were a part, stated thusly:\n\n       . . . the present language, however old, makes clear that \n     the Vacancies Act is the exclusive authority for the \n     temporary appointment, designation, or assignment of one \n     officer to perform the duties of another whose appointment \n     requires Senate confirmation. The exclusive authority of the \n     Vacancies Act would only be overcome by specific statutory \n     language providing some other means for filling vacancies. As \n     such, the Committee expressly rejects the rationale and \n     conclusions of other interpretations of the meaning and \n     history of the Vacancies Act. . . .\n\n  That was the language that was contained in the 1988 committee \nreport.\n  And yet, despite that language, it remains a fact that the Vacancies \nAct has not been complied with. As a result, the time has come, and the \ntime is now, for Congress to take the matter into its own hands and \naddress the situation foursquare, right head on. That is what we are \nattempting to do here. I believe that S. 2176, the Federal Vacancies \nReform Act, is the vehicle that will accomplish that goal.\n  This bill was introduced on June 16 by Senators Thompson, Thurmond, \nLott, Roth, and myself. Three months before, on March 16, I had \nintroduced S. 1761, the Federal Vacancies Compliance Act. Although my \nbill took a slightly different approach, I believe it is fair to say \nthat it served as a basis for the bill before us today. I was \nprivileged, through the courtesy of the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Mr. Thompson, to be the lead witness at the March 18 hearing \nheld by the Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Levin was there; \nSenator Glenn was there; Senator Durbin was there; and other Senators, \nI believe.\n  This legislation here today is the result of months of study, months \nof discussion, and months of difficult negotiation. By extending the \ntime limitation on how long an acting official may serve, it is a bill \nthat clearly recognizes the realities inherent in today's nominating \nprocess. It is a bill that goes out of its way to accommodate the \ninauguration of a new President by giving the new administration up to \n8 months to forward nominations, something not currently contained in \nthe Vacancies Act. So we are going the extra mile in an effort to \naccommodate the problems of the executive branch. And it is a bill that \nworks to encourage the timely forwarding of nominations. Most \nimportantly, though, it is a bill which will, once and for all, put an \nend to these ridiculous, specious, fallacious arguments that the \nVacancies Act is nothing more than an annoyance to be brushed aside.\n  Madam President, it is time for this institution to state, in no \nuncertain terms, that no agency--no agency--will be permitted to \ncircumvent the Vacancies Act, or any other Act for that matter, \ndesigned to safeguard our constitutional duties. We cannot, as James \nMadison warned in Federalist 48, simply rely upon the ``parchment \nbarriers'' of the Constitution if we are to remain a coequal branch of \nthis government.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect upon this issue, and, in so doing, to \nhopefully conclude, as I have, that what is at stake here is something \nmuch greater than the Vacancies Act. I hope all Senators will \nunderstand that, each time a vacancy is filled by an individual in \nviolation of the Vacancies Act, yet another pebble is washed off the \nriverbank of the Senate's constitutional role, and that, as more and \nmore of these pebbles tumble downstream, the bank weakens, until, \nfinally, it collapses. But above all, I hope my colleagues will agree \nthat we have a responsibility to the American people and to this \ninstitution, the Senate of the United States, to shore up that \nriverbank, to stop the erosion that has taken place, and to reverse the \nwretched trend of acquiescing on our constitutional duties that seems \nto have so ominously infected this Senate.\n  Let us wait not a day longer in defending the Senate's rights of the \nConstitution. We are told by the great historian Edward Gibbon that the \nSeven Sleepers of Ephesus were seven youths in an old legend who were \nsaid to have fled to the mountains near Ephesus in Asia Minor to escape \nthe prosecution of the emperor Decius, who reigned in the years 249-251 \nA.D. Pursuers discovered their hiding place and blocked the entrance. \nThe seven youths fell into a deep slumber, which was miraculously \nprolonged, without injury in the powers of life. After a period of 187 \nyears, the slaves of Adolius removed the stones to supply materials for \nsome rustic edifice. The light of the sun darted into the cavern and \nawakened the sleepers, who believed that only a night had passed. \nPressed by the calls of hunger, they resolved that Jamblichus, one of \ntheir number, should secretly return to the city to purchase bread. The \nyouth, Jamblichus, could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect \nof his native country. His singular dress and obsolete language \nconfounded the baker, and when Jamblichus offered to pay for the food \nwith coins 200 years old and bearing the stamp of the tyrant Decius, he \nwas arrested as a thief of hidden treasure and dragged before a judge. \nThen followed the amazing discovery, said Gibbon, that two centuries \nhad almost elapsed since Jamblichus and his companions had escaped from \nthe rage of a pagan tyrant. The emperor Theodosius II believed a \nmiracle had taken place, and he hastened to the cavern of the Seven \nSleepers, who related their story, following which they all died at the \nsame moment and were buried where they had once slept.\n  Madam President, the moral of the story, as far as I am concerned, is \nthis:\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\n The Senate has slept on its rights for all too many years.\n  Let us awaken to the threat posed by circumventions by the executive \nbranch of the appointments clause and act to preserve the people's \nrights and the people's liberties, assured to them by the checks and \nbalances established by our forefathers.\n  In the proverbs of the Bible, we read: ``Remove not the ancient \nlandmark, which thy fathers have set.'' The landmark of the \nappointments clause was established by our forefathers. We can suffer \nits removal only at our peril, at the Senate's peril, and at the \npeople's peril. Let us, as Senators, not be found wanting at this hour.\n  It would require more than ``a mere demarkation on parchment'' to \nprotect the constitutional barriers between the executive and \nlegislative departments. It will require nothing less than an ambition \nthat counteracts ambition. Senators, vote for this legislation. Vote \nfor cloture today so that we can move on with the legislation. In the \nwords of Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 76, ``It would be an excellent \ncheck upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend \ngreatly to preventing the appointment of unfit characters from State \nprejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a \nview to popularity. And, in addition to this, it would be an \nefficacious source of stability in the administration.''\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I, too, think we need to amend the \nFederal Vacancies Act, because the current act has too many loopholes \nand insufficiently protects the constitutional prerogative of the \nSenate to have Senate-confirmed officials serving in top positions in \nthe executive branch. It is because I believe we should amend the \nFederal Vacancies Act that I voted to report the bill out of committee \nand, along with, I think, all or most of our colleagues, voted to \nproceed to Senate consideration of the bill.\n  But I will oppose cloture on the bill at this time, because if we \nadopt cloture now, it would mean that relevant amendments could not be \nconsidered. After cloture, only what are called germane amendments, as \nwe all know, can be considered. That is a very narrow and a very strict \nrule. And for us to preclude the possibility of relevant amendments, \nrelevant to this subject, being offered, without the opportunity even \nto offer those amendments, it seems to me, does not do justice to this \nsubject.\n  I commend Senator Byrd and Senator Thompson for bringing this issue \nto our attention. Senator Byrd was the witness who appeared before our \ncommittee--and the Chair is also a distinguished member of this \ncommittee--and brought to our attention, very forcefully, the current \nloopholes that exist, at least the alleged loopholes that exist, in the \nFederal Vacancies Act.\n  These loopholes have been used by Presidents--I think inappropriately \nused. And surely Senator Byrd has laid out a very powerful case in this \nbill. And Senator Thompson and others laid out a very powerful case \nthat we should close those loopholes. But we should close those \nloopholes considering relevant amendments in the process. And obtaining \ncloture immediately upon proceeding to the consideration of the bill \nwill preclude the consideration of relevant amendments.\n  The bill before the Senate would make several important changes to \nthe current Vacancies Act to close a number of those loopholes. First, \nit would make clear that the act is the sole legal statutory authority \nfor the temporary filling of positions pending confirmation. Both \nSenator Byrd and Senator Thompson have stated forcefully why it is so \nimportant for us to close that loophole. In our judgment, that loophole \ndoes not exist. I think in the opinion of probably most Senators that \nloophole does not exist. But, nonetheless, whether it is a real one or \nan imaginary one, it has been used by administrations in order to have \npeople temporarily fill positions pending confirmation for just simply \ntoo long a period of time, which undermines the Senate's advice and \nconsent authority.\n  So the first thing this bill would do would be to make clear that the \nact, the Federal Vacancies Act, is the sole legal statutory authority \nfor temporarily filling positions pending confirmation. Agencies would \nno longer be able to claim that their organic statutes trump the act \nand empower them to have acting officials indefinitely.\n  Second, the act's time period authorizing an individual to be acting \nin the vacant position would be increased to 150 days from the date of \nthe vacancy. The current act provides for 120 days, and it is unclear \non whether the period runs from the date of the vacancy or the date a \nperson assumes the acting position.\n  Finally, the bill would provide for an enforcement mechanism for \nviolations of the time period. And that is really an important point, \nbecause without some kind of an enforcement mechanism, these violations \ncan take place without being corrected.\n  So the enforcement mechanism provides that if no nomination is \nsubmitted within the 150-day period, the position would have to remain \nvacant and any duties assigned just to that position by statute could \nbe performed only by the agency head. As soon as a nomination is \nsubmitted, the bill provides that an acting official could then assume \nthe job temporarily until the Senate acts on the nomination.\n  While the staff was making efforts to try to negotiate a unanimous \nconsent agreement and perhaps a managers' amendment for Senate \nconsideration of this bill, a cloture motion was filed. In my judgment, \nit was filed prematurely. And now if, indeed, this cloture motion \npasses, amendments which are relevant to this subject, important \namendments, relevant to this subject, would not be subject to \nconsideration and debate by the U.S. Senate.\n  Again, I am one who would like very much to see a reform of the \nVacancies Act and to see that reform enacted in this Congress. Senator \nByrd and Senator Thompson and others deserve the thanks of all of us \nfor bringing the Senate's attention to this issue. Senator Byrd, again, \ntook the lead in prompting the Governmental Affairs Committee to hold a \nhearing on this topic last March and pointed out the Justice \nDepartment's regrettable practice of having persons serve as acting \nofficials in top-level positions for significant periods of time \nwithout Senate confirmation.\n  By having acted, officials serve in this way; and ignoring the \npurpose of the existing Vacancies Act, the Department delays or avoids \nSenate confirmation.\n  The Vacancies Act was originally enacted in 1868. Its whole purpose \nis to encourage the President to submit nominations in a timely \nfashion. In 1988, the Governmental Affairs Committee amended the act to \npreclude an agency--in particular, the Justice Department--from \navoiding Senate confirmation and the requirements of the Vacancies Act \nby arguing that the act did not apply to their Departments. \nUnfortunately, the technical language that the committee used back then \nto accomplish this didn't do the job, at least in the eyes of the \nDepartment of Justice, and some agencies--and the Department of \nJustice, for one--have continued to operate outside of the intent of \nthat law.\n  The bill before the Senate, then, attempts to rein in agencies like \nthe Justice Department. It also attempts to set clearer guidelines on \nwhat agencies can and can't do with respect to vacancies, and it \ncreates an action-enforcing mechanism that will encourage Presidents to \nact promptly on submitting nominations.\n  Now, in the eyes of many Members of this body, the Senate also has an \nimportant responsibility to act promptly on the nominations once they \nare received. That is why it would be relevant to debate the question \nas to whether or not a bill which amends the Vacancies Act to force the \nPresident to make timely nominations--in order to evade the clear \nconstitutional role of the Senate in advising and consenting to such \nnominations--that such a bill could also appropriately address the \nSenate's duty to act on such nominations once they are submitted. That \ndoesn't mean approve the nominations, that simply means to act on those \nnominations.\n  When we take up this subject of nominations, we need a bill which \nwill\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\nensure that nominations are made in a timely way, but we also have to \navoid crafting an unrealistic bill that could leave many key positions \nvacant. I don't think any of us want to do that. That is why this bill \nextends the time that a new administration would have in order to fill \nthese positions without triggering the action-enforcing mechanism.\n  We need to recognize, however, that this vetting process for \nnominees--the exploratory process, the FBI checks--has become much more \ncomplicated and complex than it was even a decade ago when the act was \nlast amended. Increasingly adversarial confirmation proceedings have \nrequired that background investigations and other steps in the vetting \nprocess are more thorough and lengthy.\n  We asked the Congressional Research Service to look at the length of \ntime it took for the first Clinton administration to make nominations \nand the time for Senate confirmation of those nominations, and to \ncompare those numbers to the time it took the first Reagan \nadministration in 1981 to make those nominations and for the Senate to \nact on those nominations. The results reflect that both the nomination \nand the Senate confirmation process are simply taking longer. In 1981, \nPresident Reagan took an average of 112 days to submit a nomination; \nPresident Clinton, in 1993, took an average of 133 days to make a \nnomination.\n  In addition to Presidents taking longer because the process simply \ntakes longer, the Senate is also taking much longer to confirm \nnominees. In 1981, the Senate took an average of 30 days to confirm \nnominees; in 1993, the Senate took an average of 41 days to confirm \nClinton administration nominees. So the reality that it takes a greater \nperiod of time for these nominations to be made should be reflected in \nthe bill. It is reflected by a 30-day extension for the time period, \nwhich we have all referred to. Whether or not that is enough is subject \nto debate, and there will be amendments on that subject as well.\n  As I have indicated, in addition to crafting a bill that reflects \ntoday's more adversarial nominations climate, there are many who feel \nstrongly that we in the Senate should acknowledge our own \nresponsibility to act on nominations that we receive from the \nadministration. We, in the Senate, rightfully want to protect our \nconstitutional prerogative to advise and consent on nominations and not \nto have positions filled by people whose nominations have not been \nconfirmed by the Senate. By the same token, we should discharge our \nduties in a prompt matter once those nominations are submitted to us.\n  Currently, there are many, many examples of the Senate failing, both \nin committee and on the floor, to act on nominations. We are \nappropriately critical of the administration for not sending up \nnominations in a timely way, but it is also appropriate for us as an \ninstitution to act one way or the other on those nominations once they \nare received. It is the desire of some of our colleagues to offer \namendments that would require the Senate to act in a timely fashion on \nnominations, both by considering them in committee and by requiring a \nvote on them on the Senate floor. Again, not a positive vote \nguaranteed, just a vote.\n  Madam President, I think this bill moves us in the right direction. \nIt is a bill that would close loopholes which many of us did not think \neven existed but which are being utilized by administrations to make \nappointments of these temporary people for long periods of time without \nsubmitting the nominee's name to the Senate for advice and consent. \nThere are many provisions about which concerns have been raised, and it \nis perfectly appropriate, I believe, for those issues to be debated and \nto be resolved here on the Senate floor.\n  I also would plan on offering an amendment to provide for a cure of a \nviolation; that is, to allow an official to temporarily act in a vacant \nposition once a nomination has been submitted, even if that nomination \nis submitted during a long recess. The bill is not clear, in my \njudgment, as to what happens when the 150-day period runs prior to, for \ninstance, a sine die recess but when the intention to nominate a \nparticular person is submitted to the Senate to the extent that is \npermitted during a sine die recess.\n  It would seem to me that, just as the bill appropriately holds the \n150-day period when a nomination is submitted and permits somebody to \nserve in that capacity where there is an intent to nominate, so if the \n150-day period happens to run out before a recess but the intention to \nnominate a particular person is submitted to the Senate during that \nrecess, then also a temporary appointment ought to be permitted.\n  Madam President, I will offer an amendment at an appropriate time to \nhave a person as an acting official permitted after the 150-day period \nhas expired, when a recess occurs and the nominee or a nominee's name \nis submitted to the Senate during that recess.\n  There are a number of concerns which a number of our colleagues have \nraised with the bill as drafted, and some of these concerns, again, \nwould be reflected in relevant amendments but which are not technically \ngermane and would be precluded and foreclosed if cloture were invoked.\n  For example, the bill restricts who can be an acting official, in \ncase of a vacancy, to a first assistant or another advice and consent \nnominee. That is too restrictive a pool of acting officials and does \nnot give this administration, or any administration, the ability to \nmake, for instance, a long-time senior civil servant within the agency \nan acting official. Such senior civil servants may be the best \nqualified to serve as acting officials. First assistants may not exist \nfor all vacant positions. Further, designating another advice and \nconsent nominee to serve as an acting official takes that person away \nfrom the duties of their regular job. The category of persons who can \nact needs to be made larger, in my judgment, and in the judgment of \nothers who will be offering amendments along this line--who, at least, \nwant to offer amendments along this line, assuming that they are \nafforded the opportunity to do so.\n  This provision that I have referred to, the restriction that I have \nreferred to, may be operating particularly harshly at the start of a \nnew administration when many vacancies exist. At such times, not many \nfirst assistants may be holding over from previous administrations. \nTherefore, the first assistant slots may be empty, also. Similarly, few \nother Senate-confirmed officers will exist that the President could \nchoose from to serve in a vacant position. One of our colleagues \nintends to offer an amendment to allow qualified civil servants to be \nacting officials, also. And again, this amendment, like some of the \nother amendments that are sought to be offered here, may not be \ntechnically germane and can be foreclosed after cloture.\n  I don't think it is appropriate that relevant amendments should be \nforeclosed. That is why I am somebody who believes we need to amend the \nFederal Vacancies Act in order to close the existing loophole, and in \norder to protect the constitutional prerogative of the President, and I \nalso want to protect the prerogative of Senators to offer relevant \namendments. That is the issue we are going to be voting on--whether or \nnot Senators ought to have an opportunity to offer relevant amendments, \nor whether they should be precluded from doing that by cloture being \ninvoked so prematurely, when a bill has just been brought to the floor, \nand then being denied the opportunity to offer amendments on issues \nthat are clearly relevant to this issue.\n  So the bill is an important one. The issue is an important one. I \nthink we are all in the debt of the sponsors for bringing this bill to \nthe floor. It is appropriate that the Senate debate this bill and that \nSenators who have relevant amendments, although not technically \ngermane, be offered the opportunity to offer those amendments, have \nthem voted on, and to have these issues, some of which I have \ndiscussed, resolved.\n  I hope we will vote against cloture and that we will proceed to \ncontinue on the bill and have people offer amendments--hopefully \nrelevant amendments--and to try to work out a unanimous consent \nagreement to see if we can't come up with a list of relevant amendments \nthat people could offer on this subject so that they would not be \nforeclosed, being in a postcloture situation, from offering amendments \nthat are relevant to this important issue, but not technically germane.\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I yield the Senator from South \nCarolina 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise today in support of cloture on \nS. 2176, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This legislation should be \nentirely nonpartisan because it is essential to the advice and consent \nrole of the Senate.\n  Recent Administrations, both Republican and Democrat, have failed to \nsend nominations to the Senate in a timely manner. Instead, they have \nappointed people to serve in an acting capacity for long periods of \ntime without seeking confirmation.\n  This is a matter of great significance. One of the primary fears of \nthe Founders was the accumulation of too much power in one source, and \nthe separation of powers among the three branches of government is one \nof the keys to the success of our great democratic government. An \nexcellent example of the separation of powers is the requirement in \nArticle 2, Section 2 of the Constitution that the President receive the \nadvice and consent of the Senate for the appointment of officers of the \nUnited States. As Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the Supreme Court a \nfew years ago, ``The Clause is a bulwark against one branch \naggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.''\n  The Vacancies Act is central to the Appointments Clause because it \nplaces limits on the amount of time that the President can appoint \nsomeone to an advice and consent position in an acting capacity without \nsending a nomination to the Senate. For too many years, the Executive \nBranch has failed to comply with the letter or the spirit of the law.\n  I raised this issue for the first time this Congress in April of last \nyear at a Justice Department oversight hearing. At the time, almost all \nof the top positions at the Justice Department were being filled in an \nacting capacity. They included the Associate Attorney General, \nSolicitor General, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, \nAssistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, and Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  President Clinton allowed the Criminal Division of the Justice \nDepartment to languish for over two and one half years before \nsubmitting a nomination. The government had an Acting Solicitor General \nfor an entire term of the Supreme Court. Most recently, the President \ninstalled Bill Lann Lee as Acting Chief of the Civil Rights Division in \nblatant disregard of the Judiciary Committee's decision not to support \nhis controversial choice. Mr. Lee has been serving as Acting Chief for \nten months, and the President apparently has no intentions of \nnominating someone the Judiciary Committee can support.\n  Let me be clear. The issue is not about any one President or any one \nnominee. It is about preserving the institutional role of the Senate. A \nRepublican President has no more right to ignore the appointments \nprocess than a Democrat President.\n  I responded to this problem by introducing a resolution about one \nyear ago. However, I soon realized that a total rewrite of the \nVacancies Act with an enforcement mechanism would be required to force \nthe Executive Branch to follow the law in this area. Thus, earlier this \nyear, I sponsored a bill on behalf of myself and the Majority Leader to \nrewrite the law regarding vacancies.\n  Today, I am pleased today to be an original cosponsor of S. 2176, the \nbill that we are debating today. It contains the two primary objectives \nthat I outlined when I testified before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee earlier this year: the need to totally redraft the Vacancies \nAct and to provide a mechanism for enforcement. Senator Thompson has \ndone a fine job in drafting S. 2176 and in shepherding it through the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. He has worked hard to create a \nbipartisan consensus for this legislation. In that regard, I am pleased \nthat my distinguished colleague who is an expert on the institution of \nthe Senate, Senator Byrd, is an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  S. 2176 would correct the Attorney General's misguided interpretation \nof the current Vacancies Act. In fact, she practically interprets the \nAct out of existence. Based on various letters to me, it is clear that \nif her interpretation were correct, no department of the Federal \ngovernment would be bound by the Vacancies Act. There would be no \nlimitation on the amount of time someone could serve in an acting \ncapacity. There would be no limitation on how long the advice and \nconsent role of the Senate could be ignored.\n  Additionally, the bill has an enforcement mechanism, while the \ncurrent law has none. Because there is no consequence if the Vacancies \nAct is violated today, the Executive Branch simply ignores it. This \nchange is essential for the Act to be followed in the future. The bill \nprovides that the actions of any person serving in violation of the \nVacancies Act are null and void, until a nominee is forwarded. There \ncan be no argument that this will paralyze an office because the \nPresident can make the office active by simply forwarding a nomination.\n  It is also important to note that the bill gives the President an \nextra 30 days to submit a nomination. It extends the time from 120 days \nto 150 days, with even more time at the start of the administration. \nThese were concessions to the Executive Branch. Indeed, the bill \noverall makes no more change than necessary in the Vacancies Act to \nmake sure it will be followed in the future.\n  The question before us is cloture on S. 2176. We should invoke \ncloture now and move to any amendments that members wish to propose. \nCloture on the motion to proceed was easily invoked last week in a \ncompletely bipartisan vote, and I hope we can get a similar consensus \ntoday.\n  Madam President, we must act in a bipartisan fashion to preserve the \nadvice and consent role of the Senate. We must require any \nadministration in power, whether Democrat or Republican, to respect \nthis Constitutional role of the Senate. As the Supreme Court has \nstated, ``The structural interests protected by the Appointments Clause \nare not those of any one branch of Government but of the entire \nRepublic.'' By passing the Vacancies Reform Act, we can reaffirm the \nseparation of powers for the sake of the Senate and the entire \nRepublic.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding.\n  Madam President, I rise today to oppose this effort to bring to a \nclose debate on the Vacancies Act reform legislation, S.2176. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting against cloture.\n  Without so much as a blink, a breath, or a blush, a cloture motion on \nthe bill itself was immediately filed last Thursday morning on the \nheels of the Senate's agreement to proceed to this bill. This quick \nflinch maneuver is an attempt to deny Members the opportunity to offer \nmeaningful relevant amendments to improve this legislation, such as \nthose I intend to pursue to address the Senate's responsibility to act \nexpeditiously on pending nominations.\n  Before I outline the importance of assessing both sides of the \nprocess and outline my specific reservations about the bill as \npresently drafted, I wish to emphasize that I share the convictions and \nconcerns of the sponsors, notably Senators Byrd, Thurmond, and \nThompson, about the critical need to preserve and protect the \nconstitutional prerogative of the Senate to advise and consent to \nPresidential nominations to executive branch positions. I am sure that \nI am not alone in this view.\n  I appreciate the sponsors' zeal to remedy what has grown to be, \nnumerous instances and examples throughout the government, of outright \nchallenges to Senate authority by ignoring the Vacancies Act. There has \nbeen flagrant and contagious disregard for the application of the \nexisting law as the sole mechanism for temporarily filling advise and \nconsent positions while awaiting the nomination and confirmation of the \nofficial candidate.\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\n  I wholeheartedly concur that this law needs clarification so that \nmoves to end-run its application are halted. The bill as advanced by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee laudably addresses this exclusivity \nquestion.\n  Thus, I do not oppose efforts to bolster the Vacancies Act as the \nexclusive mechanism (with limited and explicit exceptions) for the \npresident to designate officials to temporarily fill vacancies in \npositions requiring Senate confirmation.\n  Unfortunately, in its current form this bill goes well beyond that \njustifiable but limited goal in several respects. Moreover, it fails to \ngo far enough to address the Senate's duty to timely act on \nnominations.\n  While the Administration may well bear some responsibility for the \nslow pace of nominations, I am dismayed that the Senate would want to \nso severely restrict the ability to fill vacant positions temporarily \nand to conduct the people's business while at the same time impeding \nthe nominations process and confirming nominees at a snail's pace.\n  The Senate bears partial responsibility for the time it takes to \nnominate officials for Senate confirmed positions. This Congress has \nsubjected the Administration's nominees to unprecedented scrutiny, \nusing almost any prior alleged indiscretion--no matter how trivial--by \na nominee as an excuse to delay or prevent a vote.\n  Senators have also interjected themselves into the President's \nnominations process to an unparalleled degree. As a result, that front-\nend process--the selection, recruitment, and vetting of candidates--\ntakes longer than ever before.\n  The nomination and confirmation process, it has been observed, is one \nof ``the President proposing, the Senate disposing.'' If the Senate \nexpects adherence to the rigid parameters this bill would impose on \nadvancing candidates, we as its Members need to be ready and willing to \ndiligently consider these candidates for public office and take prompt \nand deliberate action to confirm or reject them.\n  The Senate has frequently declined to exercise its advice and consent \nresponsibility in a timely and appropriate manner. Too often, \nnominations die in Committee, languish interminably on the Executive \nCalendar, or simply take months or years to move through this Chamber.\n  Just as the President has a responsibility to forward nominees to the \nSenate in a timely fashion, we in the Senate have a concomitant \nobligation to discharge our constitutional prerogative of advice and \nconsent on those candidates in an efficient and expeditious fashion.\n  We cannot simply confront practical deficiencies in the front-end \nphase of the process for recruiting and evaluating qualified candidates \nand ignore our own responsibilities.\n  We owe it not only to the Executive, but to the American public, to \noffer--not withhold--our advice and where appropriate, our consent.\n  I have filed and certainly hope to have an opportunity to offer some \nrelevant amendments designed to address those instances of dilatory \nSenate Committee processing and floor inaction once a nominee is \nadvanced to the calendar.\n  One amendment would provide that any nomination submitted to the \nSenate that is pending before a Senate committee for 150 calendar days \nshall on the day following such 150th day, be discharged and placed on \nthe Senate executive calendar and be considered as favorably reported.\n  Another amendment would require the Senate to take up for a vote any \nnomination which has been pending on the Executive Calendar in excess \nof 150 days. Such Senate consideration must occur within 5 calendar \ndays of the 150th day. In effect, it creates an end point after which \nwe can no longer hold up a nominee.\n  I am not suggesting that we would give our consent to all of these \nnominees. I am basically saying that this process should come to a \nclose. The Senate should vote. It should make its decision.\n  If we want to reasonably time-limit the front end of the process--\nwith which I do not disagree--and promptly fill vacancies, we need to \nbe equally willing to build some finality into the back-end of the \nprocess and impose some time limits on our own consideration of these \ncandidates.\n  The first problem I find with this bill is that filling positions in \nthe Government requires time far longer than that specified in this \nbill.\n  I have an amendment which suggests increasing the 150-day period to \n210 days. I am sure people are wondering, if they are following this \ndebate, why it would take so long for any kind of process to review a \nnominee. Well, as it turns out, the average number of days that a \nvacancy exists prior to a Senate nomination for the White House is 313 \ndays. What could possibly take 313 days in investigating the \nqualifications of an individual to fill the job?\n  Consider all of the things that are going to be investigated. Not \nonly the lengthy forms the individual must fill out, ethics \ndisclosures, financial statements, fingerprints and the like, but also \nan FBI investigation, a Federal Bureau of Investigation report on that \nperson, the opportunity for groups to contact the White House and say \nthat they either oppose or support the individual, the opportunity for \nMembers of Congress to come forward and suggest to the administration \nthat they either support that nominee or they oppose it. And as it \nturns out, some of these things such as an FBI report may not happen as \nquickly as some people imagine. We have heaped on that agency \nadditional responsibilities every year. We entrust them with very \nimportant jobs. We tell them that we want them to fingerprint and make \ncertain that those who want to be citizens of the United States, in \nfact, have no criminal record in any foreign country. That is a valid \nquestion, but it is an additional administrative responsibility.\n\n  The list goes on and on and on. As a consequence, when the \nadministration comes to this agency, and it is only one example, and \nasks for a timely review of an individual nominated for a position, \nthey sometimes have to wait in line. And while they wait the clock is \nticking.\n  And consider this as well. As a result of this legislation, saying \nthe administration shall only have 150 days, what if in the midst of \nthis process--say, for example, 4 or 5 months into the process--the \nadministration reaches a conclusion that the individual should not go \nforward and the nomination should not be sent to the Senate. Does the \nclock start to run again? No. The clock continues to run 150 days, so \nthe new nominee, starting over going through all these processes, \ntrying to clear all these hurdles, is still burdened by the original \nclock ticking at 150 days. I don't think it is realistic. I don't think \nit is fair. Merely adding 30 additional days to the current 120-day \ntimeframe within which an acting official may temporarily perform the \nduties and functions of the vacant office unless the Senate has \nforwarded a nominee to the Senate within that span is impractical. It \nis unrealistic, and I do not believe it is adequate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from Illinois has suggested an amendment, Madam \nPresident, as far as I am concerned, I could accept. Why not let us \ninvoke cloture; that amendment is certainly a germane amendment, and \nhave the Senator put it up for action by the Senate? I am one who would \nvote for it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, and I certainly \nappreciate those comments. But we are told by the Senate \nParliamentarian that the amendment would be relevant but not germane, \nand therefore any action for cloture which would put a burden on the \nSenate to act within a certain period of time on nominees that are sent \nwould be wiped away, or could be wiped away by this cloture motion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I may have misunderstood the Senator. I thought the Senator \nwas suggesting that the 150 days is not enough and that he would like \nto see 30 additional days. That would certainly seem to be germane as \nfar as I am concerned.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will allow me to respond, that amendment \nis germane. The only other amendments which would impose a \nresponsibility on the Senate to move a nominee out of committee within \n150 days after it is sent from the White House or\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\nto move it off the Executive Calendar for a vote within 150 days, I am \ntold by the Senate Parliamentarian, may not be allowed if cloture is \ninvoked.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I expect the Parliamentarian is right on that. I would \nnot argue with that, nor would I probably support it.\n  If the Senator will allow me, the Constitution doesn't say that the \nSenate has to confirm the nominees. It simply says the President cannot \nhave the full responsibility and power himself to name people to \nimportant positions. This is a matter that has to be shared under the \nConstitution between the President and the Senate. This constitutional \nprovision--the appointments clause--I am trying to protect today is \nbeing given the runaround by the Justice Department and several other \nDepartments, and I want to protect that constitutional power that is \ngiven to the Senate. As to whether or not the Senate acts on \nnominations, the Constitution doesn't require the Senate to act, but I \nthink that the Senate does act, and would continue to act, on \nnominations within a reasonable period of time.\n  Having been the majority leader of the Senate during three different \nCongresses, I can say to the distinguished Senator that when I was \nmajority leader we had nominations left on the calendar at the end of a \nCongress, in all three of the Congresses in which I served as majority \nleader. When we adjourned sine die that Executive Calendar was not \nwiped clean. We all did the best we could, but we did leave some \nnominations on the calendar. And I certainly share the Senator's \nfeeling that the Senate ought to act expeditiously, in a reasonable \nfashion, but when it comes to requiring the Senate to act on all \nnominations, I don't think the Constitution requires that. And I might \nhave to part company with the Senator at that point. But some of his \nother suggestions, I think, are very well made.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. It pains me to \nbelieve we would have a difference of opinion, but those things do \noccur. I am certain the Senator as majority leader did his \nconstitutional responsibility--there has never been a doubt about \nthat--and also acted with dispatch in a timely manner.\n  I think the Senator makes a good point. We not only want to protect \nthe clear constitutional responsibility and right of the Senate in this \nprocess, we want to bring the best men and women forward to continue \nserving our Government, and we want it all done in a timely fashion. My \nconcern with this bill is it addresses one side of the equation. It \nsays to the executive branch, you have to move in a more timely fashion \nto bring these men and women to the Senate for consideration. If we are \nclearly looking for filling vacancies in a timely fashion, that is only \nhalf the process. Once the nomination is brought to the Senate, we \nshould move in a timely fashion, too. Otherwise, using the old \nreference to equity, we don't come to this argument with clean hands, \nand that is why I think there should be some symmetry here in the \nrequirement of the executive as well as the legislative branch.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I thank him for yielding. The Senator, as I think I \nunderstand, suggested that if we are going to deal with one part of the \nequation, namely, the nominating process by the executive, and protect \nourselves in that regard, we ought to be equally interested in dealing \nwith the other half of the equation by requiring action by the Senate \nto confirm or reject nominees.\n  May I with great respect suggest--and I am doing this for the record. \nI am sure I am not ahead of the Senator in thinking this--I am trying \nto address the constitutional side of the equation and stop the \nadministration, not only this administration but also previous \nadministrations, from conducting a runaround of the constitutional \nadvice and consent powers of the Senate. I am suggesting we deal with \nthat constitutional side of the equation.\n  Now, the other side, which the distinguished Senator mentions, if he \nwill pardon my saying so, I think what he is talking about is the \npolitical side of the equation. That part is not included in the \nConstitution. The Constitution doesn't require the Senate to act on any \nnomination. But that is the political side. I would like to deal with \nthe constitutional side, and that is the purpose of this legislation. \nAnd then we can do the best we can on dealing with the political side. \nThe Senator is quite right; neither side comes into this matter with \nperfectly clean hands. That is an old equity maxim.\n  It reminds me of Themistocles who happened to say, one day, ``that he \nlooked upon it as the principal excellence of a general to know and \nforesee the designs of the enemy;'' Aristides answered, ``that is \nindeed a necessary qualification; but there is another very excellent \none, and highly becoming a general, and that is to have clean hands.'' \nThe same thing would apply here. Neither party has clean hands when it \ncomes to moving all nominations sent by a President to an up or down \nvote. As majority leader during the Presidential years of Mr. Carter \nand again during the 100th Congress, I can remember that the calendars \nwere not always cleared of items that had been reported by committees \nwhen adjournments sine die occurred. I hope that we will not get bogged \ndown in this way about a purely political matter when a far more \nimportant constitutional matter, important to the prerogatives of the \nSenate in the matter of appointments is at hand.\n  And let me state to the Senator the number of nominees that were left \non the executive calendar when I was majority leader, at the time of \nsine die adjournment.\n  When I was majority leader--I will just take one Congress, for \nexample, the 100th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator have an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I surely hope I will \nnot, I wonder how much time remains.\n  Mr. BYRD. And that that time not be charged against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 21 minutes; the \nSenator from Tennessee has 9 minutes. Is there objection to the \nrequest?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The modified request, we have no objection to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will just say this. To show that we all sometimes fail to \nhave clean hands, when I was majority leader in the second session of \nthe 100th Congress--I don't mind saying this--the civilian nominations \ntotaled 516, including 112 nominations carried over from the first \nsession; 335 of these were confirmed, 170 were unconfirmed, and 11 were \nwithdrawn. So, this is a failing that can be ascribed to both Democrats \nand Republicans when they are in control of the Congress.\n  But, yet, I come back to my original premise; namely, that the \nConstitution did not require me to call up all those nominations off \nthe calendar. It didn't say I had to do that. But it did say, with \nrespect to nominations, that appointments to vacancies were to be \nshared by the President and the Senate, and that is what this bill is \ncontemplating to enforce and what I am fighting for today.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I would just say that I can't believe that I hurried back from \nChicago this morning to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to \nactually engage my friend and fellow Senator from West Virginia in any \ndebate about the Constitution. I plead nolo contendere. I am not able \nto join you in that. And I can't even reach back in Greek or Roman \nhistory for any kind of solace or defense.\n  I am not sure who the author was, it could have been a Greek or \nRoman, maybe a West Virginian, or even an Illinoisan, who once said the \nprofound statement, ``What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the \ngander,'' and that is what I am attempting to argue here. That is, if \nwe are going to impose on the executive branch a requirement to produce \nthe nominee in 150 days, or if the time goes beyond that to suffer the \npossibility of not having an acting person in that slot, then we should \naccept the responsibility on the Senate side as well, to act in a \ntimely manner on these nominees.\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I hope he will \nforgive me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not here to engage in challenging his statements. He \nis one of the fine Members of this Senate; one of the newer Members, in \na way. He served a long time in the House of Representatives. He comes \nto the Senate well prepared to be a good Senator, and he is a good \nSenator.\n  But, again, I am concerned about that part of the responsibility \nwhich the Constitution places on both the executive and the \nlegislative. I think the legislative is being given the run-around by \nthe Judiciary Department. It has not just been during this \nadministration. It has been, as I say, going on for over 25 years, and \nthis is an opportunity for us to correct that, I hope we would vote for \ncloture and perhaps some of the Senators' amendments--which are \ncertainly worthy of consideration and probably of adoption, some of \nthem--could be given a chance to be offered and debated. I hope we \nwould invoke cloture, indeed, to have an opportunity to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I think what we have found is that rarely do we visit this rather \nobscure area of the law, the Vacancies Act. I am hoping in this \nvisitation on one side, that we have some balance and impose \nrequirements on the Senate to act in a timely fashion, as we impose a \nrequirement on the executive branch to report a nominee in a timely \nfashion. But I also hope the time periods that we choose are realistic. \nI think anyone involved in this process at any level understands that \nwhen a person's name comes up in nomination, they are subjected to far \ngreater scrutiny than ever before. It discourages many good people from \neven trying public service, and I am sure that many have been \ndisappointed.\n  But let us, I hope, during the process of this debate, be sensitive \nto this reality. And it is a reality that, under the bill, the meter \nkeeps on ticking even when this scrutiny is underway, even if it is \ninterrupted and a new nominee is proposed for a post. And if, in fact, \nat 150 days the nomination is not forthcoming, then, as I understand \nthis bill, we would preclude the President from filling the spot with \nan acting person. That, to me, is a sort of decision which on its face \nmakes sense but may have some practical ramifications. It may affect \nthe ability of the administration to choose the person most able to \nhandle a matter that involves public health, public safety, or the \nnational defense. I also think that this bill too narrowly restricts \nwho can function in an acting capacity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional 5 minutes of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 21 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield an additional 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am concerned this bill too narrowly \nrestricts those who can function in an acting capacity. I am worried \nthat, in fact, the administration will not be able to pick that person \nbest able to fill the spot, to conduct the duties, and to perform the \nfunctions of the office in the best way. I don't think that serves our \ncountry well. This bill could preclude the President from naming the \nmost qualified person to serve as an acting officer. I do not think \nthat will help us in any way.\n  Third, while it would not affect this President, experience has shown \nthat at the beginning of a new administration filling positions in the \nGovernment requires far longer than specified in this bill. At the \noutset of any new administration, the President must nominate \nindividuals to at least 320 positions in 14 different executive \ndepartments. The new President cannot possibly make all the required \nnominations within the 240 days allowed by this bill.\n  In 1993, when the nominations process was, if anything, simpler than \ntoday, the new administration was able to forward only 68 percent of \nthe nominees within the first 240 days. Unless this time period is \nchanged, the next administration could face departmental shutdowns \nbecause of this bill.\n  The enforcement mechanism of this bill, which establishes that no one \ncan perform the functions and the duties of the vacant office, is a \nsanction which would lead to administrative immobilization.\n  I would like to also note it is ironic that we are here today \ndebating whether to close off consideration of a measure designed to \nlimit how long an acting official may temporarily fill an executive \nbranch vacancy and legally perform the duties while awaiting an \nadvancement of a nominee. The impetus is on the President to send \nnominees more expeditiously; yet with acting officials in many of these \nagencies, the work can continue. Such is not the case with the sister \nbranch of Government which has eluded our debate here today, the \nJudiciary. In fact, a more serious crisis sits on the doorstep of the \nU.S. Senate, one that has been sorely neglected this year by many of \nthe same people on the other side of the aisle who are proposing this \nchange in the Vacancies Act.\n  We must recognize there is no similar vehicle or parallel authority \nlike the Vacancies Act for filling vacancies on the Federal bench. \nThere are presently 22 candidates to fill judicial vacancies on the \nExecutive Calendar of the U.S. Senate, and 24 pending before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--3 of those from my State. Unlike the executive \nbranch where qualified acting officials may step in, in the judicial \nbranch we don't have ``acting'' or ``interim'' judges.\n  I think, frankly, if we are going to assume some responsibility here, \nas we should, and impose responsibility on the executive branch, we \nshould meet our responsibility. I think that responsibility requires us \nto act in a timely fashion on nominees sent before us. The reason I \noppose cloture is I would like to see that the Senate shall also be \nheld to the responsibility of acting in a timely fashion. If, after 150 \ndays languishing in a committee there is no report on an individual, \nthe name should come to the floor. If, after 150 days languishing on \nthe Executive Calendar that name has not been called for a vote, it \nshould be. Vote the person up or down. They are qualified or they are \nnot. But to impose all of the burden on the executive branch and to \nstep away from our responsibility I don't think is fair. It doesn't \nengage the symmetry, which I think is important.\n\n  I will concede, as Senator Byrd has said, the constitutional question \nis directly addressed by this bill, but I think there is a larger \nquestion about the process and whether or not we meet our twin goals: \ntimely consideration and ultimately the very best and most able people \nwho are selected to serve us in Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I have a couple of points. With regard \nto the desire for symmetry, I point out that the symmetry and the \nbalance are provided for in the Constitution itself. It is not \nsymmetrical to take a constitutional provision and our constitutional \nduties, on the one hand, and equate it with legislation that people \nmight be for or against, on the other. The Constitution provides that \nthe President has the power to make the appointment, but only with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. It is part of our separation of \npowers, part of our checks and balances. Therein is the balance.\n  What we have today is a situation where the President, the current \nPresident, as Presidents in the past, has made nominations and figured \nout ways around the prerogatives of the Senate. We are in a situation \ntoday where we are not doing our duty. The U.S. Senate is not doing its \nduty in upholding its right and protecting and preserving its right.\n  We can bring this matter back. We cannot have cloture and bring this \nmatter back time and time again. But we must recognize, with the \nprovision, of course, of being able to offer germane amendments, we \nmust recognize\n\n[[Page S11032]]\n\nthat this situation is ongoing. We can debate legislation at any time. \nIf it is deemed desirable to put a time limit on the U.S. Senate to \nconsider appointments, we can debate that.\n  I think it is very bad legislation. As most Senators, I think, know, \nthere is more than one reason why nominations languish up here \nsometimes. Sometimes they languish for very good reasons. Sometimes it \nis an attempt to work with the White House with regard to someone who \nhas problems. Instead of just saying no and sending it back or telling \nthem to take it back, we find ways to work around the problems we have. \nThere are many reasons why that would be bad legislation, but it is \nsomething that can be considered at any time.\n  We have had this vacancies situation with us about 130 years now in \nterms of this legislation, and there are all kinds of things that can \nbe added to it at this date, that it would probably be better if it \nwere considered separately and invoke cloture today so we can address a \nproblem that is really important in terms of the constitutional \nresponsibilities of this body.\n  With regard to the other objections of the bill and talking about \nthat this is too confining on the front end, actually we either are \ncontinuing practices that have been with us for 130 years or we are \nmaking them more liberal. We are giving the President greater leeway. \nWe are giving him 150 days instead of 120 under current law. If we do \nnot pass this legislation, he will keep 120 days instead of the 150 we \nare trying to give him. People are concerned about a new President \ncoming in. We have added an additional 90 days to the 150 days in which \na new President will have to make his nominations. We also added \nanother liberalizing provision that, if he lets the 150 days expire and \nthen there is a period of time and then he makes the nomination, the \nacting person can go back and resume his duties. These are all \nliberalizing provisions.\n  I understand the need to consider amendments. I was hoping that the \npossibility of germane amendments would get us through this, in light \nof the fact that we have spent a lot of time working on a bipartisan \nbasis and making several changes.\n  We have made changes since this legislation was introduced to allow \nthe President to cure a vacancy by sending up a nomination even after \n150 days; by modifying the exclusion provision to exclude chief \nfinancial officers, for example; to allow a 150-day period when it \nexpires during a recess to be extended to the second day after the \nSenate reconvenes; to reduce from 180 days to 90 days the length of \ntime a first assistant held that position and can be eligible to be a \nnominee; extended the transitional period following a new President's \ninauguration, as I said, from 180 days to 240 days. In most of these \ncases, we have worked out on a bipartisan basis extensions and \nliberalizations from what is the current law.\n  While there would not be an opportunity to offer relevant amendments \nthat are not germane, I suggest that this is something whose time has \ncome and that we would be doing a disservice if we did not go ahead and \nmove this legislation--something that, as I say, has to do--it is not \njust a normal piece of legislation, it has to do with the carrying out \nof our constitutional duties.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 2176, the \n``Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998'' introduced this summer by \nSenator Thompson, Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee with \njurisdiction over the Act. I want to thank Senator Levin for managing \nthe bill today. I also want to thank Chairman Thompson for the \naccommodations his staff has afforded Democratic staff in the \nnegotiations leading up to this brief debate. We, on our side of the \naisle, were blindsided, to say the least, by the filing of the cloture \npetitions last week as staff were negotiating the terms of a unanimous \nconsent agreement on, and the substance of a managers' amendment to \nthis very bill.\n  As we know, the Vacancies Act governs the temporary filling of what \nwe call ``advise and consent'' or PAS positions (Presidentially-\nappointed, Senate-confirmed) in the Executive Branch. As I have said \nmany times before, I remain concerned about two important goals of any \nnew law we pass: (1) As Senator Byrd--the best expert this body has on \nSenate procedure and constitutional law--has repeatedly noted, this is \none of the Senate's most important and serious constitutional \nprerogatives in that we are expected--required, in fact, under the \nConstitution--to provide our advise and consent on the nominees the \nPresident submits to us for our consideration; and (2) maintaining the \nsmooth functioning of government with the large number of vacancies we \nseem to have to deal with. On one hand, we have more slots in \ngovernment than ever before which means more vacancies. On the other \nhand, our confirmation process is long and tedious keeping acting \nofficials (many of whom are very qualified to fill their slots) in \ntheir positions for longer than we intend.\n  Combined, these concepts make the continuity of the functioning of \ngovernment a challenge to achieve, but certainly not impossible. We \nshould be creating a process that reflects reality and provides the \nproper safeguards and enforcement mechanisms.\n  I believe the bill as it stands now improves on current law, but I \nthink there is still work to be done. The White House has issued a veto \nletter on this bill. While I consider this important legislation, I \nremain concerned about many of the issues raised by the Administration, \nand I have filed amendments to address many of these concerns.\n  For instance, are we being too limiting in who can become an acting \nofficial? Current law mandates that an acting official can be the first \nassistant or anyone the President designates. We will be narrowing \ncurrent law to include the first assistant or any PAS official the \nPresident designates. The importance of this change is that in the \nabsence of a first assistant or at the President's discretion, we will \nbe requiring someone whom the Senate has already approved to fill a \nslot for which the Congress has required the Senate's advise and \nconsent. But do we really want a President to designate a PAS from HUD \nto assume the additional responsibilities of a PAS position at \nDepartment of Education? Or vice versa? Do we want these folks who \nalready have plenty of responsibility as it is to assume the added \nresponsibility of a second position? With the vetting process taking \nlonger and the noteworthy downsizing in government that has occurred \nover the last 6 years, perhaps it's time to consider a hybrid category \nof who can be a temporary acting official.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to add a third category which would \ninclude qualified individuals of a certain level or higher who are \nalready within an agency in which a vacancy occurs. Such individuals--\nwho could include high-level members of the civil service--would be \nfamiliar with the agency, its processes and culture; possess some \ninstitutional memory; and be fully capable of the task. This gives the \nPresident a larger pool from which to choose an acting official, \nparticularly in a case where there is no first assistant, and the \nPresident must turn to another PAS official to temporarily fill the \nslot. In addition, it allows a larger category of who can act at the \nbeginning of an administration to keep government functioning at a time \nwhen there are not many PAS officials. I think this amendment is \ncritical to the success of the legislation, and I hope Senators on both \nsides will give it serious consideration. I will not be able to support \nthe bill if this issue is not addressed in it.\n\n  In addition, I hope to offer amendments which would give the \nPresident the authority to extend the period for a temporary official \nif a case of national interest arose and a nomination for the position \nhad not yet been sent up. In such cases, under the amendment the \nPresident upon certification to Congress of the particular national \ninterest--be it national security, natural disaster, economic \ninstability or public health and safety--would be able to extend the \ntemporary appointment one time for 90 days.\n  Finally, I hope to offer an amendment which would further decrease \nthe requirement for a first assistant who will be an acting officer and \nthe nominee to 45 days. At the beginning of a new administration, there \nmay not be enough PAS officials to perform their own duties let alone \nthose of another position. This will be the case particularly where \nthere is a change in party\n\n[[Page S11033]]\n\nin the White House. In addition, because of the restriction in the bill \non first assistants who serve in acting capacities who will also be the \nnominees, the administration will be required to fill the first \nassistant slot as well as the vacant PAS slot. My amendment would allow \nfirst assistants to be appointed, act in the vacant slot for 45 days \nand then be nominated to fill the slot on a permanent basis before the \nend of the 60-day period for which extensions are granted at the \nbeginning of a new administration.\n  I hope that other amendments that may be offered which would impose \nthe same constraints on the Senate as this legislation would impose on \nan administration will also have a fair opportunity to be considered. \nWhile some see no connection between the Vacancies Act and the \nresponsibilities of the Senate to act on nominations, I believe the two \nare inextricably linked. I do not believe we can go forward in \nreforming one process until we commit to reforming our own.\n  I want to note that as the negotiations on this bill proceeded, we \nwere not only looking to see how this law would operate in this second-\nterm Democratic administration. Indeed, some day this law will be \nutilized by a Republican administration. With this in mind, we \nattempted to help craft a fair piece of legislation.\n  In that vein, I want to emphasize again that the process by which \nthis bill has come to the floor for such limited debate with no \nopportunity for action prior to the cloture vote, is discouraging both \nfor our faith in a fair process and for the fate of this legislation.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Bill Lann Lee\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate considers possible amendments \nto the Vacancies Act, we have occasion to focus on the Senate's advice \nand consent role for all presidential nominations and the American \npeople have an opportunity to review how well, or how badly, this \nSenate has fulfilled that constitutionally-mandated role.\n  It is important to explore ways to help the Executive Branch improve \nthe process by which the President nominates, the Senate confirms and \nthen the President appoints people to serve in important positions \nwithin the executive and judicial branches of our federal government. \nIndeed, I have often joined with Senator Byrd to defend the authority \nof the Senate on this issue and to protect the Senate's role against \nthe executive encroachments by way of excessive use of the recess \nappointment power.\n  I recall when the Reagan and Bush administrations were abusing the \npower of recess appointment and note, by contrast, how sparingly \nPresident Clinton has used that constitutional authority. I am advised \nthat while President Reagan made 239 recess appointments in 8 years and \nPresident Bush made 78 recess appointments in 4 years, President \nClinton has used his recess appointment power only 45 times over the \nlast 5 years.\n  I also recall how President Clinton acted with great restraint last \nyear when he and the Attorney General joined to appoint Bill Lann Lee \nthe Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights rather than \nusing his power to make that a recess appointment.\n  Let us focus on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. He was initially \nnominated to head the Civil Rights Division in July 1997. At the end of \n1997, that nomination got caught up in one of the narrow, partisan-\ndriven whirlwinds that hit Washington every now and then. The result \nwas that the nomination became a victim of the anti-affirmative action \nlobby and was denied a vote by the full Senate. Bill Lee was \nmischaracterized last fall as a wild-eyed radical and as someone ready \nto impose an extreme agenda on the United States. He was misportrayed \nas a supporter of quotas. The Republican majority demonized this fine \nman and killed his nomination by denying him a Senate vote.\n  After looking at Bill Lee's record, I knew he was a man who could \neffectively lead the Civil Rights Division, enforce the law and resolve \ndisputes. I reviewed his record of achievement and saw a practical, \nproblem solver and noted last year that no one who has taken the time \nto review his record could call him an idealogue. I recognized that \nBill Lee would be reasonable and practical in his approach to the job, \nand that he would be a top-notch enforcer of the Nation's civil rights \nlaws.\n  Bill Lann Lee has been serving for almost 10 months now as the Acting \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and he has established a \nsolid track record. He is doing an outstanding job for all Americans. I \nhave had a chance to take a close look at what he has been doing while \nserving as the acting head of the Civil Rights Division. What I find is \na record of strong accomplishments. I see professionalism and effective \nproblem solving. I find him enforcing the law in a sensible and fair \nmanner.\n  Accordingly, I urge the Senate finally to consider the nomination of \nBill Lann Lee and to confirm him to this important post. The President \nrenominated Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General in charge of \nthe Civil Rights Division on January 29 of this year. Given his \noutstanding performance over the past 10 months, I urge the Senate to \nshow him the fairness of a vote on his nomination. I am confident that \nwhen Senators consider his nomination and review his record, a majority \nof the United States Senate will vote to confirm this outstanding \nnominee.\n  It is to raise this matter to the attention of the American people \nand for action by the Senate, that I have filed an amendment to the \nVacancies Reform Act bill to provide for a vote on the longstanding \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee before the Senate ends this year's session.\n  As we consider how to improve the Vacancies Act, the Senate would do \nwell to consider its lack of action on the many outstanding nominations \nthat the President has sent to us over the past several years on which \nthe Senate has taken no vote. In addition to unprecedented delays in \nthe consideration of judicial nominations--46 judicial nominations are \npending and 22 are on the Senate calendar--there have been a number of \nexecutive branch nominations who have been denied consideration and a \nvote for many, many months.\n  Bill Lann Lee is an example. He was first nominated for the important \nposition of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights on July 21, \n1997, over 14 months ago. When no Senate vote was taken on his \nnomination last year, he was renominated on January 29, 1998. For the \npast 8 months his nomination has, again, been bottled up in committee.\n  This is an historic nomination. Bill Lann Lee is the first Asian-\nAmerican to head the Civil Rights Division. He deserves to be confirmed \nby the Senate and to be accorded the full measure of recognition for \nall that he has achieved and all that he is doing on behalf of all \nAmericans.\n  The Senate was denied the opportunity to vote on that nomination \nbefore adjournment in 1997. With one notable and courageous exception, \nthe Republican majority of the Judiciary Committee would not report the \nnomination to the Senate so that the Senate could vote whether to \nconfirm this outstanding nominee. Although the Republicans have a \nmajority in the Senate, they have been unable to pass legislative \nproposals to undermine the nation's commitment to equal opportunity and \ncivil rights. As a result, the Republican majority decided to stall the \nLee nomination without a vote as a trophy to its extremist factions. \nThis nomination could not be defeated in a fair up or down vote, so \nthey determined to avoid that Senate vote altogether and at all costs.\n  I understand that Senator Durbin, a thoughtful member of both the \nSenate Government Affairs Committee, from which this bill emerged, and \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, which refused to report the Lee \nnomination to the Senate for action, has filed a series of amendments \nto the Vacancies Reform Act to begin to deal with this aspect of the \nproblem--Senate inaction on nominations. I will study those proposals \nwith great interest.\n  I was disappointed this year that the Senate Judiciary Committee \nrepeatedly postponed and eventually canceled hearings regarding the \nperformance of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department \nunder the leadership of Bill Lann Lee. I was disappointed because such \na hearing would have offered us a chance to look at the outstanding on-\nthe-job performance of our\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n  Over the past 10 months, the Division has focused most intensely on \nthree areas of the law: violations of our Nation's fair housing laws, \nenforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA''), and cases \ninvolving hate crimes. Bill Lee and his team of civil rights attorneys \nhave made advances in each of these areas of the law.\n  The Division has resolved a number of housing discrimination cases \nover the past few months, including the following: An agreement was \nreached with two large New Jersey apartment complexes resolving \nallegations that the defendants had discriminated against potential \nrenters based on family status and race.\n  A housing discrimination case in Michigan was settled involving an \napartment manager who told black applicants that no apartments were \navailable at the same time that he was showing vacant apartments to \nwhite applicants. An agreement was also reached with the second largest \nreal estate company in Alabama, which had been steering applicants to \nagents and residential areas based on race.\n  The Civil Rights Division has also focused on educating the public \nabout the ADA and enforcing it where necessary. These cases have \nincluded: resolution of a case in Hawaii to allow those who are vision \nimpaired to travel to the State without having to quarantine their \nguide dogs for four months in advance of arrival;\n  a consent decree with the National Collegiate Athletic Association so \nthat high school athletes with learning disabilities have the \nopportunity to compete for scholarships and participate in college \nathletics; an agreement with private hospitals in Connecticut to ensure \npatients who are deaf have access to sign-language interpreters; and \nassistance to the State of Florida to update their building code to \nbring it into compliance with the ADA. Florida joins Maine, Texas and \nWashington State in having a certified building code thereby ensuring \nbetter compliance with the ADA by architects, builders and contractors \nwithin the State.\n  The Civil Rights Division has also resolved several hate crimes cases \nover the past 7 months, including:\n\n       In Idaho, six men pleaded guilty to engaging in a series of \n     racially motivated attacks on Mexican American men, women and \n     children, some as young as 9; in Arizona, three members of a \n     skinhead group pleaded guilty to burning a cross in the front \n     yard of an African American woman; and in Texas, a man \n     pleaded guilty to entering a Jewish temple and firing several \n     gun shots while shouting anti-Semitic slurs.\n\n  The Division has also been vigorously enforcing its criminal \nstatutes, including: indictments against three people in Arkansas \ncharged with church burning; guilty pleas by 16 Puerto Rico \ncorrectional officers who beat 22 inmates and then tried to cover it \nup; cases arising from Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14, \nbeing lured to the U.S. and then being forced into prostitution; and \nguilty pleas from 18 defendants who forced 60 deaf Mexican nationals to \nsell trinkets on the streets of New York. Out of concerns about slavery \ncontinuing in the U.S., Bill Lann Lee has created a Worker Exploitation \nTask Force to coordinate enforcement efforts with the Department of \nLabor. I commend the Acting Assistant Attorney General for putting the \nspotlight on these shameful crimes.\n  Other significant cases which the Civil Rights Division has handled \nin the past few months include the following: several long-standing \nschool desegregation cases were settled or their consent decrees were \nterminated, including cases in Kansas City, Kansas; San Juan County, \nUtah; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Japanese-Latin Americans who were \ndeported and interned in the United States during World War II finally \nreceived compensation this year. Lawsuits in Ohio and Washington, D.C. \nwere settled to allow women access to women's health clinics.\n  The record establishes that Bill Lann Lee has been running the \nDivision the way it should be run. Here in Washington, where we have \nlots of show horses, Bill Lee is a work horse--a dedicated public \nofficial who is working hard to help solve our Nation's problems. I \ncommend him and the many hardworking professionals at the Civil Rights \nDivision.\n  Bill Lee has served as acting head of the Civil Rights Division for \n10 months now. Given the claims made by many in the Senate last fall \nthat Mr. Lee would lead the Division astray, you might expect that he \nwould be in the headlines every day associated with some extreme \ndecision. Instead, we have seen the strong and steady work of the \nDivision--solid achievements and effective law enforcement.\n  A few weeks ago, I received a letter from Governor Zell Miller of \nGeorgia that is emblematic of the record that Bill Lee has established. \nGovernor Miller discusses Bill Lee's efficient and effective ability to \nsettle an action which involved Georgia's juvenile detention \nfacilities. He notes that he was not exactly a fan of the Civil Rights \nDivision before Bill Lee came along and writes that he ``was fearful \nthat Georgia would be unable to get a fair forum in which to present \nour position, and that we would once again be compelled to engage in \nprotracted and expensive litigation.'' Governor Miller writes that his \nfears were unfounded, that the parties engaged in ``intensive and \nexpeditious negotiations'' and reached a fair agreement. Governor \nMiller also notes:\n\n       I have indicated to Mr. Lee both personally and publicly \n     that he and his staff treated Georgia with professionalism, \n     fairness, and respect during our negotiations. Under the \n     direction of Bill Lann Lee, what began as a potentially \n     divisive and litigious process was transformed into an \n     atmosphere where the State was able to have its case heard \n     fairly, resulting in a reasonable agreement benefiting all \n     parties. This is the way in which the Civil Rights Division \n     should operate in its dealings with the states, and I am \n     pleased to commend Mr. Lee and his staff for their efforts in \n     this matter.\n\n  The Acting Assistant Attorney General continues to build on his \nreputation as a professional and effective negotiator, who routinely \nearns praise from opposing parties. I had high expectations for Bill \nLann Lee when he was nominated and I have not been disappointed. He is \ndoing a terrific job. It is time for the Senate to end his second-class \nstatus and confirm him.\n  We need Bill Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these \ndifficult times. It is wrong for the Senate to ignore his nomination \nany longer and a shameful slight to him, to his family and to all who \ncare about fairness and equal rights.\n  I remember vividly when Mr. Lee appeared at his confirmation hearing \nalmost one year ago. He testified candidly about his views, his work \nand his values. He understood that as the Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Civil Rights Division his client is the United States and all \nof its people. He told us poignantly about why he became a person who \nhas dedicated his life to equal justice for all when he spoke of the \ntreatment that his parents received as immigrants.\n  Mr. Lee told us how in spite of his father's personal treatment and \nexperiences, William Lee remained a fierce American patriot, \nvolunteered to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in World War \nII and never lost his belief in America. He inspired his son and Bill \nnow inspires his own children and countless others across the land. Mr. \nLee noted:\n\n       My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it \n     difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching \n     patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I \n     did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to \n     a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance. \n     But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an \n     American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside \n     the momentary ugliness. He knew that the basic American tenet \n     of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.\n\n  Bill Lann Lee has remained true to all that his father and mother \ntaught him. I continue to work to end the ugliness of Senate inaction \non his nomination. If opponents want to distort his achievements and \nmischaracterize his beliefs, let them at least have the decency to \nengage in that debate on the floor of the Senate so that this \nlongstanding nomination can be acted upon--either vote it up or vote it \ndown, but vote on it. His career of good works and current efforts \nshould not be rewarded with continued ugliness. Such treatment drives \ngood people from public service and distorts the role of the Senate. I \nhave often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves \nas the conscience of the nation. In this case, I am afraid that the \nSenate has shown no conscience.\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\n  Bill Lann Lee is a man of integrity, of honesty and of fairness. Born \nin Harlem, to Chinese immigrant parents, he has lived the American \ndream and stayed faithful to American values. He has done nothing to \njustify the unfair treatment by the Senate.\n  As a child he worked in his parents' laundry after school. He went on \nto graduate magna cum laude from Yale College and to obtain a law \ndegree from Columbia University. Bill Lann Lee has spent his life \nhelping others--helping them to keep their jobs, to keep their homes, \nto have a chance at a well-earned promotion and to raise healthy \nchildren.\n  As western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a \npublic interest law firm founded by Thurgood Marshall in 1939, Mr. Lee \nlitigated hundreds of cases ranging from employment discrimination \nclaims to efforts to ensure probation offices are widely dispersed \nthroughout Los Angeles to ensuring that poor children are tested for \nlead poisoning. His extensive experience and renowned skill at settling \ncases has served him well as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the \nCivil Rights Division.\n  Most impressive is the array of former opposing counsels and parties \nwho support Mr. Lee's nomination. In addition to Governor Miller, \nconsider the words of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan: Our \n``negotiations could not have concluded successfully without Mr. Lee's \npractical leadership and expertise.'' I believe Mayor Riordan's \nenthusiastic support and assurance that Mr. Lee has ``practiced \nmainstream civil rights law'' should carry some weight.\n  Mr. Lee is a top quality candidate. He has all the essential \nqualities for this job--a legal career devoted to top-notch civil \nrights work, an outstanding degree of integrity and a commitment to \npractical solutions. This year he also has a proven track record as the \nActing Assistant Attorney General.\n  No one can argue that the President has sent to us a person not \nqualified by experience to lead the Civil Rights Division. Bill Lee's \nrecord of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor \nand when he said to this Committee that quotas are illegal and wrong \nand that he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about \nhis resolve to do what is right. The Senate should vote on this \noutstanding nominee. He is the right person to lead the Civil Rights \nDivision into the next century. We need his proven problem-solving \nabilities in these difficult times.\n  Unfortunately, last year's consideration of this outstanding nominee \ntook a decidedly partisan turn when the Speaker of the House chose to \nintervene in this matter and urge the Senate Republican Leader to kill \nthis nomination. In his unfortunate letter, Speaker Gingrich unfairly \ncriticized Mr. Lee and accused him of unethical conduct. The \nallegations of wrongdoing carelessly lodged against Mr. Lee are \ncontradicted by the Republican Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, \nas well as the Vice-President of the Los Angeles Police Commission, T. \nWarren Jackson, the Assistant City Attorney, Robert Cramer, and the \nCity Attorney, James K. Hahn, but the damage had been done.\n  I recall when times were different. I recall when charges were raised \nagainst Clarence Thomas and the Judiciary Committee held several days \nof additional hearings after that nomination had already been reported \nby the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. There was a tie vote in \nCommittee on the Thomas nomination, which would not have even been \nreported to the Senate had we not also voted virtually unanimously, \nwith six Democrats joining seven Republicans, to report the Thomas \nnomination to the floor without recommendation. Of course, ultimately \nthe nomination of Judge Thomas to become Justice Thomas was confirmed \nby the Senate.\n  It remains my hope that the Senate will now give Bill Lann Lee the \nsame fairness that we showed Clarence Thomas and allow his nomination \nto be voted upon by the United States Senate. It would be ironic if, \nafter the Senate proceeded to debate and vote on the Thomas \nnomination--one that included charges that he engaged in sexual \nharassment--the Republican leadership prevented the Senate from \nconsidering a nominee because he has worked to remedy sexual harassment \nand gender discrimination.\n  After consultation with Senators, the President acted after \nCongress's adjournment last fall to name Bill Lann Lee the Acting \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The President then \nfollowed through on his commitments and renominated this distinguished \ncivil rights attorney and public servant on January 29, 1998. This \nSenate is now approaching adjournment, again, and, again, the Senate is \nnot voting whether to confirm or reject this nomination. The President \nhas fulfilled his end of the bargain and acted with restraint and \nrespect in this regard. The Senate has done nothing with respect to \nthis nomination but ignore it. So, when we criticize this President for \nnot sending up nominees fast enough, let us not forget that the Senate \nhas now had ample opportunity for over two years to act on the \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee and the Senate has not.\n  Last year, I was honored to stand on the steps to the Lincoln \nMemorial, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke 35 years ago and \ninspired the nation toward the promise of equality. I heard our \ncolleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator Feinstein speak about the \ncontinuing struggle to provide equal opportunity to all Americans. I \ntook inspiration from the wisdom of Rep. John Lewis whose compass is \never true on these matters. We heard Rep. Maxine Waters declare in no \nuncertain terms the support of the Congressional Black Caucus for Bill \nLann Lee, Representative Patsy Mink take pride in reiterating the \nsupport of the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus and Representative \nXavier Becerra add the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n  I heard Justin Dart, a dedicated public servant who worked with \nPresident's Reagan and Bush, declare that people with disabilities \nsupport Bill Lann Lee and Representative Bob Matsui recount the dark \ndays before the civil rights laws when his family had to suffer the \nindignity of internment because of the Japanese ancestry.\n  Just last week when Congress presented Nelson Mandela with the \nCongressional Gold Medal, we drew upon the American tradition of \nLincoln, King and so many who labored long and sacrificed much in the \nstruggle toward equality for all Americans. We honored that past last \nweek. We could extend it today by taking up and voting upon the \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for the \nCivil Rights Division. I call upon the party of Lincoln to be fair to \nLee and vote on this nomination.\n  Let the Senate debate and vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. If \nthe Senate is allowed to decide, I believe he will be confirmed and \nwill move this country forward to a time when discrimination will \nsubside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each \nchild--girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, \nregardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual \norientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to \nlive the American dream.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, as we debate how to change federal law to require \nexecutive nominations within certain time frames and to preclude \nresponsibilities from been fulfilled when a confirmed nominee is not \npresent, we also need to consider how the Senate fulfills its duties \nwith regard to nominees who have been before us for many months without \nSenate action. Since July I have been comparing the Senate's pace in \nconfirming much-needed federal judges to Mark McGwire's home run pace. \nAs the regular season ended over the weekend, Mark McGwire's home run \ntotal reached 70. Unfortunately, the Senate's judicial confirmation \ntotal remains stalled at 39.\n  As recently as 1994, the last year in which the Senate majority was \nDemocratic, the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the \nRepublican Senate 3 years to reach the century mark for judicial \nconfirmations--to accomplish what we did in one session.\n  The Senate went ``0 for August,'' risks going ``0 for September'' and \nis threatening to go ``0 for the rest of the year.'' Indeed, I have \nheard some say that the Republican Senate will refuse to confirm any \nmore nominations all year. That would be wrong and would\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\ncertainly harm the administration of justice and perpetuate the \njudicial vacancies crisis. Senate action has not even kept up with \nnormal attrition over the past 2 years, let alone made a real \ndifference in filling longstanding judicial vacancies. Both the Second \nCircuit and the Ninth Circuit have had to cancel hearings due to \njudicial vacancies. Chief Judge Winter of the Second Circuit has had to \ndeclare a circuit emergency and to proceed with only one circuit judge \non their 3-judge panels. Recently, he has had to extend that \ncertification of emergency.\n  Yet in spite of that emergency, the Senate continues to stall the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit. Her \nnomination has been stalled on the Senate calendar for over six months. \nChief Judge Winter's most recent annual report noted that the Circuit \nnow has the greatest backlog it has ever had, due to the multiple \nvacancies that have plagued that court.\n  For a time Judge Sotomayor's nomination was being delayed because \nsome feared that she might be considered as a possible replacement for \nJustice Stevens, should he choose to resign from the Supreme Court. \nAfter the Supreme Court term had ended and Justice Stevens had not \nresigned, the Senate might have been expected to proceed to consider \nher nomination to the Second Circuit on its merits and confirm her \nwithout additional, unnecessary delay. Unfortunately, that has not been \nthe case.\n  When confirmed she will be only the second woman and second judge of \nPuerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit. Just as Sammy Sosa \nis a source of great pride to the Dominican Republic and to Latin \nplayers and fans everywhere, Judge Sotomayor is a source of pride to \nPuerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to women everywhere.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York in \n1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton \nUniversity and Yale Law School. She worked for over 4 years in the New \nYork District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and \nwas in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is \nstrongly support by Senators Moynihan and D'Amato.\n  I note that one of her recent decisions, Bartlett v. New York State \nBoard of Law Examiners, that had been criticized by her opponents, was \naffirmed in principal part on September 14 by a unanimous panel of the \nSecond Circuit. In an opinion written by Judge Meskill, the Court \nagreed ``with the district court's ultimate conclusion that Dr. \nBartlett, who has fought an uphill battle with a reading disorder \nthroughout her education, is among those for whom Congress provided \nprotection under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.'' In this, as in \nher other decisions that opponents seek to criticize, Judge Sotomayor \napplies the law. That is what judges are supposed to do. This \naffirmance belies the charge that she is or will be a judicial \nactivist.\n  Ironically, it was Judge Sotomayor who issued a key decision in 1995 \nthat brought an end to the work stoppage in major league baseball. If \nonly the breaking of the single season home run record could signal the \nend of the work stoppage in the Senate with respect to her nomination.\n  Instead of sustained effort by the Senate to close the judicial \nvacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays continued and unexplained \nand anonymous ``holds'' become regular order.\n  I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain the pace it \nachieved at the end of last year when 27 judges were confirmed in the \nlast nine weeks. Instead, the Senate has confirmed only 39 judicial \nnominees in 25 weeks in session. Had the Senate merely maintained the \npace that it set at the end of last year, the Senate would have \nconfirmed 75 judges--not 39 judges--by now.\n  We have 22 qualified nominees on the Senate calendar awaiting action. \nIncluding those still pending before the Committee, we have a total of \n46 judicial nominations awaiting action, some of whom were first \nreceived over three years ago.\n  The Senate continues to tolerate upwards of 75 vacancies in the \nfederal courts with more on the horizon--almost one in 10 judgeships \nremains unfilled and, from the looks of things, will remain unfilled \ninto the future. The Senate needs to proceed more promptly to consider \nnominees reported to it and to do a better job fulfilling its \nconstitutional responsibility of advice and consent.\n  Unfortunately, the record that the Senate is on pace to set this year \nwith respect to judicial nominations is the record for the amount of \ntime it takes to be confirmed once the nomination is received by the \nSenate. For those few nominees lucky enough to be confirmed as federal \njudges, the average number of days for the Senate confirmation process \nhas continued to escalate. In 1996, that number rose to a record 183 \ndays on average. Last year, the average number of days from nomination \nto confirmation rose dramatically yet again. From initial nomination to \nconfirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 \njudges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time \nin our history. It was 212 days.\n  The time is still growing and the average is still rising, to the \ndetriment of the administration of justice. The average time from \nnomination to confirmation for judges confirmed this year is 259 days. \nThat is three times as long as it was taking before this partisan \nslowdown.\n  I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the \nPresident's judicial nominations to reconsider and work to fulfil this \nconstitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling \nof these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing \nthe administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the \nguilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.\n  The federal judiciary's workload was at least 60 percent lower than \nit is today when the Reagan-Bush administrations took office. The \nfederal court's criminal docket alone is up from 28,921 cases in 1980 \nto 50,363 last year. That is an increase of over 70 percent in the \ncriminal case filings in the federal courts.\n  During the Reagan and Bush administrations, whether it had a \nDemocratic or Republican majority, the Senate promptly considered and \nconfirmed judges and authorized 167 new judgeships in response to the \nincreasing workload of the federal judiciary. While authorized \njudgeships have increased in number by 25 percent since 1980, the \nworkload of the federal courts has grown by over 60 percent during the \nsame period. That is why the prolonged vacancies being perpetuated by \ndelays in the confirmation process are creating such strains within the \nfederal courts.\n  Unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be attributed \nto newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the vacancies \ncrisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move quickly to \nconsider nominees to longstanding vacancies.\n  In the early and mid-1980's, vacancies were between 25 and 34 at the \nbeginning of each session of Congress. By the fall of 1983, the \nvacancies for the entire federal judiciary had been reduced to only 16.\n  With attrition and the 85 new judgeships created in 1984, vacancies \nreached 123 at the beginning of President Reagan's second term, but \nthose vacancies were reduced to only 33 within two years, by the fall \nof 1986. A Democratic Senate in 1987 and 1988 reduced the vacancies \nstill further to only 23 at the end of the 100th Congress.\n  It was not until additional judgeships were created in 1990 that the \nnext significant increase in vacancies occurred and then, again, a \nDemocratic Senate responsibly set about the task of helping fill those \nvacancies with qualified nominees. Although President Bush was \nnotoriously slow to nominate, the Democratic Senate confirmed 124 \nnominees in President Bush's last two years in office and cut the \nvacancies in half.\n  With respect to the question of vacancies, it is also important to \nnote that in 1997 the Judiciary Conference of the United States \nrequested an additional 53 judgeships be created. The Republican \nCongress has refused to consider that workload justified request. My \nbill to meet that request, S. 678, the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, \nhas received no attention since I introduced it over a year ago. Had \nthose additional judgeships been created, as\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\nthey were in 1984 and 1990 under Republican Presidents, current \njudicial vacancies would number 128 and total almost 14 percent of the \nfederal judiciary.\n  Last week Senator Graham spoke about authorizing the additional \nDistrict Court judges recommended by the Judicial Conference and needed \naround the country. These are the judges who try federal criminal cases \nand hear complex federal civil litigation. Given the Republican \nSenate's tenacious refusal to consider and confirm judges for the \nvacancies that currently exist, it seems unlikely that the Republican \nmajority would be willing to authorize the additional federal judicial \nresources that are needed around the country. That is a shame. The \nSenator from Florida is right to try and I join him in his efforts.\n  No one should take comfort from the number of confirmations achieved \nso far this year. It is only in comparison to the dismal achievements \nof the last two years that 39 confirmations could be seen as an \nimprovement. The President has been doing a better job of sending the \nSenate scores of nominees more promptly. Unfortunately, qualified and \ncapable nominees are still being delayed too long and stalled.\n  I have pledged to continue to work to end the judicial vacancies \ncrisis and to support efforts to provide the federal judiciary with the \nresources it needs to handle its growing caseload and serve the \nAmerican people.\n  When the Senate is asked to consider amendments to the Vacancies Act, \nit should also reconsider its own inaction on the many outstanding \nnominees that the President has sent the Senate and that the Senate is \nrefusing to consider.\n  Indeed, earlier this year I proposed a bill that requires the Senate \nto vote on nominations for Court of Appeals vacancies that created an \nemergency under federal law. The week after Chief Judge Winter of the \nSecond Circuit certified such an emergency last spring, I introduced \nthe Judicial Emergency Responsibility Act, S. 1906. The purpose of this \nbill is to supplement the law by which Chief Justice Winter certified \nthe judicial emergency, a judicial emergency that still persists in the \nSecond Circuit, and to require the Senate to do its duty and to act on \njudicial nominations before it recesses for significant stretches of \ntime. The Senate should not be taking vacations when a Circuit Court is \nsuffering from a vacancy emergency.\n  I introduced the bill just before the Senate adjourned for a 2-week \nrecess and I urged prompt action on the nominations then pending to \nfill those Second Circuit vacancies. At that time, the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor was among those favorably reported and had been \non the Senate Calendar awaiting action for a month. That was five \nmonths ago. Still, there has not been any action.\n  I did not believe that the Senate should be leaving for a two-week \nrecess in April or a four-week recess in August and leaving the Second \nCircuit with vacancies for which it had qualified nominations pending. \nI do not believe that the Senate should adjourn this year without \nvoting on the many qualified judicial nominees that have been pending \nbefore the Senate for so long without action. I have been urging action \non the nominees to the Second Circuit for more than a year. The Senate \nis failing in its obligations to the people of the Second Circuit, to \nthe people of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. We should call an end \nto this stall and take action.\n  I intend to consult with the managers of the bill, but believe that I \nshould offer S. 1906 as an amendment to the pending measure.\n  What the Senate is proceeding to do to the judicial branch in \nrefusing to vote on nominees and perpetuating judicial vacancies is too \nreminiscent of the government shutdown only a couple of years ago and \nthe numerous times of late when the Republican congressional leadership \nhas recessed without completing work on emergency supplemental and \ndisaster relief legislation. As we approach the end of the session, the \nRepublican Congress has yet to pass a budget or enact the 13 annual \nappropriations bills that are our responsibility. Must we wait for the \nadministration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate \nwill take this crisis seriously and act on the nominees pending before \nit? I hope not.\n  I look forward to Senate debate on suggestions to impose \nresponsibility upon itself in its treatment of judicial nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes from the time \nallocated to Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me say at the outset that the bill before us \naddresses a very important problem, which is to say the need to protect \nthe Senate's constitutional role in the appointment of Federal \nofficers. The Constitution, as my colleagues have indicated, provides \nthat the President's power to appoint officers of the United States is \nto be exercised ``by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate. . . \n.''\n  Unfortunately, in too many cases over the course of the past several \nadministrations, the Senate's constitutional prerogatives have too \noften been ignored through the executive's far-too-common practice of \nappointing acting officials to serve lengthy periods in positions that \nare supposed to be filled with individuals confirmed by the Senate. I \nthink it is, therefore, entirely appropriate--indeed necessary--for \nCongress to act to remedy this situation.\n  I appreciate very much the leadership given by the Senator from West \nVirginia, the Senator from South Carolina, and the chairman of our \ncommittee, the Senator from Tennessee. I also appreciate those \nSenators' willingness to work with the members of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, including this Senator, to accommodate some of the \nconcerns we have had as the bill moved through committee.\n  The fact is, throughout that whole period of time, the effort to \nreform the Vacancies Act has been a truly bipartisan one, as it should \nbe. Even though I believe there are some problems remaining with the \nbill, I also am confident that the process of resolving those problems \nhas been conducted in good faith and with fairness on all sides.\n  I therefore regret that, along with many of my colleagues, I find \nmyself in the situation I am today, which is to say, prepared to vote \nagainst cloture on this bill, because I believe there remain serious \nsubstantive problems with the bill, and the procedural situation we are \nin now with a cloture motion having been filed in an attempt to limit \ndebate will frustrate our ability to work together to solve some of \nthose remaining problems.\n  I think it is particularly unfortunate that we find ourselves in this \nposition on this bill because I am confident that, were we not forced \nimmediately into a cloture vote, we likely could work out the problems \nthat remain with the bill. It remains my hope, if cloture is not \nobtained on the vote that will occur in a little more than 10 minutes, \nthat we can continue to work together to achieve a unanimous consent \nagreement that will allow perhaps for amendments that are relevant, if \nnot germane, according to the procedures of the Senate.\n  Let me briefly give an example of one of the problems that I think \nremains with the bill which is of concern to some. As the bill is \ncurrently drafted, only one of two individuals can serve as acting \nofficials in the case of a vacancy: Either the first assistant to the \nvacant position, a term of art that generally refers to the top deputy; \nor someone already confirmed by the Senate for another position. \nBecause individuals holding Senate-confirmed positions already have a \nlot to do, it almost always will be the first assistant who takes over \nas the acting.\n  But, by the terms of the bill, a first assistant apparently can take \nover only if he or she was the first assistant at the time of the \nvacancy. This severe limitation on the universe of individuals who may \nserve as acting is, in my view, a mistake that could be harmful to the \nfunctioning of the executive branch because it will have the effect of \nforcing many important positions to remain vacant, potentially for \nseveral months at a time. That is because\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nthere are many times when a vacancy occurs at a time that the first \nassistant position is also vacant.\n  There may be other times when a first assistant, who was there when \nthe vacancy occurred, may want to leave his or her job during the \npendency of that vacancy. In both situations, as I read the literal \nterms of the bill as it is before us, it would require that during the \nduration of the vacancy, which could be many months long, we would be \nrequiring that no one other than people who had already been confirmed \nfor other positions would be eligible to serve as the acting in the \nvacant position. We would be effectively denying the executive branch \nthe ability to put someone else in that position on an acting basis.\n  Also troubling is what can happen when a new President comes into \noffice. If individuals in Senate-confirmed positions leave before the \nnew President takes office, as often happens, then the only people who \nwould be qualified to serve as acting officials as the new \nadministration gets off the ground, because they were the first \nassistants at the time of the vacancy, are holdovers, often political \nappointees from the previous administration. That could create an \nawkward situation that would require a new administration to staff \nitself with a previous administration's political appointees.\n  I am confident that we could work this problem out were the bill to \ncome to the floor under the normal processes. But, unfortunately, in \nthe posture that it is now in, it is not so.\n  So I must say I again will vote against cloture, but I do remain \nhopeful that if cloture is not granted on this next vote, we will be \nable to find a way together to continue the bipartisan path that this \nbill has taken, until this moment when it has reached the Senate floor, \nand find a way to find a common ground to move forward with this bill \non which a lot of work has been done, and, though it is detailed and \nintricate, in which the public interest finds a great expression.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee controls 4 minutes. \nThe Senator from Michigan controls 8 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask the Senator from West Virginia if he has \nadditional comments.\n  I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. A couple quick points.\n  My friend from Connecticut makes good points, as usual. I point out, \nthough, that the concern about, someone could not be a first assistant \nif they had not been there for so many days, that would not keep them \nfrom being the acting officer. If they were appointed to the permanent \nposition, they would have needed to have been there for 90 days. But \njust to be the acting officer, anyone who serves in that position would \nbecome the acting officer without having been there any length of time.\n  With regard to the second concern with regard to a new \nadministration, my understanding is there is always a holdover person \nwho is a Senate-confirmed person who traditionally takes care of those \nproblems--essentially the same situation we have had for the last 130 \nyears with regard to those concerns, I believe.\n  I yield the Senator from West Virginia the remainder of my time, \nwhich I think is probably 2, 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished chairman for \nhis outstanding service that he has performed in the interest of the \nConstitution, the interest of this institution, and the interest of the \nliberties of the people which we are all trying to protect in this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, I believe there--we only have less than 2 minutes; is \nthat right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut wish to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the distinguished Senator from Connecticut will yield me \na little of his time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield the Senator as much time as he wants.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am reminded of that situation which \noccurred in 63 B.C. Sallustius writes about. And it is referred to as \nthe conspiracy of Catiline. After Caesar had spoken in the Roman \nsenate, protesting against the death penalty for the conspirators, for \nthe accomplices of Catiline, Cato the Younger was called upon by \nCicero, the consul, to speak. Cato demanded that the accomplices of \nCatiline be put to death under the ancient laws of the republic.\n  From Cato's speech I quote only the following strain: ``Do not think \nthat it was by arms that our ancestors raised the state from so small \nbeginnings to such grandeur, but there were other things from which \nthey derived their greatness. They were industrious at home, just \nrulers abroad, and into the Senate Chamber they brought untrammeled \nminds, not enslaved by passion.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate not to let \ntheir minds be trammeled with passion. Keep them untrammeled and \nfocused on the injury that is being done to the Senate by the executive \ndepartment in the flaunting and circumventing of the appointments \nclause, which this legislation addresses and is intended to secure for \nthe Senate its rights and prerogatives under the Constitution.\n  Democrats and Republicans who reverence the Constitution and who \npride themselves in having been given the honor to serve in this \ninstitution--the legislative branch--I hope will stand up for the \ninstitution and bind ourselves to the mast of the Constitution, as did \nOdysseus when the divine Circe bade him to stay away from the Sirens' \nisle.\n  I hope that we will keep in mind that we are making several \nimprovements in this bill as it is written. And as the distinguished \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee has so eloquently \npointed out within the last few minutes, even without amendments this \nbill is a liberal advancement--liberal from the standpoint of the \nadministration, whatever administration it might be, Democratic or \nRepublican. It gives more time to the administration.\n  So if we turn down this opportunity, I hope the opportunity will come \nagain. But if it does not, then the administration is the loser, as \nwell as the Senate--but the Senate is the greater loser because of the \nconstitutional requirements under the appointments clause which give \nthe Senate a share in the appointments of individuals to important \npositions in the executive branch and the judicial branch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise simply to make an unrelated motion. I ask \nunanimous consent that privileges of the floor be granted to Laureen \nDaly of my staff during the pendency of S. 442 and H.R. 3529.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I think on this side we have spoken our piece. For the \nreasons indicated, we hope that our colleagues will vote against \ncloture and then that both sides can come together to achieve common \nground and pass this important piece of legislation.\n  I, therefore, yield back the remaining time from our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it looks like the administration has just \nexperienced a tardy but welcome revelation, Mr. President. After 6 \nyears of coddling its rulers and selling out U.S. exporters, some in \nthe administration are now beginning to realize that ``engagement'' has \nnot moved China toward free trade but to greater protectionism.\n  The $50 billion a year and growing bilateral United States trade \ndeficit, the largest with any trading partner in the world but Japan, \nwasn't enough. The continued and egregious market access barriers to \nU.S. agricultural products weren't enough. The defiant stance against \nWTO negotiators wasn't enough. And the flagrant violation of the \nintellectual property rights of the American software and entertainment \nindustries wasn't enough.\n  But finally, China has pushed at least one member of the \nadministration too far. The straw that broke the camel's\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\nback was China's decision to ban joint ventures in the \ntelecommunications industry. In Beijing last Tuesday, David Aaron, \nUndersecretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, \nbecame the first American official in nearly a decade to speak openly \nabout China's protectionist trade policy and to threaten retaliation.\n  Aaron is quoted in last Wednesday's Wall Street Journal as saying of \nthe long list of trade barriers erected against American imports in \nChina, ``The list keeps getting longer, and nothing gets struck off \nit.'' He continues, ``China is taking the trade relationship for \ngranted. They want to export to us but not buy our products.''\n  Yes; that is precisely what I have been arguing for 3 years. But an \nadministration wedded to a policy of ``engagement'' with China no \nmatter how unproductive refused to believe it until now. I cannot begin \nto express the sense of vindication I had when reading an article in \nlast Wednesday's Washington Post that hinted at a new administration \ntrade policy with China. Instead of continuing to hope that China's \ndesire to join the community of free trading nations in the WTO would \noutweigh its protectionist tendencies, the administration is finally \n``threatening retribution in a much more concrete arena--the United \nStates market . . . ''\n  All well and good, but a day late and a dollar short. While President \nClinton dismissed those of us in the antiengagement camp as ignorant, \nantifree traders, while the administration allowed the Government of \nthe People's Republic of China to walk all over the United States for 6 \nyears, and while the United States trade deficit ballooned out of \ncontrol, my home State of Washington suffered the consequences.\n  Since 1972, China has refused to allow Pacific Northwest wheat into \nits market. This nontariff barrier erected against our wheat is based \non a bogus phytosanitary concern with the spread of a wheat disease \ncalled TCK smut. For more than 20 years, the United States has \npresented Chinese officials with irrefutable scientific evidence which \nproves conclusively that there is absolutely no risk of introducing TCK \nsmut into China.\n  China's ban on Pacific Northwest wheat is in violation of \ninternational standards requiring that import barriers imposed in the \nname of food safety be based on sound science. But it is protectionism, \nnot sound science, that serves as the basis for China's ban on \nWashington State wheat.\n  For the past 3 years, I and several of my colleagues from the Pacific \nNorthwest, have written to the President and Vice President to ask for \nassistance in tearing down this deplorable trade barrier. Our \nentreaties have been totally ignored, Mr. President, and the wheat \nfarmers in my home State of Washington have suffered at the hands of \nthe administration's weakness.\n\n  Instead, the administration turned a blind eye to the wheat ban and \nhundreds of other Chinese protectionist policies, arguing all along \nthat continuing to grant most-favored-nation trading status to China \nwas the best and only way of improving our trade relationship with \nChina.\n  In addition, our apples are barred from Chinese markets. Our \ninsurance firms can't do business in China. Our telecommunications \nequipment is barred.\n  The Chinese are not stupid. In fact, one might argue that they are \nbrilliant strategists, having convinced the United States to sit on its \nhands while China pillaged the United States market. That the \nPresident, the leader of the strongest nation in the world, rolled over \nand played dead in the face of Chinese threats is an embarrassment to \nthe United States. He betrays the free people of Taiwan--who do buy our \ngoods and services. But he will sell China what it will gladly \npurchase--our defense secrets. He allows our intellectual property to \nbe stolen with impunity.\n  The President knows that China is the world's largest emerging \nmarket. With a billion potential consumers for United States goods and \nan insatiable need for infrastructure improvements and technology, the \nChinese market is among the most appealing in the world. In the fact of \nthis prize, the administration simply caved in to the demands of \nChina's dictators.\n  What the administration has ignored until this week, is that the \nUnited States is China's most important market as well. In fact, the \nUnited States absorbs 30 percent of China's exports. And today, with \nthe financial crisis having drastically decreased demand throughout \nAsia, the American market is even more important to China.\n  In its rush to expand its economy and catch up with the rest of the \nworld, China, since the late 1980's, has embarked on a full scale \neffort greatly to increase its overseas exports and thus to foster an \neconomic boom within its own borders. Without the United States market, \nChina's economic growth would come to a screeching halt.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I have argued for 3 years that we should \nuse the United States market as leverage in our trade disputes with \nChina. But the administration refused to accept the logic of this \nstrategy--until, that is, Secretary Aaron spoke so frankly in Beijing \non Tuesday. I implore the administration, with its newfound wisdom, to \ntake Aaron's advice and start tomorrow not just to threaten, but to \nimpose retaliation against China unless it makes dramatic changes in \nits trade policy immediately.\n  To make such threats without following through would be disastrous. \nThe administration must act on its words and impose trade restrictions \non China immediately unless it takes drastic steps to eliminate market \naccess barriers to United States exports.\n  The administration should start with the most egregious barrier of \nall, the ban on Pacific Northwest wheat. If, by next week, China has \nnot succumbed to the irrefutable scientific evidence and allowed \nPacific Northwest wheat into its market, the United States must take \nretaliatory action. If China won't let our wheat into its market, we \nshouldn't let China's textiles into our market. It is a simple \nsolution, and it will work. China wants our markets. It won't risk \nlosing them, even if the price is open markets to American goods and \nservices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the past several weeks the \nSenate has spent its time debating spending legislation. Now with only \n10 days remaining in the second session of this 105th Congress we are \ngoing to begin considering a supplemental spending bill.\n  The American people are currently facing tax rates that are near all-\ntime highs. These excessive taxes are being imposed on the American \npeople in spite of the fact that for the first time in a generation the \nFederal books are balanced. The first time since 1969, since Neil \nArmstrong walked on the Moon, the books are balanced and we have these \nnear all-time high tax rates.\n  Congress did some work in balancing the budget and restraining \nspending, but Americans did most of the work. And now that there is a \nsurplus, they should be the first ones to get some relief. Currently, \non average, 21 million American married couples are forced to shoulder \nan additional, on average, $1,400 in taxes simply because they are \nmarried. That is ridiculous. Congress now has the opportunity to \ncorrect this injustice by repealing the marriage penalty. And I want to \nsay this very clearly: We can do so without touching the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  We need to enact profamily, progrowth tax relief and eliminate the \nmarriage penalty. That is an important first step that we need to move \nforward on reducing our horrendously high taxes in America. America \nclearly needs strong families. The family is the building block for our \ncountry and our hope for the future, and it is unconscionable the Tax \nCode of the United States is being used to subsidize something against \nthe family, to penalize those who are married rather than living \ntogether, and creating disincentives towards marriage. We need to \neliminate the marriage penalty during the remaining 11 days of this \nsession of Congress. We have the time. We have the opportunity. The \nHouse has passed an $80 billion tax package that includes elimination \nof a portion of the marriage penalty. The Senate needs to move forward \nwith this now.\n  The American people should be the first to benefit from our budget \nsurplus\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\nwith a reduction in their taxes this year. And we can do it without \ntouching the Social Security trust fund. Elimination of the marriage \npenalty will serve this purpose. First, it will restrain the growth in \nthe Federal Government, and more importantly will begin to keep \nWashington taxmongers out of people's wallets and out of their lives.\n  During debate on the Treasury-Postal appropriation bill, the Senate \nspoke overwhelmingly in favor of a complete elimination of the marriage \npenalty. We need as large a tax cut as is possible, and in particular, \nas large a cut in the marriage penalty as possible.\n  Finally, I would like to state my willingness to work in a bipartisan \nway with my colleagues across the aisle in providing the type of tax \nrelief that I know we both want to give married couples laboring under \nthis oppressive Tax Code.\n  A couple of days ago, some of my colleagues were on the floor \ndemanding that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board begin to \nimplement expansionary monetary policy by cutting interest rates. \nCutting interest rates would incentivize investment and act as a \nstabilizing effect on many worldwide financial markets now teetering \nunder a cloud of uncertainty.\n  I think that is good, that the Federal Reserve should consider moving \ntowards a more expansionist monetary policy, but I don't think we \nshould require the Fed to do that. I believe we should let the Federal \nReserve do its job and we should concentrate on doing our job. If \nCongress has the will to enact progrowth fiscal policy, I suggest it \nbegin to do so by enacting the largest tax cut possible so we can help \nstimulate the financial markets, help in this uncertain financial \nsituation that we have, and continue the growth taking place.\n  We have a unique opportunity to substantially change our Tax Code \ntreatment of married people. We can do so without touching the Social \nSecurity trust fund. There are other people who want to spend that \nmoney. I think we need to leave the money alone, create a real Social \nSecurity trust fund, and at the same time let's give people a little \nbit of their money back with a tax cut. The House has done this. Let's \nwork together, let's push to finally be able to get some of that tax \nrelief put in place.\n  Last year, we cut taxes for the first time in 16 years. We need to \ncontinue that effort to cut taxes to continue to stimulate the economy, \nto continue to give people back a little bit of their money. We should \nstart with married two-wage-earner couples who are being penalized by a \nTax Code that doesn't make any sense at this point.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let's work with the House and make this tax \ncut a reality. We can do it. We have spent a year talking about \nspending. Let's take a few days to talk about tax cuts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11040-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \nApp.) to provide that Offices of Inspector General shall be treated as \nindependent agencies in the preparation of the United States Budget, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    inspector general act amendments\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to establish a \nmore independent budget process for the Inspector Generals of each \nfederal Department.\n  Under our current budget process, each federal Department Secretary \nhas the power to determine the budget of its Inspector General or IG. \nWhile our Department Secretaries generally do a fine job of overseeing \ntheir respective Departments and agencies, I feel that it is a conflict \nof interest for the head of an executive agency to also determine the \nfunding levels for an office whose main function is investigating that \nagency. In the interest of proper checks and balances, I would hope \nthat we could establish true independence for the IGs budgets.\n  The IGs are our government watchdogs. Yet, too often, their budgets \nhave been cut back. The United States government is wrestling with \nstreamlining its programs and revamping how it does business. But it \nhas been the IG offices which have largely identified the waste, fraud, \nand abuse in the federal government and allow this body to make \nsignificant budget cuts in an effective manner. We need stronger \nwatchdogs, not weaker.\n  The offices of Inspectors General has served this country well in \nmaking sure that the taxpayers' dollars are not misspent. This spring, \nfor example, the Department of Defense's IG, Eleanor Hill, testified \nbefore the House Oversight Subcommittee. She described over $15 billion \nin fiscal year 1996 funds that were put to better use as a result of IG \nefforts. Hill pointed out that, ``At the Department of Defense, since \nFY 1989, IG audit reports have identified almost $16 billion in agreed \nupon savings. During the same period, monetary recoveries through \ninvestigations by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the \ncriminal investigative arm\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\nof my office, have totaled over $4.5 billion. Historically, our \ncriminal investigators alone have returned at least $15 in recoveries \nand fines for every dollar spent on their operations.''\n  In her testimony, DOD Inspector General Eleanor Hill concludes with \nwhat she feels are the greatest concerns for the future of the Office \nof Inspector General. She points out examples of crimes on the \nInternet, the overload of paperwork and false claims. But the biggest \nproblem, according to Ms. Hill, ``has been the continuing difficulties \nwe face in coping with programmed downsizing.'' As we attempt to cut \nwasteful spending and streamline offices, it is the office of \nInspectors General which must not be put on the chopping block.\n  Unfortunately, the support for the IGs has been often reduced more \nthan for other parts of the government. For example, the Department of \nEnergy faced an 11% cut for FY 1996, but a 21% cut in its IG budget. It \nis my fear that as we continue to cut budgets, the IGs will be first on \nthe chopping blocks at a time when we need them even more to identify \nwasteful and outdated programs.\n  It should be obvious, Mr. President, that those who could be \ninvestigated by the Inspectors General should not be given the \nresponsibility of developing and approving IG budgets. The Securities \nand Exchange Commission's budget is not decided by Wall Street firms; \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's budget is not decided by the \nnation's nuclear power companies. Congress must ensure that no \ndepartment secretary can take vengeance upon an aggressive IG office.\n  My bill aims to ensure an effective and independent federal Inspector \nGeneral system and allow each IG, in consultation with its parent \nDepartment, to decide the budget of the IG's office. This bill would \nprovide greater autonomy for the office and prevent strong criticism of \na Department, or the singling out of wasteful programs, from affecting \nwatchdog funding.\n  We have seen repeatedly how a valuable resource like the Inspector \nGeneral's office has been able to bring this body's attention, and the \nAmerican public's attention, to some of the wasteful spending of the \nfederal government. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Bond, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Helms, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Mack, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Craig, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Allard, Mr. Frist, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Burns, Mr. Bennett, \n        Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2522.

With the additional resources provided in this \nlegislation, we can begin to restore a comprehensive eradication, \ninterdiction and crop substitution strategy.\n  I say ``restore,'' Mr. President, because we currently are not making \nthe same kind of effort to keep drugs from entering the United States \nthat we used to. Drugs are now easy to find, and easy to buy. As a \nresult, the amount of drugs sold on our streets, and the number of \npeople who use drugs, especially young people, is unprecedented.\n  The facts demonstrate this sobering trend. The August 1998 National \nHousehold Survey on Drug Abuse report by the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Administration list the following disturbing facts:\n  In 1997, 13.9 million Americans age 12-and-over cited themselves as \n``current users'' of illicit drugs--a 7% increase of 1996's figure of \n13 million Americans. That translates to nearly a million new users of \ndrugs each year.\n  From 1992-1997, the number of children aged 12-to-17 who are using \nillegal drugs has more than doubled, and has increased by 27% just from \n1996-1997 alone.\n  For kids 12-to-17, first time heroin use, which can be fatal surged \nan astounding 875% from 1991-1996. The overall number of past month \nheroin users increased 378% from 1993 to 1997.\n  We cannot in good conscience and with a straight face say that our \ndrug control strategy is working. It is not. More children are using \ndrugs. With an abundant supply, drug traffickers now are seeking to \nincrease their sales by targeting children ages 10 through 12. This is \nnothing less than an assault on the future of our children, and the \nfuture of the country itself. This is nothing less than a threat to our \nnational values, and yes, even our national security.\n  All of this begs the question: What are we doing wrong? Clearly, \nthere is no one simple answer. However, one thing is clear: our overall \ndrug strategy is imbalanced. To be effective, our national drug \nstrategy must have a strong commitment in the following three areas: \n(1) demand reduction, which consists of prevention, treatment, and \neducation programs. These are administered by all levels of \ngovernment--federal, state and local--as well as non-profit and private \norganizations; (2) domestic law enforcement, which again, has to be \nprovided by all three levels of government; and (3) international \neradication and interdiction efforts, which are the sole responsibility \nof the Federal Government.\n\n  These three components are interdependent. A strong investment in \neach of them is necessary for each to work individually and \ncollectively. For example, a strong effort to destroy or seize drugs at \nthe source or outside of the United States both reduces the amount of \ndrugs in the country, and drives up the street price. And as we all \nknow, higher prices will reduce consumption. This in turn helps our \ndomestic law enforcement and demand reduction efforts.\n  As any football fan will tell you, a winning team is one that plays \nwell at all three phases of the game--offense, defense, and special \nteams. The same is true with out anti-drug strategy--all three \ncomponents have to be effective if our strategy is going to be a \nwinning effort.\n  While I think the current administration has shown a clear commitment \nto demand reduction and domestic law enforcement programs, the same \ncannot be said for the international eradication and interdiction \ncomponents. This was not always the case.\n  In 1987, the $4.79 billion federal drug control budget was divided as \nfollows: 29% for demand reduction programs; 38% for domestic law \nenforcement; and 33% for international eradication and interdiction \nefforts. This balanced approach worked. It achieved real success. \nLimiting drug availability through interdiction drove up the street \nprice of drugs, reduced drug purity levels, and consequently reduced \noverall drug use. From 1988 to 1991, total drug use declined by 13 \npercent--cocaine use dropped by 35 percent. And there was a 25 percent \nreduction in overall drug use by adolescent Americans.\n  This balanced approach ended in 1993. By 1995, the $13.3 billion \nnational drug control budget was divided as follows: 35 percent for \ndemand reduction; 53 percent for law enforcement; and 12 percent for \ninternational and interdiction efforts. Though the overall anti-drug \nbudget increased almost threefold from 1987 to 1995, the percentage \nallocated for international eradication and interdiction efforts \ndecreased dramatically. This distribution only recently has started to \nchange, but the imbalance is still there. In the President's proposed \n$17 billion drug control budget for 1999, 34 percent would be allocated \nfor demand reduction; 52% for law enforcement; and 14% for \ninternational and interdiction efforts.\n  Those are the numbers, but what really matters are what these numbers \nget you in terms of resources. The hard truth is that our drug \ninterdiction presence--the ship, air and man power dedicated to keeping \ndrugs from reaching our country--has eroded dramatically. Here are just \na few examples:\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\n  The Department of Defense funding for counter-narcotics decreased \nfrom $504.6 million in 1992 to $214.7 million in 1995, a 57% decrease \nin only three years. As a result, flight hours by Airborne Warning and \nControl Systems--known as AWACs planes--dropped from 38,100 hours in \n1992 to 17,713 hours by 1996, a 54% reduction.\n  At the beginning of the decade, the U.S. Customs service operated its \ncounter-narcotics activities around the clock. This made sense because \ndrug trafficking truly is a 7 day/24 hour enterprise. Today, the \nCustoms Service does not have the resources needed to maintain around-\nthe-clock operations. At a recent hearing on our original legislation, \na representative of the U.S. Customs Service testified that the Customs \nservice has 84 boats in the Caribbean conducting drug apprehension \nefforts--down from 200 vessels in 1990. The Customs Service estimates \nthat they expect to have only half of the current fleet of 84 vessels \nby the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, these are shocking statistics. And perhaps more than \nthe budget numbers themselves, these statistics demonstrate the \nimbalance in our overall strategy. I have witnessed the lack of our \nresources and commitment in the region fisthand. This past year I \ntraveled to the Caribbean several times to see our counter-narcotics \noperations there. I met with the dedicated people on the frontlines of \nour drug interdiction efforts. I witnessed our strategy in action, and \nsat down with the experts--both military and civilian--who are charged \nwith carrying out the monitoring, detection and interdiction of drugs.\n  On one of my recent trips I saw that in particular, Haiti has become \nan attractive rest-stop on the cocaine highway. It is strategically \nlocated about halfway between the source country--Colombia--and the \nUnited States. As the poorest country in the hemisphere, it is \nextremely vulnerable to the kind of bribery and corruption that the \ndrug trade needs in order to flourish.\n  Not surprisingly, the level of drugs moving through Haiti has \ndramatically increased. A U.S. government interagency assessment on \ncocaine movement found that the total amount of cocaine coming to the \nUnited States through Haiti jumped from 5 percent in 1996 to 19 percent \nby the end of 1997.\n  In response, we initiated a US law enforcement operation called \nOperation Frontier Lance, which utilized Coast Guard \nCutters, speedboats, and helicopters to detect and capture drug dealers \non a 24 hour per day basis. This operation was modeled after another \nsuccessful interdiction effort that was first done off the coast of \nPuerto Rico, called Operation Frontier Shield.\n\n  Both these operations were done at two different time periods. \nOperation Frontier Shield utilized nearly two dozen ships and aircraft; \nand Operation Frontier Lance utilized more than a dozen ships and \nhelicopters. To make Frontier Lance work required that we borrow a few \nships and helicopters from operations elsewhere in the Caribbean. \nBecause of our scare resources, we had to rob Peter to help Paul.\n  These operations produced amazing results. The six month operation in \nPuerto Rico resulted in the seizure of more than 32,900 pounds of \ncocaine and 120 arrests. The three month operation in Haiti and the \nDominican Republic resulted in 2,990 pounds of cocaine seized and 22 \narrests.\n  These operations demonstrate we can make a big difference if we \nprovide the right levels of material and manpower to fight drug \ntrafficking. One would think that these operations would serve as a \nmodel for the entire region. Instead of maintaining these operations, \nwe ended them. This potential roadblock on the cocaine highway is no \nmore.\n  Now, in Puerto Rico we only have a combined total of 6 air and sea \nassets doing maintenance operations.\n  In Haiti and the Dominican Republic, we have only 1 ship and 1 \nhelicopter devoted for the drug operation. Keep in mind that since \nrefugees remain a major problem in this area, these very few vessels \nare not dedicated solely to drug interdiction. Amazingly, no sooner \nthan we build an effective wall against drug traffickers, we tear it \ndown.\n  While in the region, I was surprised to learn that in the Eastern \nPacific, off the coast of Mexico and Central America, the coast is \nliterally clear for the drug lords to do their business. This is, \nwithout any doubt, unacceptable.\n  Again, we have no presence there because we lack the resources. An \ninterdiction plan does exist for the region, which would involve the \ndeployment of several ships and planes in the region. This operation, \nunfortunately, was canceled before it even got started because the \nresources were needed elsewhere. To date, the coastal waters in the \nEastern Pacific remain an open sea expressway for drug business.\n  Mr. President, through my visits to the region, I have seen firsthand \nthe dramatic decline in our eradication and interdiction capability. \nThe results of this decline have been a decline in cocaine seizures, a \ndecline in the price of cocaine, and an increase in drug use. This has \nto stop. It is a clear and imminent danger to the very heart of our \nsociety.\n\n  That is why the legislation I am introducing today is timely. We need \nto dedicate more resources for international efforts to help reverse \nthis trend. Now I want to make it very clear that I strongly support \nour continued commitment in demand reduction and law enforcement \nprograms! In the end, I believe that reducing demand is the only real \nway to permanently end illegal drug use. However, this will not happen \novernight. That is why we need a comprehensive counter drug strategy \nthat addresses all components of this problem.\n  There's another fundamental reason why the federal government must do \nmore to stop drugs either at the source or in transit to the United \nStates. If we don't, no one else will. Let me remind our colleagues \nthat our anti-drug efforts here at home are done in cooperation with \nstate and local governments and scores of non-profit and private \norganizations. However, only the federal government has the \nresponsibility to keep drugs from crossing our borders.\n  It's not just an issue of responsibility--it's an issue of \nleadership. The United States has to demonstrate leadership on an \ninternational level if we expect to get the full cooperation of source \ncountries, such as Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, as well as countries in \nthe transit zone, including Mexico and the Caribbean island \ngovernments. There's little incentive for these countries to invest \ntheir limited resources, and risk the lives of their law enforcement \nofficers to stop drug trafficking, unless we provide the leadership and \nresources necessary to make a serious dent in the drug trade.\n  Our bill is designed to provide the resources and demonstrate to our \nfriends in the Caribbean, and in Central and South America that we \nintend to lead once again. With this legislation, we can once again \nmake it difficult for drug lords to bring drugs to our nation, and make \ndrugs far more costly to buy. It's clear drug trafficking imposes a \nheavy toll on law abiding citizens and communities across our country. \nIt's time we make it a dangerous and costly business for drug \ntraffickers themselves. A renewed investment in international and \ninterdiction programs will make a huge difference--both in the flow and \ncost of illegal drugs. It worked before and we believe it can work \nagain.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the beginning, my colleagues and I are \nreintroducing this legislation. Since we introduced our original bill \nin July, we have received a number of suggestions on ways to improve \nthe legislation, including several provided in conversations I \npersonally had with General Barry McCaffery, the Director of the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy--otherwise known as the Drug Czar's \noffice. Some of these suggestions were incorporated in the House bill \nfirst introduced by Congressmen Bill McCollum of Florida and Dennis \nHastert of Illinois. The House passed the McCollum/Hastert bill with \noverwhelmingly bi-partisan support. The final vote was 384 to 39! \nClearly, the overwhelming, bipartisan show of support for the Western \nHemisphere Drug Elimination Act is a wake up call for leadership--it's \ntime the United States once again lead the way in a comprehensive and \nbalanced strategy to reduce drug use. And the time for leadership is \nnow.\n\n  Since House passage of the bill, I have reached out once again to \nGeneral McCaffrey, and to my friends on the Democrat side of the aisle, \non how we\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\ncan work together to pass this legislation before we adjourn. I made it \nclear to General McCaffrey of my commitment to work with him and the \nAdministration to strengthen our drug interdiction efforts, and our \noverall anti-drug strategy. Again, I received several suggestions to \nimprove the bill from the General, but the Administration has shown no \ninterest in getting this bill passed this year.\n  The resources we would provide in our legislation should be of no \nsurprise to General McCaffrey or anyone involved in our drug control \npolicies. The vast majority of the items in this bill are the very \nitems which the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Coast Guard and \nCustoms Service have been requesting for quite some time now. Many of \nthese items are detailed, practically item per item and dollar amount, \nin a United States Interdiction Coordinator report, known as USIC, \nwhich was requested by the General.\n  The bill we introduce today represents a good faith effort by the \nsponsors of this legislation to get something done this year. It \nincludes almost all the changes made in the House-passed bill, and \nincorporates virtually every suggestion made to me by General \nMcCaffrey. Of central concern to the General, as he expressed in his \nrecent testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was the \nneed for greater flexibility. The bill we introduce today provides \nflexibility for the agencies to determine and acquire the assets best \nneeded for their respective drug interdiction missions. It also \nprovides more flexibility for the Administration in providing needed \nresources to Latin American countries.\n  Mr. President, thanks to the suggestions we have received, the bill \nwe are introducing today is a better bill. It has far more bipartisan \nsupport than the first version. Again, the growing support for this \nlegislation is not surprising. This is not a partisan issue--we need to \ndo more to fight drugs outside our borders.\n\n  Let's be frank--in this anti-drug effort--Congress is the anti-drug \nfunder, but the agencies represented here--the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, Customs, Coast Guard, State and Defense Departments, \nand the Drug Czar's office--they are the anti-drug fighters. The \ndedicated men and women at these agencies are working to keep drugs out \nof the hands of our kids, and all we're trying to do is to give them \nthe additional resources they have requested to make that work result \nin a real reduction in drug use. This bill is just the first step in \nour efforts to work with the agencies represented here. I expect to do \nmore in the future.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that while this bill \nis an authorization measure, I have already started the process to \nrequest the money needed for this bill over three years. Even though we \nintroduced the bill for the first time in late July, we have already \nsecured $143 million through the Senate passed FY 1999 appropriation \nmeasures. Senators Coverdell, Graham of Florida, Grassley, Bond, \nFaircloth, and myself requested these funds through the various \nappropriation measures.\n  The cosponsors of this bill also are requesting the assistance of \nSenators Stevens and Byrd--the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSenate Appropriations committee--in obtaining funding as part of any \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill we may consider before we \nadjourn. Given that it will take some time to dedicate some of our \nlarger assets, such as boats, airplanes, and helicopters, we need to \nstart our investment as soon as possible. I understand a similar effort \nis underway in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that even as we finally are beginning to \nbalance our budget, we still have to exercise fiscal responsibility. I \nbelieve effective drug interdiction is not only good social policy, it \nis sound fiscal policy as well. It is important to note that seizing or \ndestroying a ton of cocaine in source or transit areas is more cost-\neffective than trying to seize the same quantity of drugs at the point \nof sale. But more important, are the short and long term costs if we do \nnot act to reverse the tragic rise in drug use by our children.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that there are more than twice the number \nof children aged 12 to 17 using drugs today than there were five years \nago. With more kids using drugs, we have more of the problems \nassociated with youth drug use--violence, criminal activity and \ndelinquency. We will have more of the same unless we take action now to \nrestore a balanced drug control strategy. We have to have all the \ncomponents of our drug strategy working effectively again.\n  We did it before and we succeeded.\n  If we pass the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Bill we can take \nthe first step toward success. We can provide the resources, and most \nimportantly, the leadership to reduce drugs at the source or in \ntransit.\n  In the end, Mr. President, that's what this bill is about--it's about \nleadership--effective leadership. We have an opportunity with this \nlegislation to show and exercise leadership. I hope we can seize this \nopportunity to stop drug trafficking, and more important, to save \nlives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Teenage drug use in the United States has doubled since \n     1993.\n       (2) The drug crisis facing the United States is a top \n     national security threat.\n       (3) The spread of illicit drugs through United States \n     borders cannot be halted without an effective drug \n     interdiction strategy.\n       (4) Effective drug interdiction efforts have been shown to \n     limit the availability of illicit\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\n     narcotics, drive up the street price, support demand \n     reduction efforts, and decrease overall drug trafficking and \n     use.\n       (5) A prerequisite for reducing youth drug use is \n     increasing the price of drugs. To increase price \n     substantially, at least 60 percent of drugs must be \n     interdicted.\n       (6) In 1987, the national drug control budget maintained a \n     significant balance between demand and supply reduction \n     efforts, illustrated as follows:\n       (A) 29 percent of the total drug control budget \n     expenditures for demand reduction programs.\n       (B) 38 percent of the total drug control budget \n     expenditures for domestic law enforcement.\n       (C) 33 percent of the total drug control budget \n     expenditures for international drug interdiction efforts.\n       (7) In the late 1980's and early 1990's, counternarcotic \n     efforts were successful, specifically in protecting the \n     borders of the United States from penetration by illegal \n     narcotics through increased seizures by the United States \n     Coast Guard and other agencies, including a 302 percent \n     increase in pounds of cocaine seized between 1987 and 1991.\n       (8) Limiting the availability of narcotics to drug \n     traffickers in the United States had a promising effect as \n     illustrated by the decline of illicit drug use between 1988 \n     and 1991, through a--\n       (A) 13 percent reduction in total drug use;\n       (B) 35 percent drop in cocaine use; and\n       (C) 16 percent decrease in marijuana use.\n       (9) In 1993, drug interdiction efforts in the transit zones \n     were reduced due to an imbalance in the national drug control \n     strategy. This trend has continued through 1995 as shown by \n     the following figures:\n       (A) 35 percent for demand reduction programs.\n       (B) 53 percent for domestic law enforcement.\n       (C) 12 percent for international drug interdiction efforts.\n       (10) Supply reduction efforts became a lower priority for \n     the Administration and the seizures by the United States \n     Coast Guard and other agencies decreased as shown by a 68 \n     percent decrease in the pounds of cocaine seized between 1991 \n     and 1996.\n       (11) Reductions in funding for comprehensive interdiction \n     operations like OPERATION GATEWAY and OPERATION STEELWEB, \n     initiatives that encompassed all areas of interdiction and \n     attempted to disrupt the operating methods of drug smugglers \n     along the entire United States border, have created \n     unprotected United States border areas which smugglers \n     exploit to move their product into the United States.\n       (12) The result of this new imbalance in the national drug \n     control strategy caused the drug situation in the United \n     States to become a crisis with serious consequences \n     including--\n       (A) doubling of drug-abuse-related arrests for minors \n     between 1992 and 1996;\n       (B) 70 percent increase in overall drug use among children \n     aged 12 to 17;\n       (C) 80 percent increase in drug use for graduating seniors \n     since 1992;\n       (D) a sharp drop in the price of 1 pure gram of heroin from \n     $1,647 in 1992 to $966 in February 1996; and\n       (E) a reduction in the street price of 1 gram of cocaine \n     from $123 to $104 between 1993 and 1994.\n       (13) The percentage change in drug use since 1992, among \n     graduating high school students who used drugs in the past 12 \n     months, has substantially increased--marijuana use is up 80 \n     percent, cocaine use is up 80 percent, and heroin use is up \n     100 percent.\n       (14) The Department of Defense has been called upon to \n     support counter-drug efforts of Federal law enforcement \n     agencies that are carried out in source countries and through \n     transit zone interdiction, but in recent years Department of \n     Defense assets critical to those counter-drug activities have \n     been consistently diverted to missions that the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     consider a higher priority.\n       (15) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, through the Department of Defense policy \n     referred to as the Global Military Force Policy, has \n     established the priorities for the allocation of military \n     assets in the following order: (1) war; (2) military \n     operations other than war that might involve contact with \n     hostile forces (such as peacekeeping operations and \n     noncombatant evacuations); (3) exercises and training; and \n     (4) operational tasking other than those involving \n     hostilities (including counter-drug activities and \n     humanitarian assistance).\n       (16) Use of Department of Defense assets is critical to the \n     success of efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs from \n     source countries and through transit zones to the United \n     States.\n       (17) The placement of counter-drug activities in the fourth \n     and last priority of the Global Military Force Policy list of \n     priorities for the allocation of military assets has resulted \n     in a serious deficiency in assets vital to the success of \n     source country and transit zone efforts to stop the flow of \n     illegal drugs into the United States.\n       (18) At present the United States faces few, if any, \n     threats from abroad greater than the threat posed to the \n     Nation's youth by illegal and dangerous drugs.\n       (19) The conduct of counter-drug activities has the \n     potential for contact with hostile forces.\n       (20) The Department of Defense counter-drug activities \n     mission should be near the top, not among the last, of the \n     priorities for the allocation of Department of Defense assets \n     after the first priority for those assets for the war-\n     fighting mission of the Department of Defense.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States to--\n       (1) reduce the supply of drugs and drug use through an \n     enhanced drug interdiction effort in the major drug transit \n     countries, as well support a comprehensive supply country \n     eradication and crop substitution program, because a \n     commitment of increased resources in international drug \n     interdiction efforts will create a balanced national drug \n     control strategy among demand reduction, law enforcement, and \n     international drug interdiction efforts; and\n       (2) develop and establish comprehensive drug interdiction \n     and drug eradication strategies, and dedicate the required \n     resources, to achieve the goal of reducing the flow of \n     illegal drugs into the United States by 80 percent by as \n     early as December 31, 2001.\n         TITLE I--ENHANCED SOURCE AND TRANSIT COUNTRY COVERAGE\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle in reintroducing the Western \nHemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998. This legislation authorizes a \n$3 billion, three year initiative to enhance international drug \neradication, interdiction and crop substitution efforts.\n  The other body has already adopted a companion version of this bill \nin a 384-39 vote. That level of support reflects, I believe, a growing \nrecognition by members of Congress that our current approach to the \ndrug war is not working. While treatment and education and other demand \nreduction activities are vital to an overall drug strategy,\n\n[[Page S11050]]\n\nyou do not win a war by only treating the wounded. A balanced strategy \nis essential and we have in recent years neglected the interdiction and \ninternational components of our counterdrug efforts.\n  The result has been a flood of drugs into our streets and schools and \nneighborhoods and disturbing increases in drug use.\n  On August 21, 1998, the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, \nconducted by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Administration, was \nreleased. That report indicates that in 1997, 13.9 million Americans \n12-and-over cited themselves as ``current users'' of illicit drugs--a 7 \npercent increase from 1996. Current illicit drug use among our nation's \nyouth continues to increase at an alarming rate. From 1992-1997, youth \naged 12-to-17 using illegal drugs has more than doubled (120 percent)--\nwith a 27 percent increase from 1996-1997 alone.\n  On September 1, 1998, the Back to School 1998: CASA Teen Survey, \nconducted by the National Center on Addiction & Substance Abuse at \nColumbia University, was released. A majority (51 percent) of high \nschool students say the drug problem is getting worse. For the fourth \nstraight year, both middle and high school students say that drugs are \ntheir biggest concern. More than three-quarters of high school teens \nreport that drugs are used, sold and kept at their schools--an increase \nfrom 72 percent in 1996 to 78 percent in 1998.\n  This newly drafted version of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination \nAct reflects testimony heard at the joint hearing of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics \nControl held on September 15. General Barry McCaffrey, Director of the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy, as well as officials from the \nDepartments of State and Defense, the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nthe U.S. Customs Service and the United States Coast Guard testified. \nThe committees also heard from experts of the General Accounting Office \nand the Institute for Defense Analysis.\n  General McCaffrey in particular asked for greater flexibility in the \nprovisions of the bill and we have granted that request. Our \nlegislation still authorizes new aircraft, cutters, and ``go-fast'' \nboats for the Coast Guard and Customs Service. But we give these \nagencies the flexibility to prioritize from a menu of option and \ndetermine for themselves which are the greatest needs.\n  The bill supports increased eradication and interdiction efforts in \nBolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico, as well as assistance for \nalternative crop development support in the Andean region. But again, \nwe have tailored its provisions to give the State Department needed \nflexibility in determining priorities and adjusting to changing \nconditions.\n  The bill also provides for development of international law \nenforcement training and improvements in drug transit and source zone \nlaw enforcement operations and equipment.\n  Mr. President, the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998 is \na bipartisan effort to restore a balanced drug strategy. I urge all \nSenators to support it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nas original co-sponsor of the revised Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act of 1998. This bill reflects a balanced approach in \ncurbing the flow of narcotics over our borders; to stop the drugs \nbefore they arrive in the United States.\n  Illegal drug use by our children and youth is taking an enormous toll \non families and communities all over the country. A study released by \nthe National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cocaine and marijuana \nuse among high school seniors has increased 80% since 1992. Even more \nalarming is that heroin use among twelfth graders doubled.\n  The effects of drugs are astounding. It is estimated that drug-\nrelated illness, death and crime cost the United States approximately \n$67 billion a year. That is $1,000 for every man, woman and child in \nAmerica. The resources we spend to combat drugs could have been used \nfor so many other valuable social and economic development programs. \nThat is why, after decades of trying to combat the scourge of drugs, we \nmust finally put a stop to it.\n  New York State is no stranger to the plight created by illegal drugs. \nLast year, almost 40% of the heroin seized at our international borders \nwas seized in the New York metropolitan area. This disproportionate \namount of drugs destined for New York communities underscores my \nintention to do what is necessary to end the flow of drugs into our \ncountry.\n  An effective counter-narcotics control strategy should be balanced \nand coordinated--including interdiction, prevention and law \nenforcement. But a disturbing trend has emerged. Since 1987, the \npercentage of the national drug control budget earmarked for \ninterdiction and international efforts has decreased from 33% to just \n12%. That is a trend we intend to reverse with this bill.\n  This is an opportunity to make a commitment to substantially reducing \ndrug availability in the United States. In this spirit, the sponsors of \nthis bill have consulted with the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy to improve on certain aspects of this legislation. But one thing \nwon't change. This bill will provide the necessary resources, $2.6 \nbillion over three years, to increase our interdiction efforts. We can \nall agree on one thing--we have to stop the drugs before they reach our \ncommunities. And it's important to mention that the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly approved a similar bill.\n  The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998 reaches that goal \nby providing a comprehensive eradication, interdiction and crop \nsubstitution strategy. This initiative will make supply reduction a \npriority again--guaranteeing valuable equipment for our law enforcement \nincluding speed boats at least as fast as those belonging to the drug \nlords. Our radars and early warning aircraft will be improved so that \nthey will detect the small and elusive drug planes that smuggle tons of \nnarcotics destined for out streets. This initiative will restore \nbalance to the drug control strategy and make significant inroads \ntowards keeping drugs from reaching our neighborhoods, and more \nimportantly, our children.\n  This initiative recognizes that drug availability can be decreased by \noperating against every level of the drug process--from the growing \nfields to the clandestine laboratories to the trafficking. By \ncontinuing to work with reputable law enforcement in narcotic source \nand transit countries, we may be able to eradicate drugs at their \norigin.\n  The importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated. \nEveryday, our men and women of law enforcement, at the federal, state \nand local levels, make great sacrifices as they face the heavy burden \nof fighting the drug war. They protect the citizens of this country and \nwe should respond by providing them with all the tools they need to get \nthe job done. These people have committed themselves to eliminating \nillegal drugs from our streets. Now we must demonstrate to them that we \nwill support them in their struggle--a struggle they carry on to \nprotect us.\n  I commend the sponsors of this bill for working toward an agreement \non this bill and I urge my colleagues to support its enactment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2341, the \nWestern Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, introduced by Senator DeWine, \nmyself and twenty-nine of our distinguished colleagues.\n  Research shows that increased Federal, State and local efforts are \nneeded to enforce the already existing laws, as well as to pass pro-\nactive legislation to deal with ever changing trends in substance \nabuse. Unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that over the past \ndecade the changing trends indicate that drug use has increased, \nparticularly among young people. My colleagues and I believe that the \ngrowth in drug use has some connection to the decline in resources \ndedicated to drug interdiction efforts outside our borders over this \nperiod. While previous budgets have appropriately devoted resources to \ndemand and domestic law enforcement programs, evidence also shows that \nthere must be a returned focus on interdiction and eradication \nprograms. I have continued to support a continued federal commitment to \ndemand reduction and law enforcement\n\n[[Page S11051]]\n\nprograms since ultimately these activities drive the drug trade in the \nUnited States. However, we can not reverse the disturbing increases in \ndrug use unless we also dedicate more funds to drug interdiction and \nrestore a more balanced drug control strategy.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this $2.6 billion over 3 years \ninitiative to enhance international eradication, interdiction and crop \nsubstitution efforts targets the threat to the United States caused by \ndrug lords. Furthermore, by addressing the very highlights of the bill \nand appropriating the necessary monies, drug lords and drug traffickers \nwill be more clearly targeted. While this bill is very detailed, let me \nmention a few of the highlights:\n  It would improve our aircraft, maritime and radar coverage of both \ndrug-source and drug-transit countries;\n  It would enhance drug-eradication and interdiction efforts in source \ncountries;\n  It would enhance the development of alternative crops in drug-source \ncountries; It would support international law enforcement training;\n  It would enhance law enforcement interdiction operations.\n  Mr. President, all too often, the drug smugglers have the upper hand \nwith state-of-the-art boats and aircraft. I might add the United States \nspecifically lacks adequate surface assets and is using aircraft with \n1990 technology. I believe that this bill will help turn the tide in \nthe war on drugs by equipping the Coast Guard, Customs, DEA, DOD and \nother law enforcement agencies with the latest in proven technology.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to take note of the fact that an \nidentical bill H.R.4300 has already been passed in the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 384-39. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and make it far more \ndifficult for drug lords to bring drugs to our nation. I believe that \nincreasing funds for eradication and interdiction efforts will make a \ndifference.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2524. A bill to cofidy without substantive change laws related to \nPatriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations and \nto improve the United States Code; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          U.S. CODE REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce today a bill to amend \ntitle 36 of the U.S. Code, to codify certain laws related to patriotic \nand national organizations that were enacted after the cut-off date for \nthe title 36 codification recently enacted by Public Law 105-225. The \nbill makes technical corrections in title 36 and repeals obsolete and \nunnecessary provisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Such \n     forms shall also be accepted in electronic form by agencies \n     as provided by section 208.\n\n     SEC. 208. IMPLEMENTATION BY AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Implementation.--Consistent with the Privacy Act of \n     1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and after consultation with the Attorney \n     General, and subject to applicable laws and regulations \n     pertaining to the Department of the Treasury concerning \n     Federal payments and collections and the National Archives \n     and Records Administration concerning the proper maintenance \n     and preservation of agency records, Federal agencies shall, \n     not later than 18 months after the enactment of this title, \n     establish and implement policies and procedures under which \n     they will use and authorize the use of electronic \n     technologies in the transmittal of forms, applications, and \n     similar documents or records, and where appropriate, for the \n     creation and transmission of such documents or records and \n     their storage for their required retention period.\n       (b) Establishment of a Timeline for Implementation.--Within \n     18 months after the date of enactment of this title, Federal \n     agencies shall establish timelines for the implementation of \n     the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) General Accounting Office Report.--The Comptroller \n     General shall report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives \n     Committee on Commerce 21 months after the date of enactment \n     of this title on the proposed implementation policies and \n     timelines described in subsections (a) and (b).\n       (d) Implementation Deadline.--Except where an agency makes \n     a written finding that electronic filing of a form is either \n     technically infeasible, economically unreasonable, or may \n     compromise national security, all Federal forms must be made \n     available for electronic submission within 60 months after \n     the date of enactment of this title.\n\n     SEC. 209. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       Because there is no meaningful difference between contracts \n     executed in the electronic world and contracts executed in \n     the analog world, it is the sense of the Congress that such \n     contracts should be treated similarly under Federal law. It \n     is further the sense of the Congress that such contracts \n     should be treated similarly under State law.\n\n     SEC. 210.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Year 2000 Information and \n     Readiness Disclosure Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1)(A) At least thousands but possibly millions of \n     information technology computer systems, software programs, \n     and semiconductors are not capable of recognizing certain \n     dates in 1999 and after December 31, 1999, and will read \n     dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates \n     represent the year 1900 or thereafter or will fail to process \n     those dates.\n       (B) The problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting \n     failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the \n     functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, \n     utilities, government, and safety and defense systems, in the \n     United States and throughout the world.\n       (C) Reprogramming or replacing affected systems before the \n     problem incapacitates essential systems is a matter of \n     national and global interest.\n       (2) The prompt, candid, and thorough disclosure and \n     exchange of information related to year 2000 readiness of \n     entities, products, and services--\n       (A) would greatly enhance the ability of public and private \n     entities to improve their year 2000 readiness; and\n       (B) is therefore a matter of national importance and a \n     vital factor in minimizing any potential year 2000 related \n     disruption to the Nation's economic well-being and security.\n       (3) Concern about the potential for legal liability \n     associated with the disclosure and exchange of year 2000 \n     readiness information is impeding the disclosure and exchange \n     of such information.\n       (4) The capability to freely disseminate and exchange \n     information relating to year 2000 readiness, solutions, test \n     practices and test results, with the public and other \n     entities without undue concern about litigation is critical \n     to the ability of public and private entities to address year \n     2000 needs in a timely manner.\n       (5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal \n     standards in connection with the disclosure and exchange of \n     year 2000 readiness information that will promote disclosures \n     and exchanges of such information in a timely fashion.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in article \n     I, section 8, clause 3 of the\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\n     Constitution of the United States, the purposes of this Act \n     are--\n       (1) to promote the free disclosure and exchange of \n     information related to year 2000 readiness;\n       (2) to assist consumers, small businesses, and local \n     governments in effectively and rapidly responding to year \n     2000 problems; and\n       (3) to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by \n     establishing certain uniform legal principles in connection \n     with the disclosure and exchange of information related to \n     year 2000 readiness.\n\n      SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Antitrust laws.--The term ``antitrust laws''--\n       (A) has the meaning given to it in subsection (a) of the \n     first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12(a)), except \n     that such term includes section 5 of the Federal Trade \n     Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent such section 5 \n     applies to unfair methods of competition;

PROTECTION FOR YEAR 2000 STATEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Evidence Exclusion.--No year 2000 readiness disclosure, \n     in whole or in part, shall be admissible against the maker of \n     that disclosure to prove the accuracy or truth of any year \n     2000 statement set forth in that disclosure, in any covered \n     action brought by another party except that--\n       (1) a year 2000 readiness disclosure may be admissible to \n     serve as the basis for a claim for anticipatory breach, or \n     repudiation of a contract, or a similar claim against the \n     maker, to the extent provided by applicable law; and\n       (2) the court in any covered action shall have discretion \n     to limit application of this subsection in any case in which \n     the court determines that the maker's use of the year 2000 \n     readiness disclosure amounts to bad faith or fraud, or is \n     otherwise beyond what is reasonable to achieve the purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (b) False, Misleading and Inaccurate Year 2000 \n     Statements.--Except as provided in subsection (c), in any \n     covered action, to the extent that such action is based on an \n     allegedly false, inaccurate, or misleading year 2000 \n     statement, the maker of that year 2000 statement shall not be \n     liable under Federal or State law with respect to that year \n     2000 statement unless the claimant establishes, in addition \n     to all other requisite elements of the applicable action, by \n     clear and convincing evidence, that--\n       (1) the year 2000 statement was material;

or\n       (iii) if the contract or warranty specifically provides for \n     its amendment or alteration through the making of a year 2000 \n     statement.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     affect applicable Federal or State law in effect as of the \n     date of enactment of this Act with respect to determining the \n     extent to which a year 2000 statement affects a contract or \n     warranty.\n       (f) Special Data Gathering.--\n       (1) In general.--A Federal entity, agency, or authority may \n     expressly designate a request for the voluntary provision of \n     information relating to year 2000 processing, including year \n     2000 statements, as a special year 2000 data gathering \n     request made pursuant to this subsection.\n       (2) Specifics.--A special year 2000 data gathering request \n     made under this subsection shall specify a Federal entity, \n     agency, or authority, or, with its consent, another public or \n     private entity, agency, or authority, to gather responses to \n     the request.\n       (3) Protections.--Except with the express consent or \n     permission of the provider of information described in \n     paragraph (1), any year 2000 statements or other such other \n     information provided by a party in response to a special year \n     2000 data gathering request made under this subsection--\n       (A) shall be exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4) \n     of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, commonly known \n     as the ``Freedom of Information Act'';\n       (B) shall not be disclosed to any third party;

Mr. President, on Sunday, September 20th, I \ntraveled to Sparta, TN, to deliver remarks at the dedication of a \nmemorial honoring the brave Americans from White County, Tennessee who \nwere prisoners of war or missing in action during World War II. I ask \nthat my remarks be printed in the Record.\n\n Dedication of a World War II Memorial Honoring the POW/MIAS of White \n                           County, Tennessee\n\n       It is an honor and a special privilege for me to \n     participate in the dedication of this memorial to the World \n     War II POWs and MIAs of White County. To each and every one \n     of them--those who died, and those we are blessed to still \n     have with us--we owe an unending debt of love, respect, and \n     gratitude for the sacrifice they made, the pain they \n     suffered, and the trauma they endured to ensure that the \n     flame of freedom would never be extinguished.\n       Their wounds, and the wounds of their families, are ones \n     that do not close easily with the passage of time. Rather, \n     they abide as long as even one missing American remains \n     unaccounted for. And so, we must not only remember, but re-\n     dedicate ourselves to the accounting of every last American \n     serviceman from Korea, and Viet Nam and, yes, even World War \n     II, for America can never move forward by leaving even one \n     missing son behind.\n       Many of you here today were their comrades-in-arms--in \n     Italy and France; in Germany and Japan. You fought the same \n     battles. You flew the same missions. You sacrificed for the \n     same noble cause. All of you were different. You came from \n     different states and different backgrounds, but you shared \n     one thing in common: you loved America; you were willing to \n     die for freedom.\n       And so, to you also, we offer our love, our thanks, and our \n     promise that we will never forget not only those who died and \n     those who returned, but those who fate is still unknown.\n       And we promise to remember something more: We promise to \n     remember that peace is a fragile thing; that strength is the \n     only way to avoid war; and that freedom is always just one \n     generation away from extinction.\n       If we remember those things, no future American generation \n     will be required, as you were, to place themselves in harm's \n     way to secure for their posterity the benefits and blessings \n     of freedom.\n       Before I close, I'd like to mention one last thing, and \n     that's my thanks to the American Legion who has stood \n     steadfast and determined in the fight to account for every \n     American from every war who is still a prisoner or missing in \n     action.\n       I thank them for that, and all the other sponsors of \n     today's ceremony. May this marker we dedicate today, forever \n     guard the memory of those who are gone; salute the courage of \n     those who returned, and stand like a beacon of hope for every \n     American whose homecoming we still await.\n       God bless you, and God bless the United States of \n     America.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11056-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11057]]\n         THE MAMMOGRAPHY QUALITY STANDARDS REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nSenate passage of the Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act \n(MQSA). It is timely and appropriate that the Senate took action on \nthis important legislation in time for Breast Cancer Awareness Month in \nOctober and on the eve of the march against cancer right here in \nWashington. The bill that the Senate passed reauthorizes the original \nlegislation which passed in 1992 with bipartisan support.\n  What MQSA does is require that all facilities that provide mammograms \nmeet key safety and quality-assurance standards in the area of \npersonnel, equipment, and operating procedures. Before the law passed, \ntests were misread, women were misdiagnosed, and people died as a \nresult of sloppy work. Since 1992, MQSA has been successful in raising \nthe quality of mammography services that women receive.\n  What are these national, uniform quality standards for mammography? \nWell, facilities are required to use equipment designed specifically \nfor mammography. Only radiological technologists can perform \nmammography. Only qualified doctors can interpret the results of \nmammography. Facilities must establish a quality assurance and control \nprogram to ensure reliability, clarity and accurate interpretation of \nmammograms. Facilities must be inspected annually by qualified \ninspectors. Finally, facilities must be accredited by an accrediting \nbody approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  This current reauthorization makes some improvements to the current \nlaw. It ensures that women will receive direct written notification of \ntheir mammogram results. MQSA already requires written notification of \nmammography results to self-referred women. Now this provision will \napply to all women. Women won't assume that ``no news is good news'' \nwhen this isn't always the case. They will know what their results are, \nso that they can get any follow up care they need. The Agency for \nHealth Care Policy Research has cited studies that show that direct \ncommunication with patients, which is in addition to written \ncommunication to health care providers, dramatically increases \ncompliance with follow up recommendations. Women are entitled to know \nthe results of their exams. This new provision will ensure that women \nare informed and active participants in their health care decisions.\n  This legislation also allows the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to establish a demonstration program for less than annual \ninspections for facilities that have excellent track records. This \nprogram will not be implemented before April 1, 2001, which is almost \ntwo years after the final regulations implementing MQSA go into effect. \nThe facilities that participate in this program will continue to be \ninspected to ensure that they continue to comply with MQSA standards. A \nstrong inspection program under MQSA is extremely important to assure \nthe public that quality standards are being met. In a 1997 GAO report \nwhich evaluated the MQSA inspection program, GAO praised the program. I \nam very interested in the results of this demonstration. This \ndemonstration program will provide us with an important opportunity to \nsee if less than annual inspections are just as effective in making \nhigh-quality facilities comply with MQSA. It should allow the FDA to \nfocus more of its attention on ensuring compliance with MQSA standards \nby facilities where problems have been identified in the past. The best \nway to protect the public health is for the FDA to focus its resources \non the problem facilities.\n  This bill also contains a few minor changes to the law to ensure \nthat: patients and referring physicians be advised of any mammography \nfacility deficiency; women are guaranteed the right to obtain an \noriginal of their mammogram; physicians who review facility images on \nbehalf of accreditation bodies are highly qualified and subject to high \nethical standards; and both state and local government agencies are \npermitted to have inspection authority.\n  I like MQSA because it has saved lives. The front line against breast \ncancer is mammography. We know that early detection saves lives. But a \nmammogram is worse than useless if it produces a poor-quality image or \nis misinterpreted. The first rule of all medical treatment is: Above \nall things, do no harm. And a bad mammogram can do real harm by leading \na woman and her doctor to believe that nothing is wrong when something \nis. The result can be unnecessary suffering or even a death that could \nhave been prevented. That is why this legislation is so important. And \nthat is why I am so pleased that this law is being reauthorized, so \nthat we don't go back to the old days when women's lives were in \njeopardy.\n  I want to make sure that women's health needs are met \ncomprehensively. It is expected that 178,700 new cases of breast cancer \nwill be diagnosed and about 43,900 women will die from the disease in \n1998. This makes breast cancer the most common cancer among women. And \nonly lung cancer causes more deaths in women.\n  We must aggressively pursue prevention in our war on breast cancer. I \npledge to fight for new attitudes and to find new ways to end the \nneedless pain and death that too many American women face. This bill is \nan important step in that direction.\n  As the 105th Congress comes to a close, we can look back on some \ngreat bipartisan victories and other great bipartisan frustrations. But \none area Republicans and Democrats have always worked together on is \nwomen's health. I am proud of this bill's broad bipartisan support. I \nwant to take this opportunity to thank all 56 cosponsors of my MQSA \nbill here in the Senate for their support. I also want to recognize \nCongresswoman Nancy Johnson and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton as the \noriginal sponsors of the House MQSA bill. I applaud the Democrats and \nRepublicans of the House Commerce Committee, especially Congressmen \nBliley, Dingell, Bilirakis, and Brown for their leadership on MQSA. A \nspecial thanks also goes to Senator Jeffords for working with me to \nmake reauthorization of MQSA a reality. As Dean of the Democratic \nWomen, I want to also thank the Dean of the Republican Women, Kay \nBailey Hutchinson, for always reaching out to work together on the \nissues that matter most to American women and their families. MQSA is a \nshining example of what the U.S. Congress can accomplish when both \nRepublicans and Democrats work together for the good of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11057-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11057-S11058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MR. OKTOBERFEST\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while I was the mayor of Tulsa, we \nstarted an Oktoberfest to benefit the ``River Parks'' which is an area \naround the Arkansas River for jogging, cycling or walking. Tulsa \nOktoberfest is known as one of the best in world and a large reason for \nthat is due to Josef Peter Hardt, whom I dubbed ``Mr. Oktoberfest.''\n  Born in Oberhausen (Rhineland) Germany, Josef emigrated to Ithaca, \nNew York in 1951 and moved to Tulsa in 1955. His professional career \nwas in broadcasting, retiring as the manager of commercial productions \nof Channel 2 in 1993. His civic career consisted of work in the Theater \nTulsa, television and film production, one founders of Tulsa's \nOktoberfest, an active member of the German American Society Arts \nAssociation and German American Society Building Corporation in Tulsa.\n  Because of his active involvement in the German American Society, he \nwas awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Distinguished Service Cross) by \nthe Counsel General for the Federal Republic of Germany, on the tenth \nanniversary of the German American Society of Tulsa. During that \noccasion, the Honorable Peter Maier-Oswald noted that ``Joe Hardt has \nalways worked for his old country and his new country to promote \nrelations between the two.''\n  Our first Oktoberfest consisted of a small tent on the banks of the \nArkansas River in 1979 and now draws over 200,000 people over a four \nday period. Since the beginning, Josef, has held various jobs but \nperhaps the one for which he will be remembered most is that of MC. As \nthis is the last year of his active involvement in Tulsa's Oktoberfest, \nI wanted to take this opportunity to commemorate his leadership and \nfaithful service to his community.\n\n[[Page S11058]]\n\nWe will miss seeing and hearing him as the MC, but he will always be \nMr. Oktoberfest in my book.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11057-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH R. HAROLD\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nspecial individual, one whom the people of Massachusetts are proud to \ncall one of our own.\n  On Sunday, September 27th, 1998, elected officials, friends, family \nand the communities of Quincy and Dorchester will join to recognize the \ncontributions of Mr. Joseph Harold by celebrating the designation of \nthe Joseph R. Harold, Sr. MBTA Old Colony Rail Bridge. This important \nstructure will bridge these two communities in much the same way Joseph \nHarold did in his life.\n  Service to community and nation can define one's life, and such is \nthe case with Mr. Harold. After graduating from Boston English High \nSchool, he served in the U.S. Infantry under General George Patton. His \nservice with that historic leader earned him a Bronze Star for bravery \nin an assault on the Siegfried Line, a Battlefield Commission to Second \nLieutenant, and three Battle Stars.\n  His commitment to those that served in the military would remain \nthroughout his life, demonstrated by his 43 year service as the State \nAdjutant for the Disabled American Veterans. For those decades, Mr. \nHarold was a principled advocate for any man or woman who had served, \nlogging thousands of hours on behalf of countless individuals. The \ndepth of his conviction will allow his impact on national veterans \nissues to reach far into the future.\n  Mr. Harold's death in 1994 was an unfortunate loss for the state of \nMassachusetts, but his career of advocacy and compassion serves as an \ninspiration to all citizens. This is demonstrated by the fund \nestablished in his honor at the Quincy Historical Society in June of \n1997. This fund will collect, preserve and display military items of \nhistorical significance for the city, and that is a fitting tribute to \na man who did so much for the communities he loved.\n  I am proud to join with his sons, former State Senator Paul Harold \nand William Harold, his seven grandchildren, and the communities of \nDorchester and Quincy in honoring Joseph Harold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11058-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO SUMMIT DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one \nof Montana's newest and brightest stars. Summit Design and \nManufacturing, a Montana-based company located in Helena, Montana, \nrecently took a giant leap on the stepping stones of success.\n  It is both an honor and a great pleasure to announce that Summit \nDesign and Manufacturing was recently awarded the ``Outstanding Team \nPlayer Award'' by Lockheed Martin for work they have performed on the \nF-22 fighter aircraft. This award is given to only 5 Lockheed Martin \nsuppliers selected from a pool of around 4,500 suppliers program wide. \nEven more impressive is that Summit's selection is the first time this \ntype of supplier has received such an award.\n  Since their start-up in June 1997, Summit has grown from four \nemployees to 15 and now boasts deliveries for the F-22 program at \napproximately $2 million is sales for the past 12 months. In less than \na year, this company has become one of Montana's technological \nadvantages over the rest of the nation.\n  Besides performing design and manufacturing work on the F-22 in \nMontana, other involvement with Lockheed Martin has included producing \nparts and tools for the X-33 Spacecraft, Joint Strike Fighter and the \nC-130J aircraft programs.\n  I often say that folks in Montana are very special people and I \ncommend Tom Hottman and Summit Design and Manufacturing for their \nperseverance and commitment in today's small business society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11058-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to clarify my \nposition on the minimum wage vote that took place last week. In 1996, I \nvoted to increase the minimum wage by a total of 90 cents. I did this \nwith the understanding that the minimum wage has not been increased \nsince 1989. As many are aware, the last increment of the 1996 increase \nwent into effect on September 1, 1997. Senator Kennedy is now proposing \nto increase the minimum wage by another dollar one year after the last \nincrease took effect. Mr. President, I believe this is simply too soon \nbecause the current U.S. economic situation is unstable. Given the wild \nfluctuations in financial markets, continued economic stagnation in \nAsia, and job losses in our manufacturing sector, imposing additional \ncosts on the private sector--particularly the small business sector--is \nvery risky at this time.\n  I also have concerns about the effect that increasing the minimum \nwage has on low-skilled workers. Studies that examine the effect of the \n1996 wage increase only heighten my concern. For instance, a recent \nreview of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics concludes that the \nOctober 1, 1996, 50-cent minimum wage hike led to 128,000 lost jobs \namong teen workers and up to 380,000 lost jobs overall. According to a \nstudy done by the Employment Policies Institute, the employment rate of \nteenagers declined by 0.14 percent after the increase. The decline in \nemployment for black teenage males was even worse--1.0 percent.\n  Minimum wage jobs provide workers with valuable on-the-job training. \nA full 60 percent of today's workforce cites a minimum wage job as \ntheir first work experience. As we begin to move people from welfare to \nwork, it will become increasingly important that they have positions \navailable to them to gain this experience. Mr. President, I do not \nbelieve that this is the time to put the availability of low-skilled \njobs at risk.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this amendment was offered to the Consumer \nBankruptcy Reform Act. I believe this legislation contained important \nreforms that needed to be passed this year. The Consumer Bankruptcy \nReform Act of 1998 received bipartisan support and passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee by a 16-2 vote. I was concerned that adding this \namendment would stop the underlying bill from passing this Congress.\n  For all of the above mentioned reason, I chose to vote to table the \nminimum wage increase amendment at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11058-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11058-S11059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CINDY GEORGER\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an outstanding \nindividual from the State of Idaho who is deserving of not only our \npraise, but our wholehearted respect. In the turmoil of daily life, it \nis easy to get so caught up in our own affairs that we forget those \nless fortunate around us. Cindy Georger is not one of those people. She \nhas unselfishly dedicated her time and energy to one of the most \nimportant battles raging in our nation today--the fight against \nilliteracy. Although this struggle continues even during our high-tech \nentry into the 21st Century, small battles are being won every day by \npeople like Cindy.\n  Mrs. Georger, a Boise resident, has volunteered at ``Learning Lab, \nInc.'' since 1994. This is a non-profit organization providing literacy \nprograms in three sectors: Adult Basic Skills, English as a Second \nLanguage, and Family Literacy. She has assisted with children ages 3 to \n5 who have at least one functionally illiterate parent.\n  In volunteering with these children, Mrs. Georger is serving two \nequally important purposes. She is both tutoring children--undoubtedly \none of the noblest of causes--and inspiring the parents of those \nchildren. By helping the parents, she is not only promoting literacy, \nbut also family values, by encouraging them to take the time to sit \ndown and read with their children. What a gift to give to a child--what \na gift to give to a family.\n  In a nation facing an unparalleled struggle to maintain family \nvalues, and plagued with reports of the American family as increasingly \napathetic, it is easy to get disheartened, but through people like \nCindy Georger it is possible to look to the future with hope--hope for \na time when people care about others, when family returns to the top of \neveryone's agenda, and when every American knows how to read.\n  I would like to thank Cindy Georger for her time, dedication, and \nefforts to\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\npromote and teach literacy. Her services, and the services of \nvolunteers like Cindy throughout Idaho and the nation, are the \ninstruments through which the battle of illiteracy can and will be \nwon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/28/senate-section/article/S11058-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support Montreal Protocol \nNo. 4, which will simplify the rules for cargo and baggage liability in \ninternational air traffic. It is important for the Senate to act now, \nbecause Protocol No. 4 has already entered into force. Consequently, \nU.S. carriers and cargo companies are unable to take advantage of these \nsimplified rules, at a significant economic cost. U.S. industry \nestimates that Protocol No. 4 will save them $1 billion annually.\n  The treaty has been pending in the Senate for over 20 years. It \nfailed to gain support not because it is controversial, but because it \nhas been the victim of misfortune--having been paired, in its \nsubmission to the Senate, with Montreal Protocol No. 3, a treaty \nplacing unreasonably low limits on personal liability in international \nair traffic. I oppose Protocol No. 3, because I believe strongly that \nlimits on personal liability contained in the treaty are an \nanachronism. Such limits may have been warranted when the underlying \nWarsaw Convention was drafted in 1929, a time when the airline industry \nwas in its infancy. Now, however, when international air carriers are \nlarge corporations with significant financial resources--and thus fully \ncapable of purchasing adequate insurance--there is no justification for \nsuch limits.\n  For the past two decades, the aviation industry and the Executive \nBranch unsuccessfully sought ratification of Protocol No. 3 and No. 4. \nOnly once did the Protocols reach the full Senate floor. In 1983, the \nSenate voted 50-42 to approve them, far short of the two-thirds \nnecessary for advice and consent to ratification.\n  Recognizing that Protocol No. 3 cannot be approved by the Senate, the \nindustry and the Executive have effectively abandoned the effort, and \nhave requested the Senate to proceed with consideration of Protocol No. \n4. The resolution of ratification of Protocol No. 4 will bring a formal \nend to the misguided effort to approve No. 3: the resolution directs \nthe Secretary of the Senate to return Protocol No. 3 to the President.\n  More importantly, the industry, acting through its association, the \nInternational Air Transport Association, has taken steps to waive these \npersonal liability limits. Consequently, most of the leading air \ncarriers have agreed in their contracts with passengers to waive all \npersonal liability limits, and agreed to strict liability up to 100,000 \nSpecial Drawing Rights, or about $130,000.\n  These are positive developments, and I commend the airlines for \ntaking these steps. Although not all carriers have waived the liability \nlimits, all of the major U.S. carriers have, as have many of the \nleading foreign carriers which fly to the United States. I urge the \nDepartment of Transportation to make every effort to ensure that all \ncarriers involved in international air traffic which fly within or to \nor from\n\n[[Page S11060]]\n\nthe United States do so as soon as possible.\n  I hope that these measures, which are based on contract, not on any \ndomestic law or international treaty, will eventually be codified in a \nnew international instrument--an instrument that would firmly establish \ninternational norms and provide certainty for carriers and passengers \nalike. Negotiations toward that end are ongoing under the auspices of \nthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n  One sticking point in these negotiations has been the question of a \n``fifth jurisdiction.'' Under the current Warsaw Convention, a suit may \nbe brought in any one of four places: the place of incorporation of the \ncarrier, the carrier's principal place of business, the place where the \nticket was sold, and the place of the ultimate destination of the \npassenger. Notably missing from this list is the place where the \npassenger lives, or, in legal terms, his ``domicile.'' As a practical \nmatter, most Americans will be able to sue in U.S. court under the \nexisting four jurisdictions; but there will be cases in which a \npassenger buys a ticket overseas on a foreign carrier--which would \nprobably preclude that passenger from bringing a suit in a U.S. court.\n  The Clinton Administration is pressing for inclusion of the fifth \njurisdiction in any new international instrument. I commend the \nAdministration for taking this position. Including a fifth jurisdiction \nshould be considered an essential element of any new international \nagreement on passenger liability.\n  At this point, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues \nand the Executive Branch to a speech delivered earlier this year by Lee \nKreindler regarding these negotiations. Mr. Kreindler, an aviation \nattorney with over four decades of experience, has provided a helpful \nguide to the current legal situation in this area and to the ICAO \nnegotiations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Montreal Protocol No. 4 is a useful step in \nmodernizing the rules of cargo and baggage in international air \ntraffic. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Clouds on the Liability Horizon and What We Can Do About Them\n\n                         (By Lee S. Kreindler)\n\n       I am honored to appear on this symposium, the second \n     straight year in which I have been on your program. After \n     all, as a plaintiff's laywer, I have spent much of the last \n     forty five years bringing legal actions against IATA's \n     members, the international airlines. More important than \n     that, perhaps, I have spent most of that time being highly \n     critical of IATA's role in promoting the Warsaw Convention \n     and its progeny, and in defending and preserving a limit of \n     liability that to me, and all of my clients, has been \n     abhorrent.\n       Now I find myself applauding your monumental efforts, and, \n     particularly the monumental efforts of your distinguished \n     general counsel, Lorne Clark, to put an end to limits of \n     liability in personal injury and death cases. I find that, \n     after all these years, we are in synchronization, pulling \n     together to create a system that will protect the interests \n     of your member carriers' customers, the flying public, and \n     their families, and at the same time preserve the interests \n     of your airline members. To me this is an uplifting and \n     energizing experience.\n       I want IATA's efforts to establish a fair and enforceable \n     system of liability in international air law, as well as my \n     own efforts, to succeed. I have nothing but praise for IATA's \n     courage in leading its member airlines to waive the liability \n     limits of the Warsaw Convention. The IATA Agreement was long \n     and hard in coming, but it was a remarkable achievement given \n     the political and economic realities of the world. You \n     deserve enormous credit for bringing it about. I say that, as \n     your long time adversary, without condition or qualification. \n     You have done a wonderful job, for which the flying public \n     owes you thanks.\n       I think it would be a great mistake, however, to revel in \n     the glory of accomplishment, and ignore problems and threats \n     which could very well bring this brave new dream crashing \n     down. And so my concern now, as a friend, is that the new \n     system, because of its inherent weaknesses, may fail. Indeed, \n     I see clouds on the horizon, and I want to address them with \n     you while there is still time to deal with them, so that, \n     together, we can build a strong and lasting structure that \n     can and will withstand the storms that are sure to come.\n\n   Problems With the IATA-ATA Agreements and the Resulting System--A \n                      Foundation Based on Contract\n\n       The basic law in international airline liability is still \n     provided by the Warsaw Convention, which was effectively \n     modified in 1966, with respect to transportation involving \n     the United States, to increase the passenger injury and death \n     limitation to $75,000. Onto this convention there have now \n     been engrafted three agreements, the IATA Intercarrier \n     Agreement (IIA), the Agreement on Measures to Implement the \n     IATA Intercarrier Agreement (MIA), and the ATA Intercarrier \n     Agreement, also known as Provisions Implementing the IATA \n     Intercarrier Agreement (IPA), applicable, at least, to those \n     carriers which have signed the agreements.\n       Each of the three agreements, IIA, MIA, and IPA is a \n     private contractual agreement sponsored by either IATA or ATA \n     and signed by individual airlines. Some of these agreements, \n     by some of the signatory airlines, have been incorporated in \n     tariffs, which have been filed with the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation. This does not, however, turn them into \n     ``law.'' They are still private contracts which, by virtue of \n     the tariffs, are incorporated in the airline's conditions \n     of contract.\n       In the first of these agreements, IIA, the signatory \n     airlines agreed to ``take action'' to waive the limitation of \n     liability on recoverable compensatory damages, which, since \n     the Montreal Agreement of 1966 has effectively been $75,000 \n     per passenger on a substantial part of international airline \n     travel, including all transportation involving the United \n     States.\n       In the MIA the signatory carriers agree to implement the \n     IIA by incorporating various provisions in their contracts of \n     carriage and tariffs where necessary. Under the most \n     important provision the carrier agrees that it will not \n     invoke the limitation of liability in Article 22 (1) of the \n     Convention as to any claim of recoverable compensatory \n     damages under Article 17. In order words, each carrier waives \n     the Warsaw limit.\n       The second provision each carrier agrees to in MIA is to \n     not avail itself of any defense under Article 20 (1) of the \n     Convention with respect to claims up to 100,000 SDRs. Article \n     20 (1), sometimes called the exculpatory clause, provides \n     that the carrier can exculpate itself from liability \n     completely if it can show it took all necessary measures to \n     avoid the damage. Thus, in agreeing to waive this defense up \n     to 100,000 SDRs each carrier has subjected itself to absolute \n     or strict liability up to that amount. In not making this \n     waiver above 100,000 SDRs the carrier has accepted the burden \n     of proving the taking of all necessary measures. Proving that \n     is a virtual impossibility in all cases except terrorist \n     cases, other situations entirely caused by a third party, and \n     possibly clear air turbulence cases.\n       Thus while this provision may not have substantial \n     practical significance the principle of the carrier having \n     the burden of proof regarding its absence of fault has become \n     a precedent which may affect the formulation of a new \n     convention or protocol.\n\n        Rights of Recourse, Including Indemnity and Contribution\n\n       The MIA goes on to provide that the signatory airline \n     ``reserves all defenses available under the Convention to any \n     such claim.'' And it adds that ``With respect to third \n     parties, the carrier also reserves all rights of recourse . . \n     . including rights of contribution and indemnity.''\n       It may be well and good for the signatory airlines to \n     reserve all rights of recourse against a manufacturer, for \n     example, in a contract between itself and other airline, but \n     there is real doubt that this can have any legal and binding \n     effect without the consent of such third party and possibly \n     without the consent of the passenger himself. The fact that \n     this reservation of rights is a creature of private contract, \n     rather than law or legal judgments, is, in my opinion, a \n     fatal flaw in the system in terms of legal enforceability.\n       An impleaded third party, such as a manufacturer, or its \n     insurer, will be free to claim that the airline, or its \n     insurer, which made a payment pursuant to IIA, was a \n     ``volunteer'', and was a collateral source whose payment may \n     not be created to damages owed the passenger or his estate by \n     the manufacturer.\n       It is my understanding that George Tompkins and Lorne Clark \n     have requested the manufacturers to provide a statement of \n     policy that they will not assert a ``volunteer'' defense in \n     the event that an airline settles a claim in excess of the \n     applicable limit of liability in any suit for contribution or \n     indemnity, and it is my further understanding that the \n     request is being favorably considered.\n       However, in my opinion, the problem can't definitively be \n     cured by consent of the third party defendant. Under this \n     system the airline can offer to pay unlimited damages, and it \n     may try to insist that a passenger or passenger's family \n     execute a general release, releasing third parties, but the \n     passenger does not have to accept that. The passenger can sue \n     the airline under the IIA and MIA, as a third party \n     beneficiary, and can maintain a wholly independent action \n     against a negligent manufacturer or air traffic control \n     facility. In other words there is the theoretical \n     possibility here of double recoveries. The passenger can \n     recover on his case against the airline, which is based on \n     the IIA and MIA contracts and then take the position, on \n     his case against the manufacturer, or other third party, \n     that the airline was collateral source for which the \n     manufacturer may not get a credit. For the recourse \n     provisions of\n\n[[Page S11061]]\n\n     IIA, MIA, and IPA to be meaningful the payment of damages \n     by the airline would have to be the result of law and not \n     private contract.\n       This problem of recourse runs through all three of these \n     agreements, and, in my opinion, can be solved only by a new \n     convention or protocol, establishing a legal basis for the \n     payment of unlimited damages by an airline.\n       That is not the only problem presented by IIA agreements.\n\n                Domicile, ``Subject To Applicable Law''\n\n       IIA states as an objective ``that recoverable compensatory \n     damages may be determined and awarded by reference to the law \n     of the domicile of the passenger.''\n       When one examines the MIA, however, it provides that at the \n     option of the carrier it may include a provision in its \n     conditions of carriage and tariffs that, ``subject to \n     applicable law'', recoverable compensatory damages . . . may \n     be determined by reference to the law of the domicile or \n     permanent residence of the passenger.''\n       In the IPA there is no option provision. It simply states \n     that ``subject to applicable law, recoverable compensatory \n     damages * * * may be determined by reference to the law of \n     the domicile or permanent residence of the passenger.''\n       Thus the intent of the drafters, as shown by the language \n     of the three agreements, would appear to have been to apply \n     the law of the passenger's domicile or permanent residence. \n     In actual fact, however, there was no such uniform agreement \n     to apply the law of domicile, and the language can best be \n     explained by the political, or negotiating constraints if any \n     agreement at all was to be achieved.\n       Briefly stated, the United States carriers, with the \n     prodding of the U.S. Department of Transportation, insisted \n     on language applying the law of domicile. To European \n     carriers, however, their law did not apply law of domicile. \n     Generally there courts would apply the law of the place of \n     the accident or the law of the forum. Thus in the face of the \n     language in IIA, pointing to law of domicile, they insisted \n     on language making it clear that would only be at the option \n     of the airline.\n       The U.S. carriers, on the other hand, all signed the IPA, \n     and thereby accepted law of the passenger's domicile on cases \n     against them.\n       The agreements may not do that, however, because the \n     language, ``subject to applicable law'' may dictate some \n     other law!\n       Let's assume, for example, a case brought under the IPA in \n     which the deceased passenger was domiciled in Pennsylvania, \n     which has relatively liberal death damages law. Let's say the \n     airplane crashed into the high seas. When the case is brought \n     in the United States will the Death on the High Seas Act be \n     applied, or the law of Pennsylvania?\n       In the first instance the decision will be up to the \n     airline, or, more likely, the airline's insurer. Let's \n     suppose the airline, faithful to the text of the IIA \n     agreements, makes an offer under Pennsylvania law standards. \n     But let's assume the passenger, or the lawyer for the estate \n     of the passenger, rejects the offer as being insufficient. \n     The matter would then go to court. In court the passenger (or \n     the estate's) lawyer, asserts that the law of Pennsylvania \n     will govern damages, pointing to the IIA Agreements.\n       What position does the airline take in court? And what \n     position will the court take? After all the Death on the High \n     Seas Act is a United States statute.\n       As for the carrier, one might hope it would feel morally \n     bound to accept the law of the domicile of the passenger, but \n     history suggests that economics will determine its position, \n     or, more precisely, its insurer's position.\n       Let's take a similar case under the IPA, where the airplane \n     has crashed over land, as in the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie \n     bombing. Let's assume the action is started in Florida, as, \n     indeed, a significant number of Lockerbie cases were. In \n     those Lockerbie cases the court, stating that it was applying \n     Florida choice of law rules, applied the law of the place of \n     the accident, Scotland.\n       What will the situation be under the Intercarrier \n     Agreements including the IPA? Will the carrier, and the \n     court, enforce the law of the passenger's domicile, or will \n     they apply the law of the place of accident?\n       Again, history suggests that the parties are likely to be \n     motivated by economics.\n       In short, the words, ``subject to applicable law'' are \n     likely to introduce conflict and uncertainty in many cases \n     brought under the IPA. I would respectfully suggest that \n     those words be removed from the IPA Agreement, and that it \n     simply provide that the law of the passenger's domicile will \n     be applied.\n\n                          Successive Carriage\n\n       Another problem arises by virtue of Article 30 (1) and (2) \n     of the Warsaw Convention which deal with the liability of \n     successive carriers. Article 30 (2) states: ``(2) . . . the \n     passenger or his representative can take action only against \n     the carrier who performed the transportation during which the \n     accident or delay occurred. . . .''\n       It may turn out, of course, that all carriers sign and \n     adhere to the Intercarrier Agreement, and they will, \n     therefore, all be subject to it. But, given the nature of the \n     world, it is probable that some, or even many, will not sign \n     on. If the second, or third, successive carrier is the one on \n     which the accident happens, it may choose not to waive the \n     limit, despite the claim by the plaintiff that the successive \n     carrier is bound by the original contract of carriage. Then \n     where are we?\n       I understand that carriers now signing the IIA Agreements \n     are limiting their waivers of the limit to accidents \n     occurring on their own part of the carriage, so passengers \n     may still be subject to the limit in other cases.\n       But the injured passenger, or his family if he has been \n     killed, will, nevertheless, argue that the carrier which \n     issued the ticket must be liable for damages without \n     limitation, and that he or his estate is an authorized third \n     party beneficiary. An action will be brought against that \n     carrier for unlimited damages. The Warsaw Convention, which \n     was supposed to have simplified liability rules will be the \n     very cause of the dispute in these cases.\n       If, indeed, waivers of the limit do not apply to successive \n     carriers, then the IATA agreements will be something of a \n     cruel hoax in successive carriage situations and may well \n     inspire intense adverse passenger group reactions.\n\n                          The 5th Jurisdiction\n\n       Article 28 of the Warsaw Convention permits suit to be \n     brought in any one of four places; the place of incorporation \n     of the carrier, its principal place of business, the place \n     where the contract of carriage was made (i.e. where the \n     ticket was sold), and, finally, the place of ultimate \n     destination of the passenger. Notably absent is the place of \n     the passenger's domicile. In most cases the place of the \n     passenger's domicile will coincide with one of the places \n     suit can be brought anyway, so there is no problem. But \n     there are occasional cases where an American, for example, \n     will buy a ticket while on a trip, away from home. \n     American damages standards are considerably higher than \n     those of other countries, generally, and in that rare case \n     the American passenger, or his family, will be denied the \n     higher American standards.\n       It is generally recognized that the place of domicile is \n     the place which has the greatest interest in the question of \n     damages, and the denial of domicile law is very troubling to \n     parties and governments alike.\n       The United States Government, and particularly the \n     Department of Transportation and Department of State, have \n     taken the position that any new regime of law, in \n     international airline transportation, must provide for suits \n     in ``the 5th Jurisdiction'', i.e., the place of the \n     passenger's domicile. Non American carriers have resisted the \n     proposal, for reasons that baffle me. It seems to me that \n     from the airline's standpoint the point is not worth fighting \n     about, if the carriers can get an otherwise favorable system. \n     There are simply not enough such cases to provide a real \n     stumbling block.\n       The IATA intercarrier agreements do not and cannot solve \n     the problem, and they cannot because of the Warsaw \n     Convention's proscription against changing jurisdictional \n     rules (See Article 32). The United States has gone along with \n     the intercarrier agreements because of the predominant \n     interest in getting the airlines to abandon the limits, \n     notwithstanding their failure to adopt the 5th jurisdiction, \n     but the point remains one of contention for any new \n     convention or protocol.\n\n                           Fault or No Fault?\n\n       Finally, important lawyers in the United States DOT seem to \n     be locked into an anti-fault mode of thinking on any new \n     system, whether it be based on the intercarrier agreements or \n     a new convention or protocol. This probably goes back to \n     attitudes developed in 1966 at the time of the Montreal \n     Agreement, when State Department lawyers obtained from the \n     airlines and IATA an agreement to accept absolute liability \n     up to a limit of $75,000 as a tradeoff for perpetuation of \n     the Warsaw Convention and its limited liability regime. The \n     DOT has viewed absolute, no-fault, liability as being in the \n     passenger interest. Most passenger groups, however, as well \n     as lawyer groups which customarily represent passengers, view \n     the fault system as a fundamental necessity which is \n     critically important from the safety perspective for the \n     protection of passengers as well as society in general. They \n     point to numerous contributions to airline safety made by \n     tort cases and their examination into both negligence and \n     accident causation.\n       The contribution of the tort system to aviation safety is \n     well recognized, also, by aviation insurers and their \n     lawyers. Sean Gates, a London solicitor and senior partner of \n     Beaumont and Son, one of the leading firms representing \n     aviation underwriters, has expressed himself as strongly \n     opposed to absolute liability for international airlines, \n     both because he is opposed to abandonment of the fault \n     system, and because he doesn't see why airlines alone in our \n     society should be held to be guarantors of safety. Anthony \n     Mednuik, one of the world's leading underwriters, and \n     presently Managing Director of the British Aviation Insurance \n     Group, has similarly expressed himself as strongly opposed to \n     abandoning the fault system. He did so most recently at a \n     large meeting in Amelia Island, Florida, in October, of the \n     Aircraft Builders Council, which consists of both aviation \n     manufacturers and underwriters, and again at an aviation \n     insurance and law symposium in London in November, sponsored \n     by Lloyds of London Press. And George N. Tompkins, Jr. one of \n     the top airline defense lawyers in the United States has \n     recommended the following language to the ICAO Secretariat \n     Study Group, of which he is a member: ``No limit of liability \n     on the recoverable damages mentioned in A above if the \n     passenger/claimant proves negligence or\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\n     fault on the part of the carrier. This would not impose an \n     undue burden on the passenger/claimant and would serve to \n     preserve the ``Warsaw Convention'' as a fault based system.''\n       This difference of opinion on the fault system is not a \n     factor affecting the intercarrier agreements since they are \n     already in place and they have been based on strict liability \n     up to 100,000 SDRs and presumptive liability above that \n     amount if the carrier fails to show its complete absence of \n     fault, but it will be a significant factor in the effort to \n     achieve a new convention or protocol.\n       Thus we have a situation where the IATA agreements, however \n     noble their purpose and laudable their execution, provide an \n     insufficient basis for a satisfactory future regime in \n     international air law, and where there is considerable doubt \n     that, on a political level, the problems and differences of \n     fault/no fault, limitations of venue, rights of recourse, and \n     successive carriage, can be overcome, so as to create a \n     reasonable new convention or protocol. The prospect exists \n     that there will be no satisfactory new convention or \n     protocol, and that the intercarrier agreements will fail to \n     provide a workable system. It is uncertain where such an \n     outcome would lead, but one virtual certainty would be \n     complete abandonment of the Warsaw Convention, and the \n     airlines would not be happy about that.\n       So, where do we go from here?\n\n                       The Need to Work Together\n\n       Everyone involved, from IATA and airlines, to the United \n     States Government and other governments, to passengers' \n     groups and plaintiffs' lawyers, has something to lose from a \n     failure to come up with a satisfactory new liability regime. \n     The obvious answer to the problem is the formulation of a new \n     and widely acceptable convention or protocol which will have \n     the force of law to handle not only airline liability, but \n     rights of recourse, successive carriage, choice of law and \n     adequate venue.\n\n                       The Need for Ratifiability\n\n       At the excellent Lloyds of London Press Aviation Insurance \n     and Law Symposium in November, in London, Don Horn, Associate \n     General Counsel for International Affairs of the United \n     States Department of Transportation, pointed out the truism \n     that the first requirement for any new convention (or \n     protocol) is that it must be ratifiable.\n       I respectfully suggest that that is a good place to start \n     in our consideration of the new convention or protocol. \n     Whatever we come up with must be ratifiable. It must be \n     ratifiable by the United States, and it must be approval by \n     the international airlines.\n       Excellent preparatory work has been done by the ICAO Study \n     Group and the ICAO Legal Committee. The pattern of a splendid \n     convention or protocol is now clear, and available. In \n     general it has been set forth by the Study Group. It will \n     provide for a two tier liability system, with absolute \n     liability up to the threshold number of 100,000 Special \n     Drawing Rights, and negligence liability above that. It must \n     provide for the addition of the ``fifth jurisdiction.'' In \n     other words, passenger's domicile must be added to the other \n     available venues, place of incorporation of the carrier, \n     place of its principal place of business, and place where the \n     ticket was bought.\n       For those international airlines and insurers who are \n     reluctant to accept the fifth jurisdiction I would point out \n     three things. First, there is an element of compromise \n     inherent in the United States Government acceptance of the \n     two tier concept on fault. The position of the U.S. has been \n     to favor absolute liability across the board. This is not in \n     the airline interest, and in my humble opinion, not in the \n     public interest, but that, as I understand it, has been its \n     position. Acceptance of the two tier system by the United \n     States will have another laudable effect. It will insure \n     support of the new convention or protocol in the United \n     States on the part of passengers', consumers, and lawyers' \n     groups who believe that the fault system is one of society's \n     basic protections. Were the United States to hold out for \n     absolute liability across the board, and were that part of \n     the new Convention or protocol I would expect intense \n     opposition to the new convention or protocol in the United \n     States.\n       The second point is that in terms of cost to airlines or \n     insurers the fifth jurisdiction is deminimus. There are, \n     simply, very few cases where an American domiciliary buys a \n     ticket in another country and cannot sue in the United States \n     under one of the four presently permissible jurisdictions. I \n     have been practicing aviation law for forty five years, and I \n     have probably handled as many airline cases as any other \n     lawyer in the world, and I can only remember one case \n     involving an American passenger where I was unable to sue in \n     the United States because of Article 28.\n       Finally, the overall benefit to airlines, and all others, \n     of having a viable new convention or protocol would be \n     enormous. It would be foolish to jeopardize its chances \n     because of opposition to the fifth jurisdiction.\n\n                   Burden of Proof on the Second Tier\n\n       As indicated above, the new convention proposed by the \n     Legal Committee of ICAO prescribes a two tier system of \n     liability. There is absolute liability for damage up to \n     100,000 SDRs and negligence liability above that. In an \n     exercise of indecision, however, the drafters set forth three \n     alternative provisions on who shoulders the burden of proving \n     negligence. The concept of placing the burden on the \n     defendant airline of showing its freedom from fault grows \n     from Article 20 of the Convention which provides that to \n     exculpate itself the airline must show that it took all \n     necessary measures to avoid the damage. Generally speaking, \n     however, it is the plaintiff who has the burden of proving \n     negligence.\n       The concept of providing three alternative suggestions is \n     not sound and will lead to confusion and uncertainty. \n     Obviously, it is to the plaintiff's advantage to place the \n     burden on the defendant, but I don't consider it a make or \n     break matter. Again, it is more important to get the broad \n     outlines of the convention established than to fight about \n     each of its terms.\n\n                        Convention or Protocol?\n\n       Similary, the question of whether this should be a brand \n     new convention or a protocol to the Warsaw Convention is less \n     important than the substance of the new instrument. People I \n     respect, including Lorne Clark and George Tompkins, who know \n     far more than I do about the politics of enacting a new \n     convention, tell me that it will be much easier to enact a \n     protocol, so, for that reason alone I favor it.\n       I would urge a note of caution, however. The Warsaw \n     Convention has a very bad history and reputation with many \n     people, including me and my clients. For many of them it has \n     ruined their lives. I would eliminate all extolatory language \n     praising the Warsaw Convention, such as the introductory \n     language in the ICAO Legal Committee draft, regardless \n     whether it is new convention or protocol.\n\n                     Simpler and Shorter is better\n\n       I would suggest that all references to cargo be removed. It \n     is not necessary to include it in the new instrument. In \n     fact, it may be completely resolved by the ratification of \n     Montreal Protocol 4.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 584, S. 2392.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2392) to encourage the disclosure and exchange \n     of information about computer processing problems, solutions, \n     test practices and test results, and related matters in \n     connection with the transition to the Year 2000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with \nan amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting in \nlieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Year 2000 Information and \n     Readiness Disclosure Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1)(A) At least thousands but possibly millions of \n     information technology computer systems, software programs, \n     and semiconductors are not capable of recognizing certain \n     dates in 1999 and after December 31, 1999, and will read \n     dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates \n     represent the year 1900 or thereafter or will fail to process \n     those dates.\n       (B) The problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting \n     failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the \n     functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, \n     utilities, government, and safety and defense systems, in the \n     United States and throughout the world.\n       (C) Reprogramming or replacing affected systems before the \n     problem incapacitates essential systems is a matter of \n     national and global interest.\n       (2) The prompt, candid, and thorough disclosure and \n     exchange of information related to year 2000 readiness of \n     entities, products, and services--\n       (A) would greatly enhance the ability of public and private \n     entities to improve their year 2000 readiness; and\n       (B) is therefore a matter of national importance and a \n     vital factor in minimizing any potential year 2000 related \n     disruption to the Nation's economic well-being and security.\n       (3) Concern about the potential for legal liability \n     associated with the disclosure and exchange of year 2000 \n     readiness information is impeding the disclosure and exchange \n     of such information.\n       (4) The capability to freely disseminate and exchange \n     information relating to year 2000 readiness, solutions, test \n     practices and test results, with the public and other \n     entities without undue concern about litigation is critical \n     to the ability of public and private entities to address year \n     2000 needs in a timely manner.\n       (5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal \n     standards in connection with the disclosure and exchange of \n     year 2000 readiness information that will promote disclosures \n     and exchanges of such information in a timely fashion.\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in article \n     I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United \n     States, the purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the free disclosure and exchange of \n     information related to year 2000 readiness;\n       (2) to assist consumers, small businesses, and local \n     governments in effectively and rapidly responding to year \n     2000 problems; and\n       (3) to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by \n     establishing certain uniform legal principles in connection \n     with the disclosure and exchange of information related to \n     year 2000 readiness.\n\n      SEC. 3.

and\n       (2) the court in any covered action shall have discretion \n     to limit application of this subsection in any case in which \n     the court determines that the maker's use of that disclosure \n     amounts to bad faith, or fraud, or is otherwise is beyond \n     what is reasonable to achieve the purposes of this Act.\n       (b) False, Misleading and Inaccurate Year 2000 \n     Statements.--Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), \n     in any covered action, to the extent that such action is \n     based on an allegedly false, inaccurate, or misleading year \n     2000 statement, the maker of that year 2000 statement shall \n     not be liable under Federal or State law with respect to that \n     year 2000 statement unless the claimant establishes, in \n     addition to all other requisite elements of the applicable \n     action, by clear and convincing evidence, that--\n       (1) the year 2000 statement was material; and\n       (2)(A) to the extent the year 2000 statement was not a \n     republication of a year 2000 statement originally made by a \n     third party, that the maker made the year 2000 statement--\n       (i) with actual knowledge that the year 2000 statement was \n     false, inaccurate, or misleading;\n       (ii) with intent to deceive or mislead;

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Redesignate section 8 as section 9 and insert the following \n     after section 8:\n\n     SEC. 8. YEAR 2000 COUNCIL WORKING GROUPS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Working groups.--The President's Year 2000 Council \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Council'') may \n     establish and terminate working groups composed of Federal \n     employees who will engage outside organizations in \n     discussions to address the year 2000 problems identified in \n     section 2(a)(1) to share information related to year 2000 \n     readiness, and otherwise to serve the purposes of this Act.\n       (2) List of groups.--The Council shall maintain and make \n     available to the public a printed and electronic list of the \n     working groups, the members of each working group, and a \n     point of contact, together with an address, telephone number, \n     and electronic mail address for the point of contact, for \n     each working group created under this section.\n       (3) Balance.--The Council shall seek to achieve a balance \n     of participation and representation among the working groups.\n       (4) Attendance.--The Council shall maintain and make \n     available to the public a printed and electronic list of \n     working group members who attend each meeting of a working \n     group as well as any other individuals or organizations \n     participating in each meeting.\n       (5) Meetings.--Each meeting of a working group shall be \n     announced in advance in accordance with procedures \n     established by the Council.

Mr. President, this country will face an unprecedented \nproblem on January 1, 2000, when many computer systems, in the form of \nsoftware, hardware and embedded chips, will interpret the year as 1900 \nrather than 2000, potentially resulting in extensive failures of \ncritical operations. The fix to this problem is not a technological \nchallenge, but a management challenge due to its massive nature and the \nlimited time we have to fix it. With less then 465 days until the new \nmillennium, this problem will affect every level of government, every \nsize of business, and literally every person in this great nation.\n  Although the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act does \nnot represent the silver bullet to remedy this problem, I rise today to \nvoice my support for this legislation. This bill will encourage both \npublic and private sector entities to disclose year 2000 related \ninformation, in the form of product readiness, proposed solutions and \ntesting processes, thereby increasing the ability of governments and \nbusinesses to update their own systems and avoid potentially \ncatastrophic failures.\n  Mr. President, I had a number of concerns with this legislation in \nits original form. First of all, this legislation preempts state and \nlocal liability law. Typically, neither I nor many of my colleagues \nwould support such preemption of state authority; however, this problem \nwarrants drastic action. In fact, state and local government \nassociations have expressed their support for this bill.\n  Second, this legislation reduces the standard of care required in \nproviding accurate information as currently defined in state and local \nstatutes. Due to the critical nature of this problem, I can support \nthis provision for cases where businesses are sharing information with \nthe intent to identify a common solution and prevent a potentially \ncatastrophic failure. However, in its original form, this bill would \nhave extended this protection to sellers of year 2000 remediation \nproducts and services whose statements may be motivated solely by \nfinancial interests.\n  Mr. President, to address these concerns I introduced an amendment in \nthe Judiciary Committee which failed to pass. However, I worked with \nthe Committee and other interested parties to develop language that \nachieved all the goals and intentions of my original amendment. This \nlanguage has been adopted in section 6(b), and all interested parties \nagree we have strengthened the bill. My language will mitigate against \nfalse and inaccurate year 2000 solicitations while promoting the open \nsharing of information needed to solve the year 2000 problem. Further, \nit will expressly prevent vendors which sell year 2000 remediation \nproducts from taking advantage of unknowing customers by making the \nprotections of the bill unavailable to any seller of these products who \ndoes not inform in writing any entity, including businesses, \ngovernments, and non-profit organizations, that its legal rights under \nstate law are reduced by this bill. By imposing a higher duty of care \nin these instances, failures will be prevented.\n  Since my concerns have been addressed, I support immediate passage of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill \nbe read the third time and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, the amendment to the title be agreed to, and \nthe title, as amended, be agreed to, and that any statements relating \nto the bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3669 and 3670) were agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2392), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Year 2000 Information and \n     Readiness Disclosure Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1)(A) At least thousands but possibly millions of \n     information technology computer systems, software programs, \n     and semiconductors are not capable of recognizing certain \n     dates in 1999 and after December 31, 1999, and will read \n     dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates \n     represent the year 1900 or thereafter or will fail to process \n     those dates.\n       (B) The problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting \n     failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the \n     functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, \n     utilities, government, and safety and defense systems, in the \n     United States and throughout the world.\n       (C) Reprogramming or replacing affected systems before the \n     problem incapacitates essential systems is a matter of \n     national and global interest.\n       (2) The prompt, candid, and thorough disclosure and \n     exchange of information related to year 2000 readiness of \n     entities, products, and services--\n       (A) would greatly enhance the ability of public and private \n     entities to improve their year 2000 readiness; and\n       (B) is therefore a matter of national importance and a \n     vital factor in minimizing any potential year 2000 related \n     disruption to the Nation's economic well-being and security.\n       (3) Concern about the potential for legal liability \n     associated with the disclosure and exchange of year 2000 \n     readiness information is impeding the disclosure and exchange \n     of such information.\n       (4) The capability to freely disseminate and exchange \n     information relating to year 2000 readiness, solutions, test \n     practices and test results, with the public and other \n     entities without undue concern about litigation is critical \n     to the ability of public and private entities to address year \n     2000 needs in a timely manner.\n       (5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal \n     standards in connection with the disclosure and exchange of \n     year 2000 readiness information that will promote disclosures \n     and exchanges of such information in a timely fashion.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in article \n     I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United \n     States, the purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the free disclosure and exchange of \n     information related to year 2000 readiness;\n       (2) to assist consumers, small businesses, and local \n     governments in effectively and rapidly responding to year \n     2000 problems; and\n       (3) to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by \n     establishing certain uniform legal principles in connection \n     with the disclosure and exchange of information related to \n     year 2000 readiness.\n\n      SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Antitrust laws.--The term ``antitrust laws''--\n       (A) has the meaning given to it in subsection (a) of the \n     first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12(a)), except \n     that such term includes section 5 of the Federal Trade \n     Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent such section 5 \n     applies to unfair methods of competition;
