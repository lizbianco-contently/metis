May Independence Day really be a dependence day for us and our \nfellow Americans as we express our total dependence on You. We want our \nobservance to be more than picnics, firecrackers, and parades. As we \ncelebrate the birth of our Nation, we want to reaffirm the vision for \nAmerica you planted in our Founding Fathers and Mothers, as well as the \nunique role You have given this Nation as a demonstration of democracy.\n  When we say the words, ``One Nation under God'' in the Pledge of \nAllegiance, may it be a fresh dedication to work for righteousness and \njustice in every aspect of society. We confess what contradicts our \ndeclaration of dependence on You. We reflect on our secularized society \nthat gives little thought to You. Our motto is ``In God We Trust'' and \nyet, our trust often is placed in materialism and scientific humanism. \nWe repent and ask Your forgiveness.\n  Dear God, You have answered the prayers of Your people in the crises \nof our history. Today, we pray for a spiritual awakening to spread \nacross the land. We know that only what has happened to us can happen \nthrough us. So begin the awakening here in the Senate, in each Senator \nand in all of us who work with them. In the name of our Lord and \nSaviour.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \nmorning the Senate will resume consideration of S. 949, the Tax Relief \nAct of 1997, and begin another lengthy series of rollcall votes. As \npreviously ordered, the series of stacked rollcall votes will begin on \nor in relation to the Nickles amendment, followed by the Gramm \namendment and the Kerry amendment. Following the disposition of the \naforementioned stacked votes, the Senate will proceed to a vote on a \nnumber of process amendments under the control of Senator Domenici. \nAfter those amendments have been disposed of, Senators will have the \nright to offer an amendment to the bill, with 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on the proposed amendment.\n  However, it is hoped, and I would like to emphasize, that Members \nwill refrain from offering amendments so that the Senate may complete \naction on this bill at a reasonable time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Can I simply endorse my revered chairman's judgment? We \nhave had a good debate. We have a good bill, a bipartisan bill. The \nprospects of any serious change are not large. The prospect of any \nserious attention to new proposals are not great--not today. The Senate \nis a continuing body and we will continue to discuss matters, but today \nis the time for closing out this legislation so we can go to conference \nand send a bill to the President.\n  Mr. ROTH. What is the order of business?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. After the process amendment, there may be an amendment \noffered on the Republican side. We are prepared to move ahead to get on \nthe list; would that be agreeable? Can I ask consent, after the \nsequencing, there may be an amendment on the Republican side and we \ncould have consideration?\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, we \nhave you on the list for three separate amendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just one amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is the spirit.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished Senator and to my colleague, \nSenator Moynihan, that we have a list of both Republican and Democrat \namendments. They are set in a particular order. We do intend to go from \none side to the other side.\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I just ask in terms of who appears and asks for \nrecognition, the first three pending amendments are, in fact, stacked?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The rest are just amendments that may be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment of the \nSenator from Massachusetts will follow the process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask a question of the \nSenator from Delaware. Will there be a unanimous-consent agreement \npropounded of some list of priority of these amendments so that the \nSenators will know when their amendment will be considered?\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to my distinguished friend from Arizona we could set \nsuch a list. I thought at the beginning we would move informally, but \nas time proceeds we will try to set a list.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Further reserving the right to object, we all know, as \nthe day wears on, there will be increasing pressures because of the \ndeparture as articulated by my friend from Nevada last night, so it is \nof some interest as to which priority, after the initial amendments \nthat were agreed to last night, will be considered.\n  I ask both the Democrat leader and the managers, both managers of the \nbill, if we could have some predictability associated with that.\n  I remove my objection.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, these \namendments have been around for some time, and I would think there \nwould have already been a sequence of priorities. This proposal ought \nnot to be muscling around here.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished Senator we do have a sequence of \namendments and we intend to go down the sequence of amendments from \nDemocrat to Republican.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6669-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending business is the Nickles amendment \nNo. 551, with 2 minutes equally divided for debate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Hagel, \nSenator Abraham, Senator Domenici, and others, the amendment that we \nproposed last night we have modified. We did receive some requests from \nSenators to delete the provision that dealt with corporate \ndeductibility of tax exempts. That was not a major portion of the \namendment. We did delete that.\n  I might mention I think it is a good provision. It is a provision \nthat is in the House bill, so it will be in conference.\n  Mr. President, this amendment accelerates self-employed deductibility \nfor insurance. It allows self-employed individuals to be able to deduct \na greater proportion of their health insurance needs. It increases it. \nFor example, in 1997, current law is 40 percent; it increases it to 50 \npercent. In 1999 it increases it to 60 percent. And so on.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am not in opposition, but with the 2-percent provision \nstricken, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Thurmond be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is this going \nto be a real 10 minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I can respond to that question. I was just \nfixing to say that the 10 minutes be strictly enforced. Please don't \nleave the Chamber. We just had a couple of Senators that didn't make \nthat vote because it had been beyond the normal time. When the 10 \nminutes is up we are going to turn it in.\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of the Kerry amendment No. 554 that Senator Domenici be \nrecognized to offer an amendment No. 537, to be followed by the \namendments in the following order: Biden-Gramm, Gramm, Bumpers, Craig, \nBrownback, Frist, Abraham, and Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 552\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, what is the order of business before us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Gramm of Texas \namendment No. 552.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The debate is limited to 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, from the very beginning of this tax debate \nwe have talked about a $500 tax credit per child. And the logic has \nbeen to let working families decide how to spend their money on their \nchildren. Then suddenly out of the Finance Committee on a very close \nvote has come a provision that says we are going to give you a $500 tax \ncredit but you get it only if you use it the way we determine you \nshould use it, which is to have an educational IRA. I think educational \nIRAs are wonderful, if you can afford them. But the whole purpose of \nthe $500 tax credit was to let working families decide.\n  I know the Senate is full of brilliant people, and we think we can \ndecide things for families better than they can. But that violates the \nagreement we had with the American people on this bill. We hear every \ntime an issue is debated that this violates the commitment to the \nCongress, or it violates the commitment to the President. This \nprovision violates the commitment to the American people, and all of us \ntalk about a $500 tax credit. We talk about parents choosing. Let's let \nthem choose.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute to the opposition.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  We had two goals in this legislation: To provide tax relief to the \nfamily, to provide assistance for higher education to the families, and \nthis carefully crafted compromise does exactly that.\n  I yield what time is remaining to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The problem of bringing up the amendment is there is no \nrequirement that the tax credit be used for the child. This is a per-\nchild tax credit. We think there should be at least some encouragement \nthat it be used for the child.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this provision would change American \nfamilies with children, and it will generate more wealth. It is good \nfor American families. We have been talking about it. In addition to \nthe child tax credit, there are a number of us--Republicans and \nDemocrats--talking about ways to make this tax credit a vehicle for \ngenerating wealth for the last few years. It is a good provision.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against the motion to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Texas. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 139 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 552) was rejected.\n  Mr. ROTH.

We will not proceed until there is order in \nthe Chamber.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 554\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on the Kerry of \nMassachusetts amendment No. 554.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes equally divided. The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. May we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order, please.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we just heard the Senator from Texas talk \nabout getting a child tax credit for children. Under the child tax \ncredit as it is written in the Finance Committee bill, 99 percent of \nthe children eligible in the lowest 20 percent of income will not get \nit; 86 percent of the children in the next quintile will not get it. \nThis is because, as we all know, most people in America pay their taxes \nby the payroll tax.\n  What I do in my amendment is take the Contract With America provision \nthat was supported by Senator Gramm, Senator Lott, and Senator Coats \nand apply a refundable tax credit so that we expand by 7 million the \nnumber of children who will be given a tax credit. If we really want \nthe working people of America to get this credit, it is appropriate \nthat a working family that is earning $22,000 with two parents and two \nchildren be able to get the credit. Under the current legislation, they \nwould not get the credit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Only by the Contract With America provision can we expand \nthe number of children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute in opposition. The Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge any colleagues to vote no on the \nKerry amendment. This is really an amendment to make the credit \nrefundable. Another way of saying that, this is a way for the Federal \nGovernment to spend more money. Costed out, the outlays will increase \nin this bill under this amendment by $22 billion over 5 years, by $47 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  I might mention, refundable credits are one of the most fraudulent in \ngovernment. The EITC program has exploded. It has an error rate of over \n25 percent. This is an amendment to redistribute wealth, and it denies \ntax credits for families that have incomes above $60,000. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to make a point of order against \nthe\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\namendment. It would increase outlays by $22 billion over 5 years, $47 \nbillion over 10 years and it thus violates section 302(b) of the Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is revenue neutral, and I move to \nwaive the Budget Act to accept a revenue neutral amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided on this vote.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say to my colleagues this does \nnot cost one penny additional because we change the phase-in. It is \n$100,000 plus that you extended to the people in the Finance Committee. \nI put the phaseout at $65,000 to $70,000, and we phase in the children \nby age. So there is no impact on the budget. It is revenue neutral.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order, please.\n  Mr. KERRY. And it extends it to 7 million additional children. You \ncannot say you are covering working children in America if a working \nfamily is not able to take advantage of the credits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If we can all have order, please.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am advised by the Senator from New \nMexico that the low-income family with two children under the EITC \nProgram, if they have incomes of about $14,000, receive a refundable \ntax credit of $3,680, a lot more than their total tax liability. The \nSenator from Massachusetts wants to add to that and increase outlays by \n$22 billion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is a budget point of order, \nneutrality or no neutrality. The expenditures in this amendment exceed \nthe expenditures that are allocated under the budget resolution, and \nthe Budget Act says you cannot spend more than is allocated to the \ncommittee, regardless of whether it is neutral or not.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Chamber.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The question is \non agreeing to the motion to waive the point of order. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

I do not see Senator Biden on the floor but I do see \nSenator Gramm. Do you object if I modify my amendment to include your \nBiden-Gramm amendment, so when we vote on mine we would be taking yours \nwith us?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't we put it on my amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will object. Do you object?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No, being a sweet, wonderful person, I will not object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Being that everyone in the Chamber would want it to \nhappen, he agrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 539) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 537, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am the proponent of the waiver at this \npoint, so I get 1 minute for the waiver.\n  All we have done here is taken current law, with reference to points \nof order and the processes that we have to enforce budgets, the pay-go, \nand what we put in is the 5-year caps which we did on the last 5-year \nbudget. We only did 2 years on the defense wall instead of 5. That \nexists today.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we must have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So, in order to enforce the agreement that we are \nclaiming is a balanced budget, we must adopt this amendment or it is \nunenforceable, in terms of the appropriated accounts.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, might I just take a moment to observe \nthat, with no uproar, we are about to do something rather important. In \nthis vote on budget procedures we are going to legislate a change in \nthe inflation index used to update official calculations of baseline \nspending.\n  Under section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nControl Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings), required inflation \nadjustments are made using a ``fixed-weight index'' produced by the \nCommerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Section 1559(a)(3), \nof the changes in budget enforcement procedures now before us, require \nthat in the future the adjustments should be based on the ``domestic \nproduct chain-type price index''--also produced by the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis. Given the improvements in index number theory, this \nis a perfectly appropriate change.\n  Might I also just remind my colleagues that the Department of Labor's \nBureau of Labor Statistics compiles two other indexes used by the \nGovernment--CPI-U which is used to adjust provisions of the Tax Code \nand CPI-W which is used to adjust benefits such as Social Security.\n  For the record I note that none of these indexes give the same \nestimate of inflation.\n  Here are the numbers for 1996:\n\n                              [In percent]\n\nCPI-U...............................................................3.0\nCPI-W...............................................................2.9\nFixed Weight Price Index............................................2.3\nChain Weight Price Index............................................2.1\n\n  Today's vote on budget procedures should be recalled when we return--\nas we must--to the issue of producing an accurate cost of living index \nfor the purpose of automatic indexation of\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\nGovernment programs. No one is referring to today's legislative actions \nas ``politicizing'' the calculation of budget updates. We are just \ngetting the numbers right.\n  And no one should refer to legislating a correction in automatic \nindexation formulas as a ``political'' fix.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nHatch and Gregg be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I would like the 1 minute on the Biden-\nGramm second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 1 minute has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. But we have a second-degree amendment that was added to \nthe Domenici amendment by unanimous consent. We would like it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been accepted. All time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask consent that he gets 1 minute. It is fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me take 30 seconds and allow Senator Biden to have the \nother 30 seconds. Our colleagues will remember that we set up a violent \ncrime trust fund to guarantee adequate funding for law enforcement, and \nfor our antidrug effort. That provision was set to expire and all we \nare doing in this amendment is simply extending that trust fund. This \nis a mightily important matter. I am confident no one is going to \noppose it. I simply wanted to make note of what we are doing. I yield \nthe remainder of the time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, there is nothing to add. This is simply \nextending the extent, the life of this agreement--the existence of the \ntrust fund.\n\n\n                 Vote On Amendment No. 537, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, what actually happened on that vote, \nthe Parliamentarian misunderstood and he had us vote up or down on this \namendment, and I had asked that it be a waiver of the Budget Act. In \nlight of the fact we have--how many votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ninety-eight yeas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to clear the amendment and make sure we \nhave waived the Budget Act for this amendment so it is no longer \npossible to raise a point of order against it.\n  So I move to waive the Budget Act for consideration of this amendment \nto this bill and any conference report that returns with it in.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 539, as amended.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. The next amendment is Senator Gramm's.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 566\n\n(Purpose: To guarantee a balanced Federal budget and expand tax relief \n                                options)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me remind everybody that in the \nbudget that we are enforcing here, we had $7 billion of net deficit \nreduction as compared to current policy. Ninety-seven percent of \ndeficit reduction was simply assumed. That deficit reduction and policy \nchanges has now fallen to $1 billion because we are short on spectrum.\n  Everything we are doing in balancing the budget is based on \nassumptions. The only enforcement mechanism we now have is on \ndiscretionary spending, and the first act in considering this budget \nwas waiving that discretionary spending cap in the last budget.\n  My amendment sets out the deficit reduction targets that we have \ncommitted to and enforces them with an across-the-board cut if we \nrefuse to meet them. Also, my provision says that in paying for a tax \ncut, you can pay for it by cutting entitlements, by raising other taxes \nor by lowering the discretionary spending caps. So it gives us the \noption in the future, if we ever do another tax cut, to not have to cut \nMedicare in order to pay for tax cuts, so that if we want to reduce \ndiscretionary spending and put a spending cap in place, we can do it.\n  This budget has a lot of assumptions in it. We need as strong as \npossible an enforcement. If you want strong enforcement, vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I oppose the Gramm amendment. The \namendment would radically change current budget rules by allowing \ntemporary, unspecified cuts in discretionary programs to pay for \npermanent tax cuts. That would violate the bipartisan budget agreement \nand could explode the deficit in the future.\n  This amendment also brings back the discredited Gramm-Rudman system \nof automatic across-the-board cuts, the system that led to a \nproliferation of gimmicks and rosy scenarios, and we didn't \nsignificantly reduce the deficit until we got rid of it.\n  Madam President, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on \nus. I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings didn't work \nbefore, and it won't work the next time. The Senator from Texas would \nlike to put back into effect Gramm-Rudman-Hollings automatic sequesters \nif you miss your targets. As a Senator, I personally don't believe you \nought to offset appropriated accounts, to cut them to put in permanent \ntax cuts. I think that deserves far more consideration than 30 seconds \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment is extraneous and violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the clerk will \nfirst report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 566.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 568.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       ``(f) Budgetary Treatment of Sales of Certain Federal \n     Lands.--The amounts realized from the sale or lease of lands \n     or interests in lands which are part of the National Park \n     System, the Forest Service System or the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife refuge system shall not be scored with respect to \n     the level of budget authority, outlays, or revenues.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, this amendment will prohibit the \nscoring of the sale of any lands from a national park or a national \nwildlife refuge or Forest Service lands.\n  To my colleagues, I want to say, I have witnessed over the past 10 \nyears an irresistible urge on the part of some of my colleagues to \ndispose of some of the national treasures of this country, even \nsuggesting a commission to determine which lands, which national parks, \nwe can do without and sell.\n  This amendment is designed to do two things. No. 1, it is designed to \ndiscourage that by making it impossible to score the proceeds from a \nsale of national parks, Forest Service lands, or wildlife refuges in a \nreconciliation bill; and, No. 2, I want to say that I think it is a \nterrible practice. When I was Governor, I never allowed a one-time \nasset to be used in the budget.\n  Finally, to those who would say, well, this will keep us from leasing \nANWR, that is simply not true. You can lease ANWR. You can lease \nanything, wildlife refuge or otherwise, but you cannot use it as an \nasset in the reconciliation bill.\n  I yield back such time as I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, the bipartisan budget \nagreement and the Domenici-Lautenberg amendment revised the asset sale \nscoring rule. The new rule prohibits scoring asset sales that would \nlead to a financial loss to the Government.\n  Much work has gone into this. Democrats and Republicans have worked \non it. Senator Bumpers wants to make a special exception for public \nlands.\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\n  Let me suggest the awesome situation that he has talked about never \nhas happened in the U.S. Senate. We have never tried to sell national \nparks. We have never had any commission to sell national parks. \nSomebody in the House had a wild idea, and, frankly, that is never \ngoing to happen here.\n  As a matter of fact, this amendment, what we have already adopted, \nsays that if there is any financial loss to the Government, you cannot \ncount an asset sale.\n  I make a point of order against the Bumpers amendment. It violates \nsection 313 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I move to waive the Budget Act for \nSenate consideration of my amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF TAX INCREASES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, for purposes of section 202 \n     of House Concurrent Resolution 67 (104th Congress), it shall \n     not be in order to consider any bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that provides an \n     increase in direct spending offset by an increase in \n     receipts.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the \n     concurrent resolution, bill, or joint resolution, as the case \n     may be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of \n     the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n       (d) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of direct spending and receipts for a \n     fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of estimates \n     made by the Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my amendment would change the current pay-\ngo procedures by establishing a 60-vote point of order against using \ntax increases to pay for new mandatory spending increases. My amendment \nis the first step toward reining in the uncontrolled costs of mandatory \nspending programs that I believe threaten our fiscal future. This \nbudget should have gone further in entitlement reform and it should not \nhave added more entitlement spending, but there is one reform that \nshould be made definitely, and that is to cause no further harm.\n  My amendment will not affect a single current beneficiary of a single \nexisting entitlement program. My amendment will not affect a single \nperson who will qualify to become a beneficiary under the current \nrequirements of any existing entitlement program. My amendment will not \nprevent the creation of a new entitlement program if there is a true \nneed for the program. It simply will require that such a need be truly \ndemonstrated.\n  My amendment will not prevent a tax increase that is used for deficit \nreduction.\n  What my amendment will do is put an end to the fiction that tax \nincreases are capable of offsetting the cost of additional mandatory \nspending.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Craig amendment. \nThe amendment would change the pay-go system and mean that we could not \nprovide for health insurance to children by closing unnecessary tax \nloopholes. You heard it from the Senator directly.\n  This is outrageous. It would undermine our efforts to ensure that all \nof the 10 million children who lack health coverage in this country can \nhave it. There are already budget rules that limit the use of savings \nthat come from tax loopholes. This amendment would go much farther and \nmake it tougher to invest in children's health programs. If you vote \nfor the Craig amendment, you are voting to protect tax loopholes. If \nyou vote against it, you are voting to help children obtain health \ninsurance in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment is extraneous and violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, under section 904 of the Budget Act, I move \nto waive the point of order against the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a such second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordinary had.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall apply to direct spending targets for \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2002 and shall expire at the end of \n     fiscal year 2002.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Senator Kohl and I have offered this \namendment. It is a very, very simple amendment. It just says if we are \ngoing to break the spending caps on this bill, on this budget agreement \nthat we've told the American people is going to balance the budget, if \nwe're going to break the spending limits on it, we have to vote on it. \nAnd we have to vote and pass that by a 60-vote margin. That's it.\n  The President has to say how he is going to get us to a balanced \nbudget. If we're going to break that cap, he has to say how he is going \nto get us to a balanced budget; if we're going to break that spending \ncap, he has to say where we're going to make the spending cuts, and we \nhave to vote if we are going to break it.\n  I think this is the least we can do for the American people. It says, \n``Folks,\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\nwe meant it when we said we were going to balance the budget. We meant \nit when we said we're going to balance it by the year 2002.'' And if we \nare going to break it, we've got to break it by a 60-vote margin.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kohl.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I also am a supporter of this amendment. What it \nsimply says is that we are going to do what we set out to do, which is \nto balance the budget, and, if we go over it in any year, then we are \ngoing to have to decide how we are going to reduce that spending to be \nsure we stay on target to get the budget balanced over the next several \nyears. That is all this does. It is not a sequester. Nobody should fear \nthat. But it is simply an enforcement mechanism which is necessary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment is a fast-track ticket \nto deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. It would essentially create a \ncap for these and other essential mandatory programs like the Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, we ought not punish the people who are on Medicaid or \nMedicare just because these programs grow faster than a particular \nrate. Sometimes growth in these programs could be good.\n  For example, the first reconciliation bill includes money to recruit \n3 million uninsured Medicaid-eligible children to sign up for the \nprogram. If this happens, obviously Medicaid spending is going to \nincrease. But the question is, What do we want to do? Do we want to \ntake care of those kids or don't we? This would not be a good reason to \ncut the program. This is a dangerous gimmick. We can balance the budget \nwithout it. Furthermore, we ought not accept an amendment that could \nforce quick, drastic cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment to protect Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is \nextraneous and violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I make a motion to waive the Budget Act \nwith respect to my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the __, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ENFORCEMENT OF BALANCED BUDGET.\n\n       (a) In the Senate.--Title III of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n\n             ``enforcement of balanced budget in the senate\n\n       ``Sec. 315. (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order \n     in the Senate to consider any resolution or bill (or \n     amendment, motion, or conference report on such resolution or \n     bill) that provides or would cause a deficit (as determined \n     for purposes of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement of May 16, \n     1997) for fiscal year 2002 or any fiscal year thereafter.\n       ``(b) Waiver and Suspension.--This section may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.

Mr. President, this amendment, submitted on behalf of \nSenators Conrad, Sessions, Abraham, and myself evolves from a simple \nprinciple, that is, once we balance the budget, which we will do by \n2002, let us keep it in balance thereafter. The amendment has two key \nprovisions. No. 1, establishes a 60-vote point of order against any \nbill or resolution that will increase the deficit in the year 2002 or \nany year thereafter, and, No. 2, requires the President to submit a \nbalanced budget every year in 2002 and thereafter.\n  The amendment does provide exceptions in the event of war or \nrecession. The amendment is consistent with the bipartisan balanced \nbudget agreement.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am strongly opposed to this amendment. It creates a \n60-vote point of order against any budget resolution that shows a \nunified deficit after the year 2002. We are all committed to protecting \nagainst the rising deficit. This amendment, however, means that next \nyear even a modest change in CBO's long-term economic forecast could \ntrigger the need for deep and hurtful cuts. It would be outrageous to \ncut Medicare or Social Security just because CBO changes its guess \nabout what the economy will look like in 5 years. CBO cannot even \npredict what the deficit is going to look like in the next 5 months, \nnever mind 5 years. Their recent record is absolutely abysmal. This \namendment\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\nalso requires that Social Security surpluses be used in calculating the \ndeficit and could make it impossible to use those surpluses in the \nfuture to pay for Social Security benefits of retiring baby boomers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous and \nradical amendment and I raise a point of order----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order cannot be raised until the \nSenator's time has been used up.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think this is a very good idea. As a matter of fact, \nif you look carefully at the agreement we entered into with the White \nHouse, it clearly says we are not supposed to do anything that takes \nthe budget out of balance in the year 2002 and beyond. I think perhaps \nthe Senator is just helping us try to enforce that agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I now, Mr. President, raise the point of order that \nthe amendment violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to waive the Budget Act with respect to my \namendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This amendment is offered on behalf of myself, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Enzi, Senator Inhofe, Senator Grams, and Senator \nSessions.\n  At this time our Nation's tax rate is the highest percentage of the \nnational income it has ever been in history. As we all know in this \nChamber, our national debt is too high. Recently it was discovered by \nthe Congressional Budget Office that they had underestimated the \nrevenues coming into our system by some $225 billion, and we promptly \nspent a very substantial amount of those dollars on new Federal \nprograms.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says if the revenues which are \nreceived by the Treasury in the next 5 years exceed those that are \nprojected, we ought to have a lockbox and those dollars ought to either \nbe spent on tax cuts or on reducing the deficit, and not new Federal \nspending.\n  Mr. President, a coalition of taxpayer groups including the National \nTaxpayer's Union, the National Tax Limitation Committee, Empower \nAmerica, Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity, and others have \nendorsed my bill to require that any tax revenue windfall be used for \ntax cuts or deficit reduction, not new government spending. I ask \nunanimous consent that a statement by Al Cors, Jr., of the National \nTaxpayer's Union be entered in the Record immediately following my \nremarks:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 27, 1997.\n       Any amendment that would dedicate ``windfall'' revenue to \n     new spending, rather than to additional tax relief and/or \n     deficit reduction, will be scored heavily as an antitaxpayer \n     amendment on our annual NTU Rating of Congress.\n\n                                                 Al Cors, Jr.,\n\n                                   Director, Government Relations,\n     National Taxpayers Union.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      The National\n\n\n                                     Tax-Limitation Committee,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 1997.\n\n    Pro-Taxpayer Groups Urge Congress to Act Now on Future Tax Cuts\n\n       Washington, DC.--The National Tax-Limitation Committee \n     joined by Empower America, National Taxpayers Union, \n     Americans for Hope, Growth, and Opportunity, Citizens for a \n     Sound Economy, and Citizens for Budget Reform sent a letter \n     to Congress urging action in the budget legislation to \n     reserve future revenue windfalls for tax cuts for all \n     Americans. The text of the letter follows:\n       You have a great opportunity to act right now to secure the \n     first down-payment on further tax relief for the American \n     people. You can do this simply by enacting a firm rule during \n     budget reconciliation that sets aside, or ``sequesters'', any \n     revenues above the FY 1998 budget resolution projections for \n     further tax relief for all Americans. While some of these \n     ``windfall'' revenues might possibly be\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\n     applied to faster deficit reduction, it is vitally important \n     that the bulk of them go directly to taxpayers, and never get \n     within the grasp of the big-government spending machine.\n       There are a lot of good ideas floating around on how to do \n     this, but the key is to look out for the interests of the \n     taxpayer first, last, and always. We have plenty of time to \n     think about the best ways to provide for future debt \n     repayment, additional tax cuts, and major tax reform in the \n     next millenium. But our immediate and urgent goal must be to \n     unambiguously lock in any ``bonus'' revenues to help the \n     hard-pressed taxpayer.\n       We are concerned that some proposals being considered \n     merely put the taxpayer a distant third, delay their effects \n     for many years, and create a built-in bias towards higher \n     taxes, not lower (such as requiring revenue growth to \n     outstrip spending growth on a year-to-year basis). The last \n     thing the Federal government needs is yet another incentive \n     to raise taxes. Furthermore attempting to build up special \n     trust funds within the government rather than provide tax \n     relief merely gives those ``trust'' accounts protected status \n     in the fiscal policy debate--not sound fiscal policy, and \n     certainly not pro-taxpayer.\n       The pending tax bill represents an honorable and diligent \n     effort to give taxpayers a first installment of tax relief, \n     and start moving right now to ratchet down the percent of \n     family income consumed by taxes. We know that this budget \n     process has been a difficult one, and we want to work with \n     you as it continues to unfold, particularly in what promises \n     to be a very tough ``end-game'' negotiation. We want the best \n     possible deal for the American taxpayer, and we want to \n     ensure that this is a true ``taxpayer relief act''. Seizing \n     this unique opportunity to point the way to future tax relief \n     is one of the best possible ways to do that.\n         Jack Kemp, Empower America; Lewis K. Uhler, National Tax \n           Limitation Committee; David Keating, National Taxpayers \n           Union; Steve Forbes, Americans for Hope, Growth, and \n           Opportunity; Matt Kibbe, Citizens for a Sound Economy; \n           Harrison Fox, Citizens for Budget Reform.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota to comment further \non this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the amendment \noffered by Senator Abraham. After all, if the revenues do increase, it \nis going to come because of the hard work of the American people. While \nspending levels on Federal programs have already been set, it only \nmakes sense, if the revenues increase, they should go either to tax \nrelief to those hard-working American families or to deficit reduction. \nThey should not go to enlarge the size of Government. The era of big \nGovernment is far from over. This amendment would help protect future \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my op-ed \narticle in today's Journal of Commerce on the economic growth dividend \nprotection amendment be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Journal of Commerce, June 27, 1997]\n\n                        America Needs a Tax Cut\n\n                          (By Spencer Abraham)\n\n       It is always easier to spend other people's money than to \n     give it back, and that's the lesson of the budget agreement \n     between Congress and the Clinton administration. It is also \n     the major obstacle confronting those of us who advocate \n     reducing the record tax burden shouldered by American \n     taxpayers.\n       After four months of negotiations, and literally just hours \n     before a self-imposed deadline, the Congressional Budget \n     Office provided budget negotiators with a gift of sorts. It \n     found that the federal deficit in 1997 would be much less \n     than previously reported. Instead of $112 billion, the \n     deficit would be closer to $67 billion. Moreover, the CBO \n     suggested that this $45 billion windfall would extend over \n     the next five years, reducing the total deficit by $245 \n     billion.\n       This ``windfall'' is a mixed blessing. The economy's \n     continued strong performance means more jobs and \n     opportunities for Americans--as well as additional revenues \n     to the government. But it brought renewed administration \n     demands for even higher levels of spending in 1998 and \n     beyond. Apparently, all sorts of spending issues that had \n     previously been closed were reopened following the CBO's \n     surprise announcement.\n       One issue that remained closed, however, was that of tax \n     cuts. While spending for numerous programs was increased \n     following the CBO's announcement, the net tax cut remained \n     fixed at $85 billion. The result was a budget plan that would \n     increase federal spending by 17 percent over the next five \n     years, yet reduce tax collections by less than 1 percent of \n     the total tax burden over that time.\n       Along with a number of my colleagues, I have proposed \n     legislation to improve this deal. It would reserve any \n     unexpected increase in tax revenues for tax cuts and/or \n     deficit reduction. To the extent tax revenues under this \n     budget agreement exceed projections by the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation, those revenues should go to the people, not \n     additional government spending.\n       This is not an idle suggestion. For years, tax cut \n     advocates like me have argued that federal revenue estimates \n     ignore the dynamic effects that pro-growth tax reforms have \n     on the economy and the budget. Incentives for economic growth \n     and job creation--such as reduced capital gains taxes and \n     increased allowable IRAs--will bring higher economic growth \n     over the next five years and increase, not decrease, revenues \n     to the federal treasury.\n       History is on our side in this debate. For example, between \n     1978 and 1985, while the top marginal rate on capital gains \n     was cut almost in half--from 35% to 20%--total annual federal \n     receipts from the tax almost tripled. They rose from $9.1 \n     billion to $26.5 billion annually. Conversely, when Congress \n     raised the capital gains rate in 1986, revenues from that tax \n     actually fell.\n       Economists across the board predict that cutting the \n     capital gains rate will bring a revenue windfall for the \n     Treasury. Economic expert Larry Kudlow predicts that another \n     broad capital gains tax cut could produce a $90 billion tax \n     dividend next year, assuming only 15% of investors realize \n     their stock market gains from three years ago. These \n     windfalls should be given back to the taxpayers.\n       As John F. Kennedy noted, ``It is a paradoxical truth that \n     tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low, \n     and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is \n     to cut taxes now.''\n       Why do Americans need a tax cut? The President's own \n     economists report that the tax burden on Americans is the \n     highest ever--31.7%. According to the National Taxpayer \n     Union, the average American family now pays almost 40% of its \n     income in state, local and federal taxes. And while we \n     address the tax burden in a small, incremental way with this \n     budget resolution. I believe we need to tilt the playing \n     field away from more spending and toward more tax reduction.\n       How does this proposal work? First, it locks the expected \n     revenue estimates into law. Then it requires the Office of \n     Management and Budget to compare its new revenue estimates \n     each year to those included in the agreement. If the budget \n     agreement estimates are accurate, nothing happens. But if the \n     progrowth tax cuts we adopt later this year result in higher \n     than expected revenues, those revenues are reserved for tax \n     cut legislation--legislation which is exempt from all the \n     budget points of order and other obstacles that currently \n     stand between American families and tax cuts. If Congress \n     chooses not to reduce revenues, then the windfall is reserved \n     for deficit reduction.\n       The Senate gave this proposal its preliminary approval on \n     May 23 by voting for my Sense of the Senate amendment to the \n     budget. We should now put into effect the rules that will \n     help make tax cuts a reality.\n       The budget agreement takes a small, $85 billion step down \n     the long road toward reducing the tax burden on American \n     families. This cut should be just the beginning.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment says that if revenues \nexceed current projections, all the savings can only be plowed into \nmore tax breaks; if you have a surplus, back into the tax breaks, not \ndefense, not education, only more tax breaks. Even if the deficit were \nactually going up due to increased spending, we would still be able to \nuse all unexpected revenues only for more tax breaks.\n  That is fiscally irresponsible. It removes power and flexibility from \nthe congressional majority and it is terrible policy. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is \nextraneous and violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act with \nrespect to this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized to offer an amendment on which there is 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I send to the desk an amendment, and I \nask that the amendment be read. I hope that Senators will pay close \nattention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 572.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DEBATE ON A RECONCILIATION BILL.\n\n       Section 310(e)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) For purposes of consideration of any reconciliation \n     bill reported under subsection (b)--\n       ``(A) debate, and all amendments thereto and debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to not more than 30 hours;\n       ``(B) time on the bill may only be yielded back by consent \n     and a motion to further limit debate shall be debatable with \n     debate limited to \\1/2\\ hour equally divided;\n       ``(C) time on amendments shall be limited to 30 minutes to \n     be equally divided in the usual form and on any second degree \n     amendment or motion to 20 minutes to be equally divided in \n     the usual form, except that after the 15th hour of \n     consideration of a bill, time on all amendments or motions \n     shall be limited to 20 minutes;\n       ``(D) no first degree amendment may be proposed after the \n     15th hour of consideration of a bill unless it has been \n     submitted to the Journal Clerk prior to the expiration of the \n     15th hour;\n       ``(E) no second degree amendment may be proposed after the \n     20th hour of consideration of a bill unless it has been \n     submitted to the Journal Clerk prior to the expiration of the \n     20th hour; and\n       ``(F) After no more than thirty hours of consideration of \n     the measure, the Senate shall proceed, without any further \n     debate on any question, to vote on the final disposition \n     thereof to the exclusion of all amendments not then actually \n     pending before the Senate at that time and to the exclusion \n     of all motions, except a motion to table, or to reconsider \n     and one quorum call on demand to establish the presence of a \n     quorum (and motions required to establish a quorum) \n     immediately before the final vote begins.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan, wrote a book titled ``Pandemonium.'' Milton, in ``Paradise \nLost,'' designated the Palace of Satan as pandemonium. Mr. President, \nwhat we have seen going on here is pandemonium, and in light of what I \nhave just said, Senators can draw their own conclusion as to what I \nmean by that word.\n  This is a very important amendment to the reconciliation process. It \nextends the overall time from 20 hours to 30 hours. It reduces the time \non any amendment in the first degree to 30 minutes. It reduces the time \non any second-degree amendment to 20 minutes. May I proceed for an \nadditional 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. After the first 15 hours have expired, time on amendments \nin the first degree and in the second degree will be limited to 20 \nminutes each. The amendment provides for 30 minutes equally divided for \ndebate on a motion to reduce the time, which can be done now without \nany debate. It requires unanimous consent for managers of a \nreconciliation measure to yield back any time. At the present time, \nthey may yield time back without unanimous consent.\n  Now comes probably the most important provision in the proposal. If \nSenators will turn to page 19 in their rule books. I will read the \nlanguage from the cloture rule:\n\n       After no more than thirty hours of consideration of the \n     measure, motion, or other matter on which cloture has been \n     invoked, the Senate shall proceed, without any further debate \n     on any question, to vote on the final disposition thereof to \n     the exclusion of all amendments not then actually pending \n     before the Senate at that time and to the exclusion of all \n     motions, except a motion to table. . .\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we have order, Mr. President?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may again \nread what I have just read, without the time's being charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I repeat:\n\n       After no more than thirty hours of consideration--\n\n  I am reading from the present cloture rule--\n\n       After no more than thirty hours of consideration of the \n     measure, motion, or other matter on which cloture has been \n     invoked, the Senate shall proceed, without any further debate \n     on any question, to vote on the final disposition thereof--\n\n  Meaning the final disposition of the reconciliation bill--\n\n     to the exclusion of all amendments not then actually pending \n     before the Senate at that time and to the exclusion of all \n     motions, except a motion to table, or to reconsider and one \n     quorum call on demand to establish the presence of a quorum \n     (and motions required to establish a quorum) immediately \n     before the final vote begins.\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, we do away with this situation in which \npandemonium reigns supreme and where scores of amendments remain to be \nacted upon after the expiration of the time on the reconciliation bill \nand people want to call those up--and they have a right to call them up \nand get a vote thereon.\n  This amendment encourages Senators, if they want time to debate their \namendments, to call them up at the beginning of the debate, call them \nup early, when they will have time to explain their amendments. But \nwhen we reach that final 30th hour, under this amendment language, \nwhich is already tried and true--it is in the cloture rule--we close \nall debate, all voting on amendments to the reconciliation bill with \nthe exception of any amendment in the first degree and any amendment in \nthe second degree which may be then pending. That is it. No more of \nthis vote-o-rama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have been discussing this proposal \nwith the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, ``we'' being Senator \nLott and others. And I assume Senator Lott will speak in a moment to it \nhowever long he would like.\n  But I say to the Senate, and as long as Senator Byrd understands that \nwe take this to conference with the idea that we will have to make \nsure--and I think he would agree--that it deserves some careful \nconsideration.\n  I had one thought that came to my mind, I say to Senator Byrd, as you \nproposed it. I was talking to Senator Gramm about it. I guess I am \nconcerned that there might be a controversial amendment that is well-\nknown that by design could be precluded from ever getting offered. And \nI think we ought to make sure that cannot happen. I do not know how to \ndo\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nthat. I do not propose that this is not a valid and good approach. But \nI do think that is an interesting issue. I was just speaking with \nSenator Gramm a moment ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for one additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think there would have to be a lot of getting \ntogether of both sides of the aisle to preclude that amendment from \ncoming up, but it might happen. So from my standpoint, I say to \nSenators, I think this is a dramatic improvement, provided that the \nSenator understands that we have to look at it carefully if it is \naccepted here today.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do understand. I hope that the Members who go to \nconference with the House will try to make it clear to the House that \nwe Senators expect to decide on the amendments and the rules of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself leader time so I may speak \nbriefly on this. It will be briefly.\n  I have been talking to Senator Daschle about this and working with \nSenator Byrd. I think we had a good start last night on how to address \nthis problem, and it has been improved today. I think we are close to \nhaving something that would really make this process fairer and better.\n  I suggest that we accept this on a voice vote, and we go to \nconference with it and continue to make sure we have thought through \nevery possible exigency of this change. I think it is real progress. \nAnd I suggest we accept it and take it to conference.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be very brief with my leader time.\n  I congratulate the Senator from West Virginia. No one knows the \nprocess and the rules better than he does. And he has worked with all \nof us in an effort to try to accommodate the concerns that we have \nraised over the last couple of days. He has done that. This may not be \nthe final product, but it puts us in a position to achieve a final \nproduct.\n  I hope that we can take the advice and recommendation of the majority \nleader, pass it on a voice vote, and allow this process to continue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment adds $12 billion to the \nchild health insurance program. It is financed by an additional 23-\ncents-a-pack increase in the tobacco tax. This amount is necessary to \nensure that all children not eligible for Medicare, but not able to \nafford private insurance, will have access the health coverage.\n  CBO says that the current bill, a proposal that is before the Senate, \nwill not do the job. The administration strongly supports the \namendment. So do 72 percent of the American people.\n  I will just take 15 seconds to read a letter from the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics:\n\n       53,000 primary care pediatricians, pediatric medical \n     subspecialists, pediatric surgeons and specialists dedicated \n     to the health, safety, and well-being of infants, children, \n     adolescents and young adults strongly support your amendment \n     to increase the tax by 23 cents for use in financing the \n     children's health care legislation.\n\n  I hope that with this amendment we will be able to complete the job \nfor working families in this country that are unable to afford \ninsurance today.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on \nSenator Kennedy's amendment. I am bothered by the amendment to some \nextent. I heard the Senator say the administration supports the \namendment. The administration agreed to $16 billion for the so-called \nKIDCARE Program. That was the agreement. And then to see a letter by \nthe administration that says now they support this amendment, that is \nridiculous.\n  The Finance Committee increased from $16 billion to $24 billion, more \nthan I think is necessary for the program. The Finance Committee said, \n``That is all we will do.'' Now we see the administration say they \nsupport this. When is a deal a deal? We can't trust this administration \nany more than a day. That is beyond belief.\n  So now we have a program. Senator Kennedy introduced it as a $20 \nbillion program. We are now financing it at $24 billion, 120 percent of \nwhat he originally asked for. He should say, ``Hey, we won,'' and now \nhe comes back and says he wants another $12 billion, to make it $36 \nbillion. The administration agreed to $16 billion. Now they are trying \nto make it $36 billion. Taxpayers cannot afford it.\n  Finally, the net tax cut, if this amendment is passed, will be 60, \nnot 85. It will be 60.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did you say the administration favors this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for 30 seconds, and the Senator can have 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say to the White House, if there are too many \nmore like this where you support amendments that you did not agree to, \nand you actually agreed we did not have to do, then I am sending you a \nsignal right now I am going to conference and I don't know if Senator \nDomenici is going to be bound by that agreement.\n  I make a point of order that this violates the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican leadership has been \nwilling to accept a tobacco tax which the Republican leadership said \nwas going to violate the budget agreement which the President \npreviously supported. Now the President and the Republican leadership \nhave accepted a 20 cent tobacco tax. The only trouble with the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma's mathematics is he does not include the $14 billion that \nthey were instructed to reduce Medicaid.\n  So, this is necessary, according to the Republican's own CBO. This is \nnecessary to cover insurance. Let's turn our backs on big tobacco and \nput our faith in little children.\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment reduces the deficit, and I move to \nwaive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the bill currently provides an \neducation IRA for college expenses only. But, of course, not every \nchild goes to college. Every child does, however, attend elementary and \nsecondary school.\n  This amendment expands the education IRA to allow parents to use it \nfor any education expenses, including tuition from kindergarten through \nhigh school. I am pleased to be joined on this amendment by Senators \nAbraham, Coats, Craig, Santorum, and Ashcroft.\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is important to help parents cope with the cost of \ncollege, but that is not where the crisis is.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     and Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment numbered legislative \n     541.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, June 26, 1997.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. President, we all understand what regular IRA's are about and how \nthose work where a person can put up to $2,000 into an IRA. It \naccumulates earnings over a career, and then when you retire you go \nahead and pay tax on it.\n  What we have in this bill is something different than a regular IRA. \nWe have an IRA Plus. The IRA Plus differs in a very important way. What \nthis chart shows is it essentially says if you agree to pay the tax \nthat is due on your existing IRA up through the end of next year, the \n1st of January 1998, it will give you the time that this budget \nagreement covers to pay all of that tax in. And then the earnings from \nthat money in that IRA Plus account are never going to be taxed the \nrest of your life.\n  That is what the provision is. It is a back-loaded IRA which means it \nis specifically for people who are not eligible for the other types of \nIRA's. So if you have over $100,000 and you already have a retirement \naccount, then you can have an IRA Plus. The earnings from the funds in \nthat IRA Plus will never be taxed.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt our amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we need to do something about our savings \nrates. Americans are saving less now than they did than at almost any \ntime since World War II. The universal IRA Plus is our best bet to \nbolster our fledgling savings rate. In fact, expanding IRA's is the \nonly prosaving provision in the budget. The universal IRA Plus account \ncompliments the tax deductible IRA because it offers a long-term \npredictable savings program for millions of families with fluctuating \nincomes, and who do not have employer retirement plans.\n  Senator Bingaman's chart is misleading because the taxpayer must be \nat least 59\\1/2\\ years old before withdrawals are tax free. It is \nparticularly important for the self-employed like farmers and young \nfamilies who hopefully will be successful and grow out of the tax-\ndeductible IRA into the IRA Plus. With all these advantages, the \nbackloaded IRA must be included in the budget bill. Fifty-one Senators \nhave cosponsored my super-IRA legislation and agree with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KOHL. This amendment provides a tax incentive for companies that \nprovide quality child care for the children of their employees. The \namendment is cosponsored by Senators Hatch, Daschle, DeWine, Boxer, \nD'Amato, Specter, Snowe, Johnson, Abraham, Moseley-Braun, and Murray. \nThis amendment creates a tax credit limited to 50 percent of $150,000 \nper company per year for 3 years for those companies that invest in \nquality child care on or near site. The credit is offset by authorizing \nthe antifraud program that will keep parents who do not have custody of \ntheir children from unlawfully claiming child-related tax benefits.\n  We know child care is an investment that is good for children, good \nfor business, good for States and good for our Nation. We need to \ninvolve every level of government and private communities and private \nbusinesses in building a quality child care system for our youngest \nthat is the best in the world. This amendment is the first essential \nand deficit-neutral step toward that end.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, while I am sympathetic to my colleague's \neffort to provide quality child care, I regret I must oppose his \namendment. This bill already contains meaningful child care tax relief \nfor families. This proposal would give that tax relief to employers.\n  For this reason I must oppose this amendment. I point out the \namendment is not germane and, with all time yielded back, I make a \npoint of order of germaneness. I therefore raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I have a child care amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Snowe, Ms. \n     Landrieu, Mr. Chafee, Mr. D'Amato, Ms. Collins, Mr. Smith of \n     Oregon, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 555.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the June 26, 1997, edition \nof the Record.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is a natural follow-on to the \nprevious amendment. We are all aware of the need for good child care. \nThere are more than 12 million children who are in child care. At least \n15 percent are in care that is so bad that their health and safety are \nthreatened; 40 percent of the infants in child care are in very risky \nsituations.\n  For the many parents who would change their child care if they could \nfind and afford better, this amendment provides tax relief through the \nchild care tax credits, and it helps business meet the child care needs \nof their employees through the business tax credits and deductions.\n  We expand choices for parents, because if you can't afford the child \ncare you find, you don't have much choice. Representatives of the \nreligious and for-profit child care providers worked with us on the \nlanguage related to accreditation and credentialing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Members be added as \ncosponsors: Senators Dodd, Roberts, Kohl, Landrieu, Snowe, Johnson, \nChafee, D'Amato, Collins, Gordon Smith, Campbell, Kennedy, Enzi, \nAllard, Stevens, Grassley, Mikulski, Kerry, and Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I reserve the remainder of my time, if I have any left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. There is 1 \nminute in opposition. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we all want to improve quality care for \nchild care. We spend nearly $1 billion now\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\ndoing that. As chairman of the Children and Family Subcommittee I am \ncommitted to that. I commend Senator Jeffords, Senator Dodd, and others \nfor work in that area.\n  The reason I oppose this particular amendment is, first of all, \nbecause it is an amorphous amendment. It brings a number of things \ntogether. There is one in here we tried to work out. I think we ought \nto oppose it, take it back to committee, bring it through, and bring a \ntrue quality child care amendment forward.\n  This forces grandparents, neighbors, and family day-care providers \nwho already comply with State child care laws to meet now an additional \nstandard, certified by a State-recognized agency or entity to submit to \nadditional monitoring in order to have the care that they provide \nqualify for this additional tax credit.\n  We should not provide a preference tax credit for those who provide \ncare outside the State certification. There are mothers and neighbors \nand relatives who do that who provide what they think is quality care \nand, more important, what the mothers and parents of children think is \nquality care.\n  I yield whatever time I have left to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane to the \nprovisions of the reconciliation measure. I, therefore, raise a point \nof order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I understand this is a germaneness \nobjection.

Mr. President, as the Senate has considered tax \nrelief for people of means to encourage them to invest in a growing \neconomy and people of more modest means to help with their education, I \noffer an amendment to deal with a different group of Americans, people \nnot of high or medium income, but people of no income.\n  Even in good economic times, through no fault of their own, through \nmergers, acquisitions, downsizing, or foreign competition, companies \nneed to sometimes reduce their work force. And corporate America is \nresponding responsibly by offering severance pay.\n  My amendment simply takes the first $3,000 of severance pay offered \nto any American who loses their job through downsizing and makes that \n$3,000 tax free. It is offset. It is responsible. It is an appropriate \nGovernment response to a corporate policy which is the right way to \nhelp Americans to adjust to start their own businesses or retirement.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  There is 1 minute in opposition.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do not believe there is any \nopposition.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1027, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n             Subtitle N--National Fund for Health Research\n\n     SEC. 5995. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``National Fund for \n     Health Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 5996. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly 4 of 5 peer reviewed research projects deemed \n     worthy of funding by the National Institutes of Health are \n     not funded.\n       (2) Less than 3 percent of the nearly one trillion dollars \n     our Nation spends on health care is devoted to health \n     research, while the defense industry spends 15 percent of its \n     budget on research and development.\n       (3) Public opinion surveys have shown that Americans want \n     more Federal resources put into health research and are \n     willing to pay for it.\n       (4) Ample evidence exists to demonstrate that health \n     research has improved the quality of health care in the \n     United States. Advances such as the development of vaccines, \n     the cure of many childhood cancers, drugs that effectively \n     treat a host of diseases and disorders, a process to protect \n     our Nation's blood supply from the HIV virus, progress \n     against cardiovascular disease including heart attack and \n     stroke, and new strategies for the early detection and \n     treatment of diseases such as colon, breast, and prostate \n     cancer clearly demonstrates the benefits of health research.\n       (5) Health research which holds the promise of prevention \n     of intentional and unintentional injury and cure and \n     prevention of disease and disability, is critical to holding \n     down health care costs in the long term.\n       (6) Expanded medical research is also critical to holding \n     down the long-term costs of the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act. For example, recent \n     research has demonstrated that delaying the onset of \n     debilitating and costly conditions like Alzheimer's disease \n     could reduce general health care and medicare costs by \n     billions of dollars annually.\n       (7) The state of our Nation's research facilities at the \n     National Institutes of Health and at universities is \n     deteriorating significantly. Renovation and repair of these \n     facilities are badly needed to maintain and improve the \n     quality of research.\n       (8) Because discretionary spending is likely to decline in \n     real terms over the next 5 years, the Nation's investment in \n     health research through the National Institutes of Health is \n     likely to decline in real terms unless corrective legislative \n     action is taken.\n       (9) A health research fund is needed to maintain our \n     Nation's commitment to health research and to increase the \n     percentage of approved projects which receive funding at the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n\n     SEC. 5997. ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of \n     the United States a fund, to be known as the ``National Fund \n     for Health Research'' (hereafter in this section referred to \n     as the ``Fund''), consisting of such amounts as are \n     transferred to the Fund under subsection (b), any sums \n     specifically designated for such purpose by future acts of \n     Congress, and any interest earned on investment of amounts in \n     the Fund.\n       (b) Transfers to Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     transfer to the Fund amounts equivalent to one half the \n     amounts for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002 \n     derived for each such fiscal year under Section 311 through \n     Section 314 of this act that exceeds the amount of Federal \n     revenues estimated by the Joint Tax Committee as of the date \n     of enactment of this act, to be gained from enactment of \n     Section 311 through Section 314 for each such fiscal year.\n       (B) Determination by secretary.--Not later than 6 months \n     after the end of each of the fiscal years described in \n     subparagraph (A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall--\n       (i) make a determination as to the amount to be transferred \n     to the Fund for the fiscal year involved under this \n     subsection; and\n       (ii) subject to subsection (d), transfer such amount to the \n     Fund.\n       (C) Fund administered by health and human services.--The \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall administer funds \n     transferred into the Fund.\n       (D) Cap on transfer.--Amounts transferred to the Fund under \n     this subsection for any year in the 5-fiscal year period \n     beginning on October 1, 1997, shall not in combination with \n     the appropriated sum exceed an amount equal to the amount \n     appropriated for the National Institutes of Health for fiscal \n     year 1997 multiplied by 2.\n       (c) Obligations From Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph \n     (4), with respect to the amounts made available in the Fund \n     in a fiscal year, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall distribute--\n       (A) 2 percent of such amounts during any fiscal year to the \n     Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health \n     to be allocated for the following activities:\n       (i) for carrying out the responsibilities of the Office of \n     the Director, including the Office of Research on Women's \n     Health and the Office of Research on Minority Health, the \n     Office of Alternative Medicine, the Office of Rare Disease \n     Research, the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences \n     Research (for use for efforts to reduce tobacco use), the \n     Office of Dietary Supplements, and the Office for Disease \n     Prevention; and\n       (ii) for construction and acquisition of equipment for or \n     facilities of or used by the National Institutes of Health;\n       (B) 2 percent of such amounts for transfer to the National \n     Center for Research Resources to carry out section 1502 of \n     the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 \n     concerning Biomedical and Behavioral Research Facilities;\n       (C) 1 percent of such amounts during any fiscal year for \n     carrying out section 301 and part D of title IV of the Public \n     Health Service  Act with respect to health information \n     communications; and\n       (D) the remainder of such amounts during any fiscal year to \n     member institutes and centers, including the Office of AIDS \n     Research, of the National Institutes of Health in the same \n     proportion to the total amount received under this section, \n     as the amount of annual appropriations under appropriations \n     Acts for each member institute and Centers for the fiscal \n     year bears to the total amount of appropriations under \n     appropriations Acts for all member institutes and Centers of \n     the National Institutes of Health for the fiscal year.\n       (2) Plans of allocation.--The amounts transferred under \n     paragraph (1)(D) shall be allocated by the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health or the various directors of the \n     institutes and centers, as the case may be, pursuant to \n     allocation plans developed by the various advisory councils \n     to such directors, after consultation with such directors.\n       (3) Grants and contracts fully funded in first year.--With \n     respect to any grant or contract funded by amounts \n     distributed under paragraph (1), the full amount of the total \n     obligation of such grant or contract shall be funded in the \n     first year of such grant or contract, and shall remain \n     available until expended.\n       (4) Trigger and release of monies.\n       (A) Trigger and release.--No expenditure shall be made \n     under paragraph (1) during any fiscal year in which the \n     annual amount appropriated for the National Institutes of \n     Health is less than the amount so appropriated for the prior \n     fiscal year.\n       (d) Required Appropriation.--No transfer may be made for a \n     fiscal year under subsection (b) unless an appropriations Act \n     providing for such a transfer has been enacted with respect \n     to such fiscal year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in this morning's paper, researchers were \nable to identify a gene that plays a role in Parkinson's disease. We \nneed more funds for biomedical research.\n  What this amendment says, on behalf of Senators D'Amato, Specter, \nMack, and myself, is that we take the excess savings that will come in \nbecause of the capital gains tax cut. Half of that will go for deficit \nreduction; the other half will go to NIH for biomedical research.\n  I yield the remainder of my time first to Senator D'Amato and then \nSenator Specter.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, a number of recent studies have \ndemonstrated that investments in medical research can lower health care \ncosts through the development of more cost-effective treatments. \nGreater funding for research will also increase our ability to combat \ndiseases which are very costly to our Nation's health care system. We \nvoted on May 21, 1997, 98 to 0, to double the amount of funding for NIH \nso we can advance our biomedical research capabilities. This impressive \nshow of support from this body will help reduce health care costs and \nincrease the quality of health for all of our citizens.\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\n  Voting to increase funding was easy. Now comes the hard part. Where \ndo we get the money? We must not take money from other vital programs \nsuch as food stamps or senior citizen benefits. Can we afford to give \nmore money for breast cancer research and take away money from programs \nfor children? There would be no end to the debate on which is more \nworthy of our priorities.\n  There is a better way to get funds for biomedical research without \ncutting from other programs. I suggest that each year the Secretary of \nthe Treasury determine whether the actual revenue impact of the capital \ngains provisions of this bill are more positive--more revenues gained \nor less lost--than levels called for in revenue scoring of this \nprovision. If the impact is more positive, half of the revenues will be \nput toward deficit reduction. We could then take the other half and \ndeposit it into a National Fund for Health Research. This fund will \nexpand support for medical research through the National Institutes of \nHealth [NIH].\n  I believe that if we acquire the money for the fund in this way we \ncan avoid hurting other programs. Using money when there is a more \npositive revenue will keep us within the bounds of the balanced budget \nagreement. I don't believe there is a better place to put this excess \nmoney than in the research fund.\n  Mr. President, every one of us, the entire Senate called for an \nincrease in funding for biomedical research. Again, I suggest that \nthere is no better place to put the more positive revenue than in this \nfund. I believe that the establishment of this trust fund should be \nmade in the same cooperative spirit that brought the entire Senate to \nagree to increase funding on May 21. We can then go home feeling proud \nthat we did all we could to further advance our country's medical \ncapabilities and in time reduce the costs of our entire health care \nsystem.\n   Mr. President, we voted 98 to 0 to do this. This is a matter which \nwe can prove that we meant it. Any additional moneys will go to deficit \nreduction and to NIH.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate voted 98 to 0 in a sense of \nthe Senate, but turned down $1.1 billion of real money, 67 to 37.\n  This is a chance for those 63 Senators to redeem themselves, to \nredeem their promise for NIH funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute in opposition.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If this amendment is adopted, there is no money for tax \ncuts, if that money was available from extra funds.\n  I do not think that is a good idea. I think it hamstrings Congress. \nIf there is extra money, we should give it back to the people who paid \nit here. We should not be putting it into more Government spending.\n  No. 1, my understanding is that this violates the Budget Act and is \nsubject to a point of order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I make the point of order that the amendment is not \nrelevant under the Budget Act, subject to germaneness.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to waive the point of order and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator Moseley-Braun is the next Senator on \nthe list to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 581\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for a tax credit for public elementary and \n         secondary school construction, and for other purposes)\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun], for herself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 581.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, this amendment says that if our \neconomy does better than we today expect that it will, we will devote \nsome of that increased revenue to help rebuild our Nation's crumbling \nschools.\n  The General Accounting Office makes it very clear that we have at \nleast 112 billion dollars' worth of unmet needs with school facilities \naround the country. State and local governments cannot go to the \nproperty tax to meet that 112 billion dollars' worth of need. So, I say \nto my colleagues, in the interest of the 14 million American children \nwho, every day, go to schools that are unfit for human habitation and \nwhich are not suitable environments for learning, I ask support for \nthis amendment. The funds from the tax credit would only be made \navailable if actual revenue in the Federal Treasury exceeded CBO's \nannual revenue projections, and up to $1 billion above and beyond CBO \nrevenue estimates will be deposited into a school infrastructure trust \nfund. It would be distributed to the States in allocable tax credits. \nThis is a problem that will not go away. It will only get worse if we \ndon't address it now. Thank you.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \namendment. I understand there will be a voice vote. Mr. President, this \nproposal is, in essence, converting an education infrastructure grant \nprogram into a tax credit. In my opinion, that is not a good idea. The \nadministration, while they originally proposed having the $5 billion \nfor schools, during the negotiation they dropped that. That wasn't part \nof the agreed-upon package. I might also mention that the Department of \nEducation said, ``The Department recommends that Congress rescind the \n1995 appropriations for this program and provide no funding for 1996.'' \nThat was the infrastructure program.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 581) was rejected.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I next yield to Senator McCain to offer an \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 548\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the extension and \n              modification of subsidies for alcohol fuels)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 548.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 707 of the bill.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment today to strike the \nlanguage in the bill that provides an additional $3.8 billion in \nsubsidies for the ethanol industry.\n  The amendment is very simple. It strikes in its entirety Section 707 \nof the bill, which would extend for an additional 7 years the tax \ncredits for ethanol and methanol producers. The value of these ethanol \nsubsidies is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $3.8 \nbillion in lost revenues.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough. The American taxpayers have \nsubsidized the ethanol industry, with guaranteed loans and tax credits, \nfor more than 20 years. Since 1980, government subsidies for ethanol \nhave totaled more than $10 billion. Section 707 of the bill, if not \nstricken, would give another $3.8 billion in tax breaks to ethanol \nproducers.\n  Current law provides tax credits for ethanol producers which are \nestimated to cost the Treasury $770 million a year in lost revenue, and \nthe Congressional Research Service estimates that loss may increase to \n$1 billion by the year 2000. These huge tax credits effectively \nincrease the tax burden on other businesses and individual taxpayers.\n  The current tax subsidies for ethanol are scheduled to expire in the \nyear 2000. This amendment does not change current law; it allows the \nexisting generous subsidies to continue through the year 2000. The \namendment merely ensures that the subsidies do expire and are not \nextended for another 7 years.\n  Mr. President, let me just take a moment and try to explain why we \nhave such generous ethanol subsidies in law today. The rationale for \nethanol subsidies has changed over the years, but unfortunately, \nethanol has never lived up to the claims of any of its diverse \nproponents.\n  In the late 1970's, during the energy crisis, ethanol was supposed to \nhelp the U.S. lessen its reliance on oil. But ethanol use never took \noff, even when gasoline prices were highest and lines were longest.\n  Then, in the early 1980's, ethanol subsidies were used to prop up \nAmerica's struggling corn farmers. Unfortunately, the usual trickle \ndown effect of agricultural subsidies is clearly evident. Beef and \ndairy farmers, for example, have to pay a higher price for feed corn, \nwhich is then passed on in the form of higher prices for meat and milk. \nThe average consumer ends up paying the cost of ethanol subsidies in \nthe grocery store.\n  By the late 1980's, ethanol became the environmentally correct \nalternative fuel. Unfortunately, the Department of Energy has provided \nstatistics showing that it takes more energy to produce a gallon of \nethanol than the amount of energy that gallon of ethanol contains. In \naddition, the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and the Department of Energy all acknowledge that the \nenvironmental benefits of ethanol use, at least in terms of smog \nreduction, are yet unproven.\n  In addition, ethanol is an inefficient, expensive fuel. Just look at \nthe 3- to 5-cent-per-gallon increase in gasoline prices during the \nwinter months in the Washington, D.C. area when ethanol is required to \nbe added to the fuel.\n  Finally, let me quote Stephen Moore, of the CATO Institute, who puts \nit very succinctly in a recent paper:\n\n       * * * [V]irtually every independent assessment--by the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture, the General Accounting Office, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, NBC News and several academic \n     journals--has concluded that ethanol subsidies have been a \n     costly boondoggle with almost no public benefit.\n\n  So why do we continue to subsidize the ethanol industry? I think \nJames Bovard of the CATO Institute put it best in a 1995 policy paper:\n\n       * * * [O]ne would be hard-pressed to find another industry \n     as artificially sustained as the ethanol industry. The \n     economics of ethanol are such that, for the industry to \n     survive at all, massive trade protection, tax loopholes, \n     contrived mandates for use, and production subsidies are \n     vitally necessary. Only by spooking the public with bogey-men \n     such as foreign oil sheiks, toxic air pollution, and the \n     threatened disappearance of the American farmer can attention \n     be deflected from the real costs of the ethanol house of \n     cards that consumes over a billion dollars annually.\n\n  Mr. President, the House Ways and Means Committee took a bold step \nand included in its revenue reconciliation bill a phase-out of ethanol \nsubsidies. In the report accompanying the bill, the Committee stated:\n\n       [Ethanol tax subsidies] were assumed to be temporary \n     measures that would allow these fuels to become economical \n     without permanent Federal subsidies. Nearly 20 years have \n     passed since that enactment, and neither the projected prices \n     of oil nor the ability of ethanol to be a viable fuel without \n     Federal subsidies has been realized. The Committee \n     determined, therefore, that enactment of an orderly \n     termination of this Federal subsidy program is appropriate at \n     this time.\n\n  And what does the Senate Finance Committee say to support its \ndecision to extend the ethanol subsidies beyond their current \nexpiration date? Listen to this:\n\n       The Committee believes that continued assurance of tax \n     benefits for ethanol are [sic] an important signal to \n     encourage the use of alternative fuels.\n\n  I commend Chairman Bill Archer for his decision to try to phase out \nethanol subsidies. The provision in the House bill would have saved \nalmost $250 million in the next three years. Unfortunately, I \nunderstand the provision will be removed from the House bill because of \nopposition in the ethanol industry. I am very disappointed that the \nHouse is taking this step back from ending ethanol subsidies.\n  Mr. President, we should end these subsidies. We cannot afford to \nsubsidize the ethanol industry at a time when we are struggling with \nthe dilemma of balancing the budget while maintaining our commitments \nto our senior citizens, taking care of our poor and disadvantaged \ncitizens, and ensuring a healthy and secure future for our children.\n  Current law terminates ethanol subsidies after the year 2000. This \namendment would avoid the $3.8 billion cost of extending the ethanol \nsubsidies. I urge my colleagues to oppose changing current law and \nadopt my amendment to strike Section 707 from the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds and then yield to \nthe Senator from Iowa. This provision has worked and is creating jobs--\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we must have order.\n  Mr. KERREY. This provision has worked. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the motion to strike. It has created jobs and has been good for \nthe environment and promoted alternative fuel in the agriculture \ncommunity, and we have long-term contracts that individuals have taken \nout to build the plants. I hope my colleagues vote against this \nprovision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, look at how wrong the argument of the \nSenator from Arizona is, that when a consumer doesn't pay a gasoline \ntax, it turns out to be a subsidy to an industry. How wrong that \nargument can be. This is not a subsidy to any industry. If this \namendment passes, after the year 2000 the consumers of America are \ngoing to pay more gas tax on that portion of their gasoline that is \nethanol. This is good for the environment and good for agriculture. It \nis good for jobs in the cities--195,000 jobs. It is good for energy \nindependence and everything. It is good, good, good.\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator McCain's \namendment to the Revenue Reconciliation Act that would eliminate the \ntax exemption for ethanol in the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to stand in opposition of this amendment. \nOver the past 3 years, we have been deluged with a deliberate \nmisinformation campaign regarding the impact of the domestic ethanol \nindustry. The partial excise tax exemption gasoline marketers receive \nfor blending their fuel with ethanol has been disparagingly labeled \ncorporate welfare. This label patently ignores the important public \nbenefits that result from the production and use of fuel ethanol. I \nthought I would share some of the relevant facts.\n  Ethanol production stimulates the economy in rural America. As a \nresult of progressive policymakers, ethanol is now produced in 53 \nplants in 19 States. The production of fuel ethanol results in more \nthan 55,000 high-wage jobs, generates greater than $2.1 billion in \nhousehold income, and adds more than $7.2 billion to the economy every \nyear. Farmers will receive an additional $2.2 billion each year because \nof ethanol production. Moreover, nearly all new expansion in the \nethanol industry has been completed by farmer-owned cooperatives. The \nDepartment of Agriculture estimates that a 100 million gallon ethanol \nplant will add 2,250 jobs to a community--enhancing rural development \nand expansion. In short, the ethanol industry is an economic engine \ndriving investment and opportunities across rural America.\n  Ethanol promotes competition and reduces consumer gasoline costs. \nEthanol extends gasoline supplies, provides a valuable source of octane \nfor independent gasoline marketers, assures competition in the \noxygenate market for refiners trying to meet Clean Air Act standards, \nand reduces consumer costs of gasoline. As noted by the Society of \nIndependent Gasoline Marketers of America:\n\n       The federal benefits afforded ethanol-blended fuels have \n     been an important, pro-competitive influence on the nation's \n     gasoline markets. By enhancing the ability of independent \n     marketers to price-compete with their integrated oil company \n     competitors, this program has increased independent \n     marketers' economic viability and reduced consumers' costs of \n     gasoline.\n\n  Recognizing the competitive benefits of fuel ethanol in the market, \nCitizen Action, the Nation's largest consumer organization and strong \nsupporter of the ethanol tax incentive, recently stated:\n\n       The use of ethanol, a domestically produced, cleaner-\n     burning renewable fuel helps American consumers use less \n     polluting oil and reduces dependence on costly oil imports, \n     which are in part subsidized by huge foreign tax credits.\n\n  Ethanol improves the U.S. trade balance. Ethanol competes with MTBE, \na methanol-derived oxygenate, as an octane--oxygenate--additive. \nImports of MTBE have risen from just 30 million gallons in 1992 to more \nthan 700 million gallons last year, or about 25 percent of domestic \nconsumption. By displacing the demand for MTBE that would be necessary \nwithout ethanol, the U.S. trade imbalance is reduced by approximately \n$1.3 billion annually. But the trade implications of ethanol do not end \nthere. The majority of the coproducts of ethanol production--corn \ngluten feed and corn gluten meal--are exported, further reducing the \ntrade deficit by earning over $800 million annually. The net effect is \na benefit to the U.S. trade imbalance of over $2 billion each year.\n  Ethanol helps reduce air pollution. Ethanol adds oxygen to gasoline \nwhich reduces exhaust emissions of ozone-forming VOC's and carbon \nmonoxide. It is widely used in reformulated gasolines currently being \nsold in ozone nonattainment areas across the country. Because ethanol \nadds octane to gasoline, it also reduces the use of other highly toxic \npetroleum-derived octanes, such as benzene, toluene and xylene.\n  Ethanol enhances our national security. This Nation spends billions \nof dollars to protect our oil interests around the world. It is \nconsiderably less costly to defend the corn fields of the Dakotas than \nit is to defend foreign oil fields.\n  Ethanol is good for agriculture. It is good for rural America. It is \ngood for the environment. It reduces our dependance on foreign oil. The \nbottom line is that the Federal tax structure for ethanol deserves our \ncontinued support. I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be inserted in \nthe appropriate place in the Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In my State that \nmeans 27 percent of the families in my State who are working very hard \nwill not be able to keep the full amount of this credit.\n  I know this has been considered carefully. But I feel compelled to \noffer this amendment today. I know that in this bill we are giving tax \nrelief to many Americans. I believe that these Americans should have \nthe opportunity to keep the full $500 tax credit. I ask my colleagues \nto give favorable consideration. It is budget neutral.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, much to my colleague's surprise, there is \nvery serious opposition.\n  I hope we can vote this down by a voice vote.\n  This amendment would add outlays and increase Uncle Sam's writing of \nchecks for the first 5 years of $9 billion and over 10 years of $19 \nbillion. And this amendment would say that we stack these in order that \npeople get the income education credit, the wage credit, and the tax \ncredit that we are adding to the bill and the EIC. And on top of that, \nfor a family with two children already gets $3,680. Uncle Sam will \nwrite the check. We would also give $1,000 on top of it.\n  I want to raise a point of order.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, in this budget agreement some of us thought \nthere was too much spending and not enough tax relief. We find that \nthere are even more spending proposals and less tax relief than we \nthought. This point of order is directed at spending on Amtrak in \naddition to other things. There is $2.3 billion being spent out of the \ntax cut section going to Amtrak. I join my colleague from Arizona in \nasking that these matters be referred to the authorization for Amtrak \nand urge that the point of order be sustained.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the oversight committee, I \nwant my colleagues to be clear about what is happening. This bill takes \n$2.3 billion out of the tax relief promised the American people and \nplaces it into a trust fund to further subsidize Amtrak. These funds \nwould be appropriated outside of the existing budget caps ensuring that \nAmtrak would not have to compete with other transportation priorities \nsuch as highways or aviation.\n  Mr. President, I raise the point of order that section 702(d) of the \nbill violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Budget Act, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is nothing to ask for them on yet.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, at the completion of my remarks I yield 10 \nseconds to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  There is no truth that this has any impact on tax cuts. The important \npoint to understand is that this point of order is to kill Amtrak.\n  This is very important, both to Senator Moynihan and to myself. \nPassenger rail is extremely important to the entire country. What we \nhave done is fully paid for. We do not ask for any special treatment. \nThe rail fund is consistent with the budget resolution agreed to by \nboth Chambers. It has the support of Senator Domenici and Senator \nLautenberg. GAO has testified that Amtrak will not survive past 1998 \nwithout this crucial funding.\n  We could not wait any longer. I first wanted to say, I therefore ask \nfor your votes to this point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was going to answer the McCain question, but he did \nnot have one. Let me just say this is provided for in the budget \nresolution. The way it is handled, it is totally deficit-neutral. If \nthe money is not used for Amtrak, we are ahead of the game. If it is \nused, it is totally neutral. We have done this about 10 times \nheretofore in budget reconciliation and budget resolutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I strongly support the provisions within \nthis bill establishing a Rail Trust Fund, and oppose this point of \norder. Let me first state my view that these provisions do not violate \nthe spirit of the Byrd rule, which is intended to prevent unrelated \nauthorization bills from being brought into the reconciliation process. \nSection 702 of this bill, which establishes an Intercity Passenger Rail \nFund, is primarily tax legislation, which most certainly belongs on \nlegislation entitled ``The Tax Fairness Bill''.\n  Establishment of a trust fund is a critical element in providing \npassenger rail with a stable, predictable source of revenue so that \nAmtrak can achieve financial viability and effectively serve millions \nof Americans.\n  It is certainly no secret that Amtrak is in serious financial \ntrouble. Earlier this year, the GAO continued a regular series of \nwarnings in testifying to the Finance Committee on the precarious \nfinancial condition of the railroad. Amtrak President Tom Downs also \nconfirmed to us that his railroad is in difficult shape. A number of \nStates and communities have already felt the brunt of the railroad's \nfinancial predicament as often vital rail service has been \ndiscontinued.\n  There are several factors contributing to Amtrak's condition, but \nprimarily it is a result of outdated laws governing Amtrak's operation, \nas well as inadequate and inconsistent support from the Federal \nGovernment. Whatever the cause, I think we can all agree that Amtrak \nsimply cannot continue to operate under the status quo.\n  Amtrak's financial predicament has resulted in calls to end all \nFederal support for intercity passenger rail--there are those who would \njust throw up our hands in frustration and walk away. Mr. President, I \nam one who does not question the need for a Federal investment in \npassenger rail. The absence of passenger rail would clog our highways \nand airports--an additional 7,500 fully-booked 757's, or hundreds of \nthousands of cars, would be needed between Washington, DC, and New York \nevery year.\n  All major industrialized nations provide subsidies to passenger rail, \nusually to a greater extent than our Government's support for Amtrak. \nIn fact, Amtrak covers more of its operating costs--an estimated 84 \npercent--than any other passenger railroad in the world. Nonetheless, \nAmtrak operates the only mode of transportation in the United States \nwhich does not have a dedicated source of funding.\n  So the question before the Senate today is how best to provide needed \nFederal support for Amtrak's critical capital investment needs. After \nyears of congressional hearings, GAO reports and strategic plans, I and \nmany of my colleagues have concluded that dedicating a portion of the \nFederal gas tax to a Rail Trust Fund is the most appropriate and \nreliable means of ensuring that passenger rail can continue to meet \nAmerica's transportation needs. Such a solution provides passenger rail \nwith the same type of Federal support for capital improvements that \nother modes of transportation have enjoyed for years.\n  This bill's creation of an Intercity Passenger Rail Fund financed by \none-half cent of the gas tax, coupled with the needed operating reforms \ncontained within the Amtrak authorization bill introduced by the \nSenator from Texas, will allow Amtrak to operate more like a business, \nend its reliance on Federal operating subsidies, and thus better serve \nAmerica's transportation needs.\n  At least for the 3\\1/2\\ years that this Trust Fund is financed, we \nwill start on the path to financial stability and end the annual \nfinancial roller coaster to which Amtrak is subjected. It would also \navoid a catastrophic shutdown of Amtrak, which has recently been \nestimated to cost upwards of $5 billion dollars.\n  Mr. President, Amtrak has presented to Congress a responsible 6-year \nstrategic business plan which outlines how financial viability will be \nrestored to the railroad. Amtrak's President Tom Downs deserves our \npraise for the monumental efforts he has undertaken to turn things \naround at his company. Congress should do its part and join him by \nproviding a relatively modest Federal investment in passenger rail. I \nurge my colleagues to support this motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move this point of order be waived, both for now and for \nthe conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 400, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . CERTAIN MINERALS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PERCENTAGE \n                   DEPLETION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 613(b)(1) (relating to percentage \n     depletion rates) is amended--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and uranium''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``asbestos,'', \n     ``lead,'', and ``mercury,''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 613(b)(3)(A) is amended by inserting ``other \n     than lead, mercury, or uranium'' after ``metal mines''.\n       (2) Section 613(b)(4) is amended by striking ``asbestos (if \n     paragraph (1)(B) does not apply),''.\n       (3) Section 613(b)(7) is amended by striking ``or'' at the \n     end of subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end of \n     subparagraph (C) and inserting ``, or'', and by inserting \n     after subparagraph (C) the following:\n       ``(D) mercury, uranium, lead, and asbestos.''\n       (4) Section 613(c)(4)(D) is amended by striking ``lead,'' \n     and ``uranium,''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1996.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates percentage \ndepletion allowances for four mined substances--asbestos, lead, \nmercury, and uranium--and it saves an estimated $83 million over 5 \nyears.\n  Unlike depreciation or cost depletion, percentage depletion allows \ncompanies to deduct far more than their actual costs. This results in a \ngenerous loophole for the company and an expensive subsidy for the \ntaxpayer. But it gets worse, Mr. President.\n  While we spend millions subsidizing corporations to mine these toxic \nsubstances, we spend even more on their downstream public health and \nenvironmental consequences.\n  So, as the senior Senator from Arkansas says, this subsidy gives \ncorporate welfare a bad name.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this provision, and I \nyield the remainder of my time in deference to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition in opposition? The \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it seems to me we have had enough fun now. \nI think we ought to reject this amendment and get on with final passage \nof this bill.\n  This is a tax cut. This is not a place to change the way we do \naccounting for mining. If you go out and find a body of ore, you don't \nhave an investment you made in a piece of equipment. You have the asset \nthat you are depleting as you produce it.\n  Every developed nation in the world has depletion allowance, because \nthey want to produce the riches of their lands. This is a bad amendment \nand ought to be rejected.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane to the \nprovisions of the reconciliation measure. I, therefore, raise a point \nof order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. NICKLES. There wasn't a second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in my home state of \nNorth Carolina.\n  In 1982, the Congress passed legislation to allow Indian tribes to \nissue tax exempt bonds, just like other units of government. The \nlegislation recognized the rights of the tribes and confirmed their \nparallel rights to States, counties, and cities.\n  The 1982 act thus acknowledged just what most of us knew: that Indian \ntribes are legitimate units of government with wide-ranging \nresponsibilities.\n  Using the act, the Cherokee Indians in my State issued $31 million in \ntax-exempt bonds to purchase the Carolina Mirror Co. The tribal \nleadership viewed the purchase of Carolina Mirror Co. as a means to \npromote jobs and economic development for their tribe and its members. \nThe Cherokee have faced some tough times over the years. The Carolina \nMirror Co. purchase was a way to invest in the future of their tribe \nand their people.\n  Carolina Mirror today is the largest manufacturer of mirrors in the \nNation. It employees over 500 people. It is an economic engine. It \nproduces jobs and hope for a people that have seen little of both over \nthe years.\n  In 1986, however, the Congress passed new legislation that narrowed \nthe interpretation of the original 1982 act. It changed the act so that \ntax-exempt bonds could only be used to finance ``essential government \nfunctions.''\n  Mr. President, as you know, interest rates are at historically low \nlevels. I know that not enough of us have ever been in business and met \na payroll, as I have for the past 50 years. Well, interest rates are \nthe difference between profitability and bankruptcy, between jobs for \nthe community and a lock on the factory gate. Needless to say, the \nCherokees are eager to take advantage of lower interest rates and to \nrefinance these bonds.\n  The interest rate on these bonds is so high that the Carolina Mirror \nCo. literally spends almost all of its profits on interest payments. \nThis is devastating for the company.\n  When the company attempted to reissue the bonds, however, some IRS \nbureaucrat stepped away from the water cooler long enough to say \n``no.'' The great minds at the IRS ruled that a refinancing constituted \na reissuance and stopped the tribe from its plans to refinance these \nhigh interest bonds.\n  By reissuing bonds at a lower rate, the company could save nearly a \nmillion dollars a year, but the IRS does not look at the situation. The \n500 jobs do not matter. The investment of the Cherokees in the company \ndoes not matter. No, all that matters is that we follow the mindless \ndictate of an unelected, unaccountable bureaucrat holed up in a Federal \noffice building waiting for the 4 o'clock vanpool back to the suburbs. \nThe outside world is irrelevant. The real jobs of real people are \nirrelevant.\n  The amendment that I offer today is a technical bill to allow Indian \ntribes to refinance tax-exempt bonds issued on or before October 13, \n1997. This bill has a very narrow application. In fact, I introduced \nthis bill last year as S. 1676. The Joint Committee on Taxation said \nlast year--and again this year--that this bill will have a ``negligible \neffect on budget receipts.''\n  Let's do the right thing for the Cherokees. Let's tell the IRS that \nAmerican jobs matter and the Congress stands behind the working men and \nwomen of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this amendment corrects a serious problem \nCongress created in 1987 when the definition for ``essential government \nfunctions'' was inadvertently changed relating to native American \ntribes, thereby inhibiting the tribes' use of tax-exempt bonds. Prior \nto 1987, the Cherokee Tribe and other tribes used tax-exempt bonds to \nfinance ``essential government functions.'' In 1986, the Eastern Band \nof Cherokee Indians, in western North Carolina, used this provision to \npurchase the Carolina Mirror Co. to ensure the Cherokee Tribe's long-\nterm economic development. The Cherokees worked hard and built Carolina \nMirror into the largest producer of mirrors in the United States.\n  Then, Congress changed the rules in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \nAct of 1987, and narrowed the definition of ``essential government \nfunctions'', and today Carolina Mirror is in default and may be forced \nto close its Texas operation because of a staggering monthly obligation \nof $300,000. This amendment would allow these hard-working native \nAmericans to refinance their current bonds at more competitive rates. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation asserts that this purely technical \namendment will have a ``negligible effect on the Federal fiscal year \nbudget receipts.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 587\n\n  (Purpose: Relating to repeal of bad debt reserve method for thrift \n                         savings associations)\n\n       At the end of title VII, insert:\n\n     SEC.   .

I have at the desk amendment No. 577. I ask that the \nclerk call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself, Mr. \n     Brownback, and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered \n     577.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, let me briefly explain what this amendment \nis all about. This is an amendment in which we address the indexing of \ncapital gains. When we index capital gains, what we are talking about \nis protecting long-term investors from taxation on inflationary gains. \nThis helps the family business, the family farm, and the family ranch. \nIt is the family and the average American out there who owns a capital \nasset.\n  Specifically, what the amendment does is--it is pretty much the same \nindexing provision that was reported out of the House except that it \ndelays the implementation of it to 2002. The holding period of the \nproperty would change from 3 to 5 years.\n  Just briefly, there are two other very important points that I would \nlike to make about this particular amendment.\n  It is revenue neutral over 10 years, as scored by the Joint Committee \non Taxation; and, No. 2, it is germane, and in fact it does blend \nwithin the current language of the bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition in opposition?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Colorado on \noffering this amendment. It is unfortunate that I must vote against it.\n  The Senator may not be aware of this, but in 1993 I introduced a bill \nthat called for the indexing of capital assets. But today, we are not \nonly dealing with economic issues, President Clinton has said he will \nveto any tax bill that includes indexing of capital gains.\n  I have an article from last Thursday's Wall Street Journal. The title \nof the article is ``Clinton Rules Out Indexing of Capital Gains in Tax \nBill.'' The first paragraph says the President ``will not sign a tax \nbill that includes indexing of capital gains for inflation.''\n  We have a historic opportunity today to deliver badly needed tax cuts \nto Americans.

This has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. The \namendment corrects a minor drafting error in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 591) was agreed to.\n\n\n                   QUALIFIED TUITION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today in \nsupport of the tuition savings provision included in this bill. I \nbelieve the Finance Committee has done a thorough job providing broad \nincentives to help families save and provide for the education of their \nchildren.\n  I commend Senator Roth and the Finance Committee for their efforts to \ninclude many of the provisions in S. 594, the College Savings Act. The \nFinance Committee has included language to make earnings in qualified \ntuition savings plans exempt from taxation as well as expanding the \ndefinition of qualified education costs to include room and board. Once \nimplemented this legislation will reward all families who plan ahead \nand save for a child's education.\n  For the past several years, I have worked hard to make college more \naffordable by helping families who save. In both the 103d and 104th \nCongresses, I introduced legislation to make earnings invested in \nState-sponsored tuition savings plans exempt from Federal taxation. \nStates have also recognized the needs of families and have provided \nincentives for them to save or prepay their children's education. State \nsavings plans provide families a safe, affordable, and disciplined \nmeans of paying for their children's education.\n  Last year, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to \nfamilies investing in these programs. The provisions contained in the \nSmall Business Job Protection Act of 1996 clarified the tax treatment \nof both the State-sponsored tuition savings plans and the participants' \ninvestment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has \nhampered the effectiveness of these State-sponsored programs and helped \nfamilies who are trying to save for their children's education.\n  Mr. President, this action is long overdue. We have ignored the needs \nof middle-class families who have seen their income hold steady, while \ntuition costs go through the roof. According to the GAO, tuition at a \n4-year university rose 234 percent between 1980-94.\n  During this same period, median household income rose 84 percent and \nthe consumer price index rose a mere 74 percent. The College Board \nreports that tuition costs for the 1996-97 school year will rise 5 \npercent while average room and board costs will rise between 4 to 6 \npercent. While education costs have moderated throughout the 1990's, \nthey continue to outstrip the gains in income. Tuition has now become \nthe greatest barrier to attendance.\n  Due to the rising cost of education, more and more families have come \nto rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of \nall college students accept some amount of financial assistance. In \n1995, $50 billion in financial aid was available to students from \nFederal, State, and institutional sources. This was $3 billion higher \nthan the previous year. A majority of this increase has come in the \nform of loans, which now make up the largest portion of the total \nFederal-aid package at 57 percent. Grants, which a decade ago made up \n49 percent of assistance, have been reduced to 42 percent. This shift \ntoward loans further burden students and families with additional \ninterest costs. It is important that we not forget that compound \ninterest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace with \ntuition increases while putting a little away at a time. By borrowing, \nstudents must bear added interest costs that add thousands to the total \ncost of tuition.\n  State-sponsored tuition savings plans have pioneered efforts to \nprovide families with opportunities to save as a hedge against tuition \ninflation. States have established affordable tuition investment plans \nthat guarantee parents a minimum level of investment return or \nguarantee a future education at today's prices. Such guarantees offer \nmiddle-class families the piece of mind that their children will be \nable to meet the tuition obligation and reduce the need to take on \nthousands of dollars in loans.\n  States like Michigan, Florida, Ohio, and Kentucky were the first \nprograms to be started in order to help families save for college. \nToday, there are 15 States with programs in operation. An additional 4 \nStates will implement their programs this year. Also, I am informed by \nthe college savings network that every other State, except Georgia, \nwhich has implemented the HOPE Scholarship Program, is preparing \nlegislation or is studying a proposal to help their residents save for \ncollege. Today, there are 730,000 participants contributing over $3.23 \nbillion to education savings nationwide. By year end, the college \nsavings plan network estimates that they will have 1 million \nparticipants. By 2006, they estimate that over $6 billion will be \ninvested in State-sponsored programs.\n  Kentucky established its plan in 1988 to provide residents with an \naffordable means of saving for college. Today, 2,602 Kentucky \nparticipants have contributed over $5 million toward their children's \neducation. I am confident with passage of this language these programs \nwill grow dramatically.\n  Many Kentuckians are drawn to this program because it offers a low-\ncost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average monthly \ncontribution in Kentucky is just $49. This proposal rewards those who \nare serious about their future and are committed over the long-term to \nthe education of their children by exempting all interest earnings from \nState taxes. It is also important to note that 58 percent of the \nparticipants earn under $60,000 per year. Clearly, this benefits \nmiddle-class families.\n  Mr. President, the Finance Committee has expanded the language to \npermit private nonprofit colleges to establish their own tuition \nsavings plans as well as establishing education IRA's. This will ensure \nthat all families have an opportunity to save. This legislation also \nallows individuals who invested in Savings Bonds to roll them over into \nthe qualified State plan. This is a commonsense provision that will \ngive those who are already saving the flexibility to invest in prepaid \nplans if available.\n  It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and \naffordable education system for everyone. We need to decide on how we \nwill spend our limited Federal resources to ensure that both access and \nquality are maintained. It is unrealistic to assume that the Government \ncan afford to provide Federal assistance for everyone. However, at a \nmodest cost, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. \nThis reduces the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden \nfuture generations with thousands of dollars in loans.\n  Let me close by saying that I commend the work of Senator Graham and \nhis staff on the issue of tuition savings. His cooperation and hard \nwork have ensured that this issue enjoys bipartisan support. I would \nalso like to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for all his \nefforts in making education savings the cornerstone of this package.\n\n\n    extending the small blenders ethanol tax credit to farmer-owned \n                              cooperatives\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the tax bill before us includes \nimportant tax incentives for the use of ethanol. These tax incentives \nhave been critical to the growth of the ethanol industry, which in my \nState is monopolized by farmer-owned cooperatives. Farmer-owned coops \nare now the leading producers of ethanol. They make up 60 percent of \nthe ethanol facilities around the country. By year's end, nine plants \nwill be in operation in Minnesota, producing 126 million gallons \nannually and creating 500 new jobs. Overall, ethanol contributes \nbetween $109 and $260 million yearly to the State's economy. Currently, \n71 percent of the gas sold in Minnesota contains ethanol. By the end of \nthe year, 100 percent of the gas sold in Minnesota will be blended with \nethanol.\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\n  My concern today is with the small blenders tax credit. This income \ncredit is available to ethanol producers who produce no more than 30 \nmillion gallons annually; and, it is applied to the first 15 million \ngallons. That's great. Targeting the credit is what we should do. \nUnfortunately, the credit works in such a way that cooperatives fail to \nget any advantage from it.\n  I would like to ask that when the Senate Finance Committee and the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee conference on the two tax bills, that \nthey give serious consideration to changing the way the credit is \nstructured so that cooperatives, like all other ethanol producers, \nreceive the intended benefits of the small blenders tax credit. I \nappreciate the good efforts of my colleagues on this matter and hope \nthey will work with me to address this technical change in the small \nblenders tax credit when the committees conference on the tax bills.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois and know her commitment to the role \nof ethanol as an alternative fuel. I understand you have two farmer-\nowned cooperatives proposed for construction in Illinois?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The Senator is correct. The total investment is \n$92 million for both facilities with an expected capacity of 42 million \ngallons of ethanol annually. This is good for farmers and good for our \nrural communities. I fully support extending the small blender's tax \ncredit to these cooperatives, and I will urge conferees to support \nthis.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \nhighlighting the importance of farmer-owned coops in the production of \nethanol, and thank the Senator from Minnesota for his continued \nleadership on this issue. In Nebraska, two of the six ethanol \nproduction facilities are owned by farmer-owned cooperatives. These \nplants account for approximately one-third of the total amount of \nethanol produced in my State and directly employ over 300 Nebraskans. \nBy restructuring the small blenders credit, I am hopeful that not only \nwould we help the existing ethanol plants in Nebraska, but that we \nwould encourage other farmer-owned cooperatives to examine the \nopportunities for rural economic development provided by ethanol \nproduction.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues for their words of support and \nlook forward to working with them in the coming days to make this \nchange happen.\n\n\n                 Railroad Deficit Reduction Fuel Taxes\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Senator Roth, as I know you are aware, because of the \n1990 and 1993 Reconciliation Acts, our important freight railroads are \nforced to pay a 5.55 cents per gallon fuel tax into the General \nTreasury for deficit reduction. All other modes of transportation--\nhighway, air, water--only pay 4.3 cents per gallon for this purpose. \nThis is an obvious inequity. While reducing the Federal budget deficit \nis an important goal, if the transportation industry is to be singled \nout, the burden of achieving a balanced budget should be shared equally \namong all modes of transportation.\n  I am particularly concerned because S. 949 would transfer the deficit \nreduction taxes paid by highway users, including truckers which compete \nwith the railroads, into the Highway Trust Fund. Placing additional \nhighway deficit reduction fuel taxes into the Highway Trust Fund for \nhighway improvements would exacerbate the already inequitable \nsituation, placing the railroad industry at an even more unfair \ncompetitive disadvantage. In essence, the railroads would continue to \ncontribute to deficit reduction, while their competitors would instead \ncontribute to their own infrastructure.\n  The House has similarly proposed putting the aviation fuel taxes into \nthe Airport and Aviation Trust Fund for airport infrastructure \nimprovements as part of its tax reconciliation legislation.\n  This injustice against America's railroads must be remedied at our \nearliest opportunity. I would ask the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee if he would be willing to seek a solution to this \nrailroad deficit reduction fuel tax problem during the conference with \nthe House on tax reconciliation legislation.\n  Mr. ROTH. I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island \nbringing this matter to the attention of the Senate, and yes I am aware \nof this clear inequity to the railroads. This certainly should be \nremedied at our earliest opportunity, and I will seek an appropriate \nsolution as we consider the treatment of deficit reduction fuel taxes \nduring the conference with the House on this tax legislation. If we are \nunable to craft a solution to this problem on this bill, I will \ncertainly strive for a solution as part of the upcoming ISTEA \nreauthorization legislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to thank Senator Roth for his commitment to \nexpeditiously find a solution to this problem.\n\n\n        let us not forget about the u.s. citizens of puerto rico\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to state, on behalf of \nSenators Breaux, Graham, Kerrey, Chafee, and myself, that none of the \ntax relief measures and growth incentives contained in this tax bill \nwill have a positive impact on the 3.8 million American citizens of \nPuerto Rico. This result is unfair and should be corrected. The \nIsland's economy has paid dearly as a result of provisions in the tax \nbills of 1993 and 1996, as revenue offsets from Puerto Rico in those \nbills exceed $14 billion in the next few years. Yet those bills \nprovided no benefits to our Puerto Rican citizens.\n  Members from both sides of the aisle, Governors, national \norganizations, business associations, Hispanic-American groups and the \nentire Puerto Rican political community, have united forces in seeking \na sensible Federal economic development tool in section 30A. This would \nprovide viable pro growth tax incentives which will keep the Puerto \nRican economy on a path of sustained growth. We should expand and \nextend this economic activity credit which is wage-based and promoted \njobs and investment. We would urge my colleagues to correct this \nunfairness in Conference. If this is not possible, we will work to \ninclude this measure in legislation that comes before us at the next \npossible opportunity.\n\n\nprovide tax incentives to encourage property owners to preserve habitat \n                              for species\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, it was my intention to introduce today \nan amendment to provide three new tax incentives for private property \nowners who want to conserve land for the preservation of endangered, \nthreatened, and other species. But the amendments were subject to \npoints of order because they did not have accompanying offsets. Rather \nthan have the amendments lose on a parliamentary procedure, I have \naccepted Chairman Roth's offer to work on these issues in conference. \nFor too long, the Federal Government has relied almost exclusively on \nregulatory mandates and enforcement to preserve habitat for endangered \nspecies. That approach has failed to produce the kind of results we \nwant. If we're serious about preserving our rare and unique species, \nand their habitat, we must make it easier for people to purchase and \nset aside land for species.\n  The amendment would have consisted of three provisions. The first \nprovision would have provided an additional 25 percent exclusion from \ncapital gains associated with the sale of property so long as the \nproperty is transferred to a qualified organization for conservation \npurposes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I agree with Senator Kempthorne's philosophy that \nconservation benefits us all as a nation. In fact, I included a \nconservation easement provision in my chairman's mark.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The second incentive would have provided property \nowners an exclusion from estate taxes for property that is set aside in \na conservation easement.\n  Over the past few years, as I've been working on legislation to \nreauthorize the Endangered Species Act, I've met with a number of \nfarmers and ranchers and other property owners, many of whom own large \ntracts of land that they are willing to set aside in conservation \neasements to benefit species. But they are worried about the tax burden \nthat they will leave behind for their children if they do that.\n  Mr. ROTH. My chairman's mark includes a provision consistent with my \ncolleague's goals. The mark would allow a portion of the value of land\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nsubject to a qualified conservation easement to be excluded from the \ngross estate. This conservation easement is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. My amendment would have allowed property owners who \ngrant conservation easements to exclude the value of property from \nestate tax. That would make it easier for families to keep their \nproperty intact and at the same time will benefit endangered and other \nspecies by preserving habitat for them.\n  My third incentive would have allowed property owners to donate land \nfor conservation purposes to take an enhanced deduction based on the \nfull market value of their property. This will provide an important \nincentive for property owners who have land or water that provide \nhabitat for endangered and other species to preserve that habitat.\n  Over the past 3 years, I've met with many property owners who have \nsaid, ``we would be happy to step forward and preserve habitat for \nspecies and we would grant a conservation easement if there was an \nincentive.'' Well, this will provide that incentive.\n  Mr. ROTH. Under our current tax law, a deduction is allowed for \ncontributions of a qualified conservation easement to a qualified \norganization.\n  The goal of my colleagues' amendments are well taken and deserve this \nNation's serious consideration.\n  I will work with you in conference on these worthy goals because I \nshare your commitment to saving endangered species, and using \nincentives to accomplish this goal.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the chairman. I appreciate his willingness to \nwork with me on these important amendments to include them in the final \nbill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nRevenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. First, I would like to commend the \nFinance Committee on the job it has done. Chairman Roth and Senator \nMoynihan should be praised for their efforts to craft a bipartisan \nbill, something that the House clearly failed to achieve in its tax-\nwriting committee.\n  The Finance bill contains many good measures, including a $500-per-\nchild tax credit, which brings much needed relief to working Americans. \nThis bill provides tax relief for higher education, making college more \naccessible to millions of Americans. The underlying bill also expands \nIndividual Retirement Accounts helping many Americans to meet the \nfinancial demands of raising a family and planning for retirement. The \nbill before us today also recognizes the importance providing tax \nrelief for businesses by extending the research tax credit for 31 \nmonths, encouraging more investments in research and development.\n  In addition, the Finance bill provides funding for Amtrak, and \ncreates an inner-city passenger rail fund that would help finance \nimprovements in public transportation. This bill facilitates \nenvironmental cleanup efforts in many urban and rural areas, helping to \nmake our country a healthier place to live.\n  While I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues who worked so hard to \ncraft a bipartisan tax relief bill, I am concerned that this measure \nmisses opportunities to provide meaningful tax relief for American \nfamilies. During Senate consideration, I voted for a number of \namendments to make this bill more equitable. Some of these amendments \nsucceeded. Many did not.\n  In particular, I was pleased when my colleagues accepted my amendment \nconcerning student loan forgiveness for people who choose a career in \ncommunity service and public sector work. This amendment will help us \nto deal with the growing problem of student indebtedness.\n  I also supported the Nickles amendment to extend self-employment \nhealth insurance deductibility to 100 percent. This measure will prove \nextremely helpful to self-employed business men and women.\n  I was also pleased to support the Kohl amendment which creates a tax \nincentive for businesses to provide child care for employees.\n  Each of these amendments make this bill better for American families. \nRegrettably, other amendments that would have strengthened this bill \ndid not succeed.\n  Most notably, I, along with my colleague from Vermont Senator \nJeffords, offered an amendment that would have increased the child tax \ncredit for most families by making it refundable for the many low-\nincome families with little or no tax liability. It is a fair and \nequitable measure, one that would have tremendously helped our working \nfamilies, and I am disappointed that this amendment failed.\n  In addition, the Daschle amendment would have invested an additional \n$10 billion in education and more in the child tax credit. \nUnfortunately, this amendment was defeated.\n  Finally, my colleague from Massachusetts Senator Kerry offered his \nown amendment to make the $500-per-child tax credit refundable against \npayroll taxes, a measure that would have brought much needed relief to \nmany working Americans struggling to raise a family. Once again, an \nopportunity to make tax relief more equitable was defeated.\n  Despite my reservations about this bill, and my disappointment in the \nfailure of several amendments, I am encouraged by the fact that today, \non the floor of the United States Senate, we came together in a \nbipartisan manner to enact tax relief to millions of American families. \nI hope that the conference committee will report a bill that is both \nfair and equitable, benefitting working families, small businesses and \nfamily farms.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is imperative that during the conference \nnegotiations, we remain committed to preserving the integrity of the \nbalanced budget agreement. The American people will not be served by a \nbudget that achieves balance briefly in 2002 and then veers back out of \nbalance afterward.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of Senators \ntoday in supporting the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. It brings \nus much closer to enacting legislation easing the tax burden which \nweighs heavily on too many Americans.\n\n\n                           Pension Provisions\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to offer my support for the \npension provisions which are contained in the tax bill we are \nconsidering today. As a result of the bipartisan cooperation which has \nbeen demonstrated throughout this process, many American workers will \nmove closer to a secure retirement. These provisions help a broad \nspectrum of workers and employers, and will contribute toward making \npensions more available, equitable, portable and simpler.\n  First, the provisions will expand coverage among workers at small \nbusinesses.\n  The statistics concerning the lack of retirement coverage among small \nbusiness workers are astounding. According to the Small Business \nAdministration, only 13 percent of workers in businesses with less than \n20 employees have pension plans and only 38 percent of workers in \nbusinesses employing between 21 and 100 employees currently have plans.\n  Two provisions in this bill will address this problem. This bill will \nencourage even the smallest of small businesses to help their employees \nsave for retirement through IRA payroll deductions. These payroll \ndeductions are the easiest way for workers to save for their \nretirement. This bill clarifies that if a small business man or woman \npermits IRA payroll deductions, they will not be threatened with \nliability under ERISA.\n  Small businesses will also be encouraged to establish pension plans \nby allowing partners and self-employed individuals to receive matching \ncontributions under the same rules applicable to incorporated \nbusinesses. More small business owners will establish retirement plans \nbecause of this change.\n  Second, this bill will help women. Although women are entering the \nwork force at a larger rate than ever before, 25 million working women \nstill do not have pension plans--this represents nearly 3 out of every \n5 women who work in the private sector. Of these 25 million women, 12 \nmillion are employed by small businesses.\n  Unfortunately, many of these working women have no pension plan. Many \nof these women would like to make contributions to an IRA, but cannot \nbecause their husband participates in an employee-sponsored retirement \nplan and tax law says that she cannot make\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\na deductible contribution to an IRA because his participation is \nattributed to her.\n\n  The Finance Committee bill eliminates a spouse's participation from \nthe considerations relevant to contributing to a deductible IRA. With \nthis provision, all Americans--working women, working men, and \nhomemakers--will now have the opportunity to save, regardless of their \nspouse's participation in a retirement plan.\n  Because of our bipartisan work on this issue, Susan Stratton of \nTallahassee, FL, will be able to begin contributing to her retirement \nwhile her husband Charles continues contributing to his corporate plan.\n  Susan is the owner of Care Packages, Inc., and will be able to save \n$2,000 per year in an IRA.\n  Similarly, John Pollack of Orange County, FL, will be able to begin \nsaving for his retirement because of this bill. As the owner of \nAllrite-Foto, John has not made any IRA contributions due to his wife \nLorraine's corporate plan involvement. If this bill is enacted, John \nwill be able to save for retirement along with his wife.\n  As you can see by these two examples, this provision--championed by \nSenator Roth and Senator Breaux for many years--will be beneficial for \nboth spouses.\n  Third, the pension provisions in this bill begin to address a \nsignificant need in the pension area--portability. American workers are \nchanging jobs much more frequently than ever before. Over the course of \na 40-year career, the average worker will hold seven different jobs. \nYet only 50 percent of current 401k plans accept rollovers from other \nplans.\n  As a result, it has become imperative that these workers be able to \ntransport their retirement plans when they change jobs.\n  This bill makes it more attractive for businesses to accept \nrollovers. The bill provides that a plan will not be disqualified just \nbecause funds rolled over from a new employee's previous job come from \na fund which has become disqualified.\n  Although this is a good step, I will in coming days be pushing for \nmore pension portability. Similar defined contribution plans should \nalso be able to roll into each other. Money in a retirement stream \nshould be kept there until retirement. Government plans should be able \nto roll into private-sector plans. Private sector plans should be able \nto roll into nonprofit plans and nonprofit plans should be able to roll \ninto Government plans.\n  Fourth, this bill will make pensions simpler to administer. One of \nthe main reasons employers cite for not establishing or expanding \npension coverage is red tape. The Finance Committee bill eliminates \nsome of the paperwork burden it now takes to administer a pension.\n  This bill asks that the Treasury Department and Department of Labor \nissue guidance on the use of new forms of electronic pension \nnotification, and provides for the review of current rules to \naccommodate new technology.\n  With the help of this new Internet and telecommunication technology, \npension information will be more readily available to workers and less \ncostly for employers to produce.\n  Finally, this bill enhances pension security. Both businesses and \nworkers will be helped by a provision phasing up the 150 percent of \ncurrent liability limit. Under current law, companies are limited in \nthe amount they can contribute to their employees' defined benefit \nplan. I believe companies should be able to increase funding of their \npension plans in order to fully meet the needs of their future \nretirees.\n  Companies can better budget if they have greater flexibility in what \nthey put in their plan--and workers are better off, because the more \ncompanies contribute, the more secure their retirement. This bill gives \ncompanies that flexibility.\n  Each of these provisions, as well as others I have not mentioned, \nwill improve our private pension system. It is not all we should do to \nprepare for retirement in the 21st century, but it is a good start.\n  I have been honored to work closely with many of my colleagues in \nbringing about these bipartisan pension changes. Senators Hatch, \nGrassley, Jeffords, Breaux and Moseley-Braun have been instrumental in \nbringing about these reforms, and I would like to commend them, and \nothers, on their efforts.\n  By finding this common ground on both sides of the political aisle, \nwe are working to ensure that the American workers of today will have a \nmore secure and prosperous retirement for tomorrow.\n\n\n                          Aviation Excise Tax\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about actions \ntaken in the reconciliation bills by the Senate Finance and the House \nWays and Means Committees to modify the current aviation excise tax \nstructure. Although somewhat different from each other, both of the \nproposed modifications would increase taxes on airline passengers, and \nrepresent significant changes in aviation policy.\n  Last year, Commerce Committee members worked closely with members of \nthe Ways and Means and Finance Committees, during consideration of the \nFederal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, to establish the National \nCivil Aviation Review Commission. The members of this Commission have \ndedicated themselves to developing a consensus within the aviation \nindustry regarding the appropriate financing mechanism for the Federal \nAviation Administration [FAA], and the important safety programs it \noversees. Together, the committees empaneled the Commission to consider \nsubstantive policy changes to the aviation excise tax formula, and I \nbelieve that the Commission should be given every opportunity to do so. \nThe reconciliation bill should not make substantive changes to the tax \nformula without the benefit of the Commission s work.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to agree with the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, of which I am a member. The work of \nthe National Civil Aviation Review Commission could result in a unique \nopportunity for an often divided aviation industry to reach a consensus \non important funding issues. Congress should not force its will on the \nindustry prematurely.\n  The Commission is in the process of developing legislative \nrecommendations, and plans to complete its work soon. Unfortunately, \nthe reconciliation process is moving faster than the ability of the \nCommission to reach a comprehensive solution. The Commission recently \nwrote to the leadership of both the Senate and House on this issue. We \nshould ensure that the reconciliation bill, or budget rules, do not \nforeclose the ability to consider the commission recommendations in the \nfuture. At that time, we will have a full and fair debate on the \nrecommendations themselves.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished majority leader for his \ninsight. I plan to continue to work with him and other members of the \nCommerce Committee to see that the budget reconciliation bill does not \nforeclose the opportunity for Congress to implement the Commission \nrecommendations in the future. We must continue our efforts to ensure \nan adequate and stable funding source for the FAA and the safety \nprograms it oversees.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, the majority leader, the chairman and ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee, and the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, in expressing concern about the reconciliation bill \npreempting the work of the National Civil Aviation Review Commission. I \nappointed two of its members, and I would not like to see its important \nwork undermined before it has had an opportunity to achieve a consensus \nto a very important issue. I believe that after the recommendations of \nthe Commission have been submitted to Congress, we must give them every \nconsideration.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I, too, would like to join my \ndistinguished colleagues in this discussion. The leadership of the \nCommerce Committee worked very hard in the Senate and during the \nSenate-House conference to create this Commission. Congress even \nprovided a substantial appropriation to fund its activities. The work \nof the Commission is extremely important. I know that my colleagues \nshare my concern that aviation monies are not being used for aviation \npurposes, and we need to work to correct that. During our Commerce \nCommittee markup recently, I expressed my desire to treat\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\nthe Airport and Airways Trust Fund differently, and many members \nindicated that we needed to do something different for aviation. The \nGAO report on airport funding suggests that the airports are in need of \n$10 billion, according to the airports, and $6.5 billion, according to \nthe FAA, depending upon the type of projects included. The Airport \nImprovement Program is an important component of the work of the FAA. \nWe cannot meet future growth needs without expanding our airports and \nmodernizing the air traffic control system. The Commission work and \nrecommendations will help us in the debate in finding ways to meet our \nfuture aviation system needs.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, \nI would like to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Commerce Committee, as well as with \nthose of the majority and minority leaders. An efficient FAA will be \ncrucial if our country is to maintain its role as the world leader in \nthe aeronautical and aerospace industries. The FAA must have adequate \nresources to transform itself into an efficient and productive agency. \nThe anticipated work of the Commission should provide the Congress with \nvaluable guidance in that respect. The proposed changes to the aviation \nexcise taxes in the reconciliation bill should not be a signal to the \ncommission that its ongoing work is meaningless. I intend to work with \nthe leadership of the Commerce Committee and Senate to ensure that the \nfuture recommendations of the Commission are not prejudiced by any \nactions taken in this reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to add to the thoughtful \nremarks of my distinguished colleagues. We started the debate over how \nto fund the FAA last Congress when we first proposed a fee system. \nSenator McCain and I worked very hard on the bill and the entire \ncommittee agreed that we needed a Commission to provide a blueprint for \nhow to fund the FAA. The FAA bill last year restructured the agency and \ngave the FAA the ability to do some creative things. Now the Commission \nmust give us their best advice on how to meet the needs of the FAA, or \nhow to cut spending. Those are the dilemmas facing the Commission. I \nknow all of us share a desire to ensure that the work of the Commission \nis debated and fully aired.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank the distinguished gentlemen for \ntheir remarks. The safety of the flying public and the health of an \nessential, vital industry are at stake. We must give the Commission a \nchance to fulfill its statutory mandate.\n\n\n                              401(k) plans\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles, and Delaware, Mr. Roth, if they would be willing to enter into \na colloquy with me about an amendment I offered last night which was \nadopted by voice vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be pleased to answer any questions that the \nSenator from California may have.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As the Senators are aware, the 401(k) has emerged as many \nbaby boomers primary pension plan. 401(k)s now cover more than 22 \nmillion employees and invest more than $675 billion in pension assets. \nMany American workers now have more equity in their 401(k) plans than \nin their homes.\n  Unfortunately, Federal law is currently less protective of 401(k)s \nthan traditional defined-benefit pension plans. A company sponsoring a \ntraditional plan is currently prohibited from investing more than 10 \npercent of its assets in company holdings, such as real property or \ncompany stock. This reasonable limitation, however, does not apply to \n401(k) plans.\n  The amendment I offered last night would extend this 10 percent \nlimitation to 401(k) plans, enhancing pension security for millions of \nworkers nationwide.\n  I want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee for their assistance in clearing this important \namendment.\n  The amendment included a small change at the request of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. The provision requested by the Senator from Oklahoma \nwould allow companies sponsoring 401(k) plans to require that 1 percent \nof an employee's contribution be invested in qualified employer \nsecurities.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator has accurately described the change to her \namendment that I suggested. I believe that employers should be allowed \nto require employees to contribute 1 percent of their 401(k) \ncontributions to company assets. However, as a member of the Finance \nCommittee and possible conferee on this bill, I will urge my colleagues \nnot to increase the 1-percent cap.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I certainly appreciate the support of the Senator from \nOklahoma. I would ask the Senator from Delaware if he, too, will work \nto retain the Boxer amendment in conference.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, the \nassistant majority leader, and the ranking member of the committee for \nall their hard work to guarantee pension security for America's working \nmen and women.\n\n\n                   computer technology and equipment\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my colleagues from Delaware, Mr. Roth, and New \nYork, Mr. Moynihan, if they would be willing to enter into a colloquy \nwith me regarding providing an enhanced deduction for corporate \ncontributions of computer technology and equipment.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would be pleased to answer any questions the Senator from \nCalifornia may have.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would be pleased to enter into a colloquy with my \nfriend from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As you know, the House-passed Tax Reconciliation Bill \nincluded a provision which would provide an enhanced tax deduction for \ncorporate contributions of computer technology and equipment. This \nprovision, authored by Congressman Randy Cunningham, is very similar to \na bill Senator Chafee and I introduced earlier this year. Our bill, the \nComputer Donation Incentive Act of 1977, provides an incentive for \ncompanies to donate new and nearly new computers and software to \nelementary and secondary schools.\n  The successful education of America's children is closely linked to \nthe use of innovative educational technologies, particularly computer-\nbased instruction and research. Unfortunately, however, far too many \nelementary and secondary school classrooms lack the computers they need \nto take advantage of these new educational technologies. I believe this \nprovision will provide America's schools with the technological \nresources necessary to prepare both students and teachers for the \ntechnologically advanced society in which we now live.\n  I know that the chairman and ranking member on the Committee on \nFinance would like to have included the House provision in the Senate \ntax reconciliation bill, but due to revenue considerations were unable \nto do so. I hope, however, that my friend from Delaware and my friend \nfrom New York would urge the adoption of this very important provision \nin conference.\n  Mr. ROTH. I agree that this is a very important provision and I will \nurge my colleagues to consider this proposal in conference.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I agree with my friend from California and my friend \nfrom Delaware, that this provision should be carefully considered and I \ntoo will work to urge my colleagues to give this proposal careful \nconsideration.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Committee on Finance for their support of my bill and of the House \nprovision.\n\n\n supplemental enterprise zones and eligibility for brownfields benefits\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to ask if the chairman can \nclarify for me whether this bill includes a provision that provides the \n``brownfields'' benefits for supplemental empowerment zones.\n  As a former mayor, I am very committed to promoting economic growth \nin our urban area. The ``brownfields'' provision will be significant in \nthe City of Los Angeles' effort to turn abandoned, vacant or \nunderutilized industrial or commercial properties back into productive \nuse. Can the chairman confirm that, under the Senate tax bill, \nbrownfields remediation incentives are also extended to supplemental \nempowerment zones?\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\n  Mr. Roth. Yes, the committee bill extends the brownfields benefits to \nsupplemental zones as well. Section 768(c)(2) of the bill, entitled \n``Expensing of Environmental Remediation Costs,'' extends the \nbrownfields benefits to supplemental zones designated after December \n21, 1994, which confers the benefits to the supplemental zones of Los \nAngeles and Cleveland, OH.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman for clarifying the provision and \nthank the committee for its work on this issues.\n\n\n                       computer access incentive\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to repeat \nmy interest in including funding in the reconciliation bill which would \nfacilitate our schools' efforts to acquire computers and become \nconnected to the Internet.\n  If our students are going to be fully prepared to face the next \nmillennium with computer skills adequate to the task of competing in a \nglobal economy, I believe we in the Federal Government have a \nresponsibility to ensure that our schools have every opportunity to \nacquire computer equipment.\n  The House Ways and Means Committee reported a bill which includes \nfunds for an enhanced charitable deduction for those who donate \ncomputer equipment to the schools. As you know, based on the experience \nI have had helping schools in Montana acquire computer equipment, I \nhave been working on a somewhat different approach which provides a tax \ncredit for companies that give a price discount to schools purchasing \nnew equipment.\n  I ask the chairman to work with me during conference to evaluate the \nHouse Ways and Means proposals and my proposals to increase schools' \naccess to the Internet.\n  Mr. ROTH. I look forward to working with the Senator.\n\n\n                         EDUCATION INITIATIVES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Chairman Roth for working on this tax legislation in a fair, \nbipartisan manner. In particular, this bill includes several \neducational initiatives that will have a positive impact not only on \nthe people of my home State of Florida but on the citizens--of every \nincome--in our Nation as a whole.\n  First, I applaud the chairman's provisions with respect to prepaid \ncollege tuition plans. Currently, 16 States offer and manage college \nsavings programs, 5 States are in the process of implementing such \nprograms, and the other 29 States have legislation pending or are \nstudying the feasibility of creating these programs.\n  Last year, Congress clarified the tax treatment of participation in \nprepaid college tuition plans. The 1996 Small Business Protection Act \nprovided that any prepaid or savings State entity is tax-exempt. The \nact also clarified that earnings under prepaid programs are not taxed \nuntil distribution, and--when distributed--earnings would be taxed to \nthe student beneficiary.\n  Under the proposal approved by the Finance Committee, distributions \nfrom prepaid college tuition plans will be 100 percent tax-free. In \naddition, the definition of qualified higher education expenses will be \nexpanded from current law. Under this legislation, tax-exempt benefits \nwill now include room and board, as well as tuition, fees, and related \nexpenses. Thus, families who plan ahead can lock in today's rates for \nalmost all expenses incurred in their children's education.\n  The legislation will have immeasurable benefits for our Nation's \nfamilies. For example, Barbara and Jack Alfonso, who live in Miami, FL, \nhave a 10-year-old son, Adrian. Back when Barbara finished high school, \nher parents could not afford to send her to college. She decided to \ntake out loans to attend secretarial school. It took her 7 years to pay \noff those loans, so Barbara knows what it's like to be burdened with \ndebt.\n  Barbara and Jack decided that they didn't want their son to be faced \nwith the same obstacles. So, when Adrian was 5, they invested in the \nFlorida Prepaid College Tuition Program. They will make their last \npayment in October of this year.\n  Adrian is a good student, and he deserves the opportunity to further \nhis education. And because his parents chose to put aside money for his \nfuture by participating in the State's tuition program, Adrian will \nhave this opportunity. Now Adrian can become one of the first college \ngraduates in the Alfonso family. He can rest assured that his hard work \nwill not have been in vain--that college is not a dream for him but a \nreality.\n  As Barbara tells it: ``The best thing about this plan is that it \ngives me peace of mind.'' Thanks to a prepaid college tuition plan, \nBarbara knows that her son will be able to go to college. And thanks to \nthis program, two hard-working parents are able to give their child \nwhat they never had. Their son will be better off than they were.\n  With this legislation, families throughout our Nation will be better \nable to plan and save for their children's education. First, parents \ncan save for their children's education without paying taxes. Second, \nparents can purchase tuition at today's rates and then withdraw this \nmoney when their children begin school. Tomorrow's education can be \nsecured at today's prices.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Roth for including a portion of \nmy school construction tax proposal, which would assist small and rural \nschool districts. The provision that was included in this bill will \npositively impact issuers of small school construction bonds. These \nissuers will be exempt from arbitrage rebate requirements up to $10 \nmillion. Currently, there is a $5-million limit which applies to all \nbonds.\n  With this provision, we are specifically helping small school \ndistricts to lower the cost of building new schools. I hope that this \nlegislation is just the beginning of much more which this Congress will \ndo to make a significant and substantial dent in the problem of school \nconstruction and rehabilitation needs.\n  On behalf of all of our Nation's families, I would like to thank \nChairman Roth for his efforts regarding these education initiatives. I \nthink Barbara Alfonso says it best: ``We can't cut corners when it \ncomes to education.'' Barbara is right. This legislation will allow us \nto invest in our most precious resource--our children--who are, of \ncourse, ultimately our future.\n\n\n                             rail fuel tax\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Would the esteemed chairman of the Finance Committee be \nwilling to enter a colloquy on the rail deficit reduction fuel tax?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would be happy to discuss this matter with my colleague \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. As the chairman is aware, the 1990 and 1993 Budget \nReconciliation Acts imposed a 2.5-cent-per-gallon and a 4.3-cent-per-\ngallon diesel fuel tax for deficit reduction on railroads and highway \nusers. Beginning October 1995, 2.5 cents of the trucking industry's \ndeficit reduction tax was directed to the Highway Trust Fund. The \nremaining highway 4.3 cents remained in place for deficit reduction \npurposes, while the rail rate was set at 5.55 cents per gallon, also \neffective October 1995. As a result of these acts, the freight rail \nindustry currently pays 1.25 cents per gallon more for deficit \nreduction than its primary competitors.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BURNS. While the Highway Trust Fund provides the financing for \nconstruction and maintenance of public roads and bridges used by trucks \nand automobiles, the railroad industry realizes no similar return on \nits tax payments. Railroads currently expend more than $7 billion \nannually in capital to build and maintain their own ``roads.'' These \nprivate rights-of-ways are subject to more than $400 million annually \nin local property taxes. While few Senators are more dedicated to the \ngoal of deficit reduction than I, it seems that the burden of reducing \nthe Federal deficit must be shared equally among competing modes of \ntransportation.\n  The Senate Finance Committee adopted an amendment to the chairman's \nMark which would transfer the 4.3-cent-per-gallon deficit reduction tax \npaid by highway users to the Highway Trust Fund--minus the new half-\ncent tax for the Intercity Rail Trust Fund--Amtrak. Additionally, the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee transferred the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax \npaid by aviation users to the Aviation Trust Fund. Assuming that these \namendments remain in the bills, the rail industry will be paying 5.05 \ncents per gallon for deficit reduction while those in competing \nindustries will be paying nothing for deficit reduction.\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Again the Senator is correct in his assessment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Understanding the demands on the chairman, I would merely \nlike to encourage him to address this situation in conference. If a \nsolution can not be reached in this bill, I would encourage the \nchairman to give careful consideration to and to work toward a remedy \nof this situation in the tax title to the upcoming ISTEA \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. ROTH. Rest assured that the committee will give every \nconsideration to the addressing the transportation excise tax equity \nmatters raised by my colleague from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I greatly appreciate the time and consideration given to \nme by the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n\n\n                PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER SURVIVOR PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed my \namendment to make a modest change in current law. A modest change, but \none which will make an enormous difference in the lives of some very \nspecial Americans--the families of public safety officers--police \nofficers and firefighters--who have given their lives in the line of \nduty.\n  This amendment would forgive Federal tax liability on the annuities \nreceived by the families of these fallen heroes. The cost is modest--\nabout $25 million over the next 10 years.\n  I would also add that this tax treatment would be the same as that \nfor the families of fallen soldiers. In other words, my amendment gives \nto those who fight and die in domestic battles to keep us safe the same \ntreatment we give to those who fight and die in keeping us safe from \nforeign battles.\n  Mr. President, again, I welcome my colleagues support for my \namendment--we have stood with the cops, stood with the firefighters, \nand stood with the paramedics who have given their lives in service to \nall of us.\n\n\n              STATE-SPONSORED WORKERS' COMPENSATION FUNDS\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would like to ask a question of the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee concerning a provision in the tax \nbill.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would be pleased to respond to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Section 761 of the bill provides standards that a State-\nsponsored workers' compensation company must meet in order to be exempt \nfrom Federal income tax for future years. As the chairman is aware, a \nlarge number of the States, including Louisiana, have State-sponsored \nworkers' compensation companies that have been operating as tax-exempt \nagencies for several years. It is my understanding that the standards \nthat we have proposed for the future are intended to codify the \nstandards that exist under present law and that a company, such as the \none established by the State of Louisiana, that met these standards in \nprior years should be confident that it is, in fact, tax exempt under \ncurrent law. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator is correct. The committee thought it was \nappropriate to provide prospective application for the codification of \nstandards which must be met for tax exemption. However, the committee \nexpressly acknowledged the fact that a number of States had established \nentities that were operating as tax exempt organizations. The \nmotivation for codifying the standards as part of the Internal Revenue \nCode was to help these entities and the Internal Revenue Service more \neasily apply the law. However, our report expressly states that tax \nexemption may be available to many such State-sponsored entities under \npresent law and no interference was intended to be drawn from our \naction that the income of those entities was not already tax-exempt.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I strongly support the provision in \nthe bill that deals with tax-exempt status of State workers' \ncompensation funds. Senator Gramm and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the text of a letter we received earlier this \nmonth from the Governor of the State of Texas urging us to clarify the \nFederal tax statutes to maintain the tax-exempt status of this fund in \nlight of the important role it plays in stabilizing the market for \nworkers' compensation insurance in Texas.\n  There being no objection, the text of the letter was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   State of Texas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                     June 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I understand that the Internal Revenue \n     Service is questioning the source of the Texas Workers' \n     Compensation Insurance Fund's tax exemption.\n       The Texas Legislature created the Fund in 1991 to resolve a \n     crisis in our workers' compensation insurance market. The \n     Fund carries out its statutory responsibility to ensure that \n     workers' compensation insurance is available for Texas \n     employers in even the smallest or riskiest of businesses.\n       Workers' compensation insurance is not mandatory for Texas \n     employers. Those businesses that choose to carry workers' \n     compensation coverage for their employees now have access to \n     a much broader variety of carriers, competitive premiums and \n     enhanced employee benefits.\n       I encourage you to consider clarification of the federal \n     tax statutes to resolve this issue. Arbitrarily and \n     retroactively changing the tax status of the Fund would \n     directly affect the small businesses that depend on the Fund \n     for workers' compensation coverage, and would needlessly \n     inject instability into what is now a healthy segment of the \n     Texas insurance market.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is it also the chairman's understanding that this \nprovision clarifies the tax-exempt status of these funds under current \nlaw by codifying the existing standards?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                             aviation taxes\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I was wondering if Senator Nickles and I \ncould engage the chairman of the Finance Committee in a colloquy \nregarding the proposed tax on the domestic portion of international \njourneys [DPIJ]. As I understand the new tax, it will impose a new 10-\npercent tax on domestic legs of international flights. This tax hurts \ndomestic carriers because they typically have domestic stopovers on \ntheir international flights, whereas international carriers have more \ndirect flights without stopovers in the United States. Since flights \nwithout stopovers are not subject to the new 10-percent tax, the net \nresult is a competitive disadvantage for domestic carriers.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator from Michigan would yield, I want to echo \nthe concerns of my friend from Michigan. In fact we were prepared to \noffer an amendment along with several other colleagues but out of \ndeference to the desire of the chairman to complete action on the bill, \nwe agreed to work with the chairman. It is my understanding that the \nchairman of the Finance Committee is aware of these concerns and has \nexpressed his intention to resolve this controversy in conference. \nWould the chairman confirm his intentions regarding the proposed tax on \nthe domestic portion of international journeys?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would like to assure my colleagues from Michigan and \nOklahoma that it is my intention to work with House and Senate \nconferees to eliminate any competitive advantages that foreign carriers \nmay enjoy and resolve this controversy.\n\n\n                          net operating losses\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Santorum, I would \nlike to discuss an issue with the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee relating to operating losses of a business.\n  The tax bill extends the carry forward period for businesses with \noperating losses for an additional 5 years. But the provision only \napplies to operating losses incurred in future years.\n  We are less concerned about the tax impact of allowing existing \nlosses to expire than about the impact on companies for financial \naccounting purposes. Under the accounting standards, if the operating \nlosses expire, some companies will see a major reduction in asset \nvalue.\n  We would like for the chairman and the ranking member to consider \nthis issue in conference.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would like to associate myself with the comments of \nmy colleague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I understand the issue raised by the Senators from \nPennsylvania. I will be pleased to look at the issue in conference.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I understand the issue raised by the two Senators from \nPennsylvania. I will be pleased to look at the issue in conference.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will also be pleased to look at the issue in conference.\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\n                 for an additional tobacco tax increase\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain my \nvote against waiving the Budget Act on the Kennedy amendment for an \nadditional tobacco tax increase. I have long been a leading supporter \nof providing adequate health coverage to our Nation's children. On the \nfirst day of the 105th Congress, I introduced legislation that would \nprovide coverage to the 4.2 million children of the working poor, who \nare not eligible for Medicaid but whose parents cannot afford private \nhealth insurance. During consideration of the budget for fiscal year \n1998, the President and Congress reached an agreement to provide $16 \nbillion for health care insurance to protect our Nation's uninsured \nchildren. The Senate Finance Committee has added an additional $8 \nbillion for children's health insurance from funds derived from a new \ntax on tobacco. As a result, the budget reconciliation bill now \ncontains $24 billion for the vital purpose of providing health \ninsurance to America's uninsured children.\n  The Kennedy amendment would further increase the tobacco tax by an \nadditional 23 cents per pack. The amendment, however, did not specify \nhow this additional tax revenue would be spent. As a consequence, the \nSenate could be given no assurance that any of the money generated by \nthis new tax would provide health insurance. I believe the American \ntaxpayer is willing to accept a reasonable level of taxation in order \nto provide health insurance to our Nation's children. However, with the \nmoney provided under the budget agreement and the additional funds \nprovided by the Senate Finance Committee, Congress is fairly addressing \nthis need.\n\n\n                        ira withdrawals for k-12\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I supported Senator Coverdell's amendment \nto expand the bill's provisions to allow penalty-free withdrawals from \nIndividual Retirement Accounts for education expenses for children in \ngrades K-12 because I believe that parents should have the maximum \nflexibility to spend their own money on their children's education.\n  I have consistently opposed the use of public funds to subsidize \nprivate school tuition for K-12 educational expenses because I have \ngrave concerns about the constitutional issues of separation of church \nand State raised in such policy and because I am an advocate of public \nschools. As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee which funds the \nEducation Department, it is among my top priorities to continue to \nprovide increases in Federal support to the Nation's public schools. \nHowever, there are many parents who feel that it is in the best \ninterest of their children to attend nonpublic elementary and secondary \nschools for a variety of reasons and in a variety of settings. I \nbelieve they should be free to spend their own resources on such \nexpenses as they see fit.\n\n\n                     TAX RELIEF IS FINALLY AT HAND\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, hard-working American families have not seen \nsignificant net tax relief since Ronald Reagan's first year in office \nas President. That was 16 years ago, in 1981. Since then, their tax \nburden has gone in just one direction--up. Higher payroll taxes, higher \ntaxes on gasoline and Social Security, higher taxes on capital gains \nand air travel. If you manage to save something for your child's \neducation, the earnings are even taxed.\n  It is no wonder, then, that the typical American family feels \noverwhelmed: it now pays more in taxes than it does for food, clothing, \nand shelter combined. That is wrong, and it has got to change. It is \nabout to change.\n  Mr. President, there has really been a sea of change in Washington's \napproach to taxing in recent years. Remember that it was not so long \nago, in 1993 to be exact, that President Clinton pushed through the \nlargest tax increase in the Nation's history. Everyone in the country \nfelt the bite of the Clinton gas-tax increase. Retirees even saw their \nSocial Security benefits taxed more. The debate back then was not \nwhether to raise taxes, but how much to raise them.\n  Two years ago, after Republicans gained control of both Houses of \nCongress, the debate changed dramatically. The question no longer was \nwhether to raise taxes, or even whether to cut taxes. The question was \nhow much to cut them. The debate has changed so much that President \nClinton, who initiated that record-setting tax increase 4 years ago, \nand who vetoed tax relief just 2 years ago, now tries to claim the tax-\ncutting mantra as his own.\n  We began last year to make some incremental progress in offering tax \nrelief. The adoption tax credit, for example, was enacted, as was an \nincrease in the Social Security earnings limitation and new tax \nincentives for the purchase of long-term health insurance. That was \nafter President Clinton vetoed a far more substantial tax-cut package \nin December 1995.\n  The bill before us today takes yet another step in the right \ndirection. When signed into law, it will provide more tax relief than \nany other bill in 16 years. And three-quarters of the total relief \nprovided by the bill will go to families with annual income of less \nthan $75,000. Again, that is families with income under $75,000 a year \nthat would benefit most.\n  Make no mistake, it provides nowhere near the level of relief that \nAmerican families need. The net tax cut of between $77 billion and $85 \nbillion over 5 years represents just 1 percent of the amount that the \nTreasury would otherwise collect over that period. But given the \nconstraints on tax relief that President Clinton imposed in this year's \nbudget agreement, it is probably the most we can do. It is, in my view, \nmerely a downpayment on the amount of tax relief that we will continue \nto seek next year and the years after that.\n  Mr. President, I opposed the budget agreement a few weeks ago, in \nlarge part because it so severely restricted the amount of tax relief \nthat we could provide this year. I believed that we should have held \nout for a better deal for the taxpayers, but a majority of both Houses \ndisagreed, and therefore we have to find a way to live within the \nconstraints the deal imposed. I must say, however, that I believe the \nFinance Committee has done a good job with the limited resources it had \nto work with.\n\n  The bill includes a $500-per-child tax credit for families with \nchildren under the age of 17. The credit would become fully effective \nnext year; it would be limited this year to $250 for every child under \nthe age of 13.\n  The bill also provides important help to parents who are struggling \nto find a way to pay for their children's college education. It offers \na new $1,500 HOPE tax credit, new tax-preferred Education Savings \nAccounts, and something that the budget agreement did not contemplate, \na new deduction for student-loan interest payments.\n  These provisions alone--the education-related and child tax credits--\nmake up 82 percent of the tax relief provided by this bill--82 percent. \nAn analysis by the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche estimates that \na married couple with two children and a household income of $35,000 a \nyear would see its tax bill slashed by 40 percent--to $1,573 a year, \ndown from $2,625 now. If one child were in college, the tax relief \nwould rise to 78 percent.\n  The bill does some other good things as well. It reduces the capital-\ngains tax rate to 10 percent for individuals in the 15 percent income-\ntax bracket, and 20 percent for other taxpayers. It provides a capital-\ngains exclusion for homeowners--up to $250,000 for single taxpayers, \n$500,000 for married couples. Given that more than half of all \ntaxpayers reporting capital gains have incomes under $50,000--including \nmany seniors who depend upon income from their life-long investments to \nsupport them in their golden years--we can be sure that the benefits of \nthese capital-gains reductions will flow to middle America.\n  And with history as a guide, we know that the Treasury will benefit \nfrom a capital-gains tax cut as well. Between 1978 and 1985, for \nexample, the top marginal tax rate on capital gains was cut by almost \n45 percent--from 35 percent to 20 percent--but total individual \ncapital-gains tax receipts nearly tripled--from $9.1 to $26.5 billion \nannually.\n  When capital-gains tax rates are too high, people need only hold onto \ntheir assets to avoid the tax indefinitely. No sale, no tax. But that \nmeans less investment, fewer new businesses, and new jobs, and--as \nhistorical records show--far less revenue to the Treasury than if \ncapital-gains taxes were set at\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\na lower level. Just as the Target store down the street does not lose \nmoney on weekend sales--because volume more than makes up for lower \nprices--lower capital-gains tax rates can encourage more economic \nactivity, and in turn, produce more revenue for the Government.\n  With that in mind, many of us believe that the capital-gains tax rate \nshould have been cut deeper--some wanted an earlier effective date, \ntoo--but the die was cast against more capital-gains relief when the \nbudget agreement passed earlier this month. Still, even the modest \nreduction in this bill will begin to unlock the sizable amount of \nassets currently locked up in the economy because of high tax rates. \nThe American Council for Capital Formation estimates that it will lead \nto the creation of as many as 150,000 new jobs a year.\n  The bill also enhances the ability of individuals to save for \nretirement in IRA accounts. More Americans would be allowed to save in \ntraditional IRA's, including homemakers who have been precluded from \nparticipating merely because their spouses are active participants in \nemployer-sponsored plans. Non-deductible contributions of up to $2,000 \nto new IRA plus accounts would be allowed for anyone; distributions \nfrom the accounts would occur on a tax-free basis.\n\n\n                            DEATH TAX RELIEF\n\n  The legislation includes modest death-tax relief--a phased increase \nin the unified credit from $600,000 today to $1 million by 2006. An \nadditional $1 million exclusion is allowed for qualified family owned \nbusinesses and farms.\n  Mr. President, although the death-tax provisions represent steps in \nthe right direction, they are totally inadequate to solve the problems \nassociated with the tax. The unified credit has not been adjusted since \n1987, when it was set at $192,800, for an effective exemption of \n$600,000. Had it merely kept pace with inflation, the exemption would \nnow amount to about $840,000. By the time the $1 million exemption is \nfully phased in in 2006, inflation will have further eroded its value. \nThe family business exclusion is so complex and establishes so many \nhurdles for families to meet before they could qualify for relief that \nfew families will likely see any relief at all.\n  And it is family owned businesses, particularly those owned by women \nand minorities, that are in the greatest need of relief from death \ntaxes. Instead of being able to pass a hard-earned and successful \nbusiness on to the next generation, many families have to sell the \ncompany in order to pay the death tax. The upward mobility of such \nfamilies is stopped in its tracks. Proponents of this tax say they want \nto hinder concentrations of wealth. What the death tax really hinders \nis new American success stories.\n  Yet, the death-tax provisions in the bill do not save Americans from \nhaving to engage in costly estate-tax planning. They provide little in \nthe way of substantive relief. And they likely do little to promote \nstronger economic growth.\n  I know that we are not going to be able to do enough this year given \nthe constraints of the budget agreement, so further progress with \nrespect to death-tax relief will have to wait until next year. But we \nshould commit now to seeking that relief when the next opportunity \narises.\n\n\n                         DEPRECIATION RECAPTURE\n\n  There are two other parts of the bill that I hope we can correct this \nyear, hopefully before the bill emerges from the House-Senate \nconference committee in a few weeks. The first deals with the tax \ntreatment of capital gains earned from the sale or exchange of \ndepreciable real property. Such gains would be taxed at a maximum rate \nof 24 percent, compared to the lower tax rates that would be applied to \ngains earned from nondepreciable real estate and other assets.\n  Most of us are well aware of the significant unlocking effect that a \ncapital-gains tax cut would have: Not only would it stimulate savings, \ninvestment, and job creation, but, as I indicated before, historical \nevidence shows that it would result in increased revenues to the \nTreasury to assist with deficit reduction. The capital-gains relief \nrecommended in the tax bill mark is a step in the right direction. But \nunless the reach of that relief is extended to depreciable real \nproperty, we cannot ensure that the full benefit of a capital-gains tax \ncut is realized throughout the economy.\n  Establishing disparate tax treatment for investment and business real \nestate would provide little incentive for individuals to sell \ninvestment properties, or to recapitalize and modernize multifamily \nhousing, industrial properties, office buildings, retail properties, or \nsingle-family rental homes. It would provide little, if any, \nstimulation in what amounts to a substantial sector of the Nation's \neconomy. Moreover, taxing such property at rates higher than for other \nassets would establish a bias in the Tax Code that must be avoided.\n  I would note that the Finance Committee modified the bill to reduce \nthe tax rate, from the 26 percent originally recommended, to 24 \npercent. But we ought to make sure that by the time the bill reaches \nthe President's desk, depreciable real estate is on par with other \ntypes of investments.\n\n\n                      CHILDREN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about the tobacco-tax provisions \nof this bill. I realize that the tax is intended in large part to raise \nadditional revenue for the children's health-insurance initiative. Yet, \nmost people recognize that an increased cigarette tax would lead to \nlower cigarette consumption--in fact, discouraging smoking is one of \nthe prime objectives of a tax increase. But if smoking declines, so do \ncigarette-tax revenues. The proposal thus creates an expensive new \nprogram, the costs of which are likely to increase rapidly, and yet the \nintended revenue stream is by its very nature designed to dry up. This \nmethod of financing the children's health initiative will simply not \nwork over time.\n  My hope is that the financing mechanism will be modified in \nconference. I am not prepared, however, to vote against the bill as \nreported by the Finance Committee on account of that flaw and deny \nmillions of Americans the first significant tax relief they have seen \nin 16 years.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes many good provisions: Education tax \ncredits, the family tax credit, IRA incentives, capital-gains, and \nmodest death-tax relief. It extends the work opportunity credit, the \nresearch tax credit, and the exclusion for employer-provided \neducational assistance. Although there are some flaws in the current \nversion, we ought to seize the opportunity to enact these provisions as \na downpayment toward the ideal tax package.\n  I support the bill as it came out of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the tax bill before the \nSenate. Although I supported the budget resolution which allowed for \nthis bill to proceed, I did so to advance the spending cuts that I \nvoted for and the Senate passed earlier this week. I have consistently \nstood for the proposition that we shouldn't be reducing revenues until \nwe balance the budget, and I will keep that commitment today.\n  While I have supported a number of amendments that I felt would make \nthis bill a better package, even if all those amendments had passed, \nI'd still be opposed to cutting taxes while we still have a budget \ndeficit. Nonetheless, I understand that it is difficult for elected \nlegislators to resist the temptation of tax cuts, and I do not discount \nthe popular appeal of a number of the measures before us, nor do I \nquarrel with the public demand for them. However, sound fiscal policy \ncompels me to oppose even the tax changes I might otherwise support \nuntil such time as the Federal budget actually reaches balance.\n  By passing and enacting this tax bill, or any other, we \nsinglehandedly undo the hard work we did in 1993 to finally bring \nannual budget deficits under control. We've made dramatic progress, \nbringing down annual deficits from $290 billion in 1992 to an expected \n$60 billion this year. Now, on the precipice of balancing the budget, \nwe are going to pass a tax cut bill which takes us in precisely the \nopposite direction. While I understand that these tax cuts are provided \nfor in the context of a balanced budget plan, no one can argue that \nthey will increase the deficit and the debt between now and the year we \nexpect to get to a balanced budget, if we get there at all.\n  Not only will this bill increase the current deficit and the long-\nterm debt,\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nthe out-year costs will come due at a time when the costs of our \nentitlement programs begin to swell due to the retirement of the baby \nboom generation. From now until 2030, the number of individuals who \nwill qualify for these programs will double, going from 35 million to \n70 million. Even if we didn't enact this tax cut, all revenues we \ncollect would be needed just to fund entitlement programs and interest \non the debt by 2012, leaving only borrowing to cover defense and \ndiscretionary investments in human and physical capital. Enacting a tax \ncut which doubles in cost every 5 years hardly seems an appropriate \ncourse to follow given the demographic challenges we confront early in \nthe next century.\n  This tax cut would not have been as damaging in the future were we \nlikely to make some of the long-term structural changes in our \nentitlement programs that would have sufficiently restrained the growth \nof these expenditures in the future. By abandoning a legislative change \nfor a more accurate measure of the cost-of-living adjustments and the \nlikely elimination of any eligibility changes in Medicare by the time \nthe spending measure becomes law, we compound our long-term fiscal \nproblems with this tax cut.\n  Mr. President, the truth is that even if we were in budget balance \ntoday and for the forseeable future, I couldn't support this particular \ntax bill. The fact of the matter is that the tax bill before us does \nlittle or nothing to simplify the tax code, fails to adequately \nencourage new savings and investment, and is structured in a way that \nmasks its long-term costs. Instead, it is largely driven more by \npolitical payoffs to special interest groups and polling data, rather \nthan rational tax policy.\n  The child tax credit has been roundly denounced by economists as \ndoing little more than encouraging additional consumption, something we \nclearly ought not to be encouraging at this point given our robust \neconomy. At least the Senate retained the provision that required that \nthe tax savings be saved for education expenses for those with children \nbetween 13 and 16, and I commend my colleagues, including Senators \nBreaux, Kerrey, and Lieberman, who have fought so hard to ensure that \nthe child tax credit provides some economic value by requiring that it \ngoes to savings and investment.\n  Many have claimed that both the capital gains provisions and new \nindividual retirement accounts will encourage additional savings and \ninvestment, and I would like to believe that is the case. However, the \ncapital gains benefits fail to differentiate between those gains from \nlong-term investment and those from stock speculation, and the new \nbackloaded IRA's will likely result in simply a shift of existing \nsavings to a tax deferred vehicle, resulting in compounding revenue \nlosses over time.\n  Compounding revenue loss will also result from the structure of the \nestate tax relief provisions in this bill. I understand the burden \nthese taxes cause for some families, particularly those with family \nowned farms and businesses, but the slow phase-in of increases in the \ncurrent $600,000 exemption amount guarantee that the true cost of the \ntax change won't show up until after 2007.\n  Mr. President, the most difficult part of opposing this tax bill for \nme has to do with the education incentives included in this bill. From \nmy days as governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I've made \neducation my top priority, pumping over $1 billion of new funds into \neducation during my tenure as governor without a tax increase. I simply \nbelieve that the education of our children is the most important \nfunction of government at any level. Because of this commitment, I \napplaud the President's effort to increase access to education.\n  I am not opposed to commiting additional resources to education, but \nmy concern about these tax provisions is that they are not likely to \nencourage students to get a higher education. For the most part, they \nwould simply subsidize those who would have attended anyway. In \naddition, most education experts believe these tax provisions could \nresult in an increase in tuition costs as institutions use the tax \nsavings to increase their costs, potentially making education expenses \neven higher for students who can't qualify for these new tax benefits. \nIt also seems to me that those who benefit from these education \nincentives ought to have some obligation of community service, a cause \nI have long championed.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I voted earlier this week for the spending \ncuts in the first Reconciliation bill because I believe that deficit \nreduction should be our No. 1 priority. It is for this same reason that \nI oppose this legislation on principle and for the substantive policy \nreasons I have outlined. I understand that it is politically difficult \nin our day and age to resist the siren song of tax cuts. But I hope \nthat those who intend to support this tax package will be prepared to \nanswer for their vote when the revenue losses begin to mount and \nprevent our budget from staying in balance over the long term.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this bill, and I hope that it \nwill be vetoed by the President if it emerges from the House-Senate \nconference in this unacceptable form. The last thing the American \npeople need is a trickle-down tax relief bill that offers plums to the \nwealthiest individuals and corporations in our society, and crumbs for \neveryone else.\n  Clearly, we need to give tax relief to families, we need to encourage \ninvestment in education, we need to encourage investment in small \nbusinesses, we need to grant relief from the hardships that are \nsometimes caused by the estate tax.\n  The Republican plan takes each of these legitimate points and misuses \nthem as excuses to give enormous tax cuts to the well-heeled and the \npowerful and it does so as far as the eye can see. This plan violates \nthe fundamental principles that any tax bill must meet: tax fairness \nand fiscal responsibility.\n  The Republican bill claims that it will give fair tax relief to \nfamilies, but the Republican child credit is designed to exclude large \nnumbers of low- and middle-income working families. Forty-seven percent \nof all American children would not be eligible for the child credit \nunder the Republican proposal. An additional 8 million children would \nbe eligible for only a partial benefit. Clearly, the Republicans have \ngerrymandered their credit to save money by denying it to as many \nworking families as possible. Yet these are the families who need help \nthe most. Our Democratic proposal offers all of these families an \nhonest tax break. The Republican proposal is a let them eat cake tax \nbreak.\n  I also oppose the education provisions of the Republican bill because \nthey are skewed toward the highest income taxpayers. These Republican \nprovisions clearly violate the firm commitment made under the budget \nagreement on tax benefits for higher education. The letter signed by \nNewt Gingrich and Trent Lott specifically states that tax relief of \n``roughly $35 billion'' will be provided over 5 years for post-\nsecondary education, and that the education tax package ``should be \nconsistent with the objectives put forward in the HOPE scholarship and \ntuition tax proposals contained in the administration's fiscal year \n1998 budget to assist middle-class parents.''\n  The administration's proposal had two goals: to help middle-class \nfamilies during the critical years while students are in college, and \nto encourage lifelong learning. Students and families across the Nation \nare concerned about escalating tuition, and this bill does not do \nenough to help them.\n  The Republican bill is flawed in another major respect in this area--\nit utterly fails to address the need to help workers expand their \nskills and education. We need to give a real benefit to teachers, \nnurses, auto mechanics, and all others in jobs that need continual \nupgrading of skills. The workplace depends more and more on highly \ntrained workers. To sustain a strong economy, we must invest in ongoing \neducation throughout life.\n  The bill also provides a disproportionate education benefit to high \nincome families. It contains three separate provisions to encourage \nsavings for college, at a total cost of over $7 billion over the next 5 \nyears. Lower income families do not have the luxury to save as much as \nhigher income families do, and will not be able to take advantage of \nthese provisions.\n  I also strongly support funding for crumbling schools. The \ndeterioration of hundreds of schools across the United\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\nStates is a disgrace. But the Republican bill provides only token help. \nIt offers only Band-Aids to put over leaking roofs.\n  Similarly, the massive capital gains tax breaks and massive estate \ntax breaks are also tilted heavily to the wealthy. Largely because of \nthese provisions, more of the benefits of the Republican plan go to the \ntop 1 percent of taxpayers than go to the bottom 60 percent of the \ntaxpayers. Under the Republican plan those who are already well-off are \ngiven tens of billions of dollars in unwarranted tax breaks, while \nthose who are struggling are ignored.\n  Finally, the amount of the Republican tax cuts will explode in the \nyears after 2002, and the deficit will increase enormously. The Center \non Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated that the cost of the \nRepublican proposal will increase by between $500 and $600 billion in \nthe 10 years following the current budget period. It will be nearly \nimpossible to balance the budget in those years if this Republican tax \ngiveaway is enacted into law.\n  The Republican plan is a Trojan horse for giving tax breaks to the \nwealthy. If we had no tax bill, it would be better than this trickle-\ndown bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to vote against this tax bill.\n  Although I voted for the budget resolution which was designed to \nbring us to a balanced budget within the next 5 years, I have \nconsistently said that we should actually achieve a balanced budget, \nbefore enacting any sweeping new tax cuts. As attractive as new tax \ncuts may be, I think our first fiscal obligation is to eliminate the \ndeficit. We shouldn't ask our children and grandchildren to foot the \nbill for our program spending or our tax cuts.\n  Having said that, let me address several other issues. If we are \ngoing to have tax cuts before the budget is actually balanced, then we \nshould focus on the kinds of cuts that at least have some potential to \nhelp enhance economic productivity and increase revenues--tax changes \nthat arguably will increase income and resulting revenues will help \nmove us toward a balanced budget.\n  For these reasons, I have indicated that if we are to have tax cuts \nbefore the budget is in balance, we should limit them to changes that \nwill stimulate economic growth. A number of my constituents have \npresented me with strong arguments that some reductions in the capital \ngains and estate taxes will enhance economic productivity and growth, \nand I have been willing to support capital gains and estate tax changes \nif crafted in ways that target the benefits so as to stimulate growth \nand economic activity. For Wisconsin, this means, in particular, that \ncapital gains and estate tax changes should be targeted to help family \nfarms and other smaller family businesses that are passed down from one \ngeneration to the next.\n  Arguments for certain types of education tax cuts and child tax \ncredits are not as persuasive. And they become less so when they are \nnot available to those families who might most need such relief. If we \nare going to provide tax cuts to families with children, then we \nshouldn't exclude millions of working families with lower and moderate \nincomes. Over 565,000 kids in Wisconsin, nearly 40 percent, live in \nfamilies that will not receive the tax credit.\n  Altogether, as desirable as tax cuts might be, we need to keep our \nfocus on balancing the budget first, then consider tax cuts. American \nfamilies will benefit enormously by the Federal Government bringing \ndown the deficit and achieving a balanced budget. Anything that diverts \nus from that course should be resisted until we have finished the job.\n  Finally, if we must have tax cut legislation as part of the budget \nagreement, it ought to be both fiscally responsible and fair. This bill \nfails on both counts. The tax cut bill is heavily back-loaded. While \ncosting $85 billion over the first 5 years, the plan will cost close to \n$60 billion annually once it is fully in place. That kind of exploding \ncost moves us away from a balanced budget, and puts us back on the \ntrack to rising deficits. It is ironic that those who shout the loudest \nabout the need for a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution are \namong the biggest supporters of a tax bill that is nothing less than a \nbudget buster.\n  The tax plan also fails the test of fairness. A package of tax cuts, \neven one targeted toward economic development, need not be skewed to \nthe wealthiest. Unfortunately, this measure is. According to the tax \nwatchdog group Citizens for Tax Justice, over half the proposed tax \ncuts in the bill go to the top 5 percent of all taxpayers. And while \nthe 40 percent of families with the lowest income receive no tax \nbenefit, the top 1 percent receive an average benefit of nearly \n$16,000.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize my firm belief that our highest \npriority must be to balance our Federal budget before we cut taxes. We \nhave come too far and worked too hard to bring our deficit down to \njeopardize that effort with a fiscally irresponsible tax cut bill. I \nsupport the bipartisan balanced budget agreement negotiated by the \ncongressional leadership and the White House, but this tax package is \nnot consistent with the spirit of that agreement, and needlessly risks \nthe progress we made in the reconciliation package we just passed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nthe historic tax relief plan, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, \nthat is before the Senate today. Change has finally come to Washington \nand the fruits of that change are beginning to be realized. Who would \nhave thought that 3 years ago that the American people would be \nreceiving a $85 billion tax cut today, especially after the huge $265 \nbillion tax increase that President Clinton pushed through in 1993?\n  It is a proud day for this body and for the American people to \nfinally witness a Congress with the courage to enact a plan to restrain \nFederal spending and balance the budget. Also very important is the \nsavings that will be passed on to the American people in the form of \ntax relief. One thing we easily forget is that tax revenues belong to \nthe taxpayers. This historic bill will simply return the taxpayers' own \nmoney back to them.\n  Mr. President, important to this debate is how this tax package is \nbeing received and the work that has gone into making this bill a good \npiece of legislation. This bill was reported out of the Finance \nCommittee with overwhelming bipartisan support, and I hope that there \nis overwhelming bipartisan support for its final passage. I want to \ncommend my colleague and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee for \nthe balanced, bipartisan bill he spearheaded.\n  Mr. President, working families in this country do not take the \npaying of taxes lightly. How could they? They pay payroll taxes, income \ntaxes, property taxes, and other taxes. In addition to the amount of \ntaxes taken out of every paycheck, families reconcile what income taxes \nthey owe to Uncle Sam every April 15, and millions must send a check to \nthe government for additional taxes. The American taxpayers understand \nand realize that their tax payments go to providing needed Government \nbenefits and to support the freedoms we enjoy. However, enough is \nenough. It is time to cut the fat out of Government and lower the \nFederal tax burden. And, it is time to reduce the burden of budget \ndeficits on taxpayers, mortgage holders, small businessmen, students, \nand all others having or needing loans. It is time to stop passing off \nthe burden of current spending onto our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, this tax relief plan contains significant tax cuts in \na variety of areas. I will not take the time to comment on every \nprovision and change in the bill. However, I would like to comment on a \nfew of the main areas of tax relief which I have long advocated.\n  First, families with children will receive a $500 per child tax \ncredit. Raising children in today's world becomes more expensive each \nyear. This $500 credit will put more money in the hands of parents to \nhelp them better afford the high cost of raising children. It's real \nmoney back into the bank accounts of American families.\n\n  Second, this bill would provide a number of proposals to ease the \nburden of paying for college. I hear again and again about the high \ncost of colleges and universities. And, I have some personal knowledge \non this point, Mr. President. I not only put myself through both \ncollege and law school, I have also, as a father, put my six children \nthrough college. I know the sacrifices that are necessary.\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\n  This tax bill would provide a tax credit for tuition expenses, a \ndeduction for student loan interest, and an expansion of the current \npre-paid tuition programs. And, important to elementary and secondary \nschool teachers, the bill contains a provision to remove from the 2-\npercent itemized deduction limitation educational expenses related to \nfurthering the skills of the teacher. Teachers have great influence \nover our children. Well trained teachers are critical to preparing our \nchildren for the challenges of the future.\n  Third, this bill contains important tax cuts to stimulate economic \ngrowth and to further the creation of jobs. I have long been an \nadvocate of reducing the tax on capital gains. During debate this week, \nwe have heard a great deal of discussion about the rich versus the poor \nand who gets what out of this tax bill. Let me make it clear that \neverybody benefits when jobs are created through economic growth. A \ncapital gains tax cut creates jobs and economic growth. Government \ninvestment is limited in what it can do to help people economically. \nEncouraging private sector investment will foster the most efficient \nand effective ways to better the economy. I firmly believe that the \ncapital gains tax relief in this bill is the most important thing we \ncan do for economic growth in this country.\n  Expanding an existing business, starting a new venture, or bringing a \nnew invention to market requires capital investment to make happen. Tax \npolicy has a tremendous impact on the amount of capital investment. \nUnder the current law, gains from capital investments are taxed twice, \nonce when the income is earned and again when that income is \ndistributed to the shareholders. Cutting the capital gains tax rate \nwill encourage more investment which will translate into the creation \nof more jobs. This change is absolutely critical to maintaining a \nstrong economy well into the future.\n  I am also pleased to see relief from the death tax in this bill. \nNowhere is the damage of onerous taxation more evident than our current \nestate tax. It is an inefficient tax that really should be abolished. \nFamilies should not have to face a tax bill that forces the involuntary \nsale of assets shortly after putting a loved one to rest. I hope that \nwe can increase exemption from this onerous tax as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, another critically important provision in this bill is \nthe $8 billion in additional money for children's health insurance. \nThis is important for the most vulnerable of our citizens--low-income \nchildren. The future of this country lies with our children. We cannot \nignore the gap in our health care system that does not currently \nprovide vision or auditory screening, or other preventive health care. \nThe provisions adopted by the Finance Committee, and ratified by the \nfull Senate by an overwhelming vote, are significant and will help \naddress these yet unmet needs in a responsible manner. I applaud my \ncolleagues for their support of this important program.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of other tax relief provisions in \nthis bill and also many other tax simplification provisions that are \nvery important. I personally wish we could have done more in many of \nthese areas.\n  But, the fact that we are passing this legislation today, and the \npromise of the President that he will sign it into law, means that the \nbill has been a bipartisan effort. As such, it is a compromise and is \nnot perfect from any one Senator's point of view. If you polled all 100 \nSenators, I am sure each of us would mention provisions we would like \nto have written differently.\n  There were a number of amendments offered to this bill that I support \nand would have liked to vote for. However, when anyone participates in \na negotiation and becomes a party to an agreement, he or she cannot \nwilly-nilly support changes to that agreement just because you happened \nto like someone else's idea better. It stands to reason that you cannot \npersuade others to compromise if they cannot expect your adherence to \nwhatever agreement is reached. I gave my word to Chairman Roth and to \nmy colleagues on the Finance Committee to maintain the integrity of the \ncompromise bill that we passed out of the Finance Committee on a strong \nbipartisan basis. I am also constrained from voting to further increase \nthe cigarette tax even though it could be used to finance laudable \nobjectives in childrens health or to increase the deduction for health \ninsurance premiums paid by those who are self-employed.\n  Of course, there are also some provisions in this bill that I am not \nenthusiastic about and would cheerfully drop were they not part of the \nagreement.\n  But, taken as a whole, this tax package is a good mix of tax relief \nprovisions that will go a long way to lower the average American \nfamilies' tax burden. This is an historic piece of legislation, and I \nam proud to support its passage.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the tax bill \nwe are debating, S. 949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. This \nbill is not the bill I would have preferred if I had written all of the \ndetails, but it has many redeeming sections which I think do benefit \nNew Mexico and the Nation as a whole.\n  I want very much for New Mexicans to get needed tax relief. We have a \nstrong economy and are within reach of a balanced budget. It does seem \nto me that the tax burden of many New Mexicans and others is higher \nthan it needs to be--and while this is not structured the way I would \nhave preferred it--I will support final passage of S. 949 because it \ndoes move us further in a positive direction, than it does negative. \nThis bill expands IRA's in a way in which nearly 90 percent of our \nworking population will be eligible for these accounts, in contrast to \njust 70 percent today. Also, this bill provides both capital gains and \nestate tax relief, phased in in incremental steps, but nonetheless \nimportant to the overall investment climate of the Nation. I hope that \na great portion of that investment and economic activity gets directed \ntoward and takes place in New Mexico.\n  This bill contains about $32 billion in education provisions which \nwill be of benefit to many New Mexicans, particularly those who need \nsupport for college tuition. In addition, over 45 percent of New \nMexico's families paying taxes of $1,500 or more will be eligible to \ntake advantage of the HOPE scholarship. And while I would have \npreferred that this figure be far higher, approximately 51 percent of \ndependent children in New Mexico will be eligible for some portion of \nthe per child tax credit. Another important accomplishment in this bill \nis that it provides resources to help cover child health insurance for \nthe 10.5 million uninsured kids in America by raising the tobacco tax \nby 20 cents per pack.\n  There are other provisions in S. 949 that are worthy of support \nincluding permanent extension of the tax credit for employer provided \neducational assistance which many New Mexican workers and firms have \nvery much wanted. This bill also provides for an exemption from the 2 \npercent miscellaneous work provision of the Tax Code for hard-working, \ndedicated teachers who spend their own money on education technology \nmaterials and who should be able to fully expense these costs on their \ntax returns.\n  However, this bill is far from perfect. S. 949, which provides for an \n$85 billion net tax decrease, does not provide for the kind of \ndistribution of benefits across our society that I would have \npreferred. Although the Finance Committee did a far better job of \nmaking the tax cuts fairer than did the House Ways and Means Committee, \nI would have preferred the Democratic alternative which was offered \nyesterday by Senator Daschle.\n  The bill we are passing today--and which I plan to support on final \npassage--still hands the lion's share of tax relief to the wealthiest 1 \npercent of Americans, more than the combined lower 60 percent will \nreceive. By contrast, if we had passed the Daschle bill, working \nfamilies would have received almost twice the tax relief provided in \nthe Finance Committee plan.\n  Furthermore, the Democratic proposal had many targeted tax relief \nmeasures which would have done much more for small businesses and small \nfarms than the Republican bill achieves. In education, the Democratic \namendment would have provided working families more opportunities to \nhelp educate their children, rebuild schools and send their children to \ncollege.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Democratic bill was the more fiscally \nresponsible of the two alternatives.\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\n One of my major concerns about S. 949 is that the backloading of \nestate tax provisions, capital gains provisions, and particularly IRA \nprovisions will balloon the budget deficit enormously just after we \nfinally achieve the discipline to bring the Nation's spending and \nincome into balance.\n  Let me explain a bit about my concern about the IRA provisions. I \ncompletely support the notion that the Nation needs more savings. This \nwill help generate more capital for long-term investment and growth. \nBut I object to allowing only the wealthiest in our society to have the \ntax incentives and tax havens to save. We should provide incentives \nacross the board--and make sure that all sectors of our society are \ngetting some degree of retirement savings in place. This bill does not \ndo this. In fact, this legislation is a radical departure from our \ncurrent retirement savings policy which at least purports to establish \na level playing field for both high income and low income workers.\n  Unfortunately, the Finance Committee tax proposal contains two IRA \nprovisions which are at fundamental odds with each other and represent \nthe Cain and Abel of retirement savings policy. On one hand, the bill \nmakes an important contribution to strengthening the national savings \nsystem by doubling the income eligibility for deductible IRA's. The \nproposal makes deductible IRA eligibility available for 90 percent of \nthe population instead of the 70 percent now eligible.\n  Under this better side of the S. 949, deductible IRA's will be \navailable to everyone with less than $100,000, joint filers, of income. \nAnd as is the case with current law, even those with incomes above \n$100,000 can still make deductible IRA contributions, as long as they \nhave no other employer-sponsored pension plan.\n  It is also important to understand that under current law, people who \nhave employer-sponsored retirement plans can still make nondeductible \ncontributions to IRA accounts. These people can put an extra $2,000 a \nyear away so that this money can accrue and compound tax-free until \nretirement. This tax-advantaged savings opportunity provides \nsignificant benefits to those who make after tax IRA contributions. So \nfar so good.\n\n  But Senator Roth's IRA Plus proposal, in contrast to the IRA \nexpansion provisions, is a bad step for us to take. A radical departure \nfrom past retirement savings policy, IRA Plus overwhelmingly benefits \nthe rich. It also creates a slippery slope towards tax-free havens for \nother retirement programs and blows a very large hole in the Federal \nbudget deficit in future years. The fact is that because tax advantages \nin the other Roth provisions are available to both those under $100,000 \nincome levels as well as those at any income level who don't have an \nemployer-sponsored pension plan, only those above $100,000 income \nlevels and who actually have employer-sponsored plans benefit from IRA \nPlus.\n  Because all distributions from these IRA Plus accounts are tax free, \nthey provide a certain group of wealthy savers a home grown version of \na Swiss bank tax haven. If these IRA Plus accounts are established, \nthere is no doubt that they will be a terrific deal for those who \nparticipate. But it's not fair and not good policy to provide a tax \nwindfall to the rich and do nothing for those who are struggling to \nsave smaller sums; those less wealthy taxpayers will continue to pay \ntax on any distributions.\n  Furthermore, IRA Plus accounts create a troublesome benchmark vis a \nvis other savings vehicles. It is reasonable to ask that if IRA Plus \naccounts are tax free, then why not 401(k)'s or regular IRA's or the \nSimple Plan or corporate defined benefit programs? It would be terrific \nif all savings vehicles were tax free, but the fact is that the IRA \nPlus program alone--given the tremendous backloading in it--will blow a \nhuge hole in the budget deficit in future years.\n  While the IRA provisions in the Finance Committee tax bill start out \ncosting just $3.3 billion in the first five years, the cost surges to \n$20.5 billion in the next five years and then to an estimated $88.5 \nbillion in the following ten years. Most of this backloading comes from \nthe establishment of IRA Plus \naccounts. Furthermore, the irreversibility of this backloading will tie \nthe Nation's hands just as the crush of retiring baby boomers forces \nvery real costs on the Federal Government.\n  We should think very carefully about the consequences of setting up \nthese IRA Plus accounts. I very much hope that when this bill goes to \nconference, the conferees will tread carefully and will reconsider this \nvery troublesome provision.\n  I have other concerns including the signals that I think are \nbeing sent to hard-working New Mexican families that you have to have a \nhigh level of income and children to fully qualify for the child tax \ncredit we are providing in this bill; 70 percent of New Mexico tax \nfilers report less than $30,000 in annual income, 45 percent have less \nthan $15,000 income. It is obvious that many, many New Mexico children \nwill not be able to benefit significantly from the child tax credit.\n\n  Many here attempted to offer amendments which I supported and which \nwould have made the $500 per child tax credit refundable against \npayroll taxes; or in a different approach, would have allowed tax \nfilers to get their full EITC credit and then figure the per child \ncredit. Either of these would have ensured that millions more children \naround the Nation and more than 250,000 New Mexico children would have \nbenefited from this provision.\n  Overall, S. 949 delivers a better package of education, health, and \nchild care spending initiatives and various tax relief provisions than \nthe House bill. I wish we had done better and hope that the conferees \nwill struggle to produce an even better bill than this, rather than \ndumbing this down to many of the worst provisions in the House \ncompanion bill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns with the tax \nbill passed by the Finance Committee, and to express my support for the \nDemocratic alternative. I believe the Finance Committee bill is \nseriously flawed, and will put us on a path to exploding deficits, \nrising inflation, and future economic hardship. In a time when we are \nasking our seniors to absorb $115 billion in Medicare cuts, I think it \nis irresponsible to enact the large, across-the-board tax cuts that are \ncontemplated in this legislation--tax cuts that will add to the pain of \nbalancing the budget by the year 2002.\n  Of particular concern is the fact that these tax cuts will \ndisproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans who have already \nbenefited from the unprecedented performance of our economy and stock \nmarket over the last several years. Specifically, 42.8 percent of the \ntax cuts will go to the top 10 percent of income earners, those who \nearn more than $120,000. Meanwhile, only 2.7 percent of the benefits \nwill go to the bottom 40 percent of hard-working Americans. To continue \nthis gravy train for the well-to-do, while ignoring the economic \nanxieties faced by middle and lower income Americans, is unfair. \nNevertheless, the Finance Committee tax bill is loaded with breaks for \nthe wealthiest Americans, leaving the average taxpayer holding the bag.\n  Perhaps most illustrative of this point are three of the plan's \nlargest tax cuts--the capital gains, individual retirement accounts \n[IRA's], and estate tax provisions. The Joint Tax Committee has \nestimated that three-quarters of Americans receiving capital gains \nincome have household incomes over $100,000. Similarly, only 1.6 \npercent of estates are valued high enough to qualify for estate taxes. \nFinally, increases in the IRA income limitations will benefit only the \ntop 30 percent of taxpayers. As laudable as some of these items are, \ntheir combination, without targeting, skews this bill to favor the \naffluent over middle-income Americans.\n  Beyond favoring the wealthy, the cost of these tax cuts will \nultimately threaten the progress we have made on reducing the deficit, \nwhich is at its lowest point as a percentage of gross domestic product \n[GDP] since 1974. This is because the costs of the tax cuts, which are \nrelatively low in the early years, will explode in later years outside \nof the budget window. For example, from 1997 to 2002, the combined \nrevenue loss of the capital gains, estate tax, and IRA provisions is \n$4.3 billion. However, the revenue loss from these provisions rises \ndramatically between 2003 and 2007 to $68.7 billion. In 2007, the \ncombined costs of the capital gains, IRA, and estate tax provisions \ngrow to\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\n$18.2 billion. This is 25 times the average annual cost of these \nprovisions of $720 million, as indicated in the Joint Tax Committee \ndistribution tables for 1997 through 2002 for the Republican tax bill.\n  In addition, cuts in the capital gains tax rate will likely generate \na flurry of unproductive economic activity that may produce an \nunwelcome side effect--inflation. Because there are no requirements for \nreinvestment, a significant share of the capital gains realized will \nlikely be consumed. This increased consumption will put upward pressure \non prices and fuel the fires of inflation that we have fought so hard \nto extinguish.\n  I am supportive of the Democratic alternative because it contains \ntargeted capital gains tax cuts aimed at productive, long-term \ninvestment and savings in areas that will best-serve our economy. For \nexample, the bill provides a capital gains reduction for owners of \nsmall and startup businesses, which represent the most dynamic sector \nof the American economy. In addition, the Democratic alternative \neliminates IRA provisions in the Finance Committee bill that will lead \nto dramatic cost increases over time. Moreover, the Democratic bill \nprovides estate tax relief in a manner that will benefit true family-\nowned businesses and farms that continue to be operated by family \nmembers.\n\n  The child tax credit is yet another example of the distributional \nunfairness of the Finance Committee legislation. Because the credit is \nnonrefundable, many middle- and low-income Americans will be unable to \ntake advantage of the child tax credits. It has been estimated that \nnationwide, 47 percent of all dependent children will be completely \nineligible for the $500 tax credit because their incomes are too low. \nIn my State of Rhode Island, almost 141,000 children, or 46 percent of \nthe dependent children in the State will be ineligible for the credit \naccording to Citizens for Tax Justice.\n  The fact that almost half of this Nation's children will be denied \nthe tax credit is of great concern, and further reinforces my support \nfor the Democratic tax alternative, which goes a long way toward \nsolving this problem. The Democratic alternative improves the overall \ndistribution of the tax cut by making the child credit refundable \nagainst federal payroll taxes. This is significant because most of the \nfamilies that would otherwise be ineligible for the credit pay far more \nin payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. The Democratic \nalternative would also establish an income limitation on the tax credit \nto target the benefits to low- and middle-income families that truly \nneed the assistance.\n  Mr. President, in these times of economic prosperity, we can afford \nto, and indeed we have an obligation to invest in priorities such as \neducation that will have a positive impact on America's future. That is \nwhy I have been a strong supporter of the HOPE scholarship tax credit \nproposed by the President. While I applaud the committee for including \neducation tax credits in their bill, I am concerned about reductions \nthe committee has made in the size of the credit, which will limit its \nusefulness to many students. For this reason, I believe we should look \nto the Democratic alternative which allows for the full HOPE credit to \nbe used by students for the first $1,000 in tuition expenses. \nAdditionally, the Democratic alternative establishes a 20 percent \ntuition deduction that can be used after a student ceases to be \neligible for the HOPE credit. Together, these tax credits provide the \ntype of meaningful assistance that many middle-class students will need \nin order to meet the financial demands of postsecondary education.\n  Also, the Democratic alternative addresses the problem of crumbling \nschools that threatens our education system at the most fundamental \nlevel--elementary and secondary grades. It has been reported that in \norder to repair the costs of this country's aging schools, we will have \nto spend at least $4.8 billion. The Democratic alternative takes a step \ntoward addressing this problem by establishing a program to allocate \ntax credits among the states for the purpose of repairing and \nconstructing school facilities. We cannot hope to improve access and \nopportunity to higher education, without first ensuring that our \nelementary and secondary schools provide a physical environment that is \nconducive to learning.\n  Although hailed as the biggest tax cut since the Reagan era, the \nFinance Committee bill is perhaps a prelude to the biggest tax increase \nin our history. This is because the bill is loaded with gimmicks that \nreduce its costs in the early years, and will result in an exponential \nrise in costs beyond the 5 year budget window. Assuming that we reach a \nbalanced budget by 2002, this bill will make it virtually impossible to \nkeep our budget in balance, without raising taxes. In addition, the \nbill assumes that the U.S. economy will remain strong in the future--an \nassumption that flies in the face of the business cycle. An economic \ndownturn would dramatically increase the costs and eliminate the hope \nof a balanced budget.\n  The Finance Committee bill will also help those Americans who are \nleast in need of help. The capital gains tax cuts, estate tax cuts, and \nmany of the changes to IRA's will benefit those Americans who have \nshared most in the economic growth of recent years. I question how we \ncan afford to offer these tax cuts, while asking seniors to pay more \nfor Medicare.\n  Mr. President, as we debate this bill, I ask my colleagues to \nconsider the Democratic tax alternative. This amendment will provide \nfor a fair distribution of the tax cuts and benefit a greater number of \nAmericans. The amendment will eliminate the fiscal time bombs in the \nFinance Committee bill that will explode after 2002 and threaten our \nprogress toward a balanced budget. Finally, the amendment rightly \nfocuses on the targeted investments necessary to keep our country \nmoving forward into the 21st century.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss three provisions of \nthe Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. I begin by congratulating my \ncolleagues on the Senate Finance Committee for their efforts on this \nbill. They have worked hard to craft legislation that is forward \nlooking and sensitive to the needs of our economy, working Americans, \nand our children. For the next few minutes, I would like to highlight \nseveral provisions of the bill that I believe are particularly \nimportant to our national economy and my State of Connecticut and are \nissues that I have supported and worked on over the years.\n\n\n      economic growth and u.s. competitiveness in a global economy\n\n  The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997 is a timely piece of tax \nlegislation. It comes at a moment when our economy is in the midst of a \ntransition to one that is more global and outward looking, more \ncompetitive, and more innovative. American companies and workers, \nwhether they are in manufacturing, high-technology, or service \nindustries, are more dependent on the world economy than ever before. \nIt is with this assumption that we must consider our economic future.\n  Today in this new global economy, more Americans are taking part in \nemployee ownership programs than ever before. Employees increasingly \nhave a stake in the performance of their company and are sharing in its \ngrowth. As a result, our workers are directly benefiting from the \ndynamic economic expansion that is sweeping across our land. Our \neconomy is once again being driven by aspirations for a better living.\n  This bill represents an understanding of our new economy and the \naspirations of working Americans. It understands that education is the \nkey to social mobility and economic security; it understands that small \nbusinesses are the backbone of our economy; it understands that \nincreased savings and investment means greater independence and growth; \nand it understands that urban renovation means enlarged opportunity. It \nis a bill that sets our economy on a sound footing for the next \nmillennium.\n\n\n                                kidsave\n\n  Let me now turn to some of the specific provisions that I believe are \nat the heart of this tax legislation and the reasons why I will support \nthis bill. First, I am pleased that my colleagues have included in the \nRevenue Reconciliation Act of 1997 a child tax credit for children \nunder age 17. This provision is a modified version of a proposal \nSenator Kerrey of Nebraska and I first discussed in the 104th Congress. \nThe inclusion of Kidsave reflects forward\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\nthinking and, according to a recent New York Times editorial, ``a \nclever way to convert a pro-consumption tax cut * * * into a pro-\nsavings tax cut.'' I congratulate Senators Kerrey and Breaux and their \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle on the Finance Committee for \ntheir work on this proposal.\n  The key word here is pro-savings. At a time when one of our greatest \nchallenges is how to create economic opportunity and wealth for the \nworking families of this country, I believe Kidsave helps us meet that \nchallenge in an affordable, responsible way. If there is going to be a \ntax credit to help families with children, I believe there is no better \nway to provide that help than to offer parents the opportunity to \nensure a sound financial future for their children.\n  One additional advantage of Kidsave should be noted, although it is \nharder to quantify at this time. This is the effect of encouraging \nAmericans to save. The ethic of thriftiness seems to have been lost in \nrecent decades, replaced by a credit card mentality. We would compound \nour problems if we pass such bad habits on to future generations. \nKidsave can help us turn the tide of indebtedness into a groundswell of \nsavings and can transform our whole attitude toward money and how to \nuse it to best advantage. That will yield incalculable dividends for \nour nation down the road.\n  Kidsave will help our economy today by creating a pool of savings \navailable for investment. As you know, savings and investment rates in \nthe United States are at historic lows: our household savings rate is \n4.6 percent of disposable income, compared to Japan's 14.8 percent and \nGermany's 12.3 percent. Under the provisions of the bill, parents will \nhave the option of depositing $500 into an IRA-like account for \nchildren from birth to age 13, and be required to direct $500 into an \nIRA from age 13 to 16. This money will serve as an education fund for \nindividual children, as well as a long-term retirement account; it will \nalso provide investment capital for our economy. Most importantly, \nunlike any other proposal that has come before, Kidsave gives our \nchildren a tangible, financial head start on the rest of their lives.\n\n\n                             capital gains\n\n  I am also encouraged that the drafters of the Revenue Reconciliation \nAct of 1997 decided to include broad-based capital gains cuts and \ntargeted cuts directed toward small businesses. The bill calls for \nreducing the top rate from 28 percent to 20 percent for the highest \nearners and down to 10 percent for more modest household incomes. This \ndecision too reflects a forward-looking perspective on our economy. I \nwas pleased to cosponsor similar legislation with Senator Hatch earlier \nthis year.\n  In today's global economy, small businesses and start-ups must rely \non investors willing to take a risk on their venture. And in today's \nfinancial markets, investors are not only the wealthy, but include all \nworking Americans. As a result, the benefits of this capital gains cut \nwill not flow just to people of wealth. Anyone who has stock, who has \nmoney invested in a mutual fund, who owns a home, who has a stock \noption plan at work, has a stake in capital gains tax relief. According \nto the provisions included in this bill, homeowners will now be able to \nexempt up to $500,000 in gains from the sale of their principal \nresidence. In addition, $1.5 million in assets of a family business \nwill be exempt from estate taxes. All of this means that millions and \nmillions of middle-class American families stand to benefit from this \nbill.\n  Small businesses will also particularly benefit from the provision in \nthis bill. In a country where small businesses comprise a growing \npercentage of GDP, it is critical that their economic growth is not \nstifled by limited capital, but encouraged through greater investment. \nThe Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997 increases the size of an \neligible corporation for additional favorable capital gains treatment. \nIt also cleans up some of the implementation problems from the 1993 \ncapital gains legislation for smaller firms which I strongly supported \nat that time. This means that the thousands of smaller companies and \nstart-ups will attract more investors and capital. This will be \nespecially helpful in the capital intensive high-technology and \nbiotechnology industries where much of the growth in our economy is \ntoday.\n\n\n                              brownfields\n\n  I am also pleased to see that there is a tax relief provision for \nrestoring brownfields, abandoned commercial and industrial properties \nbelieved to be environmentally contaminated. The Revenue Reconciliation \nAct will provide clear and consistent rules regarding the Federal tax \ntreatment of certain environmental remediation expenses. This too is an \nissue that I have supported for some time. In fact, earlier this year, \nI advocated the restoration of brownfields with Senators Abraham and \nMoseley-Braun.\n  In a perfect world, I would like the clean-up of all brownfield sites \nto begin tomorrow. However, revenue constraints preclude us from doing \nso. But we do have to start somewhere and what better place to start \nthan Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, areas that have been \ndesignated as economically distressed. These are arguably the areas of \nthis country that are most in need of economic development. And that is \nprecisely what this brownfields tax incentive is designed to do--bring \neconomic development to the places that need it most. If this incentive \nworks in our most economically distressed areas, I hope this Chamber \nwill work to have this incentive cover a broader range of areas in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In closing, I would like to encourage my colleagues to vote for the \nRevenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. It is a fair and sensible bill that \nis pro economic growth and pro-job creation. At a time when we are \nfacing many economic challenges, this bill helps our companies and \nworkers more effectively compete on the global economic stage. But more \nimportantly, it is a bill that will broaden educational opportunities \nfor our children and promote economic security for their retirement.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I supported this compromise legislation in \nthe Senate Finance Committee, and I intend to support its passage on \nthe floor as well. While there are many aspects of this legislation \nwhich I believe could be improved, I applaud Chairman Roth for his \nefforts to produce a bipartisan, consensus bill that the great majority \nof the members of the committee could support.\n  One of the areas where I believe the bill does not go far enough in \ncorrecting flaws in the House Ways and Means bill, however, relates to \nthe treatment of investment in real estate. Since 1963, so-called real \nestate depreciation recapture resulting from straight line depreciation \nhas been provided the same tax rate as other forms of capital gains. \nUnder current law, this rate is 28 percent. Under the House Ways and \nMeans bill, however, an unfair differential is created between the \ngeneral capital gains rate, which is capped under the bill at 20 \npercent, and the tax rate applied to depreciation recapture, which is \nset at 26 percent.\n  Many members of the Senate Finance Committee expressed serious \nconcerns with this inequitable treatment of real estate investment, and \nsignificant efforts were made during the committee's consideration of \nthis bill to provide equal treatment for depreciation recapture. \nUnfortunately, revenue concerns limited our ability to provide the 20 \npercent rate for depreciation recapture, and, in the end, the committee \nagreed to lower the rate for depreciation recapture to 24 percent.\n  While a better result than the House Ways and Means Committee's 26-\npercent rate, the 24-percent rate in the Senate Finance bill still does \nnot place real estate investments on an equal footing with other types \nof investment.\n  I urge the leadership of both the Senate Finance Committee and the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee to reconsider this issue, and, during \nconference, to restore equal treatment for real estate investment. At a \nminimum, I urge the conference committee to resist any effort to \nincrease the tax rate for depreciation recapture any higher than the 24 \npercent included in the Senate bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the tax relief \nlegislation before the Senate.\n  This is a complex bill. Chairman Roth has done a superb job in \nworking with a vast range of issues and many different groups of \ntaxpayers to produce a generally good bill. And to explain why, I will \nstart by putting\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\nnumbers aside and reviewing the broad principles our tax policy should \nreflect.\n  First, our tax policy should pay the bills.\n  Second, it should be simple and predictable.\n  Third, it should be fair.\n  Fourth, it should promote growth.\n  And fifth, it should be as low as possible.\n  Let's begin with the first. We need to pay the bills. To take \nAlexander Hamilton's words from Federalist 30, government must:\n\n     raise troops, build and equip fleets * * * [and pay] for \n     support of the national civil list; for * * * debts \n     contracted, or that may be contracted; and, in general, for \n     all those matters which will call for disbursements out of \n     the national treasury.\n\n  These latter disbursements now include health insurance for seniors \nand the poor. Social Security checks. Highways, education, veterans \nbenefits, scientific research, clean air, clean water, and more. \nEssential services the people want and should have.\n  But we also need to pay for them. And in the past the government \nhasn't entirely paid for them. In 1992, our budget deficit stood at \n$290 billion. But in the past five years we've done much better. This \nyear, the deficit will be under $65 billion--a fall of nearly 80 \npercent.\n  And this bill will take us the rest of the way. By the year 2002, it \nwill balance the federal budget. It will pay the bills.\n  Second, it will help make our Tax Code fairer. One very important \nexample is our large cut in the estate and gift tax.\n  This tax is one of the prime causes of misery for farmers and small \nbusinesses today. These businesses hold small Montana towns and rural \ncounties together across the generations. And by imposing very high-tax \nrates and equating land or asset values with large cash inheritances, \nthe estate and gift tax often force families to sell them when an owner \ndies.\n  To cite one particular example, let me quote from a letter I received \njust last week from a veterinarian who runs a small clinic in \nKalispell. He fears that:\n\n       if I grow my business any more my heirs will have to sell \n     it to pay estate taxes.\n\n  That fear runs from Kalispell clinics to ranches in the Judith Basin \nto small businesses in every Montana town. And it extends much further. \nWhen small businesses, farms, and ranches leave the family, their \nentire neighborhoods lose something very special. It is not right, and \nit is not fair.\n  And this bill will help us put a stop to it. It will let Montana's \nfamily-owned farms and businesses exclude up to $1 million in farm and \nbusiness assets from the estate tax, allow 20-year installment payments \nfor businesses with majority family ownership, and make other reforms \nthat help make sure that young men and women can keep their family \nbusinesses in the family.\n  Third, with respect to simplicity, this bill will mean a much \nimproved Tax Code in one very important area. That is international \ntaxation.\n  Today, businesses are international. Agriculture is international. \nCompanies in air services, entertainment, high technology and basic \nmanufacturing are international. They comply with Tax Codes in other \ncountries. They hire people all over the world. They work with \nsuppliers and customers in different countries. And our international \ntax laws, mostly drafted in the 1970's, don't recognize this.\n  At that time, trade made up only about 12 percent of the \nAmerican economy. Today it is over 30 percent and growing all the time. \nAnd tax provisions which assume that international businesses are a \nrarity don't make sense any longer. They often make American companies \nless competitive, and sometimes even create perverse incentives that \npush firms to avoid hiring American citizens in foreign operations.\n\n  This bill will help bring our Tax Code into the 21st century. Not all \nthe way, but part of the way. It changes the passive foreign investment \ncompany provisions to eliminate overlaps with other tax provisions. And \nit ensures that Foreign Sales Corporation treatment applies to software \nas well as other copyright works.\n  But I must say with some regret that on the general principle of \nsimplicity, this bill is not an advance.\n  Our Tax Code today relies on several dozen different income taxes, \npayroll taxes, excise taxes, Federal Reserve deposit interest receipts, \ntariffs and Customs fees, corporate taxes and user fees to make up its \n$1.5 trillion in revenue.\n  That is confusing and complicated enough. Then add in the 135 major \ntax credits, deductions, exemptions, exclusions and deferrals, totaling \nover $500 billion in tax expenditures last year. And it gets even \nworse.\n  And this bill will not improve the situation. In fact, in some \nrespects it will worsen the problem by adding to the diversity of tax \nprovisions. That's a drawback--not serious enough to devalue the bill \nas a whole--but one we must frankly admit and return to in coming \nyears.\n  Fourth, the bill will help promote growth.\n  How can we do that? First, by promoting investment for the future. \nHelping companies create new technologies, new products and new \nmanufacturing processes. Providing some incentives to start firms and \ncreate jobs. And improving our basic infrastructure.\n  With this legislation, we do all those things.\n  We extend the research and development tax credit for two and a half \nyears.\n  We use targeted capital gains tax cuts as an incentive for investment \nin small businesses--the sector which presents the greatest risks and \nrewards, and which creates the most new jobs.\n  And we will directly increase our essential public investment in \ninfrastructure by moving the 4.3 cents per gallon in Federal gas tax \nrevenues from general revenues to the Highway Trust Fund.\n  And most important of all, we will help educate our children. Give \nthem the chance for college. Help them work with new technologies. Make \nsure the next generation of Americans has the highest level of skills \nand education in the world.\n  With this bill, we create a $20 billion HOPE scholarship. We create a \nnew deduction for interest paid on student loans. Promote life-time \nlearning by making the exclusion for employer-provided educational \nassistance permanent.\n  Our legislation is not perfect on education. I believe we can and \nshould go further on college opportunity. But it is much better than \nthe status quo.\n  And let me make a related point. That is, with this bill we help make \nsure children are ready to learn. We do this by providing $24 billion \nin this bill and the accompanying entitlement bill for children's \nhealth. Today in Montana, about 27,000 have no health insurance at all. \nMillions more around the country.\n  That is a moral scandal and a threat to our future. Today in Montana, \na typical health insurance plan for a family of four, with a $500 \ndeductible and a partial dental benefit--costs $5,580 a year. That is \nsimply out of reach for many working families.\n  And we have put together a package with a lot of money for States to \ninsure more kids. Through Medicaid, through assistance for private \ninsurance, or other options that fit a State's circumstances. This is \nwill make our country stronger and healthier in the future, and it is \nthe right thing to do for our kids today.\n  Finally, the last principle. Taxes should be low.\n  And this bill will make taxes lower. Over the next 5 years, it will \nreduce overall taxes by $85 billion.\n  Small businesses will get some more capital to help them invest and \ngrow.\n  Farmers and ranchers will find it easier to pass their land on to \ntheir sons and daughters.\n  Families with young children will have some more money to spend at \nthe movies, or in bookstores, or in contributing to charities.\n  Parents will find it a bit easier to send the kids to college.\n  That's a good thing for everyone.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this bill lives up to the principles we \nshould expect of our tax policy.\n  It will pay the bills and balance the budget.\n  It will make taxation fairer.\n  In some ways, although it could be better, it will make taxation \nsimpler.\n  It will promote growth.\n  And it will make taxes lower.\n  On the whole, it is a solid, careful, bipartisan bill. And we should \nbe proud\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\nof it. I congratulate the chairman for his work, and I hope this bill \nwill get the Senate's support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with disappointment that I oppose the \nreconciliation bill before the Senate today. I supported the budget \nagreement entered into by the congressional leadership and the \nPresident and I supported the budget resolution passed by the Congress \nlast month. Both of them provided the broad parameters for a tax \nreduction package. I was hopeful at that time that the package of tax \nreductions worked out by the Finance Committee would be targeted to \nassist working families, particularly those with children. The package \nbefore us, however, is too regressive. It does too little to assist \nworking families with education expenses, and it provides too large a \ntax break to those who need it least, at the expense of those who need \nit most. For that reason, I supported the Democratic alternative \noffered by Senator Daschle which would have provided a much larger \nproportion of its benefits, more than half of the tax cut, to middle-\nincome families, the lowest 60 percent of wage earners. Unfortunately, \nthat substitute for the committee's bill was defeated.\n  The legislation before us is out of balance. More than 42 percent of \nthe benefits of its tax cut provisions go to the top 10 percent of \nincome earners. By contrast the lowest 60 percent, middle-income \nfamilies and below, receive less than 14 percent of the benefits. In my \nview this is not equitable.\n  The broad based capital gains tax cuts and the reductions in the \nestate tax largely benefit those among us that need it least. In \ncontrast, I support the education tax cuts which the President has \nproposed, a $500 per child tax credit adequate to provide tax relief to \nmiddle-income families with children, and capital gains relief for \nhomeowners. Also, I believe that, if consistent with deficit reduction \ngoals arriving at a balanced budget, that targeted capital gains relief \nfor long-term investments and an incremental approach to estate tax \nrelief should be used.\n  Mr. President, I am also deeply concerned that this bill may result \nin large deficits in the years beyond this decade. In 1981, I opposed \nthe Reagan tax cut because I was convinced that it would lead to huge \ndeficits. We have paid dearly for the debt which resulted from that \nlegislation. Only now, 16 years later, do we finally have a realistic \nopportunity to balance the budget once again. In 1992, the deficit in \nthe Federal budget was $290 billion which represented 4.7 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. The most recent estimate of the deficit for \nfiscal year 1997 is $67 billion, approximately eight-tenths of 1 \npercent of the gross domestic product.\n  Over the 5 years from 1993 to 1998, the deficit has been reduced by \nabout $1 trillion from the deficit for those 5 years projected at the \ntime. This remarkable progress has come about in large part as a result \nof the deficit reduction package which President Clinton presented in \n1993, and which this Senate passed, without a single Republican vote, \nby a margin of one vote, the Vice President's. We should not now, by \npassing a tax bill like the one before us, head back down the road \ntoward a new large future deficits. That is why, I supported the Dorgan \namendment to sunset elements of the tax cut, if deficit reduction \ntargets were not being met, and that is another important reason I \ncannot support this bill.\n  I know that the Senate is about to pass this bill. I hope that the \nconferees, the House and Senate leadership, and the President will \nengage in future negotiations which will result in a final product \nwhich is more equitable, which does more to invest in our children \nthrough their education, and which does not risk large deficits in the \nyears after the turn of the century.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if one looks back in our Nation's history, \none cannot help but see numerous examples of both the great strengths \nand weaknesses of representative democratic government. Compared to \nother nations and societies in the world, it is more difficult for us \nto hide or camouflage our mistakes to a considerable degree. If we look \nclosely, we can identify indicators for which we in public service \nshould be watchful, lest we repeat our errors.\n  I fear we are repeating errors we have made in the past as the Senate \npasses the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, and the intimately \nrelated budget reconciliation Bill that passed earlier this week.\n  For all of us who are politicians and who hold or seek elective \noffice, it is often difficult, Mr. President, to resist the temptation \nto play to the gallery--to do the popular thing. And there are few \nthings that get political juices flowing more readily than cutting \ntaxes. If one looks only skin deep, a tax cut of almost any kind looks \nappealing. After all, those who benefit will be pleased to accept the \nbenefit. And a tax cut does not directly take anything away from \nothers.\n  As is not infrequently the case, however, an honest analysis must \nlook beyond that kind of ``quick-and-dirty'' first appearance. Tax \npolicy has two dramatic effects on the Nation and its people. It \ninescapably is the determinant of the resources the Federal Government \nwill have to meet national needs, ranging from defending our national \nsecurity to preserving the environment to ensuring health care is \navailable to those who need it to managing our national parks and \nforests to deterring criminal acts and identifying, pursuing, \narresting, convicting, and incarcerating those who commit crimes \nagainst society.\n  Mr. President, when the Senate took up the package of two bills \nproduced by the Senate Finance Committee to implement the so-called \nbudget deal that had been negotiated by the White House and the \ncongressional leadership, again and again I was brought back to two \nstark conclusions.\n  First, I was terribly disappointed that, once again, the Congress \nseemed to lose sight of the original objective. We started out on this \nbudget track with the objective of putting in place a fiscal plan that \nwould take us to a balanced budget in 5 years. We knew that, in order \nto do that, we would have to obtain economies in many important \nGovernment services and programs on which Americans in all walks of \nlife depend. Incongruously, somewhere along the way, the urge to take \nthe easy way to political popularity took over, and the effort to \ndevelop the budget deal and then the legislation to implement the \nbudget deal was consumed by the passion of making huge tax cuts. At a \ntime when we have agreed that the route to a balanced budget is so \npainful that we cannot accomplish that objective in less than 5 years, \nthose who developed the plan and the legislation insisted that we cut \ntaxes by $135 billion in gross and $85 billion in net over that period.\n  Mr. President, a student will not even be out of elementary school \nmathematics before he or she has the capacity to know that tax cuts of \nthat magnitude represent movement in precisely the opposite direction \nto the goal of obtaining a balanced budget while not hurting our \nnation's ability to meet its national needs.\n  I want to emphasize immediately that I am not categorically opposed \nto tax reductions. To the contrary, I favor targeted tax cuts of \nreasonable dimensions designed not just to slash federal revenues but \nto achieve purposes that are in the Nation's interest. I was a leader \nin Democratic efforts here on the Senate floor to pass a tax reduction \npackage--a much fairer package than the one presented to the Senate by \nthe Finance Committee and a package that identified clear national \ninterest objectives and devoted its resources to meeting those \nobjectives. I will have more to say about that in a moment.\n\n  Second, I was terribly disappointed when I examined the specifics of \nthe budget proposals to see the extent to which its benefits were \nskewed to those in the highest income brackets. The past several years \nhave been extremely kind to the well-off in our Nation. Those who \nalready possessed a disproportionate share of capability, capital, and \nopportunity have prospered mightily. Those who crafted this budget \npackage provided the greatest share of its benefits to this privileged \nportion of our population. Those at the other end of the economic \nspectrum--those who struggle the hardest to make ends meet, and for \nwhom life is far more of a challenge--would receive virtually nothing, \nor nothing at all, of its benefits. The word ``unfair'' is not \nsufficiently stark to adequately describe the overall effect of this \npackage.\n  For those of us who, over time, have made the hard judicious, \nmoderate,\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\nmeasured choices to bring the Federal budget into balance, there is \ntremendous disappointment in this outcome. When this budget process \nbegan this year, I enthusiastically wanted to participate in the \nprocess and support its outcome. I have long called for our political \nstructure to demonstrate the fiscal discipline to balance the Federal \nbudget, and have insisted that we do so in a way that is fair, and in a \nway that recognizes the Nation's fundamental needs and does not \nemasculate our Government's ability to address them. I and many others \nhave worked arduously to break the spiraling deficits which plagued our \nNation for a decade and to provide a solid economic foundation for our \nNation as we move into the 21st century.\n  We made a very important installment payment toward this goal in \n1993, when Democrats in the Congress, with the leadership of President \nClinton--and without a single Republican vote in either House--passed \nlegislation that dramatically cut the deficit and put us in striking \nrange of where we find ourselves today. I have long waited for the day \nwhen the benefits of our hard work would be as obvious as they are \ntoday. In the four years since that action in 1993, we have witnessed \nprosperity unprecedented in recent years. In five years, we cut the \ndeficit from $290 billion to $67 billion. Interest rates are subdued. \nWe are seeing the lowest unemployment and inflation rates and the \nlargest drop in poverty rates in a generation. Consumer confidence has \nshown the greatest improvement since the Eisenhower administation and \nthe value of the stock market has doubled since 1993--the fastest \ngrowth since the Second World War.\n  By enactment of the 1993 budget legislation, Democrats proved that it \nis possible to take a fiscally responsible course toward a balanced \nbudget and extend health care to children, provide broader educational \nopportunities, ensure the future for our senior citizens, and safeguard \nour environment. This certainly is not a picture which is without its \nproblems, and we must address those problems. But the overall picture \nis a very appealing one, indeed.\n  Even the possibility of the legislation before us now--a conceptually \nbalanced budget with tax breaks--is testament to the application of \nDemocratic ideals to fiscal policy. We have been successful because, \nsince the Great Depression, our party has stuck by the fundamental \nbelief that sound economic and social policy go hand-in-glove, that our \nNation is stronger when all Americans have equivalent economic \nopportunity. Thomas Jefferson taught us that ours is a n ation of the \ncommon man and enshrined this belief in one of our most treasured \ndocuments when he wrote of the self-evident truth that all men are \ncreated equal. Andrew Jackson echoed this creed when he restated the \nparty's commitment to the ``humble members of our society--the farmers, \nmechanics and laborers.'' That commitment, that core set of beliefs, \nis, in fact, Mr. President, the essence of the American dream and the \nfoundation of what has become the greatest contribution this Nation has \nprovided to the world's social economic history--the growth of a \nvibrant middle class.\n\n  Universal economic opportunity, sound fiscal policy based on \nequitable distribution of benefits and assistance to those most in \nneed--those are the fundamentals of Democratic economic policy. That is \nthe goal of the program we put in place in 1993, and that is the end to \nwhich our fiscal policies are directed. Franklin Roosevelt reminded us \nof our commitment to expanding opportunity when he said: ``the spirit \nof opportunity is the kind of spirit that has led us as a nation--not \nas a small group but as a nation--to meet very great problems.''\n  Mr. President, as Democrats, we believe that deficit reduction is a \nmeans to an end. We believe that tax breaks are a means to an end. But, \nunlike the Republicans, we do not subscribe to the callow notion that \ndeficit reduction is an economic policy in and of itself or that tax \nbreaks are an end which justify any means. We do not believe that \ncutting vital programs is a courageous or visionary act. We believe \nthat courage lies in advancing economic opportunity: this requires \nwisdom, innovation, and conscience. It is chilling that this dichotomy \nof political and economic philosophy remains as obviously demarcated \ntoday as it was 100 years ago. Yesterday I re-read the cogent \ndescription by William Jennings Bryan of the two opposing ideas of \ngovernment. He separated the parties into those who ``legislate to make \nthe well-to-do prosperous and wait for their prosperity to leak through \non those below, or those who legislate to make the masses prosperous \nand ensuring that their prosperity will find its way up through every \nclass which rests upon them.''\n  Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator, I have an obligation to the \nconstituents who elected me to represent their interests, to act on \ntheir behalf and to present their views to this body. I cannot turn \naway from the long history which has shaped my core sense of fairness, \nmy overarching insistence on making Government work for the common good \nand the needs of my constituents--all in order to satisfy the \nparameters of a political deal. Mr. President, for that reason, I voted \nagainst the tax portion of the reconciliation bill as I voted against \nthe spending portion.\n  The problem, when distilled to its essence, Mr. President, is that \nthis legislation, which has been called by some the Tax Fairness Act, \nwould be better called the Tax Unfairness Act.\n  Mr. President, I have great admiration for the work of the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Senator Roth, who chairs the Finance Committee and my \nfriend from New York, Senator Moynihan, who serves as that committee's \nranking member. They produced a tax bill that is improved considerably \nfrom the gravely flawed piece of legislation passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. But, Mr. President, without additional improvements I \ncannot support it or its companion spending programs reconciliation \nbill.\n  During the course of debate this week, we attempted to shape the \nlegislation so it would address more of the problems of more Americans, \nand thereby become a fairer piece of legislation, but time and again we \nwere rebuffed by the Republican majority.\n  Some of my colleagues, who share many of my concerns about the bill \nand my judgment that, in its current form, it neither is fair nor will \nin the long run prove beneficial to our Nation, chose today to vote for \nthe tax bill, hoping devoutly that with the President's active \ninvolvement in the conference committee that will convene to resolve \ndifferences between the Senate-passed bill and the bill the House \npassed earlier, a better, fairer bill will emerge and will come back to \nthe Senate for its approval. But I believe that the product before us \ntoday is so flawed in such critical respects that I could not vote for \nit in its current form. I join my colleagues who hope for it to be \nimproved in conference committee. I want to be able to vote for a bill \nthat provides tax reductions that will benefit Americans fairly, and \nwill not concentrate its benefits on those who least need them while \ntotally excluding those hard-working, tax-paying Americans who most \nneed the additional assistance.\n\n  The Democratic alternative to the Finance Committee's bill which I \njoined the Democratic leader and other Democratic Senators in offering \nyesterday was designed so that our education tax breaks, our capital \ngains and estate tax reductions and our child credit corrected the \nbasic inequity found in the Finance Committee proposal: the flow of \nbenefits chiefly to the wealthiest Americans.\n  In the committee's package, nearly 43 percent of the breaks go to the \nwealthiest 10 percent of Americans--those who earn more than $120,000. \nIn its plan, Mr. President, 60 percent of hard-working poor and middle \nclass Americans get only 12.7 percent of the tax breaks, while the \nrichest 1 percent of Americans get 13 percent of the benefits. Mr. \nPresident, in the Finance Committee proposal, the poorest 60 percent \nget only as much in aggregate as the richest 1 percent. This is a new \nstandard of unfairness. This is anathema to the party of Jefferson and \nJackson and Truman and Roosevelt.\n  During the course of the debate, I heard some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle justify this counterintuitive distribution by \narguing that since the rich make the most money, the rich will \nnecessarily benefit the most from a tax cut. But this skewed \ndistribution is not necessary. In our alternative, Democrats showed\n\n[[Page S6715]]\n\nthat it is indeed possible to craft a tax package which is targeted to \nthose who need help and not lavish more on the rich. We designed tax \nbreaks which are affordable and which meet a common-sense and economic \ntest of basic fairness.\n  In the Democratic alternative, the poorest 60 percent of Americans \nwould have received 46 percent of the tax cuts. These are the same \nAmericans who receive only 13 percent of the breaks in the Finance \nCommittee's plan. In the Finance Committee proposal, middle class \nAmericans--those earning between $30,000 and $85,000--receive a scant \n30 percent of the benefits. Under our plan, these middle class \nAmericans would have done twice as well: 57 percent of the benefits in \nour plan go to hard-working, middle class Americans.\n  The Democratic alternative would have helped those who actually need \na tax break to raise a child, to go to college, to start a business, to \ngenerate high-wage 21st century jobs and to grow our economy. Our \nalternative was based on principles which have guided our party for two \ncenturies, and followed the basic economic philosophy which has served \nour Nation so well since 1993.\n  Another feature of the Finance Committee's plan troubles me \nimmensely, and I believe it should trouble all Americans. According to \nthe computations of the Joint Tax Committee and other reputable \nprojections, the cost of the tax cut explodes in future years--it is a \nfiscal timebomb. In the first 5 years, the cost of these inequitable \ncuts is $85 billion. I believe we can afford a cut of that size and \nhave stated so publicly--if it is carefully structured, usefully \ntargeted to need and social benefit, and fairly distributed. But, Mr. \nPresident, in the second 5 years of the Finance Committee's plan, the \ncost of these cuts will escalate to $250 billion. And, in the 10 years \nafter that--when baby boomers will be retiring and straining Medicare \nand Social Security coffers--the cost will be between $650 to $700 \nbillion. That is exactly the type of fiscal irresponsibility we avoided \nin our alternative.\n\n  I was not here in 1981 when the Congress passed a large tax reduction \nbill, Mr. President. But the entire time I have served here--since \n1984--the Congress has struggled to deal with the history-making \ndeficits and resulting all-time-high national debt that resulted from \nthat irresponsible tax cut. I cannot support legislation that, even if \nof a lesser magnitude as this bill surely is, will have an out-years \nexplosive effect that will saddle Americans in future years, and their \nelected representatives, with a recurrence of the deficit and debt \nproblems that have beset us for nearly two decades. Most destructively, \nthis explosion will occur just as the baby boomers are reaching \nretirement age and beginning to place an unprecedented demand on \nretirement and medical programs and other governmental services. It is \na looming problem universally acknowledged. Yet instead of doing \neverything in our power to reduce its severity and to take gradual \nsteps to resolve it, we are considering and passing legislation that \nwill dramatically increase its dimensions, narrow the range of \nsolutions, and complicate the task of addressing it. That is not \nleadership, Mr. President. That is folly.\n  In the Democratic alternative tax proposal, we attempted to reduce \nthe capital gains taxes in a measured way. In the past, broad capital \ngains tax cuts have been used to spur economic growth when the economy \nwas lagging. In the past, across-the-board capital gains cuts have been \nused to encourage the movement of capital into investment that would \ncreate jobs because unemployment was high. In the past, broad capital \ngains tax cuts have served as a shot of adrenaline for an ailing \neconomic system. But today, such emergency measures are neither needed \nnor appropriate.\n  Mr. President, as a question of fundamental economics, there is no \njustification for broad capital gains tax cuts at this time. There is \nno need to expend precious budget resources to reward the wealthiest \nAmerican families for the sale of art work or Persian rugs or luxury \ngoods they have held for a generation.\n  Again, Mr. President, I am not saying that we cannot afford a capital \ngains tax cut. For years, I have believed that a targeted tax break can \nshape economic policy and can display economic vision. But, I ask, what \nis the benefit to our economy if a wealthy American only has to pay 20 \npercent instead of 28 percent on the gains he accrues from selling his \nyacht? Where is the economic vision in that kind of a Tax Code change?\n  Mr. President, there are ways to aim a capital gains tax cut--\ntargeted, sensible ways--to use taxation of capital to leverage growth \nand job creation in those areas. That is a tax policy with vision, with \na goal, with an economic priority. The economic priority, Mr. \nPresident, is not an across-the-board capital gains cut such as the one \npresented by the Finance Committee.\n  The priority is a targeted tax cut in areas which could use the added \neconomic stimulus, such as emerging small businesses, or start-up \ncompanies, or parts of the inner cities and rural areas which could use \nthe jobs. That is what we Democrats included in our tax proposal. And \nthat is a policy which I have fought for--along with the senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Bumpers and other Senators--for nearly a decade. \nMr. President, our plan would have improved on a provision we passed in \n1993 by allowing a 50-percent exclusion for capital gains on qualified \nsmall business stock held for at least 5 years. Qualified small \nbusinesses under this proposal would be defined as having $100 million \nin assets and would be start-up, small, high-technology ventures.\n\n  Our plan would have cost $10 billion--it did not break the budget in \nthe future like the capital gains provision in the Finance Committee \nplan. Mr. President, more than 90 percent of the cost of the Republican \ncapital gains plan comes after 2002. To use computer terminology, Mr. \nPresident, this is a latent virus--it will emerge full blown in later \nyears to exact a terrible toll on those who at that point will have the \nresponsbility for delivering essential services to Americans while \noperating a balanced Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, while the Finance Committee plan does a great deal to \nhelp wealthy Americans in its capital gains and estate tax cuts, it \ndoes not extend the same broad-based cuts to help hard-working middle \nclass families raising children. Our alternative would have done more \nfor precisely those families who can use the help the most. And those \nare the families--young families with young children--who will be doing \nthe most for our country in the future.\n  Today, Mr. President, I attempted to correct this basic inequity by \noffering an amendment which would have improved the bill by \ntransforming the child tax credit so that it would be refundable \nagainst payroll taxes paid by all working families. Most Americans pay \nmore in payroll taxes than income taxes. Income taxes have remained \nstable for most Americans in the past 10 years while payroll taxes have \nincreased 17 percent. Allowing Americans to offset the credit against \nthese payroll taxes would have broadened its application to many \nadditional American families--hard-working families at the lower end of \nthe economic spectrum. This is in distinct contrast with the Finance \nCommittee plan under which nearly 40 percent of America's children are \nexcluded from the tax credit. Those 40 percent are the children of the \npoorest families in the Nation.\n  The judgment I reached on Wednesday about the reconciliation bill \nthat applies to mandatory spending programs was similar and related, \nMr. President. It is painfully apparent that we must take prudent, fair \nsteps to restrain the growth of some of our so-called entitlement \nprograms so that they do not rage out of control and threaten our \nability not only to meet the needs they are designed to meet but the \nhost of other critical national needs to which discretionary programs \nare addressed. But the objective was lost in the stampede to provide a \nhuge tax cut to upper-income Americans. The spending programs \nreconciliation bill cut far more deeply into critical programs like \nMedicare and Medicaid than was required to achieve necessary savings. \nAnd for what purpose? To provide the cushion enabling Republicans to \nincrease the size of the tax cut to the wealthy by scores of billions \nof dollars.\n  The worst part of this spending bill is the increase in the Medicare \neligibility age from 65 to 67. This will cause the\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\nnumber of uninsured older Americans to increase substantially, moving \nthe United States even further away from the goal of universal health \ncoverage. For many seniors age 65 to 67, this will make purchasing \nprivate health insurance unaffordable--especially those who have pre-\nexisting conditions. Private policies cost seniors approximately $6,000 \na year, and more than $10,000 if they have any pre-existing \nconditions--if they are able to get insurance coverage at all.\n  Mr. President, raising the eligibility age is bad policy because most \nseniors do not have access to employer-provided private health \ninsurance now and the problem is getting worse: according to a recent \nCommonwealth Fund study, the number of retirees with health insurance \nfrom a previous employer decreased from 44 percent in 1988 to 30 \npercent in 1994.\n\n  Although some argue that this increase in the eligibility age is \nsimilar to the increase in the age for Social Security eligibility that \nis being phased in, Social Security still provides early retirement \nbenefits at age 62. Medicare, on the other hand, will not provide an \noption for health care coverage for early retirees, many of whom have \nnot retired voluntarily. Finally, businesses correctly oppose this \nprovision because they realize the huge cost it will impose upon them. \nEighty major corporations and the National Association of Manufacturers \nrecently wrote to the Senate to ask it not to raise the eligibility \nage.\n  I am also opposed to the $5 home health visit co-payment which was \nnot part of the balanced budget agreement with the President. This co-\npayment will primarily hurt elderly women who need this help the most: \nover half of the group who would no longer be able to afford home \nhealth services are women age 75 and older who have incomes below \n$15,000. I am also concerned that increasing the cost of home health \nvisits is not cost-effective because many poor seniors will be forced \ninto institutions at much greater public cost than continuing to stay \nat home.\n  I also oppose the Medical Savings Accounts [MSAs] provisions in the \nbill. Although the number of MSA enrollees would be limited to 100,000, \nthere is no reason to test MSAs beyond the study begun in the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill. We are spending $1.5 billion through that bill \nand at the very least we should wait to see the results from that study \nbefore we authorize more demonstrations.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the cuts in the Medicaid Program \nwhich is the bedrock health program for children, disabled people, and \npoor seniors. The spending bill would cut $13.6 billion from the \nprogram, the bulk of which comes from cutting payments to hospitals \nthat treat a large number of uninsured patients. These payments, called \nDisproportionate Share Hospital [DSH] payments, are essential to many \nhospitals across this country that provide health care to our poorest \ncitizens. Although it may be necessary to more effectively target these \nfunds, this funding has enabled hospitals to continue their role as an \ninstitutional safety net for those with no other access to health care.\n  Mr. President, there unquestionably are some sound provisions in \nthese two bills. There are provisions I strongly support. But my job as \nthe Senator elected by the people of Massachusetts is to examine the \noverall effects of the legislation the Senate considers and to \ndetermine if, on balance, it serves the interests of the Commonwealth \nand its citizens, and the people across our United States and their \ninterests.\n  I would like to support a budget package that will reach balance in \n2002 since I have long advocated such a step. I would like to support a \nbill that achieves economies in mandatory spending programs to put us \non a pathway toward balance. I would like to support a tax bill that \ntargets tax reductions to Americans who need them and that will help \ncreate jobs and extend our current situation of economic strength. I \nstill hold out hope that I will be able to do so when these bills \nreturn from conference committee.\n  But, sadly, they did not pass that test as they came before the \nSenate for final passage, and I was constrained to vote against them.\n\n\n                             CAPITAL GAINS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this tax legislation, as passed by the \nSenate Finance Committee, goes a long way toward assisting our Nation's \nfamilies. For example, reducing the capital gains tax rate from 28 \npercent to 20 percent will stimulate savings and investment. This \nincreased investment will, in turn, foster economic growth.\n  In particular, I would like to draw your attention to a provision \nthat will have considerable impact on our Nation's families: the \ncapital gains exclusion for homeowners who sell their primary \nresidence. Under current law, capital gains from the sale of principal \nresidences is subject to taxation, with two limited exceptions. First, \nunder the rollover provision, taxpayers can rollover gains from the \nsale of a principal residence into a new residence. They can then defer \nany capital gains tax--but only if the purchase price of the new home \nexceeds the adjusted sales price of the old one. And to restrict this \neven more, the new residence must be purchased within 2 years of the \nsale of the first home.\n  A second exemption ties the capital gains tax to age. At age 55, a \ntaxpayer can exclude up to $125,000 of any accumulated gain from the \nsale of a principal residence. And this is a one-time-only opportunity. \nWorse yet, even this is restricted. To qualify for the exclusion, the \ntaxpayer must have owned the residence and used it as a principal \nresidence for at least 3 years during the five years before the sale. \nAlso, a taxpayer is eligible for the exclusion only if neither the \ntaxpayer nor the taxpayer's spouse has previously benefitted from the \nexclusion.\n  Unfortunately, the very provisions which are supposed to relieve \nhomeowners from taxation often prevent them from making the soundest \nfinancial decisions. Under current law, to avoid being taxed, most \npeople wait until they are eligible for the one-time exclusion, or they \nmake what may be imprudent decisions regarding the sale of their homes.\n  For example, many families, after their children have moved out, \nwould like to sell their home and buy a less expensive one. However, \nthe rollover provision means that they will have to pay taxes on the \ndifference between the profit gained on the sale of their old home and \nthe cost of their new home. As a result, these families often choose to \nbuy more expensive homes or not to sell their home at all. Mr. \nPresident, that is not right. People should be able to move when and \nwhere they want to, not when the tax code makes it financially \npossible.\n  Under the legislation passed by the Finance Committee, taxpayers of \nany age could exclude gain on the sale of a principal residence of up \nto $500,000 for married couples filing a joint return, and up to \n$250,000 for single taxpayers. To be eligible, the taxpayer must have \nowned and used the home as the principal residence for at least two of \nthe last 5 years prior to the sale. The exclusion will generally be \navailable once every 2 years.\n  This legislation will give our Nation's families more freedom in \ndeciding where to live. This decision can be based on family \ncircumstances rather than on the Tax Code. The bill would also relieve \nnearly all families of the burdensome record-keeping requirements and \nconstraints on decision making under current law. The impact on our \nNation's families will be tremendous, and I look forward to the \nenactment of this legislation.\n  This bill will significantly impact our Nation's families. It will \npromote investment and boost long-term economic growth. And a healthy \neconomy translates to increased opportunities for American families to \nsecure their future. Our Nation's taxpayers work hard to provide for \ntheir families. This legislation is a chance for us to lend them a \nhelping hand in that task.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the halls of the Capitol have been filled \nrecently with cheers and rejoicings for the balanced-budget agreement \nreached between President Clinton and the Congressional leadership in \nMay of this year. We have been told time and time again that balancing \nthe budget is crucial to the future of our Nation and that enacting \nthis budget agreement will eliminate the Federal deficit. Well, Mr. \nPresident, I find it interesting that the reconciliation legislation \nbefore the Senate today has nothing to do with balancing the budget. \nRather, S.\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\n949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, will bring us farther away \nfrom our collective goal of balancing the budget by reducing revenues \nsome $76 billion below what they would otherwise be over the next five \nyears.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has already approved legislation this week \nto balance the Federal budget. On Wednesday, June 25, the Senate \napproved S. 947, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997. \nDespite its deficiencies, that legislation provides for some $127 \nbillion in deficit reduction over the next five years. These savings, \ncoupled with the $96 billion in discretionary savings provided in the \nBudget Resolution, will likely produce a balanced budget in the next \nfive years. While I had intended to support passage of the first \nreconciliation bill, I became deeply concerned about a provision in the \nbill emanating from the Finance Committee that would raise the \neligibility age for Medicare from sixty-five to sixty-seven years. As \nreported, the bill already included a provision to create a National \nBipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare to study ways to \npreserve and protect the Medicare program for future generations. If \nthe bill thus created a commission to study and propose recommendations \nto protect Medicare in the future, why was the aforementioned increase \nin the eligibility age included in this bill? Is that not why we are \ncreating the commission in the first place? Mr. President, the \nimportant and controversial issue of raising the eligibility age for \nMedicare beneficiaries should be decided by a national debate--not in \nthe opaque cloaking of a reconciliation bill. Thus, because of my deep \nconcerns about this provision on both substantive and procedural \ngrounds--and my general frustration with the haste and confusion with \nwhich the Senate was considering the overall measure--I decided not to \nsupport passage of the first reconciliation bill. However, let me \naffirm that my vote against this measure in no way reflects any \nunwillingness on my part to pass spending cuts to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn back to the pending matter, the \nRevenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. All Senators should be aware that, \non the heels of approving a deficit-reduction plan to balance the \nbudget, we are about to approve subsequent legislation to weaken--and \npossibly undermine--that very balanced-budget plan. I have not kept \nsecret my fervent opposition to this foolish idea of cutting taxes \nwhile simultaneously trying to balance the budget. Doing so is simply \nso illogical that a third-grade student, with just a pencil, paper, and \na modest knowledge of the fundamentals of mathematics, would be \nsufficiently equipped to reach the same conclusion that tax cuts and \ndeficit reduction do not mix. I am confident that such a student would \nchoose, like this Senator chooses, not to include such tax cuts in a \nplan to balance the budget.\n\n  Mr. President, as I stated in my remarks on the Budget Resolution \napproved last month, by including these tax cuts in this balanced-\nbudget plan, we are with one hand digging deeper the very hole our \nother hand is trying so hard to fill. We should not rely on such \nambidexterity to balance the budget. We should shelve all tax cuts \nuntil after we firmly erase the budget deficits that have so plagued \nour nation in recent years. Tax cuts were, after all, the primary \nculprit for the rapid escalation in the federal budget deficit in the \n1980's. It is all too easy to enact tax cuts and save the pain for \nlater. We have done it before, and the lessons learned from that \nexercise should instruct us not to do it again.\n  Mr. President, traditionally, one of the most powerful arguments in \nfavor of tax cuts has been that they spur economic growth. I do \nrecognize that properly constructed tax cuts can produce some positive \neconomic results in certain circumstances. However, no matter how \nstrongly one believes that tax cuts stimulate economic growth--and \nthere are some in this body who unequivocally adhere to the supply-side \ndogma--there can be no sound argument made now that tax cuts are \nnecessary to boost the economy at this time. We are currently in our \nsixth consecutive year of economic growth, the stock market continues \nto reach record high after record high, unemployment has just dipped \nbelow five percent, and inflation has remained in check. Mr. President, \nsuch a performance hardly bolsters the case that tax relief is \nnecessary to inject new life into our economy.\n  If anything, Mr. President, our current economic situation should \nreinforce the notion that reducing the deficit is more conducive to \neconomic growth than cutting taxes. To illustrate this point, let me \nremind all Senators what actions have led to four straight years of \ndeclining deficits and to one of the healthiest American economies in \nthe last thirty years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe FY 1997 budget deficit will be approximately $67 billion, or less \nthan one percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Just five years ago, \nwe were facing a budget deficit of $290 billion, or about 4.7 percent \nof GDP. This considerable improvement in the fiscal order of our nation \ndid not occur by accident. Rather, it can be traced directly to the \npassage in 1993 of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act (OBRA-93) \nby the 103rd Congress and its subsequent signing by President Clinton. \nThat legislation combined responsible spending cuts and revenue \nincreases to begin the painful--but necessary--process of eliminating \nthe deficit. There can be no doubt of the success of OBRA-93 in \nbringing down the deficit and stimulating economic growth. OBRA-93 \nachieved such positive economic results not by cutting taxes, but \nrather by convincing financial markets that we were serious about \nreducing the deficit. These markets drove interest rates downward and \nconsequently rewarded American taxpayers with lower interest payments \non the federal debt, as well as lower interest payments for the \npurchase of a home, car, or an education.\n\n  Mr. President, even if I were convinced that we must cut taxes before \nbalancing the budget, I would also hope that any such proposal would \nnot explode revenue losses in the long term. Unfortunately, S. 949 is \nflawed when judged by this standard. As reported, this legislation \nincludes a significant backloading of many of its tax cuts to mask \ntheir true cost. As such, while the bill purports to reduce taxes by no \nmore than $85 billion over the next five years, I suspect that these \ntax cuts will cost considerably more in the out years than we are being \nled to believe. The Joint Committee on Taxation's estimates reveal that \nthe annual cost of these tax cuts would more than double between the \nyears 2002 and 2007--thus reducing federal revenues at the same time \nour nation is preparing to face the rising entitlement costs that will \nstem from the retirement of the so-called ``Baby Boomers.'' I defy \nanyone to explain to me the flawed logic inherent in this proposal.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me explain my views on the Democratic \nalternative amendment that was offered by the distinguished Minority \nLeader. In looking at the Senator's proposal, I saw that he had made a \nconsiderable effort to ensure that these tax cuts are more fairly \ndistributed and that the cuts do not explode in the long term. For this \nimprovement, I applaud Senator Daschle and the other Members who have \nworked on this proposal, which is, in this Senator's opinion, an \nimprovement over the pending legislation. However, I was unable to \nsupport his amendment to this legislation because it also provided for \ntax cuts prior to balancing the budget--a notion that I cannot \nphilosophically accept. I hope that my vote against this proposal is \nnot misconstrued as anything else but a determined, unyielding \nopposition to tax cuts at this time.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, despite my unequivocal opposition to \nthis pending reconciliation bill, I would like to commend the members \nof the majority and minority leadership, and the Budget and Finance \nCommittees, who have been able to bridge the gap between the White \nHouse and both parties in Congress to forge the budget compromise that \nwe have considered this week. I know how difficult such compromise can \nbe to reach, and, more importantly, to sustain. Nevertheless, I would \nmuch prefer not to have seen these tax cuts being debated at this time \non the Senate floor. Such a debate is akin to arguing with your mother \non whether or not you can eat dessert before finishing your broccoli. \nWe may all want to eat the sweet and leave the vegetable, but we should \nknow better--and our mothers would surely remind\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nus so. I fear that the Senate will come to regret the action it takes \non this legislation, though only the passage of time can be the final \narbiter in this debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the vote we're about to take will be one of \nthe most important any of us will ever cast.\n  The decision before us is as important as our families and as large \nas the American future.\n  If this is not an historic moment, then it is as close to it as most \nof us will ever come.\n  Several weeks ago, when we first reached the broad outlines of an \nagreement with the President, I called it a victory, not for a party or \na person, but for the American people.\n  We can reaffirm that today. We listened to the American people. We \nknew what they wanted us to do.\n  And somehow, by the grace of God and the endurance of Pete Domenici \nand Bill Roth, we did it.\n  We set out to lower the tax burden on the American people. We did so. \nIn this bill, more than 75 percent of the tax breaks go to people with \nincomes under $75,000.\n  We set out to make the Tax Code family-friendly. We did so. After far \ntoo many years of talking about a tax credit for children, we're \nfinally approving one. In addition, we're making it easier for families \nto save for the costs of education.\n  On top of that, we're expanding the availability of IRA's to \nvirtually all homemakers in the country. And we're easing the death tax \non family farms and businesses.\n  This bill rides in tandem with the Balanced Budget Act the Senate \npassed 2 days ago.\n  That marks a turning point in the way Congress deals with the \nentitlement programs that have driven our country to the depths of \nindebtedness.\n  Even more important, it fulfills our commitment to strengthen and \npreserve Medicare, not only for today's beneficiaries but for those who \nwill depend on that program in the years ahead.\n  Taken together, what the Senate and House have done this week gives \nthe American people the assurance of something they have not had in \nthree decades: a long-term balanced budget.\n  That, of course, is more than an end in itself. It is the surest way \nto touch off a dynamic economic expansion that will make the first \nyears of the new century an opportunity decade.\n  What we have done this week, and what we do today, is more than an \nexercise in bookkeeping. It is a commitment of the heart to an America \nwhere every willing worker can find a good job, where industry and \nthrift are rewarded, and where every family can aspire to a better \nlife.\n  And yet, this is not a perfect bill. I wish we could have reduced \ntaxes more, just as I wanted to reduce spending more in the Balanced \nBudget Act.\n  But we had to craft both pieces of legislation through compromise and \nconsensus. If the American people understood everything we were up \nagainst these last few weeks, they would be amazed that we were able to \ndo for them as much as we did.\n  This is not the end of the story. We have one hurdle left, and that \nis the highest of them all.\n  After passing this bill, we will go to conference with the House. I \nwill do all I can to make that conference quick and productive.\n  Our hurdle--our challenge--will be to preserve the historic work of \nthe Senate and the House in the face of opposition, and perhaps veto \nthreats, from the administration.\n  On behalf of our entire Republican leadership, and all Senators who \nwill be our conferees, I want to give this pledge to the American \npeople:\n  We will go the extra mile to advance this legislation that is so \nvital to you. We will do our utmost to work out disagreements with the \nPresident.\n  But by the same token, we will not agree to any settlement that \ndenies your tax cuts or turns them into the kind of tax fiddling that \ndoes nothing to advance opportunity and job creation.\n  So as we prepare the conference report on these two bills, we will \nlisten in good faith to anyone who speaks in good faith.\n  We will share credit, take blame, and let others have the spotlight. \nBut we are not going to yield on matters of principle.\n  With that in mind, Mr. President, I urge the passage of the Taxpayers \nRelief Act as the Senate's Independence Day salute to the taxpayers of \nAmerica.\n\n\n                             byrd rule list\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       ORDER FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nwrap-up of the chairman and ranking member, there be a period for the \ntransaction of morning business with Senators permitted to speak \ntherein for up to 5 minutes each. I know there are some Senators here \nwishing to speak. I don't know if the Senators have any wrap-up that \nthey need to do from the Finance Committee. But once that is done, we \ncan continue on to the 5-minute order for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to express my sincere gratitude \nto my colleagues and good friends who have been instrumental to the \nsuccessful culmination of this important budget reconciliation process. \nI am gratified by the results. I think we have indeed made history. We \nhave passed a reconciliation package that balances the budget, while \noffering American families their first real tax cut in 16 years.\n  I am happy to say that we have done it in a bipartisan way. It never \ncould have happened, in my humble judgment, without the good will, \ncooperation, and intelligence of the many Members who have contributed \nto this important piece of legislation.\n  In the process, Mr. President, we have made significant progress in \nour ongoing efforts to preserve and strengthen the Medicare Program, a \nprogram of critical importance to our senior citizens, and to give \nState governments greater voice and authority in the administration of \nMedicaid. We have increased the ability of families and individuals to \nsave their money, to become more self-reliant, and to invest in the \nfuture of America. We have passed significant proposals to help our \nyouth and their families with their education. And we have saved who \nknows how many family small businesses and farms from extinction \nwrought by death taxes.\n  We can go home during this Independent Day recess with our heads held \nhigh. We have done what our constituents sent us here to do. As I said, \nwe have accomplished these important objectives in a bipartisan spirit.\n  Mr. President, the Senate's success of the last few days would not \nhave been possible without the leadership and example of my \ndistinguished colleague and close friend, Senator Moynihan. He is a \nscholar, a statesman and--perhaps, most important--a gentleman and \ntrusted friend.\n  I appreciate the other Members of the Senate Finance Committee. It \nwas interesting to watch the process as the cooperative spirit on that \ncommittee worked to refine and build rather than denigrate and destroy. \nThe cream indeed rose to the top through our days, weeks, even months \nof hearings, conferences, meetings, and debates. I am proud of every \nmember and, if time permitted, I would give specific examples of how \neach one of them rose to the challenge that has resulted in the success \nwe produced today.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank, again, the many professional \nstaff members whose work and expertise made this possible. No one \nappreciates these men and women more than those of us who watch their \ntireless efforts and depend on their support. Our gratitude to them as \nindividuals, and for their work, is perhaps best demonstrated by the \nincredible trust we place in their judgment and by the way we depend on \ntheir advice and support.\n  Particularly, Mr. President, among our professional staff, I would \nlike to thank: Lindy Paull, Frank Polk, Mark Prater, Rosemary Becchi, \nDoug Fisher, Brig Gulya, Sam Olyck, Tom Roesser, Joan Woodward, Ashley \nMiller, Mark Patterson, Nick Giordano, Patricia McClanahan, Maury \nPassman, Bill Fant, David Podoff, and also Ken Kies and his capable \nstaff at Joint Tax.\n\n  These men and women, along with the leadership of the members on the \nFinance Committee, share in the tremendous success, a success for which \nI give them my most sincere thanks and a success, Mr. President, that \nwill bless the lives of all Americans.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is characteristic of our revered \nchairman that he would spend this precious moment at the end of a \ntriumphant legislative process thanking others. It is the part of him \nthat brings us together and brought us together to an extraordinary 80 \nto 18 vote. I would presume to speak for every member of the committee, \nand certainly for the Democratic members who have been unanimous on \nboth of these measures in committee, and on the floor today, in \nexpressing our profound appreciation to him, our profound admiration, \nand our conviction that we will now go on to a successful conference \nand write some history in our Nation this year.\n  We shall have a balanced budget. We shall have a health care program \nfor adults and children. And not least, we have had in fact 77 votes in \nfavor of a successful and permanent Amtrak program in this country, a \nmatter of particular concern to him, but both attributable to him. And \nI thank him.\n  Again, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition of S. \n949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. I was necessarily absent \nand unable to vote on the final passage of the bill, but I would like \nmy statement to be recorded in the Record.\n  There has been a great deal of congratulations about how this is the \nfirst major tax cut since the Kemp-Roth tax cuts in 1981. I would like \nto remind everyone of the consequences of that particular measure. \nSince 1981, our deficits have exploded, growing to as high as $403 \nbillion. Our national debt has soared from under $1 trillion in 1980 to \n$5.4 trillion this year. The interest costs on this debt have \nskyrocketed during that period from $74.8 billion to $360 billion, \nrepresenting spending of $1 billion a day. This money does not go to \npurchase any new bridges, roads, airports, or any other public good. \nInstead, it is wasted on servicing this debt. These interest payments, \nin essence, represent a mammoth tax on the American people which will \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\nto rise until we can get our fiscal house in order.\n  Since 1993, we have made substantial progress toward reducing our \ndeficit. Despite the opposition of every Republican in the Senate, we \npassed a tough deficit reduction bill which included unpopular tax \nincreases and spending cuts. The results have been clear. Our deficit \nhas fallen for 5 years in a row, unemployment is at a 24 year low, \ninflation is minimal, interest rates are down, 12.1 million new jobs \nhave been created, and business investment is at a post-war high. Yet, \ninstead of building on this progress, we have chosen to abandon ship \nand engage in the political temptation of tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is experiencing a period of prosperity, \npartially because we were courageous enough to make the right choice in \n1993 and begin to reduce our deficit. We should stay on this course \nuntil we truly balance our books. Instead, this year's budget deal \nengages in the same old trickery of back loaded tax cuts, borrowed \ntrust funds, and unrealistic economic assumptions. Rather than doing \nwhat is right for the American people, we have chosen to do what is \nright to get us past the next election. I fear, however, that the \nresults of this measure will be felt long after then. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6670-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the members of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, ably led by chairman Roth and ranking \nmember Moynihan, for their willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion \nto bring meaningful and much-needed tax relief to the American people.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 is extremely important legislation. \nWhile it makes many significant changes, I want to focus my remarks on \nthe provisions that will provide long-overdue estate tax relief for \nfamily-owned businesses and farms and on those that will help lower- \nand moderate-income families put their children through college.\n  The first bill I sponsored as a U.S. Senator was targeted death tax \nrelief for family-owned businesses and farms. This was no accident, for \nI firmly believe that small, family-owned enterprises hold the key to \nour economic future. It is these family businesses that will create \ntwo-thirds of all new jobs for the people of the United States in the \n21st century.\n  Regrettably, our current tax code penalizes family-owned businesses \nby making it difficult, if not impossible in some cases, for families \nto pass the business down from generation to generation. In fact, fewer \nthan one-third of all family-owned businesses survive the transition \nfrom the first generation to the second.\n  Our tax policy should produce the very opposite result, and I am \ngratified that a strong, bipartisan majority of the Senate Finance \nCommittee recognized this problem and supported action to put us on the \nright track. Specifically, S. 949 establishes a $1 million exemption \nfrom Federal estate taxes for closely-held family businesses, thereby \nmaking it easier for parents to pass their business along to their \nchildren. My estate tax relief bill, S. 482, contained the very same \nprovision, and I commend the Finance Committee for including it in \ntheir legislation which we just passed.\n  The Finance Committee's proposal will help to make real the dreams of \nthose Americans who work long hours to build a business so they can \nturn it over to their children. It will help individuals like the \npotato bag manufacturer in northern Maine who would expand his business \nand hire more new employees were it not for the money he has to invest \nin estate planning and insurance. And it will help the small \nbusinesswoman in Portland, ME, who wishes to leave her restaurant to \nher son and avoid the problem she faced when her father died and the \nfamily had to sell 24 of their 25 restaurants to pay the estate tax \nbill.\n  Mr. President, by preserving family-owned enterprises, we not only \nstrengthen American businesses, we also strengthen American families.\n  Mr. President, I also want to commend the Finance Committee for \nincluding several very important provisions that will help lower- and \nmiddle-income families finance college educations for their children. \nMany of the provisions are similar to those in my legislation, the \nCollege Access and Affordability Act of 1997.\n  For the last 30 years, the Federal Government has helped make post-\nsecondary education available to millions of high school students, \nthereby giving them a chance to fulfill their potential to the greatest \nextent possible. The primary vehicles for this invaluable Federal \nassistance to lower-income and middle-income families have been the \nPell grant and student loan programs, both of which I wholeheartedly \nsupport.\n  But our student aid programs have had the unintended consequence of \npunishing those families who struggle to save for their children's \neducation and then become ineligible for Federal assistance because of \ntheir savings. To its credit, the Finance Committee recognized that \nwith the greatly increased cost of a college education, these families \nalso are deserving of help, and it took several important steps in that \ndirection.\n  First, the bill that we just passed also establishes education \ninvestment accounts to help families save for their children's college \neducation. Under this plan, families can contribute up to $2,000 a year \nto a special savings account and not have to pay taxes on the account's \nearnings if they use the money for qualified educational expanses, such \nas room, board, and tuition. Along similar lines, the Finance Committee \napproved a proposal that allows families who have created Individual \nRetirement Accounts [IRA's] to withdraw funds for post-secondary and \ngraduate education without penalty.\n  Second, the Committee's bill allows annual dedications of up to \n$2,500 for interest paid on student loans. This will help to soften the \nfinancial burden on students like the young woman in my State who \nrecently graduated from college with $18,000 in debt and who returned \nto her home town in rural Maine where high-paying jobs are simply not \navailable.\n  Finally, the Committee adopted a permanent extension of the section \n127 program, which allows employees who receive up to $5,250 in \nemployer-provided tuition assistance to exclude this assistance from \ntheir taxable income. We live in times of rapid change when workers may \noften need new skills to remain employable, and the section 127 program \ncan be the key to making this possible.\n  Taken together, these proposals represent a major step forward in our \nefforts to help lower-income and middle-income families finance higher \neducation for themselves and their children. These changes will benefit \nnot only our students but also our Nation, for a better educated \npopulation will be better able to compete in our global economy. By \nmaking education more affordable for all, we also reaffirm that America \nis the country of opportunity, where success is there for all who are \nwilling to work for it.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude my remarks with the observation that \nS. 949 is notable not only for what it provides but also for how it was \nproduced. Led by their Chair, the members of the Taxation Committee put \naside partisan concerns and crafted a bill which can command widespread \nsupport both in Congress and in the country. Despite the rhetoric of \nthose bent on sowing the seeds of division, the legislation benefits \nall Americans, as reflected in the fact that a family of four earning \n$30,000 will receive a 53 percent tax cut under the plan.\n  Mr. President, the people of my State want results and not rhetoric, \ncooperation and not confrontation. The Family Tax Relief Act of 1997 \nshows what we can accomplish when we honor the wishes of those who sent \nus here.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say first of all that in the \nSenate in 1981 there were only 11 votes cast\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\nagainst the proposal to cut taxes and increase defense spending to \nbalance the budget--11 Senators. President Reagan's popularity was \nunbelievable, and there was a herd instinct that swept across this \nbody. It was absolutely unstoppable. And in 1994 when we were going to \nbalance the budget the deficit was up to $200 billion.\n  I hate to say this. But, in my opinion, Mr. President, 18 people who \nvoted ``no'' today will be more than justly and aptly vindicated when \nthe year 2002 rolls around and we will not have a balanced budget or \nanything even close to it.\n  I am chagrined and dismayed that today we are looking at a $67 \nbillion deficit on October 1, and next year, by our own admission and \nour own actions, the deficit will go to $94 billion --almost $30 \nbillion higher than it is in 1997. To me that is shameful and \nunforgivable.\n  The American people have demanded a balanced budget as long as \nanybody can remember, and today we just forsook the opportunity to meet \nthat nonnegotiable demand of the American people which they have laid \non us for years.\n  Mr. President, I forsook offering an amendment that I felt very \nstrongly about this afternoon. I did it to accommodate our own majority \nleader who had a plane to catch, and there were a lot of other \nSenators. I had no disillusions about whether my amendment would pass \nor not. But I wanted to debate it for 1 minute, and I am perhaps better \noff taking 5 minutes now to say to whoever may be watching and the \nMembers of this body, ask yourself this question. It goes right to the \nheart of my amendment.\n  Do you think the Nation is better off providing a $135 billion tax \ncut, over 50 percent of which goes to the wealthiest 5 percent of the \npeople in America? Do you think we are better off doing that, or do you \nthink we would be better off providing a college education for the 5 \nmillion youngsters whom the New York Times says over the next few years \nwill be excluded from a college education because of skyrocketing \ncosts?\n  I speak from experience. I spent 3 years in the Marine Corps in World \nWar II. I came home where there was a compassionate, caring, \nunderstanding Government which provided the GI bill to my brother and \nme. I wouldn't be standing on the floor of the Senate today as a U.S. \nSenator if it had not been for that help from the U.S. Government. Some \npeople think the Government has no obligation to help anybody.\n  What I am saying is if I had my first choice it would be to put the \n$135 billion in savings on the deficit, and balance the budget by the \nyear 2000, and no later than 2001. But if we are not going to do that, \nif we are going to take the $115 billion we cut out of Medicare and \nspend it on something, I say spend it on college education for \nyoungsters who cannot go to college otherwise.\n  Mr. President, the greatness of this country has occurred when \nMembers of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives had strong \nconvictions about what we need to do as a matter of social, \neducational, and cultural policy--the GI bill, for example. It takes a \ngiant leap of faith to believe that we can do this--educate every \nyoungster in the country with a college degree.\n  We found that the average cost of an education in a State-supported \nuniversity is $7,000 a year. So we simply increased the Pell grant to \n$7,000. The income criteria would remain as it is now. If you were \nwealthy or partially wealthy, you wouldn't get the full $7,000. But if \nyou had an income of below a certain amount, you would get the $7,000. \nWe left the two tax provisions that are in this bill that we just \npassed intact.\n  Mr. President, I want you to look at this chart so that you can see \nwhat I am talking about and where we are headed.\n  Here are the percentages of people in certain income categories. This \nis the highest level of income in the country --86 percent of those \npeople go to college. In the next quintile down here, 60 percent, a \nlittle less than 60 percent, in 1983 and today, almost 68 percent of \nthose kids go to college. And you get down here in the low-income, and \nlook what happens. It started up--down and up. And now it is down \nagain. If you look at the New York Times article of this past week, you \nwill see that this figure is going to head down.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take up a lot of time to say \nsomething that everybody knows that we ought to be doing. But I do want \nto say this. Mr. President, the high school graduates in this country \nin the past 20 years have lost 18 percent more of their income. When \nyou hear people say the income gap in this country is widening, there \nit is. High school students lost 18 percent in the last 20 years. \nDropouts have lost 25 percent. And, if it continues at the present \nrate, by the year 2015 high school students will have lost 38 percent \nof their income because they didn't go to college.\n  If you want to live in a civilized society, it is this simple. If you \nwant to live in a civilized society, one that is relatively drug free \nand crime free, if you want to live in a society and in a technological \nage, we don't have any choice about it. This has to come.\n  It is one of those things that we need to debate and debate now, and \nwe need to do it. We need to make sure that no child in this country is \ndenied a college education anymore than today we would deny somebody a \nhigh school education.\n  So I forsook offering that amendment even though my staff and I had \nspent untold hours gathering statistics and information.\n  I want to conclude as I opened a moment ago. Once again, I ask my \nbrethren in the U.S. Senate and the people of America to ask yourself \nthis one question: Do you think we are better off spending this $135 \nbillion on a tax cut which goes to me, upper-income people, and $12 a \nyear to the stiff out there making $15,000 a year--$12 a year for him? \nThe guy making $15,000 a year gets $12 a year out of this tax bill.\n  The guy making over $200,000 a year gets $3,500 to $3,700. It is \nironic; it does not mean anything to either one of them. To the man \nmaking $15,000, $12 does not mean anything in his life; to a man making \n$200,000, $3,000, or $3,500 does not mean much either. That is what we \nare doing instead of meeting our obligation. Ask yourself which is more \nimportant, that tax cut or educating the children of this country so we \ncan live in a civilized society.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PATTEN, GOVERNOR OF HONG KONG\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to say a thank you on \nbehalf of myself and I feel a thank you as well on behalf of my 99 \ncolleagues to his Excellency, Christopher F. Patten, the outgoing \nGovernor of Hong Kong. Governor Patten has the particular distinction \nof being the last of 28 British Governors to preside over Hong Kong \nbefore this territory reverts back to the People's Republic of China on \nJuly 1--in just a few days.\n  Chris Patten, as those of us in this body have come to know him over \nthe years, is a truly remarkable individual. He has been a superb \nadministrator and an inspiration to the people who he has sought to \ngovern in Hong Kong.\n  During his 5 years there, Chris Patten has watched the economy \nflourish under his stewardship. It grew by more than 30 percent in real \nterms over that period--a truly impressive performance. He has presided \nover a capable and honest civil service. Crime has fallen. The \npolitical situation has been stable and further democratized.\n  These are all important achievements, but, in my view, the most \nimportant legacy of the Patten administration is that it leaves behind \nthe seeds of democracy firmly planted in the minds and hearts of the \npeople of Hong Kong.\n  Thanks to Governor Patten and the people of Hong Kong, they were able \nto experience democracy firsthand by electing members of their local \nlegislature, thereby making good on the British commitment to put in \nplace a solidly based democratic administration.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, the Chinese have already made the decision to \ndismantle the elected legislature and to replace it with an appointed \ncouncil, hand-picked by Beijing. That may work for the moment. In time \nwe will know whether the ``provisional legislature'' installed by \nBeijing is only a temporary setback to democracy or the first step down \na very dark, dark road, indeed. I hope it is not the latter.\n  Hopefully, Beijing will come to appreciate that it is virtually \nimpossible to totally destroy democratic aspirations. As Governor \nPatten recently so eloquently put it, ``You can dismantle institutions \nbut you can't dismantle benchmarks. People now know what a fair \nelection is like, and they will surely know what an unfair election is \nlike if one takes place.''\n  Many political leaders leave office, Mr. President, less than popular \nwith those that they have governed, some deservedly so and others \nunfairly so, because they have had to make hard choices that only \nhistory will record kindly.\n  Not in the case of Chris Patten, in my view. Although few have had to \nmake tougher decisions than he has, he leaves Hong Kong enormously \npopular, with 79 percent of the people of Hong Kong viewing him as \nhaving done a very good job, indeed.\n\n  On Monday, June 30, Governor Patten and his wife, Lavender, and his \ndaughters, Kate, Laura, and Alice, will depart Hong Kong. I am \nconfident that the people of that place will hold Chris Patten in their \nhearts for years and years to come. As one who considers him a personal \nfriend, I would like to add my personal congratulations and thanks to \nhim for all that he has endeavored to do, and I know that his many, \nmany friends here in this body and the other and across this country, \nand particularly in Hong Kong, will not forget the challenges he has \nplaced before the Government of the People's Republic of China.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd pertaining to the introduction of S. 983 and \nSenate Joint Resolution 34 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DODD.

I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD.

How soon?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Tomorrow.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have to go somewhere tomorrow, too. I thought if the \nSenator wanted to catch a plane today, I would take my chair again.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may use as \nmuch time as I may consume.

Mr. President, last week I was proud to celebrate West \nVirginia Day, marking the 134th anniversary of the birth of my great \nState. Born in the midst of a terrible war, the mountain State still \nbears witness to that difficult four years of struggle, from Harper's \nFerry to battle sites across her hills and farmlands. But she also \nstill stands fast, and holds onto the traces of earlier history in her \nsturdy log barns and cabins and the winding rows of moss-covered stones \nbounding fields and cemeteries. Crumbling now, these long stone walls \nare losing their battles to the honeysuckle vines and the frosty \nupheavals of the centuries, but they remind us still of our forebears \nwho settled this rugged and beautiful country and who bequeathed to us \na legacy both tangible and intangible. For just as these early settlers \nleft us these stacked stones, they also left us an even greater gift, a \ngift no one else on Earth has ever truly shared--our American freedom \nand the remarkable form of government that keeps Americans free.\n  Next Friday, on the Fourth of July, we in the United States will \ncelebrate the declaration of our freedom and the announcement of our \nintent to form a new government, not bound by happenstance of birth or \ncaste, but one that gives each man an equal opportunity to rise above \nthe circumstances of his own beginning and to make of his life whatever \nhis ability and ambition would allow. The government that was \npainstakingly crafted in the years following this turning point in \nhistory combines the best of many forms of government, while avoiding \ntheir excesses. I never cease to wonder at our great and lasting \nfortune in having been blessed with a collection of Founding Fathers \nwho were able to blend so many differing viewpoints and draft a \nConstitution that is so well thought out, and so finely balanced, that \nit has survived over the last two centuries with remarkably little \nchange--remarkably little change. It demonstrates an ability to \ncooperate that has been in rather short supply around here in recent \nyears.\n  The drafting of the American Constitution was the work of many minds. \nThe Declaration of Independence, though conceived by a committee of \nfive, was penned by a single versatile, very remarkable man. The group \nformed for this work was comprised of notables including John Adams, \nBenjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert \nLivingston--whose namesake graces our Government today with his \npresence in the other body, Representative and chairman of the \nCommittee on Appropriations in the House of Representatives, Bob \nLivingston. These were brave men to undertake what was then an act of \ntreason against the British monarch, King George III. They decided \nunanimously to select Thomas Jefferson for the delicate job of putting \ninto words the message they wanted to send to George III, and to the \nworld. And of all the powerful and lyrical speeches that have ever been \ncaptured on the page, surely the grace, courage, and idealism of the \nDeclaration of Independence ranks high. Thomas Jefferson's legacy to \nthis Nation is a rich one, including the nucleus of our Library of \nCongress formed from his own collection after the destruction of the \nWar of 1812, his contributions to the Continental Congress, and his \nservice as President. But the soaring majesty of his words--beginning \nwith ``When in the course of human events * * *''--would stand alone as \na monument to the man. Even as he lay dying at his mountaintop home in \nMonticello in 1826, Jefferson struggled to last until the fourth of \nJuly before succumbing to the call of the angels. John Adams, who died \nthat same day--what a coincidence, what a coincidence--50 years after \nthe Declaration of Independence was adopted, observed with his last \nbreath that the\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\nyoung Nation was safe, because ``Jefferson still lives.'' He did not \nknow that his friend had already died a few hours earlier.\n\n  The birth of our Nation, like the birth of my beloved State of West \nVirginia, was marked by conflict ignited by the Declaration of \nIndependence, and the fireworks that we will watch next Friday serve as \na vivid reminder of the price of our freedom. But many of us will watch \nthose fireworks amid gatherings of friends and family, and the sting of \nbattle will be but a distant memory. In West Virginia, the Fourth of \nJuly is marked in traditional ways, with parades and large family \nreunions, gatherings of kin from around the State and around the \ncountry. In cities like Weirton and Ripley, high school bands and \nvolunteer firemen will step out smartly behind banners carried by \nmajorettes in sequins that glint in the bright afternoon Sun. Local \npoliticians and beauty queens will decorate the open tops of mirror-\npolished convertibles. And families will cheer as the Stars and Stripes \ngoes past, carried proudly by an Eagle Scout. The very sight of Old \nGlory stirs the pride in even the most jaded or unpatriotic among us, \nwhen it is surrounded by such homespun and heartfelt pageantry.\n  After the parades, long tables will be laid under the old trees \nshading the yard--it may be a churchyard; There may be a cemetery \nnearby. Many hands will share in the labor of cooking, and the \nfragrance of meat grilling will blend with the sweet aroma of home-made \npies and cakes. Children with watermelon juice dripping down their \nchins will run past grandparents in lawn chairs, waving their sparklers \nat the darkening sky as the dogs bark and give chase. When finally the \nfireflies give way to the stars, fathers will set up the roman candles, \nfountains, and noisemakers in a spectacular reprise of the ``rocket's \nred glare, the bombs bursting in air,'' penned by Francis Scott Key as \nhe witnessed the battle over Fort McHenry.\n  And after the glories of the Fourth of July, after the sleepy \nchildren are put to bed and the dishes are washed, the gathered kinfolk \nwill scatter like the fallen rocks of the old stone wall, back to their \nhomes, to be gathered again for next year's reunion. The strength of \ntheir families goes with them, and the love and pride they have in \ntheir union and their country will be renewed. There is no better \nNation on Earth, no Nation more blessed, than this one. So, for this \nhappy Fourth, I wish my fellow Senators Godspeed as they go to their \nmany homes throughout the several States of the Union. I wish them all \na safe journey in their weekend travels. I also wish God's blessings to \nall Americans traveling or residing abroad, who will gather at U.S. \nEmbassies to celebrate with their fellow Americans on the Fourth of \nJuly in reunions of strangers that are still, intangibly, our kin as \ncitizens. So with God's blessings on everyone, everyone who is a part \nof the U.S. Senate, everyone who is part of the family of the Senate, \nwe will come together again after we have celebrated the invisible yet \nlasting legacy of the men who gave us the Fourth of July. Henry Van \nDyke captured this deep seated pride and kinship we all feel for our \ncountry, and never more so than on this holiday, in his poem, ``America \nfor Me:''\n\n       'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down\n       Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n       To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the \n     kings,--\n       But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n       So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n       My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,\n       In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n       Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n     stars.\n\n       Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n       And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n       And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study \n     Rome\n\n       But when it comes to living there is just no place like \n     home.\n\n       I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled;\n       I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n     filled;\n       But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day\n       In friendly West Virginia hills where Nature has her way!\n\n       I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to \n     lack:\n       The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n       But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,\n       We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n       Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n       I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n     sea,\n       To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,\n       Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n     stars.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is intimidating to speak after such \npoetic eloquence. One of the joys of serving in the U.S. Senate is to \nbe part of a permanent class with Senator Byrd. Some students have left \nfor their homes and Fourth of July activities and some of us were able \nto share in his just concluded statements on behalf of his wonderful \nState. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my honorable friend, the senior \nSenator from Florida, for his overly gracious and very charitable and \nkind remarks, and I hope that he and his lovely wife will have a joyous \nFourth of July and a safe journey to the great State of Florida and \nback to Washington when the holiday week is done.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, earlier today, Senator Harkin introduced \nlegislation dealing with the recent agreement between States and the \nU.S. tobacco industry. Senator Harkin's provision says simply that the \npayments from tobacco companies to States should not be tax deductible.\n  I applaud this effort, and I want to speak for a few moments on the \nsubject and how we might proceed from here.\n  Last week, a number of State attorneys general reached an agreement \nwith several American tobacco companies. The agreement will compensate \nthe States for their Medicaid spending on people who suffer from \nsmoking-related illnesses, like lung cancer and emphysema, with $368 \nbillion in payments over the next 30 years. It is also supposed to \ninclude measures to protect the public health and provide tobacco \ncompanies with protections against future losses.\n  Congress must soon be asked to pass a law implementing this \nagreement. Because the agreement is very large and very ambitious, we \nwill need a lot of time and study and consultation before we can reach \na final judgment. But let me start with a basic principle.\n  I think we all would agree that a fair negotiated agreement is much \nbetter than litigation. But the key word is ``fair.'' The agreement \nmust be fair to States as they pay Medicaid expenses, fair to the \nFederal Government as it pays for Medicaid and Medicare, fair to kids, \nfair to the public, and fair to the taxpayers.\n\n  Initially, my reaction to the first point is that we should give the \nattorneys general a lot of deference on fairness to States. After all, \nthey negotiated the agreement. With respect to the Federal \ncontributions to Medicare and Medicaid, though, I am concerned that the \nagreement may not be fair. On public health, it seems they have come to \nsome very good provisions on advertising, but perhaps weaker provisions \non regulation of nicotine.\n  All this will take some more study. But I see one thing right away \nwhich seems to me grossly unfair to taxpayers. That is, under the terms \nof this agreement, tobacco companies will apparently be able to deduct \ntheir compensation payment from their tax bill as ordinary and \nnecessary business expenses.\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\n  Thus, the tobacco companies could deduct $368 billion from their \ntaxable income and reduce their tax payments by about $123 billion, \nassuming we maintain a corporate tax rate of about 33 percent during \nthe course of this agreement. In effect, this would reduce the tobacco \ncompanies' payment by $123 billion and force the taxpayers to pick it \nup instead. That is a full third of the compensation payment to States.\n  I believe that is wrong. I believe it is unfair. The basis of this \nwhole agreement is the idea that tobacco companies bear some \nresponsibility for the illnesses caused by tobacco and nicotine and \nshould help pick up the tab.\n  I agree with that. I also feel strongly that ordinary taxpayers are \nnot responsible for the illnesses caused by tobacco, and they should \nnot have to put up $123 billion to pay for the treatment.\n  Is there a solution to the problem? Yes, there probably is. We should \nlook into the issue, and I believe that the Senate Finance Committee \nshould hold hearings on the tax implications of this settlement.\n  But already it seems clear that these payments are not necessary \nbusiness expenses. They are, rather, belated compensation for the \nhealth effects of tobacco. I do not think they should be tax \ndeductible. I will explore every means, including legislation if \nnecessary, to make sure this agreement is fair to taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6723-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REFORM OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND CONSERVATION EASEMENTS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on another matter, I wish to inform the \nSenate that we in the Environment and Public Works Committee are \nworking very diligently to come up with a good solid reform of the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  In this respect, I say that Senator Kempthorne, the chairman of the \nrelevant subcommittee, is working very hard with Senator Reid, the \nranking member of the relevant subcommittee, along with myself and \nSenator Chafee to reform the current Endangered Species Act, including \nmany provisions, such as involving the States much more deeply than \nthey are now, making sure there is peer review by scientific \ncommunities, and a host of other changes.\n  But one change I would like to mention at the moment is an idea in \nthe bill introduced by the Senator from Idaho which very simply states \nthat conservation easements that protect habitat for endangered species \nshould be tax deductible.\n  I raised this issue in the Finance Committee markup a week ago \nexplaining to members of the committee that this was a new idea, a good \nidea which would give landowners incentives so that they themselves can \nprotect their own land in a way to avoid problems under the act. But I \ndid not push for the amendment in committee because we were not quite \nready for the provisions of the amendment and did not have an \nappropriate way to pay for it which is called for under the \nReconciliation Act.\n  Senator Kempthorne has introduced a statement today basically calling \nthis matter to the attention of the full Senate, and most particularly \nto the attention of the conferees.\n  I say to Senator Kempthorne and others that are interested that I \nwill work diligently, in cooperation with the Senator from Idaho, to \nsee if we can find a way to get that provision passed.\n  Essentially, Mr. President, we will very soon have a bipartisan \nEndangered Species Act reauthorization reported out of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. I think Senators will be happy in the main \nwith the provisions of this agreement. I compliment, again, Senator \nKempthorne, Senator Reid, and others who are working, on a very \nbipartisan basis, to reach this result.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their interest in the tax incentive \nportion of it because I think that is an important, integral part of \nthis solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6724-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMPLIMENTING SENATOR ROTH\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much thank again publicly my \nchairman of the committee, Senator Roth, who has heard many, many \ncompliments on his leadership of the committee. I have complimented him \nmany times already. Other Senators have complimented him many, many \ntimes. But one cannot compliment him too often because he did a \nterrific job in coming up with a bipartisan bill, as we know, that \npassed the Senate not too long ago by a vote of 80 to 18--quite an \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. ROTH. If the distinguished Senator from Montana would just yield \nfor a comment. You do not have to stop complimenting. As far as I am \nconcerned, I could sit here all day and listen to it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It may be deserved.\n  Mr. ROTH. You are very kind. I must say, I think we have all had a \ngreat experience of working together. I feel very strongly that this \nspirit of bipartisanship should continue. I know the Senator from \nMontana is of the same school as I am.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ROTH. So have a good recess.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank the junior Senator \nfrom Montana for his leadership on the important issue. Senator Burns \nhas led a valiant effort to address an area that I believe is in great \nneed of reform. He has championed the cause of allowing citizens to \nprotect their information through readily available strong information \nsecurity technology. In the 104th Congress, he introduced legislation \nthat set the stage for our reform efforts in this Congress. Again, last \nweek, Senator Burns offered a compromise version of his original bill \nbefore the Commerce Committee, but unfortunately this measure did not \npass. I hope that now we can go through a process to bring all parties \ntogether, industry and Government, to try to relieve some of the \nproblems created by current law. We did not accomplish everything that \nI wanted in Committee, but I am confident that there is still time to \nimprove this legislation. I want to congratulate Senator Burns and \nothers on the committee like Senator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan who \nhave taken the time to understand the technology and to attempt to \neffectively guide us through these difficult issues.\n  Mr. President, the demand for strong information security will not \nabate. Individuals, industry, and governments need the best information \nsecurity technology to protect their information. The Administration's \npolicy and the McCain-Kerrey bill allow export of 56-bit encryption, \nwith key recovery requirements. How secure is 56-bit encryption? That \nquestion was answered the day before the Senate Commerce Committee \nacted. Responding to a challenge, a secret message encoded with 56-bit \nencryption was decoded in a brute force supercomputing effort known as \nthe ``Deschall Effort.'' The message that was decoded said ``Strong \ncryptography makes the world a safer place.''\n  Now that 56-bit encryption has been cracked by individuals working \ntogether over the Internet, information protected by that technology is \nvulnerable. The need to allow stronger security to protect information \nis more acute than ever.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the majority \nleader. I too was opposed to the legislation approved by the committee \nlast week, but know that we still have the opportunity to pass a \nmeaningful bill that will allow American industry to compete with the \nrest of the world in the global information marketplace. I believe that \nwe can pass a bill that will not compromise our national security or \nlaw enforcement interests. As I sat through the markup last week, it \noccurred to me that we had allowed the issue of encryption to be framed \nas the\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\nissue of child pornography or gambling. I want to be sure that all \nparties understand that the reform of encryption security standards is \nnot related to these issues.\n  I have often said that encryption is simply like putting a stamp on \nan envelope rather than sending a postcard because you don't want \nothers to read your mail. Encryption is simply about people protecting \ntheir private information, about companies and governments protecting \ntheir information, from medical records to tax returns to intellectual \nproperty from unauthorized access. Hackers, espionage agents, and those \njust wanting to cause mischief must be restrained from access to \nprivate information over the Internet.\n  When used correctly, encryption can enable citizens in remote \nlocations to have access to the same information, the same technology, \nthe same quality of health care, that citizens of our largest cities \nhave. Perhaps most importantly, it is about ensuring that American \ncompanies have the tools they need to continue to develop and provide \nthe leading technology in the global marketplace. Without this \nleadership, our national security and sovereignty will surely be \nthreatened.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, I would like to make a few comments to \nassociate myself with the comments of the majority leader and the \nSenator from Montana. These two gentlemen have demonstrated great \nleadership on this issue, and I especially admire their dedication to \neducate our colleagues about this important issue. I believe that at \nthe bottom line, if we allow this critical technology to be stifled in \nthe United States I believe our national interests will be severely \nundermined. We must do our best to allow U.S. companies to compete in \nthe world marketplace, and do so without in any way undercutting our \nnational security interests.\n  I believe that the bill that was reported last week out of the \nCommerce Committee does not achieve those objectives. In fact, I fear \nthat bill may be nothing more than an attempt to ensure that no bill \npasses in Congress this year. This would be a victory for the \nadministration, which has rigorously resisted changes to their outdated \nand obsolete policies. I must say that I try to support the \nadministration on many issues, but on this issue, I have found that \ntheir arguments and policies simply do not withstand scrutiny.\n  And, Mr. President, I was an original sponsor of the Burns bill and I \nworked very hard with the Senator to help shape the consensus position \nthat was rejected by the committee. I would like to take a few moments \nto set the record straight about the true differences between the \nMcCain-Kerrey bill and the Burns' approach.\n\n  The bill that passed the committee certainly represents a victory for \nthose within the administration opposed to any relaxation of export \ncontrols in this area. In fact, it may be a perfect bill from their \nstandpoint. It allows them to begin the process of domestic control \nwhile actually freezing exports to a weak enough level of encryption \ntechnology that was actually decoded by amateurs the very day before. \nAnd it is very unclear to me exactly where the McCain-Kerrey reaches a \ncompromise position.\n  The Burns' bill however, merely allows that we would allow export of \n56-bit encryption immediately, but we would establish a process for \nunderstanding the level of encryption that is generally available \nthroughout the world. That review process would include panels and \nadvisory boards consisting of government and industry representatives \nequipped to determine the security strength of particular software that \nis available in the world market. Our belief was that it was in the \nnational interest for American software companies to maintain \nleadership in this area. The very notion that we would let foreign \ncompanies get a head start on new technology while forcing American \ncompanies to come to a government entity to plead for the right to \ncatch up was troubling enough to both Senator Burns and myself. But, we \nagreed to this compromise because we thought it represented the \nappropriate middle ground.\n  As the majority leader reminded us, we did not accomplish what many \nof us had hoped that we would while in Committee, but we will continue \nto work within the process to improve the legislation. I remain \ncommitted to encryption reform and will do everything possible to try \nto educate my colleagues about this issue.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to add my comments on this \nimportant issue. For over 2 years, I have participated in Commerce \nCommittee hearings to learn more about on encryption and the technology \nissues that it encompasses. Last week, I voted for Senator Burns' \nsubstitute and was disappointed when it was not approved by the \ncommittee.\n  I am concerned about the tone of the discussion at last week's \nmarkup. It appeared to me that many on the committee are seeking ways \nto outlaw the Internet. We are all troubled by any type of child \npornography or gambling on the Internet. These are not areas where any \nmember of Congress, any software or hardware vendor, or any member of \nthe general public I know, argues for anything less than the strictest \nlegal provisions. These matters are distasteful and wrong, but even if \nwe eliminated the Internet, we would not eliminate these offensive \nconcerns.\n  As I said during the markup, we all know that cameras are used in \nchild pornography, but we don't talk of outlawing photography. And, we \nalso know that rental vehicles are often used in terrorist activities, \nbut we don't make it illegal to rent a car or truck.\n  Mr. President, it appears to me that at the most fundamental level, \nthis debate is about the relationship of our citizens to our \nGovernment. We all must take steps to insure that the rights of our \ncitizens are not violated. Our citizens should be able to communicate \nprivately, without the Government listening in--that is one of our most \nbasic rights.\n  We have to be careful to ensure our law enforcement can have just the \nnecessary amount of access and then only in a manner consistent with \nour Constitution.\n  I am persuaded that a number of the new provisions in the McCain-\nKerrey bill are not necessary.\n  I believe that many of the provisions will not even succeed at \nachieving the end they seek. For example, a false choice has been \noffered indicating that if the U.S. continues to enforce the export \npolicy on encryption that is currently in place, 40 bit and with \nspecial permission up to 56-bit, then law enforcement could apprehend \nterrorists, stop illegal gamblers and arrest pornographers. However, \nthis argument assumes that these criminals cannot find stronger \nencryption elsewhere than in the United States. As has been shown \nseveral times, this assumption is false. Robust encryption is \navailable. Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom all have companies, \nsuch as Siemens, Nippon and Brokat, that have developed and promote 128 \nbit encryption. Last week even the supporters of the administration's \napproach, as expressed in the current legislation, admitted that \ncriminals who want the robust encryption can find access and use strong \nencryption in their current dealings. This issue is a red herring.\n  Moreover, the administration announced Wednesday that they will allow \nthe export of 128-bit encryption for bank transaction use involving \nbank software in an apparent admission of the vulnerability of the 56-\nbit strength. Also, the administration has continued to tell us during \nthe hearings on encryption and in private meetings with the FBI and \nNSA, that 128-bit use outside the United States would end in terrible \nconsequences, and now 128-bit use outside the U.S. is being advocated. \nWe should remember that the Burns compromise only wanted to export 128-\nbit with key recovery for trusted parties. The administration now \nadvocates 128-bit length encryption without any key recovery device, a \nposition that goes beyond the Burn's compromise, which they opposed. My \npoint, Mr. President is that this debate must change. We cannot \ncontinue to focus on the key length since these standards become \nobsolete on a daily basis. We need to focus on allowing trustworthy \nparties to use robust encryption, not necessarily to sell as encryption \nbut to use in their transactions and in the development of software and \nhardware.\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\n  No nationwide key recovery system, or a new licensing requirement for \ncertificate authorities should be brought to the floor without thorough \nexamination, analysis and understanding. We must further study the \nimpact of these provisions well before this bill is brought to the \nSenate floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I too would like to work with my colleagues \nto improve the McCain-Kerrey bill before it is brought to the floor. I \nwould like to ask my good friend from Missouri to pay special attention \nto this bill while it is under consideration by the Judiciary \nCommittee. I know that I can count on him to work hard to improve this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr President: I want to indicate my willingness to \ncontinue to work on this issue. As the majority leader well knows, I am \nprivileged to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee where we will \naddress this issue after the July recess. I pledge to work with members \non that Committee and with other interested Senators and the leader to \ntry to move a bill in that committee that will capture the essence of \nBurns substitute.\n  Mr. LOTT. It remains my hope that we can work with Chairman McCain \nand other members of the Committee to produce a bill that more of us \ncan support. We need to recognize that American industry will have \nincreased difficulty of competing in the international marketplace \nunless we provide some real reform. It is as if we erected a 30-foot \nwall between the United States and the rest of the world. The problem \nis that in today marketplace, American industry only has a 10-foot \nladder while their foreign competition has a 35-foot ladder. Foreign \nfirms are able to climb the wall while our American industry faces an \ninsurmountable obstacle. This is both short-sighted and wrong.\n  If we follow our current path, we will rue the day when we allowed \nour policies drive world leadership of the important information \nsecurity business to shift to Germany, Russia, Japan or China. I fully \nintend to work toward a legislative solution that will help solve the \nproblem while protecting American security interests. We need to create \nthe mechanisms that will allow American companies to have the same \nsized ladders that the rest of the world can use.\n  Mr. President, we all appreciate the legitimate law enforcement and \nnational security issues involved in this debate. Our national security \nand law enforcement agencies need to work with industry to ensure that \nour interests are protected. I remain convinced that we can do this in \na way that insures that our national security and sovereignty remains \nprotected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6724-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, for some time now the Judiciary Committee \nhas been working on issues dealing with copyright protection on the \nInternet and the copyright rights of performers and sound recordings. \nThe Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act that I introduced \nwas passed in 1995, and my National Information Infrastructure \nCopyright Protection Act was the subject of two hearings in the last \nCongress. The NII Copyright Protection Act was superseded by the \nClinton administration's effort to deal with many of the same issues in \nthe context of two new treaties, the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization [WIPO] Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and \nPhonograms Treaty.\n  These treaties were concluded successfully in Geneva in December \n1996. Since then, I have been eagerly awaiting the administration's \ndraft of implementation legislation. To date, I have not received such \nlegislation, and the Foreign Relations Committee has not received the \ntreaties. I know that the administration shares the respect that I have \nfor copyright, and I commend Bruce Lehman, the Commissioner of Patents \nand Trademarks, for the splendid work that he did on negotiating the \ntreaties, but I am concerned that 6 months have passed without draft \nlegislation for the committee to work on.\n  Both WIPO treaties were completed in record time, because there was a \nsense of urgency about the vulnerability of U.S. copyrighted works to \nmassive infringement by means of Internet access and about insufficient \ninternational copyright protection for sound recordings. Where is this \nsense of urgency now? Nothing has changed. Our copyright industries are \nstill threatened.\n  In 1994, copyright-related industries contributed more than $385 \nbillion to the American economy, or more than 5 percent of the total \ngross domestic product. This represents more than $50 billion in \nforeign sales, which exceeds every other leading industry sector except \nautomotive and agriculture in contributions to a favorable trade \nbalance. From 1977 to 1994, these same industries grew at a rate that \nwas twice the rate of growth of the national economy, and the rate of \njob growth in these industries since 1987 has outpaced that of the \noverall economy by more than 100 percent.\n  Yet these same industries lost an estimated $18 to $22 billion to \nforeign piracy in 1995. The film industry alone estimates that its \nlosses due to counterfeiting were in excess of $2.3 billion for that \nyear, even though full-length motion pictures are not yet available on \nthe Internet. The recording industry estimates its annual piracy losses \nin excess of $1.2 billion, with seizures of bootleg CDS up some 1,300 \npercent in 1995. These figures promise to grow exponentially as \ntechnology provides for quicker, more perfect digital reproduction, \nwhich is exactly why timely ratification of the WIPO treaties is so \nimportant..\n  I urge the administration to complete its work and to send the \ntreaties to the Senate. I would like to get the treaties ratified and \nimplementation legislation passed during this session of Congress. That \ngoal may already be unachievable because of administration delay.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to extend the \nbridge discretionary program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                      THE SAFE BRIDGES ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this bill I am introducing today is a bridge \ndiscretionary bill. We cannot forget in our reauthorization of the \nNation's transportation policy the importance of maintaining our \nbridges.\n  Missouri has approximately 23,000 bridges in total.\n  Unfortunately, the State of Missouri, according to Department of \nTransportation statistics ranks sixth from the bottom on conditions of \nbridges in this country. This is a deplorable place for the State of \nMissouri to be.\n  We must start taking better care of our roads and bridges and begin \nbuilding roads for the 21st century--with new technologies, new \nmaterials, and better designs.\n  According to the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials America must address the deficiencies of over \n11,000 bridges per year just to maintain current levels of condition.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, the cost to improve \nbridge conditions would require an annual investment of $8.9 billion.\n  Let us not lose the hard-won gains in our transportation \ninfrastructure. Let's not squander our investment.\n  Postponing taking care of our bridge needs only means that our \ninvestment declines and to make repairs later will cost more. The \ncliche does say ``Pay now or pay More later.''\n  Taking care of our transportation infrastructure can be compared to \ntaking care of your home. If you fail to fix the leaky roof, fail to \nre-paint, fail to adequately insulate, your costs increase and the \nvalue of your home declines.\n  If we fail to maintain and reinvest in our Nation's bridges not only \ndoes the value of our investment decline, but lives are lost and our \neconomic prosperity is jeopardized.\n  I am pleased to work with my dear friend and House colleague, \nCongresswoman Emerson to introduce this bill in both Houses--the Safe \nBridges Act of 1997.\n  The Safe Bridges Act of 1997 is our marker to stress to our \ncolleagues from around the country that bridges are an important and \nnecessary component to this country's transportation system.\n  Properly maintained and constructed bridges help save lives and \nprovide for the efficient movement of people and goods in this country.\n  If we want to secure our foundation--we must renew our investment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 975\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Bridges Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) bridges are important and necessary components of the \n     surface transportation system of the United States;\n       (2) bridges are an important factor in the efficient \n     movement of people and goods;\n       (3) properly maintained and constructed bridges help save \n     lives;\n       (4) more than 25 percent of the bridges on the Interstate \n     System are classified as deficient or in poor condition; and\n       (5) an investment of more than $5,000,000,000 annually is \n     needed to maintain the bridges that are in existence as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources \nPlanning Act of 1974 and related laws to strengthen the protection of \nnative biodiversity and ban clearcutting on Federal lands, and to \ndesignate certain Federal lands as Ancient Forests, Roadless Areas, \nWatershed Protection Areas, Special Areas, and Federal Boundary Areas \nwhere logging and other intrusive activities are prohibited; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     THE SAVE AMERICA'S FORESTS ACT\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator Kerry and I are \nintroducing the Save America's Forests Act. I rise to draw this \ncountry's attention to the management practices that threaten the \nhealth of our Nation's forest lands. When this country was founded over \n200 years ago, it is estimated that there was 1 billion acres of forest \nland across this Nation. Today, 95 percent of those original virgin \nforests have been cut down.\n  Forests are unique and valuable public assets. Large, unfragmented \nforest watersheds provide high-quality water supplies for drinking, \nagriculture, industry, as well as habitat for recreational and \ncommercial fisheries and other wildlife. The large-scale destruction of \nnatural forests threatens other industries such as tourism and fishing \nwith job loss. As a legacy for the enjoyment, knowledge, and well-being \nof future generations, provisions must be made for the protection and \nperpetuation of America's forests. We must also set an example to \npoorer developing countries to preserve their vast forests so they do \nnot make the same mistakes we did. We cannot call upon these countries \nto preserve large portions of their rain forests when we do not \npreserve the last fraction of our own ancient forests.\n  Clear cutting, even aged logging practices, and timber road \nconstruction have been the preferred management practices used on our \nFederal forests in recent years. These practices have caused widespread \nforest ecosystem fragmentation and degradation. The result is species \nextinction, soil erosion, flooding, declining water quality, \ndiminishing commercial and sport fisheries--that is, salmon--and \nmudslides. Mudslides in Western forest regions during recent winter \nflooding have caused millions of dollars of environmental and property \ndamage, and resulted in several deaths. An environmentally sustainable \nalternative to these practices is selection management: the selection \nsystem involves the removal of trees of different ages either singly or \nin small groups in order to preserve the biodiversity of the forest.\n  Destructive forestry practices such as clearcutting on Federal lands \nwas legalized by the passage of the National Forest Management Act of \n1976. From 1984 to 1991, an average of 243,000 acres were clearcut \nannually on Federal lands. During the same time period an average of \nonly 33,000 acres were harvested using the protective selection \nmanagement practices. Interpretations of forestry laws have also been \nused by Federal managers to include the promotion of even age logging \nand road construction. In addition, the laws are not effective in \npreserving our forests because in many cases judges do not allow \ncitizens standing in court to ensure that the Forest Service or other \nagencies follow the environmental protections of the law.\n  I am introducing this legislation to halt and reverse the effects of \ndeforestation on Federal lands by ending the practice of clearcutting, \nwhile promoting environmentally compatible and economically sustainable \nselection management logging. It is important to note this legislation \nwould only apply to Federal forests which constitute 20 percent of the \ncountry's harvestable timber supply, the vast majority of the 490 \nmillion acres of harvestable timber are privately owned and unaffected \nby the bill. This legislation\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\nputs forward positive alternatives that will achieve two principle \npolicies for our Federal forests. First, the act would ban logging and \nroad building in remaining core areas of biodiversity throughout the \nFederal forest system including roadless areas, specially designated \nareas and 13 million acres of Ancient Forests. Second, in noncore areas \nit would abolish environmentally dangerous forms of logging such as \nclearcutting and even aged logging.\n  The act requires selection management logging practices to be used \nwhereby timber companies would only be allowed to log a certain \npercentage of the forests over specified periods of time. Further it \ntakes extra steps to protect watersheds and fisheries by prohibiting \nlogging in buffer areas along streams, lakes, and wetlands. The act \nwould also call for an independent panel of scientists to develop a \nplan to restore and rejuvenate those forests and their ecosystems that \nare damaged from decades of these logging practices. And finally, the \nlegislation would empower citizen involvement in insuring compliance \nwith environmental protections of forest management laws by making \ncertain that all citizens have standing to pursue actions in court.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 977\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are, on all Federal \n     public lands, to conserve native biodiversity and to protect \n     all native ecosystems against losses that result from--\n       (1) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging; and\n       (2) logging in Ancient Forests, Roadless Areas, Watershed \n     Protection Areas, Special Areas, and Federal Boundary Areas.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal agencies of the United States that engage in \n     even-age logging practices include the Forest Service of the \n     Department of Agriculture, the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior, and the \n     Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Department of Defense.\n       (2) Even-age logging causes substantial alterations in \n     native biodiversity by emphasizing the production of a \n     limited number of commercial species of trees on each site, \n     generally only one; by manipulating the vegetation toward \n     greater relative density of such commercial species, by \n     suppressing competing species, and by planting, on numerous \n     sites, a commercial strain that was developed to reduce the \n     relative diversity of genetic strains that previously \n     occurred within the species on the same sites.\n       (3) Even-age logging kills immobile species and the very \n     young of mobile species of wildlife and depletes the habitat \n     of deep-forest species of animals, including endangered \n     species.\n       (4) Even-age logging exposes the soil to direct sunlight \n     and the impact of rains, disrupts the surface, and compacts \n     organic layers. It disrupts the run-off restraining \n     capabilities of roots and low-lying vegetation, which results \n     in soil erosion, the leaching our of nutrients, a reduction \n     in the biological content of the soil, and the impoverishment \n     of the soil. All these consequences have a long-range \n     deleterious effect on all land resources, including timber \n     production.\n       (5) Even-age logging decreases the capability of the soil \n     to retain carbon and, during the critical periods of felling \n     and site preparation, reduces the capacity of the biomass to \n     process and to store carbon, with a resultant of loss of such \n     carbon to the atmosphere, thereby aggravating global warming.\n       (6) Even-age logging renders the soil increasingly \n     sensitive to acid deposits by causing a decline of soil wood \n     and coarse woody debris, thereby reducing the capacity of the \n     soil to retain water and nutrients, which increases soil heat \n     and impairs the soil's ability to maintain protective carbon \n     compounds on its surface.\n       (7) Even-age logging results in increased stream \n     sedimentation, the silting of stream bottoms, a decline in \n     water quality, and the impairment of life cycles and spawning \n     processes of aquatic life from benthic organisms to large \n     fish, thereby depleting the sports and commercial fisheries \n     of the United States.\n       (8) Even-age logging increases harmful edge effects, \n     including blowdowns, invasions by weed species, and heavier \n     losses to predators and competitors.\n       (9) Even-age logging decreases the land's recreational \n     values, reducing deep, canopied, variegated, permanent \n     forests, thereby limiting areas where the public can fulfill \n     an expending need for recreation. Even-age logging replaces \n     such forests with a surplus of clearings that grow into \n     relatively impenetrable thickets of saplings, and then into \n     monoculture tree plantations.\n       (10) Human beings depend on native biological resources, \n     including plants, animals, and micro-organisms, for food, \n     medicine, shelter, and other important products, and as a \n     source of intellectual and scientific knowledge, recreation, \n     and aesthetic pleasure.\n       (11) Alteration of native biodiversity has serious \n     consequences for human welfare as America irretrievably loses \n     resources for research and agricultural, medicinal, and \n     industrial development.\n       (12) Alteration of biodiversity in Federal forests \n     adversely affects the functions of ecosystems and critical \n     ecosystem processes that moderate climate, govern nutrient \n     cycles and soil conservation and production, control pests \n     and diseases, and degrade wastes and pollutants.\n       (13) The harm of even-age logging to the natural resources \n     of this Nation and the quality of life of its people are \n     substantial, severe, and avoidable.\n       (14) By substituting selection management, as prescribed in \n     this Act, for the even-age system, the Federal agencies now \n     engaged in even-age logging would substantially reduce \n     devastation to the environment and would improve the quality \n     of life of the American people.\n       (15) By protecting native biodiversity, as prescribed in \n     this Act, Federal agencies would maintain vital native \n     ecosystems and would improve the quality of life of the \n     American people.\n       (16) Selection logging is more job intensive, and therefore \n     provides more employment than even-age logging to manage the \n     same amount of timber production, and produces higher quality \n     sawlogs.\n       (17) The court remedies now available to enforce Federal \n     forest laws are inadequate, and should be strengthened by \n     providing for injunctions, declaratory judgments, statutory \n     damages, and reasonable costs of suit.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (1) In General.--This Act and the amendments made by this \n     Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (b) Effect on Existing Contracts.--The amendments made by \n     this Act shall not apply with respect to any contract to sell \n     timber which was awarded on or before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n          TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING LAND MANAGEMENT LAWS\n\n     SEC. 101.

The vast majority of the \n     remnants of America's original forests are located on Federal \n     lands.\n       (3) Large, unfragmented forest watersheds provide high-\n     quality water supplies for drinking, agriculture, industry, \n     and fisheries across the United States.\n       (4) The most recent scientific studies indicate that \n     several thousand species of plants and animals are dependent \n     on large, unfragmented forest areas.\n       (5) Many neotropical migratory songbird species are \n     currently experiencing documented broad-scale population \n     declines and require large, unfragmented forests to ensure \n     their survival.\n       (6) Destruction of large-scale natural forests has resulted \n     in a tremendous loss of jobs in the fishing, hunting, \n     tourism, recreation, and guiding industries, and has \n     adversely affected sustainable nontimber forest products \n     industries such as the collection of mushrooms and herbs.\n       (7) Extractive logging programs on Federal lands are \n     carried out at enormous financial costs to the United States \n     Treasury and American taxpayers.\n       (8) The Ancient Forests continue to be threatened by \n     logging and deforestation and are rapidly disappearing.\n       (9) Ancient Forests help regulate atmospheric balance, \n     maintain biodiversity, and provide valuable scientific \n     opportunity for monitoring the health of the planet.\n       (10) Prohibiting extractive logging in the Ancient Forests \n     would create the best conditions for ensuring stable, well \n     distributed, and viable populations of the northern spotted \n     owl, marbled murrelet, American marten, and other \n     vertebrates, invertebrates, vascular plants, and nonvascular \n     plants associated with those forests.\n       (11) Prohibiting extractive logging in the Ancient Forests \n     would create the best conditions for ensuring stable, well \n     distributed, and viable populations of anadromous salmonids, \n     resident salmonids, and bull trout.\n       (12) Roadless areas are de facto wilderness that provide \n     wildlife habitat and recreation.\n       (13) Roadless areas contain many of the largest \n     unfragmented forests on Federal lands. Large unfragmented \n     forests are among the last refuges for native animal and \n     plant biodiversity, and are vital to maintaining viable \n     populations of threatened, endangers, sensitive, and rare \n     species.\n       (14) Roads cause soil erosion, disrupt wildlife migration, \n     and allow nonnative species of plants and animals to invade \n     native forests.\n       (15) The morality and reproduction patterns of forest \n     dwelling animal populations are adversely affected by \n     traffic-related fatalities that accompany roads.\n       (16) The exceptional recreational, biological, scientific, \n     or economic assets of certain special forested areas on \n     Federal lands are valuable to the American public and are \n     damaged by extractive logging in these areas.\n       (17) In order to gauge the effectiveness and \n     appropriateness of current and future resource management \n     activities, and to continue to broaden and develop our \n     understanding of silvicultural practices, many special \n     forested areas need to remain in a natural, unmanaged state \n     to serve as scientifically established baseline control \n     forests.\n       (18) Certain special forested areas provide habitat for the \n     survival and recovery of endangered and threatened plant and \n     wildlife species such as grizzly bears, spotted owls, Pacific \n     salmon, and Pacific yew that are harmed by extractive \n     logging.\n       (19) Many special forested areas on Federal lands are \n     considered sacred sites by native peoples.\n       (20) Ecological, economic, and aesthetic values on private \n     property are damaged by logging and roadbuilding in Federal \n     Boundary Areas.\n       (21) As a legacy for the enjoyment, knowledge, and well-\n     being of future generations, provisions must be made for the \n     protection and perpetuation of America's Ancient Forests, \n     Roadless Areas, Watershed Protection Areas, Special Areas, \n     and Federal Boundary Areas.\n\n     SEC. 202.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nemployers a credit for a portion of the expenses of providing dependent \ncare services to employees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                     the affordable child care act\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Affordable Child Care Act, which will ease the financial burden of \nchild care for working families by reducing the cost of day care. I \nwould like to commend Congressman Jon Fox from Pennsylvania's 13th \nDistrict, who has sponsored this legislation in the House. Our bill \nwould provide a tax credit for employers who provide on-site or site-\nadjacent child care to their employees in order to reduce the child \ncare expenses of the employee.\n  Many employees have expressed support for on-site day care \nfacilities, which allow parents to spend more time with their children \nduring the day, such as over the lunch hour. On-site child care may not \nbe the best option for all families. Many families rely on relatives, \ncenters operated by churches and other religious organizations, or make \nother arrangements to provide care for their children while they work. \nHowever, it is my view that this bill represents a good start toward \nreducing the cost of child care for many Americans.\n  The need for affordable and accessible day care is critical given the \nincreasing numbers of working parents and dual-income families in the \nUnited States. According to the Bureau of the Census, in 1975, 31 \npercent of married mothers with a child younger than age 1 participated \nin the labor force. By 1995, that figure had risen to 59 percent. \nAlmost 64 percent of married mothers and 53 percent of single mothers \nwith children younger than age six participated in the labor force in \n1995.\n  Yet, as reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on June 5, 1996, only \n13 percent of all major U.S. companies provide some form of on-site day \ncare. Further, it costs at least $1 million to start up such a day care \ncenter. About 70 percent of working parents missed at least 1 work day \nin the past year because of child-related problems, according to Work \nFamily Directions of Boston, a company that advises firms on how to \nimprove work and family programs. A 1991 estimate by the Child Care \nAction Committee, a national child care advocacy group, found that U.S. \nbusinesses lose $3 billion a year because of child care related \nabsences.\n  The cost of child care for families is also significant. A 1995 \nreport by the Census Bureau showed that in 1993, the average weekly \nchild care cost per arrangement paid by families with employed mothers \nwas $57. Parents using organized child care facilities paid the most \nper arrangement at around $65 per week. Child care is even more \nexpensive in metropolitan areas than nonmetropolitan areas, averaging \n$80 per week versus $55 per week. I know that licensed day care centers \nin some urban areas cost as much as $200 per week, which is quite a \nburden on families which need the second income. These figures serve to \nunderscore the need for action on the part of the Federal Government to \nprovide the necessary assistance to our Nation's working families.\n  Accordingly, the legislation I am proposing today would provide a tax \ncredit to businesses that provide licensed, on-site or site-adjacent \nchild care for their employees. Employers would be eligible for a tax \ncredit equal to 50 percent of the net cost of providing dependent care \nservices at a child day care facility for employees. This bill also \nprovides, however, that no credit shall be allocated unless the \nemployer certifies that the amount of such a credit is passed on to the \nemployees using the provider day care in the form of reduced child care \ncosts.\n  The Affordable Child Care Act complements my recent efforts to assist \nworking families in a number of areas. When Congress debated welfare \nreform in 1995 and 1996, I worked to ensure that adequate funds were \nprovided for child care, a critical component for welfare mothers who \nwould be required to work to receive new limited welfare benefits. I am \npleased that the welfare reform bill that became law provides $20 \nbillion in child care funding over a 6-year period.\n\n  Providing health insurance for children is also a top priority of \nmine, and I have sponsored legislation to establish a discretionary \npilot program to cover the 4.2 million children of the working poor, \nwho are not eligible for Medicaid but whose parents cannot afford \nprivate insurance. I am also a cosponsor of legislation introduced by \nmy colleagues, Senators Chafee and Rockefeller, to expand the Medicaid \nProgram to cover children whose families earn up to 150 percent of the \nFederal poverty level.\n  To encourage the adoption of children into healthy and stable \nfamilies, last April I introduced the Adoption Promotion Act of 1996 \n(S. 1715) with 13 other Senators to provide tax credits for families \nthat adopt. Subsequently, a broader piece of tax legislation, the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of\n\n[[Page S6741]]\n\n1996, was passed by Congress and signed into law on August 20, 1996. \nThis act included a $5,000 adoption tax credit for qualified adoption \nexpenses and a $6,000 tax credit for special needs adoptions, and was \nmuch like our legislation. I recently reintroduced legislation to \nincrease the tax credit for special needs adoptions for $7,500, and \npermit penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts up \nto $2,000 for adoption expenses.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, encouraging businesses to provide \naffordable child care for their employees will help provide peace of \nmind to those in our Nation struggling to balance career and family. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation, and I urge its swift adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 979. A bill to provide a tax credit to families with elderly \nfamily members living in the family home; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         tax credit legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that would provide a $2,500 tax credit for individuals or \nfamilies with elderly family members living in the family home. As we \nall know, our Nation's population is living longer. With advances in \nmedical treatment, improvements in the Nation's nutrition, and the \ndevelopment of drugs to combat infectious diseases, our Nation's \nelderly population is expected to more than double by the year 2050. \nThis demographic change presents a unique challenge to America, and it \nis our duty to work together to ensure that our Nation's elderly and \nevery generation of American families maintain a high quality of life.\n  Since the Great Depression, our Government has instituted several \nextremely successful social insurance programs to protect the elderly. \nThe Social Security Program has provided an income security net, and \nthe Medicare Program has insured that senior citizens are afforded \naccess to medical care. Many families, however, are faced with \ndifficult decisions when elderly family members are no longer able to \nlive alone. Many of these seniors are brought into the family home. \nOthers are placed in institutional nursing facilities.\n  While multigenerational families are not a new phenomenon in America, \na new survey released by the National Alliance for Caregiving \nillustrates how contemporary multigenerational families are faced with \nextraordinary pressures. Nearly two of three individuals who \nprovide care to elderly family members are employed full or part time, \nand about half have reported that their caretaking duties have made \nthem late for work, forced them to come home early or to take time off. \nThese caregivers spend an average of 18 hours a week taking care of \nloved ones, grocery shopping, managing their medications, and helping \nwith transportation and personal care. Many people needing care are \nchronically ill. More than one in five caregivers, or about 5 million \nhouseholds nationwide, take care of someone with Alzheimer's disease, \nconfusion, dementia or forgetfulness.\n\n  Today, millions of American families face a no-win situation when an \nelderly family member is no longer able to live independently. Taking a \nloved one into the family home may be much desired instead of having to \nsee a person impoverished by the Medicaid eligibility rules and left a \nward of the State, living in a nursing home. Obviously, on the other \nhand, very few families can afford to pay for private nursing home care \nthemselves. But, bringing an elderly relative into the family home is \ncostly. Our public policy should recognize this dilemma and support \nthose loving families seeking to care for the elderly with their own \nresources in their own homes.\n  Currently, there are more than 33.5 million Americans who are 65 \nyears of age and older. In my own State of Pennsylvania, there are 2 \nmillion individuals 65 years of age and older. Many of these seniors \nlive independent lives. However, nationwide approximately 3.9 million \nof our elderly citizens live with relatives other than their spouse and \nan additional 1.7 million seniors live in nursing homes. My amendment \nwould provide a $2,500 tax credit to individuals or families who care \nfor an elderly family member in the family home. In order to qualify \nfor this tax credit, the elderly family member would have to be at \nleast 65 years old, would have to reside with their family at least \nhalf of the taxable year, and must have been eligible under current law \nto be claimed as a dependent on the family's tax return.\n  With this amendment, families will be given the vital assistance \nnecessary to provide care to seniors in their homes. It will also \nprovide flexibility to families who would like to provide care to \nfamily members in their home rather than place these seniors in \ninstitutionalized care facilities, but are otherwise unable to afford \nthis financial commitment. In Congress, we have made many speeches \nabout strengthening the American family and about providing support for \nour Nations senior citizens. This bill would accomplish both of these \nimportant goals. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of \nthis bill to find real solutions to the real problems faced by the \ngrowing numbers of caregivers and senior citizens in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 980. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to close the U.S. \nArmy School of the Americas; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n             the school of the americas closure act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call upon my colleagues to \nsupport a bill to close the School of the Americas.\n  The School of the Americas is an institute that has outlived its \nusefulness and its purpose. SOA was established over 50 years ago. Its \nmission is to provide military education and training to military \npersonnel of Central America, South America, and Caribbean countries. \nThe training provided at the school in tactical intelligence, infantry \ntactics, combat skills, and battle planning was designed in accordance \nwith U.S. strategy of a bygone era: to create a Latin and South \nAmerican staging area to thwart the Communist threat. But times have \nchanged and there is no longer a Soviet bloc threatening to attack the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, SOA has not successfully adapted to the \ngreat changes in the world since the 1992 breakup of the Soviet Union. \nDespite attempts made over the past couple of years to update the \ncurriculum and improve the selection process for students and the \nquality of the teaching staff, SOA remains an anachronism.\n  In the post-cold-war era, we need to strengthen civilian institutions \nin Latin America and help these countries continue to reform their \nmilitaries. This region contains some of the most fragile democracies \nwhich need our support in encouraging democratically elected \ngovernments, the role of civilian institutions and economic stability. \nOur focus should be on supporting these nascent civilian governments \nand helping them shift authority away from their militaries.\n  I also believe the school should be closed because of its past links \nto numerous military personnel who have committed some of the most \nheinous crimes of recent memory. SOA graduates include: Panamanian \ndictator and drug dealer, Manuel Noriega; 19 Salvadoran soldiers linked \nto the 1989 murder of 6 Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her \ndaughter; El Salvador death squad leader, Roberto D'Aubuisson; \nArgentinian dictator, Leopoldo Galtieri; three of the five officers \ninvolved in the 1980 rape and murder of four United States churchwomen \nin El Salvador; and 10 of the 12 officers responsible for the murder of \n900 civilians in the El Salvadoran village, El Mozote. These criminals, \nmultiple murderers, and rapists are former students and graduates of \nthe School of the Americas where they received their military and \ncounterinsurgency training.\n  The U.S. military has readily admitted that these SOA graduates were \nguilty of these atrocities. These admissions are an embarrassment to \nthe United States and to our reputation as a leader in promoting human \nrights throughout the world.\n  In addition, recently the Pentagon released the training manuals used \nat\n\n[[Page S6742]]\n\nSOA from 1982 to 1991. These manuals contained instruction in torture \nand extortion techniques. These manuals are inconsistent with U.S. \npolicy and democratic ideals. I am concerned that there might be other \nformer students, trained with these manuals and guilty of human rights \nabuses but who have not as yet come to public attention.\n  Some have suggested that if SOA is revamped and reorganized that it \ncould still serve a useful purpose. I disagree. SOA cannot be salvaged. \nIts reputation is too tarnished and its name is too closely linked to \nthe assassins and rapists who were trained there. The United States \ncannot deny the human rights violations inflicted by the graduates of \nSOA. But, we still need to find a resolution for these terrible events. \nI believe that closing SOA is the only way to finally break with this \nchapter in U.S. history.\n  Our South American neighbors need to know that human rights and \ndemocratic values are held in high esteem in the United States. We are \nhampered in making this claim as long as the School of the Americas \nremains open. The continued funding of SOA does not fit into the United \nStates long-term strategy for the Latin American region and undermines \nour credibility on human rights issues in this hemisphere. I call upon \nmy colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and support the closure of \nthe School of the Americas.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as an original \ncosponsor of the legislation being introduced today by the Senator from \nIllinois [Mr. Durbin] to close the U.S. Army School of the Americas \n[SOA] located at Fort Benning, GA.\n  SOA was created in 1946 to train Latin American military officers in \ncombat and counterinsurgency skills, with the goal of professionalizing \nLatin American armies and strengthening democracies. Originally located \nin Panama, the SOA moved to Fort Benning in 1948. There has been a \ngreat deal of controversy surrounding the types of leaders that have \ngraduated from the SOA, leading it to be called the School for \nDictators. Some of SOA's graduates include Manuel Noriega, at least 19 \nSalvadorean officers implicated by El Salvador's Truth Commission in \nthe murder of 6 Jesuit priests, and officers who participated in the \ncoup against former Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\n  In 1991, following an internal investigation, the Pentagon removed \ncertain SOA training manuals from circulation. On September 22, 1996, \nthe Pentagon released the full text of those training manuals and \nacknowledged that some of those manuals provided instruction in \ntechniques that, in the Pentagon's words, were ``clearly objectionable \nand possibly illegal.'' The techniques in question included torture, \nextortion, false arrest, and execution. I and other Senators have \nwritten the Department of Defense several times to request additional \ndisclosure of SOA policies, curriculums, training manuals and other \nmaterials so that the history of the school can be fully understood.\n  The horrendous record of the SOA has inspired hundreds of Wisconsin \nresidents to contact my office to express their support for closing \nthis school. Numerous organizations, including Public Citizen, the \nWashington Office on Latin America and Human Rights Watch also support \nthe elimination of SOA.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am \ncommitted to promoting human rights throughout the world. In my view, \nour Government cannot continue to support the existence of a school \nthat counts so many murderers among its alumni. While I do not doubt \nthat it can be in our national interest to conduct military training \nwith our friends and partners, it is unexcusable that such military \ntraining should take place at an institution with the reputation of the \nSchool of the Americas. This bill gives Members of the Senate an \nopportunity to separate the legitimate training exercises conducted by \nthe U.S. military from the sordid acts of many individuals who have \nbeen trained at SOA. We must lift the cloud of suspicion that has \nfallen on these programs by closing SOA once and for all.\n  Not only are the human costs of this training program unjustifiable, \nbut so are its monetary costs. With a national debt in excess of $5 \ntrillion, every Federal program needs to be carefully scrutinized to \nensure that Federal tax dollars are wisely spent. Given the end of the \ncold war, and in light of documents indicating the SOA training program \nprovided instruction in techniques which violate human rights \nstandards, I feel that the School of Americas is an unwise expenditure, \nand I support eliminating it as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Abraham, \n        Mr. Robb, Mr. Roth, Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 981. A bill to provide for analysis of major rules; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 The Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today Senator Thompson and I are joined by \nSenators Glenn, Abraham, Robb, Rockefeller, Roth, and Stevens in \nintroducing the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997. The bill would put \ninto law--first, basic requirements for cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment of major rules; second, a process for the review of existing \nrules where there is a possibility of achieving significantly greater \nnet benefits; and third, executive oversight of the rulemaking process. \nIt builds on the bipartisan Roth-Glenn bill that was unanimously \nreported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee in 1995.\n  This bill would require agencies, when issuing rules that have a \nmajor impact on the economy or a sector of the economy, to do a cost-\nbenefit analysis to determine whether the benefits of the rule justify \nits costs and to determine whether the regulatory option chosen by the \nagency is more cost effective or provides greater net benefits than \nother regulatory options considered by the agency. If the rule involves \na risk to health, safety or the environment, the bill requires the \nagency to do a risk assessment as part of the analysis of the benefits \nof the rule.\n  The bill also requires agencies that issue major rules to establish \nadvisory committees to identify existing rules that the agency should \nconsider for review because they have the potential, if modified, to \nachieve significantly greater net benefits. It would also codify the \nreview procedure now conducted by the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs [OIRA] and require public disclosure of OIRA's \nreview process.\n  The bill is significantly different from S. 343, the Dole-Johnston \nbill which I strongly opposed and which was rejected by the Senate in \nthe 104th Congress.\n  It does not create a supermandate that would amend existing laws nor \ndoes it contain mandatory decisional criteria that would establish new \nstandards for an agency to meet. It does require agencies to conduct \ncost-benefit analyses for major rules and explain whether the benefits \nof the rules justify the costs and whether the rule is cost-effective \nthan the other alternatives considered by the agency. It does not \nmandate the outcome of the process, only the process itself.\n  It does not provide for judicial review of the process for, or the \ncontents of, the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment. The cost-\nbenefit analysis and risk assessment are made part of the rulemaking \nrecord for judicial review of whether the final rule is reasonable.\n  It does not provide for a petition process for challenging existing \nrules. It provides for advisory committees to identify rules for \npossible review, gives the agency head the discretion to select rules \nfor review especially taking into account the resources of the agency, \nand requires the agency to review the rules scheduled for review in 5 \nyears.\n\n  Mr. President, many people think that when many of us fought hard \nagainst the Dole-Johnston bill that we didn't really want to reform the \nregulatory process. Well they are wrong. Many of us were disappointed \nthat we were unable to pass a comprehensive regulatory reform bill in \nthe last Congress. We weren't going to support bad reform, but that \ndoesn't mean we didn't want to see good reform. Those of us who believe \nin the benefits of regulation to protect health and safety have a \nparticular responsibility to make sure that regulations are sensible \nand cost-effective. When they aren't, the regulatory process--which is \nso\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\nvital to our health and well being --comes under constant attack . By \nproviding a common sense, moderate and open regulatory process, we are \ncontributing to the well being of that process and immunizing it from \nthe attacks on excesses.\n  Mr. President, I've fought for regulatory reform since 1979, the year \nI came to the Senate. I even had as part of my platform back in 1978, \nthe legislative veto--which would give Congress the chance to block \nexcessively costly and burdensome regulations before they take effect. \nThat was my battle cry for years. I worked with former Senator Boren, \nfor instance, trying to get an across-the-board legislative veto bill \nenacted into law. Last Congress we were finally able to get a version \nof that adopted.\n  I was also the author of the Regulatory Negotiation Act which was \npassed in 1990 and reauthorized in 1995 to encourage agencies to use \nthe collegial process of negotiation in developing certain rules in \norder to avoid the delays and costs inherent in the otherwise \nadversarial process.\n  As for an overall regulatory reform bill, I've supported such \nlegislation since 1980, when the Senate first passed S. 1080, the \nLaxalt-Leahy bill only to have it die later that year in the House.\n  At the same time, I took a strong stand against several damaging \nregulatory reform proposals from the House including an overall \nmoratorium of regulations and against the Dole-Johnston bill in the \nSenate. I will not support any regulatory reform proposal that I \nbelieve would roll back important environmental, public health and \nsafety protections. Nor will I support any regulatory reform proposal \nthat I believe will lead to gridlock in the agencies or the courts. We \ncertainly don't need that.\n  We do need--better cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, more \nflexibility for the regulated industries to reach legislative goals in \na variety of ways, more cooperative efforts between government and \nindustry and less ``us versus them'' attitudes.\n  Based on these common principles, Senator Thompson and I have been \nworking for months on this legislative proposal that I hope will yield \na more rational and fair regulatory process and better, more flexible, \nmore cost-effective and more enforceable regulations.\n  Let me highlight some important features of this legislation.\n  First, we say right from the beginning, in the section on findings, \nthat cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are useful tools to help \nagencies issue reasonable regulations. But they are only tools; they \nare not the sole basis upon which regulations should be developed or \nissued. They do not, we explicitly state, they do not replace the need \nfor good judgment and the agencies' consideration of social values in \ndeciding when and how to regulate.\n  We define benefits very broadly--expressly taking into account \nnonquantifiable benefits. There is nothing in this bill that suggests \nthat the assessment of benefits by an agency should be only \nquantifiable. On the contrary, this bill explicitly recognizes that \nmany important benefits may be nonquantifiable, and that agencies have \nthe right and authority to fully consider such benefits when doing the \ncost-benefit analysis and when determining whether the benefits justify \nthe costs. We emphatically do not intend for the benefits part of the \nequation in the cost-benefit analysis to be limited to merely those \nbenefits that are quantifiable.\n  We direct the agencies to consider regulatory options that provide \nflexibility, where possible, to the regulated parties. I have been a \nlongtime proponent of performance standards in regulations and not the \nso-called command and control approach. This bill urges the agencies to \ninclude in its identification of possible regulatory approaches that \npermit flexibility in achieving the required goal, either through \nperformance standards or market type mechanisms.\n  The definition of major rule, to which the provisions of this bill \napply, is limited to those with a $100 million impact on the economy \nand those otherwise designated by the Administrator of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs [OIRA].\n  The bill requires an agency issuing a major rule to evaluate the \nbenefits and costs of a ``reasonable number of reasonable alternatives \nreflecting the range of regulatory options that would achieve the \nobjective of the statute as addressed by the rulemaking.'' I am quoting \nthese words, because they are significant. The bill doesn't require an \nagency to look at all the possible alternatives, just a reasonable \nnumber; but it does require the agency to pick a selection of options \nthat are available to it within the range of the rulemaking objective.\n\n  This cost-benefit analysis, of which any risk assessment would be a \npart, is intended to be transparent to the public; that is, those of us \noutside the agency--Congress, the regulated community, the \nbeneficiaries of the regulation, the general public--should be able to \nsee and understand the thinking the agency used to select the \nregulatory option it did, as well as the underlying scientific and/or \neconomic data. Agencies should not hide the important information that \nforms the basis of their regulatory actions.\n  Another important provision of this bill is the one that requires the \nagency to make a reasonable determination whether the benefits of the \nrule justify the costs and whether the regulatory option selected by \nthe agency is substantially likely to achieve the objective of the \nrulemaking in a more cost effective manner or with greater net benefits \nthan the other regulatory options considered by the agency. This is not \nin any way a decisional criteria that the agency must meet. This only \nrequires the agency to make its assessment. And, if, as the agency is \nfree to do, it chooses a regulatory option where the benefits do not \njustify the costs or that is not more cost effective or does not \nprovide greater net benefits than the other options, the agency is \nrequired to explain why it did what it did and list the factors that \ncaused it to so. Those factors could be a statute, a policy judgment, \nuncertainties in the data and the like. There is no added judicial \nscrutiny of a rule provided for or intended by this section. The final \nrule must still stand or fall based on whether the court finds that the \nrule is arbitrary or capricious in light of the whole rulemaking \nrecord. That is the current standard of judicial review.\n  The bill says that if an agency cannot make the determinations \nrequired by the bill, it has to say why it can't. Use of the word \ncannot does not mean that an agency rule can be overturned by a court \nfor its failure to pick an option that would permit the agency to make \nthe determinations required by the bill. The agency is free to use its \ndiscretion to regulate under the substantive statute, and there is no \nimplication that such rule must meet the standards described in the \ndeterminations subsection. It does mean, though, that the agency is \nrequired to make such determinations and let the public know why it \npicked the regulatory option that it did, and if it can't say, or \ndetermine, that the regulatory option it chose is the most cost \neffective or provides greatest net benefits, it must say why it chose \nit. This legislation requires only that the agency be up front with the \npublic as to just how cost beneficial and cost effective its regulatory \nproposal is.\n  The risk assessment requirement in this bill, unlike previous bills, \nis not unduly proscriptive. It establishes basic elements for \nperforming risk assessments, many of which, again, will provide \ntransparency for an agency's development of a rule, and it requires \nguidelines for such assessments to be issued by OIRA in consultation \nwith the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n  Peer review, Mr. President, is required by this bill for both cost-\nbenefit analyses and risk assessments, but only once per rule. Peer \nreview is not required at both the proposed and final rule stages. \nThere is great concern in the public interest community, that there \nwill not be sufficient personnel available with appropriate expertise \nand independence to serve on each of these peer review bodies. I am \nhoping to pursue that issue at greater length during our committee \nhearings.\n  There is a similar concern by the public interest sector as to the \navailability of a balanced cross-section of individuals to serve on the \nadvisory committees required for the review of rules. Service on such \nbodies obviously takes time and expertise and both of\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nthose cost money. I hope we can also address the concerns about the \npossibility of inadequate levels of participation by groups and \ninterests which have fiscal constraints that could preclude their full \nparticipation.\n  Mr. President, the review of rules provision in this bill is also a \nreasonable approach. Unlike past proposals, it does not provide for an \nautomatic sunset of a rule that is not reviewed pursuant to the \nschedule. Rather it provides for the agency to determine during the \nreview period of rules it chooses to review whether it is going to \ncontinue, modify, or repeal the rule under review. If it fails to make \nthat determination and take the appropriate action, the agency can be \nsued under the existing provision of the Administrative Procedure Act \nto force agency action unlawfully withheld.\n\n  Rules would be scheduled for review under the provisions of this \nbill, only at the discretion of the agency head. However, the public \nwould know the list of rules recommended for review by the advisory \ncommittee. The advisory committee would recommend those rules for \nreview that, if modified, could result in substantially greater net \nbenefits to society. That is the standard the committees are supposed \nto apply. The agency must review the recommendations of the advisory \ncommittee and develop a schedule for review of rules taking into \naccount the resources available to the agency to conduct such reviews.\n  Judicial review has been of great concern to those of us who want \nreal regulatory reform without bottling up important regulations in the \ncourts. There is no judicial review permitted of the cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment required by this bill outside of judicial \nreview of the final rule. The analysis and assessment are included in \nthe rulemaking record, but there is no judicial review of the content \nof those items or the procedural steps followed or not followed by the \nagency in the development of the analysis or assessment. Only the total \nfailure to actually do the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment \nwould allow the court to remand the rule to the agency.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill puts into law the requirement that \nthe President establish a process for reviewing rules and coordinating \nFederal agency regulatory actions. Despite over 15 years of Executive \norders that impose such a requirement, Congress has yet to put such a \nresponsibility of the President into law. This bill would do that. And \nwith that responsibility goes the obligation of the President, acting \nthrough OIRA, to make public the process and results of its review of \nagency rules. This is an important element of accountability, and such \ndisclosure should not depend upon the whim of the President but rather \non the requirements imposed by permanent law.\n  So those are some highlights. Senator Thompson has committed to \nhearings on the bill. Everybody will be given an opportunity to comment \nand identify potential problems and possible improvements.\n  I believe this bill will improve the regulatory process, will build \nconfidence in the regulatory programs that are so important to this \nsociety's well-being, and will result in a better--and I believe--a \nless contentious regulatory process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 981\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory Improvement Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Current regulatory programs can be improved by being \n     more firmly rooted in sound economic and scientific analysis.\n       (2) Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are useful \n     tools to better inform agencies in developing regulations, \n     although they do not replace the need for good judgment and \n     consideration of values.\n       (3) Cost and risk need to be considered in evaluating \n     regulatory proposals which address health, safety, or the \n     environment. Other factors such as social values, \n     distributional effects, and equity, must also be considered.\n       (4) Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment should be \n     presented with a clear statement of the analytical \n     assumptions and uncertainties including an explanation of \n     what is known and not known and what the implications of \n     alternative assumptions might be.\n       (5) The public has a right to know about the costs and \n     benefits of regulations, the risks addressed, the amount of \n     risk reduced, and the quality of scientific and economic \n     analysis used to support decisions.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this Act, this Act shall \n     take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     but shall not apply to any agency rule for which a notice of \n     proposed rulemaking is published on or before August 1, 1997.\n\n           Summary of the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997\n\n       1. Regulatory Analysis (Sec. 623). When issuing major rules \n     (costing over $100 million or deemed by OMB to have a \n     significant impact on the economy), Federal agencies must \n     conduct a regulatory analysis, including a cost-benefit \n     analysis and, if relevant, a risk assessment.\n       a. Cost-benefit analysis. The cost-benefit analysis shall \n     consider: The expected benefits of the rule (quantifiable and \n     nonquantifiable); the expected costs of the rule \n     (quantifiable and nonquantifiable); reasonable alternatives, \n     including flexible regulatory options--such as market-based \n     mechanisms or outcome-oriented performance-based standards;\n       b. Cost-benefit determination. The agency shall include in \n     the statement of basis and purpose for the rule a reasonable \n     determination: (1) whether the rule is likely to provide \n     benefits that justify the costs of the rule; and (2) whether \n     the rule is likely to substantially achieve the rule making \n     objective in a more cost-effective manner, or with greater \n     net benefits, than the other reasonable alternatives \n     considered by the agency.\n       If the agency cannot make those determinations, it shall: \n     (1) explain why such determinations cannot be made; (2) \n     identify any statutory provision or other factor that \n     prevents such determinations; and (3) describe a reasonable \n     alternative considered by the agency, if feasible, that would \n     allow the agency to make such determinations.\n       The agency shall include an executive summary in the \n     regulatory analysis and in the statement of basis and purpose \n     for the rule.\n       There is an exception from the regulatory analysis \n     requirements when an agency must act expeditiously to address \n     an imminent threat to health, safety or the environment.\n       2. Risk assessment principles (Sec. 624). If the major rule \n     has the primary purpose of addressing health, safety, or \n     environmental risks, or results in a significant substitution \n     risk, the regulatory analysis must also include a risk \n     assessment following general statutory criteria to ensure \n     that the assessment is scientifically sound and transparent, \n     including: Identify and explain assumptions made when \n     measuring risks; provide appropriate opportunities for public \n     comment and participation during the development of the risk \n     assessment; disclose relevant information about the risk, \n     including the range and distribution of risks and \n     corresponding exposure scenarios, identifying the range and \n     distribution and likehood of risk to the general population \n     and any sensitive subpopulations, including the most \n     plausible estimates of the risks; when scientific information \n     permits, compare the risk being analyzed with other \n     reasonably comparable risks familiar to and routinely \n     encountered by the general public.\n       3. Peer review (Sec. 625). Agencies shall conduct \n     independent peer review for risk assessments and cost-benefit \n     analyses related to major rules. Peer review is not required \n     where the agency and OMB certify that an assessment or \n     analysis has previously been subjected to adequate peer \n     review.\n       4. Deadlines for rule making (Sec. 626). For two years \n     after the Act becomes effective, agencies are provided with a \n     6-month time extension from a regulatory deadline if needed \n     to satisfy the requirements of the Act.\n       5. Judicial Review (Sec. 627). Judicial review is limited \n     to making sure that agencies perform the cost-benefit \n     analyses and risk assessments for major rules. (The process \n     for and content of such analysis is not subject to separate \n     judicial review.) The cost-benefit analysis and risk \n     assessment are to be included in the rule making record for \n     purposes of judicial review of the final rule under the \n     deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.\n       6. Guidelines, interagency coordination, and research \n     (Sec. 628). Within 9 months, OMB is required to consult with \n     OSTP and relevant agencies to develop broad guidelines for \n     risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses consistent with \n     the Act.\n       Within 18 months, each relevant agency shall develop more \n     detailed guidelines for risk assessments tailored to agency \n     programs consistent with the OMB/OSTP guidelines.\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\n       OMB shall consult with OSTP to coordinate and improve \n     agency cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment practices \n     and to develop a strategy to agency research and training \n     needs.\n       Within 6 months, OMB shall consult with OSTP to arrange for \n     research to identify and evaluate a common basis to assist \n     comparative risk analysis and risk communication related to \n     both carcinogens and noncarcinogens; and to appropriately \n     incorporate risk assessments into cost-benefit analyses.\n       7. Comparative risk analysis study (Sec. 629). OMB, in \n     consultation with OSTP, shall enter into a contract with an \n     accredited scientific institution to conduct a study that \n     provides a comparison of significant health, safety and \n     environmental risks, the methodologies for such comparisons, \n     and technical guidance and recommendations on the use of \n     comparative risk analysis to set priorities within and across \n     agencies.\n       Within 5 years, the President shall submit a report to \n     Congress recommending legislative changes to assist in \n     setting priorities to more effectively and efficiently reduce \n     risks to health, safety and the environment.\n       8. Review of Rules (Sec. Sec. 631-633). Each agency that \n     has issued a major rule within the last 10 years shall \n     establish a balanced advisory committee to recommend a list \n     of rules that the agency should review to increase net \n     benefits. Membership of the committee shall include a \n     balanced cross-section of the public and private interests \n     affected by agency regulations, including small business, \n     small governments, and public interest groups.\n       After reviewing the recommendations of the advisory group, \n     the agency shall develop and issue a schedule of rules to be \n     reviewed every 5 years, taking into account the extent of the \n     agencies resources to review such rules. The agency may \n     continue, modify or repeal the reviewed rule pursuant to \n     notice and comment rule making.\n       9. Executive Oversight (Sec. Sec. 641-644). The bill \n     codifies the regulatory review process and sets out \n     responsibilities and authority of the Office of Information \n     and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to develop policies and \n     procedures to review regulatory actions and to develop and \n     oversee an annual government-wide regulatory planning process \n     that includes the review of major rules and other significant \n     regulatory actions.\n       OIRA shall establish procedures to provide public and \n     agency access to information concerning regulatory review \n     actions.\n       Information to be disclosed to the public includes: the \n     status of regulatory actions; written communications between \n     OIRA and the agency on the regulatory action; written \n     communications between OIRA and persons outside the Executive \n     Branch; and a list identifying the dates, names of \n     individuals involved, and subject matter discussed in \n     meetings and telephone conversations relating to the \n     regulatory action between OIRA and persons not employed by \n     the Executive Branch.\n       Information to be disclosed to the regulatory agency \n     includes: written communications between OIRA and persons \n     outside the Executive Branch on a regulatory action; a list \n     identifying the dates, names of individuals involved, and \n     subject matter discussed in meetings and telephone \n     conversations relating to the regulatory action between OIRA \n     and persons not employed by the Executive Branch; and a \n     written explanation of any review action taken.\n       The agency shall include in the rule making record: a \n     document identifying the substantive changes between the \n     draft submitted to the Director for review and the rule \n     subsequently announced; a document identifying those changes \n     in the rule that were made at the suggestion or \n     recommendation of the Director; and all written \n     communications exchanged between the Director and the agency \n     during the review of the rule, including drafts of all \n     proposals and associated analyses.\n       10. Effective Date (Section 4). The Act shall take effect \n     180 days after the date of enactment, but shall not apply to \n     any agency rule for which a notice of proposed rule making is \n     published on or before August 1, 1997.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to join with \nSenator Levin and several of our colleagues in introducing legislation \nto improve how the federal government regulates. This legislation is an \neffort by some of us to devise a common solution to the problems of our \nregulatory system. We have some real political differences among us, \nbut we all share the same goals: clean air and water, injury free \nworkplaces, safe transportation systems, to name a few of the good \nthings that can come from regulation. We also all share the goal of \navoiding regulation which unnecessarily interferes in people's lives \nand businesses, which costs more than it benefits, or which--\ninadvertently--causes actual harm.\n  I am pleased we are introducing this bill with Senators Glenn, \nAbraham, Robb, Roth, Rockefeller and Stevens. They have all toiled in \nthe fields to improve regulation.\n  It was in this spirit that the legislation we are introducing today \nwas drafted. The Regulatory Improvement Act will promote the public's \nright to know how and why agencies regulate, improve the quality of \ngovernment decisionmaking, and increase Government accountability and \nresponsiveness to the people it serves.\n  The problem is that agencies sometimes lose sight of common sense as \nthey create regulations. Then even well-intentioned rules can produce \ndisappointing results.\n  Consider the airbag issue that has been in the news lately. The \nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration required high-\nforce airbags to maximize the odds of survival for adult males in \nhighway crashes. But the deployment force from these airbags can be so \nsevere that they can injure children, women, and the elderly. Senator \nKempthorne has spoken about the tragic death of a young girl from Idaho \nwho was decapitated when an airbag deployed during a low-impact \ncollision. The agency is now considering the use of an airbag cut-off \nswitch to avoid these tragedies. But Mr. President, tragedies like this \nnever should have occurred. We could have avoided needless deaths and \ninjuries if the agency had carefully considered the risks that high-\nimpact airbags pose to certain populations. I hope today's proposal \nwill correct mistakes like this before they occur.\n  A second example is the removal of asbestos from our schools and \nother public buildings. Early in the 1980s, government scientists \nargued that asbestos exposure could cause thousands of deaths. Congress \nresponded by passing a sweeping law that led cities and states to spend \nnearly $20 billion to remove asbestos from public buildings. After \nfurther research, EPA officials eventually concluded that ripping out \nthe asbestos had been an expensive mistake. Ironically, removing the \nasbestos actually raised the risk to the public--because asbestos \nfibers become airborne during removal. This mistake never would have \noccurred if these increased risks had been considered in the first \nplace. I hope that would change under the Regulatory Improvement Act.\n  Finally, let me mention our Superfund requirements. Superfund was \npassed with the good intention of cleaning up America's toxic waste-\nsites. Unfortunately, things are not working as well as intended. \nSuperfund has become a legal and regulatory maze where a good 90 \npercent of insurers' costs and 20 percent of liable parties' costs are \nspent on lawyers and consultants--not on cleaning up the environment. \nWe also have to ask if we are focusing on the most important \npriorities. For example, Superfund imposes extremely stringent \nstandards for cleaning up lead in groundwater. Now, this is a good rule \nin many cases, because lead can be very toxic to children. The problem \nis that we may be overlooking more direct threats to children from \nlead. For example, lead paint in old houses can be a greater threat to \nchildren's health than lead that may be under some industrial site \nwhere there are no children. Last congress, our committee heard \ntestimony about how the Superfund law requires groundwater in a Newark \nrailyard to be cleaner than drinking water--at enormous cost. Now, if \nland is going to be used for industrial purposes, and no children will \nbe there, does this make sense? The answer may be no--those \nrequirements may not improve the environment much, but they may drive \nbusinesses out of Newark. Nobody wants to open a business near a \nSuperfund site and risk being sued. No wonder our inner cities are \nstarved for jobs. In the end, we may be hurting the very people we \nshould be concerned about--the inner-city poor, those who already have \nto live with many risks in their daily lives, those who do not have \nclout here in Washington.\n  Virtually every serious student of the regulatory process agrees we \ncan do better. One study by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found \nthat if agencies simply set their priorities in a smarter way, we could \nsave an additional 60,000 lives per year at no additional cost. Mr. \nPresident, we don't have a moment to lose when we could save more \nlives. We can set aside partisan politics, and we all can agree this is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Since I became chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have \nbeen working closely with Senator Levin to forge bipartisan legislation \nwith three major purposes:\n  First, to promote the public's right to know how and why agencies \nmake\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\nregulatory decisions. This legislation helps the public to understand \nagency decisions by directing agencies to--\n  Allow the public to comment and participate as rules are developed; \ndisclose the benefits and burdens of major rules; disclose any \nenvironmental, health and safety risks a rule is designed to reduce, \nand make those risks understandable by comparing them with other risks \nfamiliar to the public; and identify major assumptions and \nuncertainties considered in creating rules.\n  Second, to improve the quality of government decisionmaking. Careful \nthought, grounded in science, will help us to target problems and to \nfind better solutions. We must carefully craft new rules to be \neffective and efficient. Agencies will carefully consider the benefits \nand burdens of rules and use good scientific and technical information. \nAgencies will seek out smarter ways to regulate, including flexible \napproaches such as outcome-oriented performance standards and market \nmechanisms. We must modernize and improve rules already on the books. \nIndependent committees will advise agencies how to revise rules to \nsubstantially increase the benefits to the public.\n\n  And finally, to increase Government accountability to the people it \nserves. The Act will require agencies to--\n  Clearly present regulatory proposals so the public, the Congress, and \nthe President can understand the problem at hand and help find a \nsolution; explain any legal impediment or other factor hindering the \nagency from issuing cost-effective and sensible regulations, and \ndescribe any superior alternatives; disclose realistic estimates of any \nrisks addressed; document changes made to proposed rules when the rules \nare reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]; disclose \ncontacts from persons outside the executive branch with OMB when it is \nreviewing proposed rules, since such contacts may represent outside \ninfluence.\n  Mr. President, while it is important to review what this legislation \nwill accomplish, it also is important to note that this proposal avoids \nthe contentious issues that thwarted agreement on legislation last \nCongress.\n  First, this legislation does not contain a supermandate. That is, \nwhile we believe that cost-benefit analysis is an important tool to \ninform agency decisionmaking, the results of the cost-benefit analysis \ndo not trump existing law. The bill explicitly recognizes that \nsometimes an agency will issue a rule that would not pass a cost-\nbenefit test. We only ask the agency to explain why it selected such a \nrule, including any legal impediment that hindered the agency from \nissuing a cost-justified rule.\n  Second, this bill does not contain a petition process that would \nallow outside parties to sue agencies in court to change particular \nrules that the litigant does not like. While we believe there are \nfruitful opportunities to update and improve old rules, we do not want \nto set up a review process that could create a litigation morass. \nInstead of a petition process, agencies will use independent advisory \ncommittees that would recommend a list of rules that could be improved \nto substantially increase net benefits to the public. The agency would \ndefer to the recommendations of the advisory committee, but they could \nnot be dragged into court if someone wanted a different rule to be \nreviewed.\n  Finally, this bill strikes a balanced approach to judicial review. We \nallow limited judicial review under the deferential arbitrary and \ncapricious standard to ensure that agencies issue reasonable \nregulations using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment. But this legislation does not provide a series of trip \nwires that could hinder agencies from performing their missions. In \nother words, we realize the agencies may not be perfect in complying \nwith this law. They may make mistakes from time to time. We won't \nimperil important regulations because the agency made honest mistakes. \nWe just ask the agency to make reasonable and honest decisions, and the \npublic deserves no less.\n  Mr. President, we are devoting vast resources to achieve our \nregulatory goals. By some estimates, the annual regulatory burden is \nnearly $700 billion per year--almost $7,000 for the average American \nhousehold. Our regulatory goals are too important, and our resources \nare too precious, to spend this money unwisely.\n  The Regulatory Improvement Act will ensure that agencies conduct \nbetter economic and scientific analysis before they issue regulations. \nGovernment will be more open to the public, will better explain the \nproblem, and will consider the best available information to solve the \nproblem. Agencies will consider the benefits and burdens of different \nregulatory alternatives so we can reach the most sensible solutions. \nAnd agencies will modernize old rules on the books to increase the \nbenefits to the public. In the process, we won't sacrifice our \nimportant national goals and values. We can make our Government more \neffective, more open, and more accountable than ever.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to cosponsor the \nRegulatory Improvement Act of 1997. This legislation, introduced today \nby my colleagues Senator Carl Levin and Senator Fred Thompson, reflects \na bipartisan effort to establish a balanced, comprehensive \ngovernmentwide standard for Federal rulemaking.\n  As former chairman and current ranking member of the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, I have worked for over a decade to improve the \nFederal regulatory process. I must note that with me at every step has \nbeen my good friend and colleague, Senator Carl Levin. Now, we are \njoined by our new Committee Chairman, Senator Fred Thompson. I am very \nhappy to take part in this bipartisan effort.\n  Regulatory reform has seen many forms in Congress over the years, \nfrom S. 1080 over 15 years ago, to several bipartisan bills in the \n104th Congress--S. 291, our unanimous Governmental Affairs Committee \nbill introduced by Senator Roth and me, the Dole-Johnston S. 343, and \nthe Glenn-Chafee S. 1001. While these bills differed in many ways, they \nall had one thing in common, a bipartisan resolve to reform the Federal \nregulatory process.\n  The regulatory process is important because in our system of \ngovernment, Congress relies on agency regulations to ensure the \neffective implementation of the laws we enact. Improved public health \nand safety and environmental protection are some of the successes \nprovided by this process.\n  Unfortunately, despite these successes, congressional oversight has \nshown there are too many instances where agencies have regulated \nwithout sufficiently analyzing the costs and benefits of regulation. \nIndividuals, businesses, and State and local governments pay too high a \nprice for such thoughtless rules. They also are often burdened by \nstatutory requirements that force agencies to impose overly \nprescriptive requirements, unnecessary unfunded mandates, or \nunjustified costs.\n  So, while I have supported many programs to improve health and safety \nand the environment, I have also worked to improve the regulatory \nprocess. This has involved legislation and oversight in several \ndifferent areas. For example, the Paperwork Reduction Act, which we \nstrengthened in 1995, requires Federal agencies to reduce burdensome \ninformation collection activities, such as forms and regulatory \nreporting requirements. The Unfunded Mandates Act of 1994, which I \nintroduced with Senator Dirk Kempthorne, requires Congress and Federal \nagencies to account for unfunded legislative and regulatory \nrequirements imposed on State and local governments. Most recently, I \nsupported enactment of the Congressional Review Act, which provides for \nexpedited congressional review of new regulations, so that we, as \npolitically accountable public representatives, can take responsibility \nfor implementation of the laws we enact.\n  These initiatives addressed several parts of the administrative \nprocess. Still lacking is a comprehensive statutory framework for \nregulatory analysis. The search for the right mix of these regulatory \nanalysis requirements was at the heart of the regulatory reform debate \nin the early 1980's, in the last Congress, and now again, in the \nlegislation introduced today.\n  I believe that this legislation would establish the needed reforms in \na balanced and fair manner. It would require cost/benefit analysis and \nrisk assessment of major rules, and require periodic review of existing \nrules. These basic requirements will improve regulatory decisionmaking \nand ensure that\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\nCongress and the public are better informed about regulatory impacts.\n\n  I believe that such regulatory reform can improve our Government and \nreduce regulatory burdens without harming important public protections. \nAs I said many times during the debate in the last Congress, true \nregulatory reform must strike a balance between the public's concern \nover too much government and the public's strong support for \nregulations to protect the environment, public health and safety. The \nlegislation developed by Senator Levin and Senator Thompson strikes \nthis balance. It requires:\n  Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment of major rules; An agency \ncost justification statement to explain whether a rule's benefits \njustify its costs and whether it is more cost-effective or has more net \nbenefits than other alternatives. If the agency cannot make that \ndetermination, it must explain why not, and if feasible describe an \nalternative that would, if permitted, be cost justified; peer review of \ncost-benefit analyses and risk assessments; OMB regulatory review, with \nsunshine protections for fairness and accountability; judicial review \nof relevant regulatory analyses, but only in the context of review of \nthe final rule and the rulemaking record; and periodic review of \nexisting rules.\n  All in all, I believe these are the necessary core elements of an \neffective regulatory reform bill. Nonetheless, past debates have shown \nthat the devil is in the details. This legislation will be no \nexception. There are several areas, in fact, that I believe should be \nexamined closely in committee hearings to ensure that the regulatory \nprocess is improved and not impeded by this reform effort.\n  First, the legislation's most fundamental provision is the \nrequirement that all agency major rules must have a cost-benefit \nanalysis. I believe that given 16 years experience with regulatory \nreview under Presidential Executive order, it is appropriate to \nestablish a statutory bottom line that all major rules must be \naccompanied by a cost-benefit analysis. While a cost-benefit analysis \nshould not control decisionmaking, it is a very useful tool for \ndecision-making, and should be used to the extent both practical and \npermitted.\n  We need to be sure, however, that this requirement is not used to \nundermine program-specific statutory requirements that may, for \nexample, preclude consideration of certain costs or alternatives. While \nI believe that a cost-benefit analysis should be done to inform every \nmajor rulemaking decision, if a statute requires a certain approach to \ndecisionmaking, the agency has to be bound by that requirement.\n  I think it will be very important to discuss this issue during \ncommittee hearings and decide whether the bill's formulation is \nsufficient. A more explicit savings clause may be needed. While we want \nto improve decision-making, we do not want paralysis by analysis. And \nwe do not want to create new avenues for litigation to undermine \nstatutory requirements. If there is a problem with a statute, Congress \nshould be informed and Congress should correct the problem.\n  The bill's second basic requirement is for evaluating the risks that \nwould be addressed by a major rule. This is also a fundamental \nprovision, but here too, I believe it will be very important to explore \nthe bill's specific risk assessment language in more detail during \ncommittee hearings. For example, while science can provide critical \ndata with which to inform a rulemaking decision, often times general \nobservations cannot be reliably reduced to single point conclusions. \nThus, I am concerned that the bill's use of the phrase ``most plausible \nestimate of risk'' could lead to the arbitrary selection of a single \nrisk figure, when a range of risks is all that the scientific evidence \nwould support. I agree that agencies should not be led by speculation, \nbut we must not lose sight of the fact that caution is always in order \nwhen it comes to protecting public health and safety, and the \nenvironment.\n  Finally, committee hearings will also be needed to explore the \npractical impact of the legislation's requirements for agency advisory \npanels, both for peer review of regulatory analyses and identifying \ncurrent rules for review. These panels can provide a fair and effective \nmeans of providing important information to agencies. But they can also \nbe used to unfairly sway decision-makers and obscure behind-the-scenes \nlobbying. Care must be taken to ensure that such panels are broadly \nrepresentative and do not introduce undue delay or waste agency \nresources. Again, our committee hearings will be important to discuss \nthese issues.\n  Senator Levin and Senator Thompson are to be commended for the work \nthey have done to sift through the contentious regulatory reform record \nand draw out the core requirements and many of the needed details for \neffective regulatory analysis. I believe we are very close to having a \nbill that should pass the Senate unanimously. I support this \nlegislation and urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of comprehensive, \nresponsible reform of our regulatory process. It has been a long and \ntortuous journey. Many thought it could not be done. But I'm pleased \nthat it has been done, and I'm pleased to join Senators Levin and \nThompson as an original sponsor of the Regulatory Improvements Act of \n1997.\n  Efforts to reform the regulatory process began long before this \nCongress, and the legislation we're introducing today is a testament to \nthe tenacity of Senator Levin, who has worked untiringly for \nresponsible changes in the regulatory process for a long time. Senator \nBumpers, as well as our former colleagues Senators Johnston, Nunn and \nHeflin, toiled in these vineyards for many years.\n  The reason for this continued effort is clear. Regulations produce \nenormous benefits for society, protecting workers, conserving our \nenvironment, and promoting public health. But regulations also impose a \ntremendous cost on society. The purpose of regulatory reform is to make \nsure the benefits of the regulations warrant the costs.\n  According to the GAO, expenditures relating to pollution abatement \nalone exceeded $110 billion in 1992. While this represents only a \nportion of the costs of regulation, it provides some guidance regarding \nthe magnitude of regulation. If we can maintain the level of pollution \nabatement, but increase the efficiency in how we attain it, consumers \nwill ultimately reap the benefits. And of course every dollar that a \nbusiness spends beyond what is necessary to protect us and our \nresources is one less dollar that could otherwise be used to hire an \nemployee, or fund a pay raise, or pay for a plant expansion. Not only \nwill consumers benefit, but so will the economy.\n  Regulating in a cost-effective fashion simply makes sense. If we can \nachieve the same environmental benefit for less money, or even better, \nachieve more environmental benefit for the same money, then it makes \nsense to do so.\n  While the debate over regulatory reform has in the past been \npresented as a choice between the economy and the environment, there is \na responsible middle ground. If done wrong, regulatory reform could \nharm the environment, but if done right, both the economy and the \nenvironment benefit.\n  As noted by Vice President Gore in November 1995, in announcing one \nof the administration's regulatory reform initiatives:\n\n       For decades, the American political system pitted the \n     economy against the environment in a false conflict. \n     America's business leaders were pitted against America's \n     environmentalists. It seemed that too often for one side to \n     get its way, the other side had to lose ground, and you had \n     to decide which side you were on, business or the \n     environment. Most people didn't like that choice, because \n     most people, in their hearts, really are on both sides and \n     don't see them as being in conflict.\n\n  I share the Vice President's view that we can protect both the \nenvironment and the economy. The benefits of regulatory reform will \ncome primarily from relieving consumers from unnecessary costs and \nstrengthening people's respect for government. In addition, by \ndeveloping a responsible approach to regulatory reform, we will be able \nto prove what most of us having been saying for years--that we can be \ntrue to our principles to protect people and preserve our natural \nresources without being antibusiness and antigrowth.\n  At the same event in 1995, President Clinton reiterated that growing \nthe economy and preserving our health and environment are compatible \ngoals. The President stated that ``protecting the\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\nhealth and safety of our citizens doesn't have to come at the expense \nof the bottom line,'' and that ``strengthening the economy doesn't have \nto come at the expense of the air we breathe, the food we eat, the \nwater we drink.''\n  During the last Congress, we witnessed a massive effort to pass an \nextremely broad regulatory reform bill, offered by former Senator Dole.\n  Whether intentional or not, that bill could have lowered the \nstandards regulating our health, our safety and our national resources.\n  In addition, that bill was too reliant on litigation to challenge the \nenforcement process. For example, the process for reviewing existing \nrules was driven largely by individual petitions each of which were \nsubject to review by a court. That bill also raised the specter that \nagency rules could be overturned in court for minor procedural errors \nthat were unlikely to have affected the outcome of the decisionmaking \nprocess.\n  The amount of litigation which would have been created by the \noriginal bill, coupled with excessive paperwork requirements, would \nhave led to agency overload. Rather than focusing on producing and \nenforcing regulations to benefit society, the agencies would have been \ntied up in court or processing paper. And this problem would only have \nbeen exacerbated by deep cuts proposed for many of the affected \nagencies.\n  After the original bill failed cloture for the third time, former \nSenator Johnston, Senator Levin and I and our staffs spent a great deal \nof time and energy trying to find common ground. Many Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle were committed to reforming the regulatory \nprocess, and we tried to use the synergy of the expertise of Senators \nLevin and Johnston to develop an acceptable package. Ideas and drafts \nwere frankly exchanged during the many hours of meetings we held. In \nbetween meetings, we talked to interested parties, including labor \ngroups, environmental groups, business groups and the administration. \nThe purpose of this excercise of listening and drafting was to \ndetermine whether we could craft a responsible middle ground on \nregulatory reform.\n  The three of us came very close to settling on a middle ground, but \neventually the Presidential campaign made it impossible to complete \naction. But what evolved from that process last year laid the \ngroundwork for the efforts which began this Congress. With Presidential \npolitics safely behind us, and with a substantially lowered decibel \nlevel, Senators Thompson and Levin were able to focus on the critical \nelements and develop responsible reform. The scope of the legislation \nhas been narrowed to address only those issues which are essential to \nimproving our regulatory process.\n\n  By focusing on the essential requirements of reform, we've avoided \nmany of the pitfalls found in the Dole bill. By narrowing the scope, \nwe've also been able to concentrate our attention on those elements \nwhich belong in a regulatory reform bill but which were not resolved \nsatisfactorily in the earlier bill.\n  For example, we improved the ``look-back process'' which provides for \nthe review of existing rules. The Dole bill allowed rules to be placed \non the schedule for review either through agency action or a \npetitioning process reviewable by the courts. The petition process was \nfor those who could show that a rule would fail to meet the decisional \ncriteria. Each petition denied would have been separately reviewed by a \ncourt.\n  The bill we're introducing today eliminates the courts from the \nagency review process altogether. The question of which rules should be \nreviewed will not be the subject of litigation. In my view, this is one \nof the major improvements in this new version. Rather than having \ncourts decide, through an adversary process, which rules should be \nreviewed, the bill takes a more rational approach. Under the new bill, \nan advisory committee made up of a cross-section of public and private \ninterests affected by an agency's regulations will recommend to the \nagency which rules to review. Agencies are required to give deference \nto the committee's list, and undertake a review of the rules selected. \nThis will allow agencies to spend more of their time reviewing rules \nand less of their time in court.\n  The most important aspect of a regulatory reform bill is how it will \nchange agency behavior prospectively. We want to encourage agencies to \nchoose the most cost-effective method for achieving the regulatory goal \nand to select a rule where the benefits justify its costs whenever \npossible.\n  Under current law, agencies are not directed to take those factors \ninto account. In fact, agencies are given broad discretion under \ncurrent law when developing rules to implement statutes. The only guide \nan agency must use to develop rules is the language of the statute upon \nwhich the rule is based. That is the standard against which an agency's \naction will be judged if challenged in court. The agency must be able \nto demonstrate that the rule satisfies the statutory requirement.\n  This legislation requires agencies to consider additional criteria in \ndeveloping major rules. The rule would not only have to meet the \nstandard contained in the statute upon which the rule is based, as \nrequired under current law, but would also have to consider whether the \nrule is the most cost-effective approach and meets a cost-benefit test. \nIf the agency adopts a rule which is not the most cost-effective, or \nwhere the benefits do not justify the costs, the agency must explain \nwhy it chose that approach. We think consumers, taxpayers, and \nthose subject to regulation have a right to know what benefits a \nproposed rule is likely to provide, and what the costs will be to \nachieve those benefits. We also think people have a right to know why \nan agency would select a rule other than the most cost-effective for \nmeeting the objective of the statute.\n\n  The bill broadly defines ``benefits'' and ``costs,'' which provides \nagencies with vast discretion. ``Benefits'' are defined as ``the \nreasonably identifiable significant favorable effects, quantifiable and \nnonquantifiable, including social, health, environmental, economic and \ndistributional effects, that are expected to result directly or \nindirectly from implementation of, or compliance with, a rule.'' The \nterm ``costs'' is similarly defined.\n  As I stated at the beginning of my comments, this has been a long, \nevolutionary process. But I think this legislation we are introducing \ntoday represents a responsible approach to improving the regulatory \nprocess. And I think it demonstrates what we can accomplish when we set \naside partisan wrangling and rely on reason rather than rhetoric to \nsolve complex problems such as this. Once again, I've been pleased to \nbe involved in this process, and I commend both Senators Levin and \nThompson for their determination to see this through to conclusion. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to improving the product and \nmoving this legislation through the process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 983. A bill to prohibit the sale or other transfer of highly \nadvanced weapons to any country in Latin America; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n              THE LATIN AMERICAN ARMS CONTROL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I come to the Senate floor to \nintroduce legislation designed to send a signal to the Clinton \nadministration that the current United States policy of banning the \nsale or transfer of sophisticated fighter aircraft and other armaments \nto Latin American countries--which has by and large been United States \npolicy for some 20 years--should not be altered.\n  The bill I am introducing today would call upon the President to \nrespect the requests of a number of Latin American leaders and \nprominent political figures to maintain a moratorium on the export of \nUnited States advanced weapons to that region. It would also prohibit \nthe issuances of the necessary licenses for such exports unless the \nPresident first certificated that such sale was in the national \nsecurity interest of the United States and the Congress concurred with \nthat finding.\n  The Clinton administration is currently in the process of reviewing \nthat policy predominantly as a result of heavy lobbying by those who \nare seeking to open up a new front for high dollar sales of state-of-\nthe-art defense\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\ntechnology to countries in the Western Hemisphere--particularly those \nin South America.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton has a record he can be proud of with \nrespect to the Western Hemisphere. The 1994 Summit of the Americas, \nhosted by the United States, to which all but one head of state in the \nhemisphere was invited, was hugely successful.\n  Since that time, the President, together with his colleagues \nthroughout the region, has endeavored to pursue the hemispheric agenda \nthat the region's leaders agreed to during the course of that summit--\nnamely to strengthen democracy, increase trade, bolster national \nsecurity and combat drug trafficking.\n  I would respectfully assert that were the United States to alter our \npolicy of arms restraint with respect to the region, we would be \nundermining efforts to implement those important hemispheric \nobjectives. Heretofore, the President had been on the record in support \nof arms restraint, particularly with respect to sales to developing \ncountries.\n  Last year, President Clinton joined with other members of the so \ncalled G-7 countries at the Lyon Summit to underscore the importance of \ndeveloping and transition countries giving priority to avoiding \nunproductive expenditures, in particular excessive military spending.\n  The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is responsible for \nmonitoring economic policies and balance of payments throughout the \nworld, has also given high priority to warning against the dangers of \narms purchases.\n  Most recently, on June 19, during the Article IV consultations with \nthe United States, where the performance of the United States economy \nwas reviewed, the IMF staff, ``urged the United States, together with \nother major countries, to administer their policies on military sales \nto developing and transition economy countries in a way that avoids \nencouraging unproductive expenditures and heightening security \ntensions.''\n  It would be the ultimate irony, after all the time and effort that \nthe President and his administration has expended in helping to plant \nthe seeds of democracy in our own hemisphere, and in so carefully \nnurturing those seeds as they have germinated and bloomed, if he were \nto make a decision that would undermine all of those efforts.\n  I believe that a decision to alter our current policy to permit the \nexport of highly advanced weaponry to the region would do just that. \nOver the medium term it could only serve to disturb the delicate \nregional military balance and thereby pose a serious threat to regional \npeace and economic prosperity.\n  Mr. President, if you were to listen to American defense contractors \nyou would think that our current policy has prevented them from earning \neven 1 dollar on arms sales to Latin America. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Between 1992-1995 the United States was the single \nlargest supplier of weapons to Latin America, capturing more than 25 \npercent of that market. According to the Congressional Research Service \nduring fiscal years 1993-1996, U.S. arms sales to Latin American \nnations averaged nearly $200 million annually.\n  No one is suggesting that Latin American countries, or that Latin \nAmerican militaries do not have legitimate defense and national \nsecurity requirements that can only be met from foreign sources. I \nwould strongly argue that our current policy is absolutely compatible \nwith those countries being able to fulfill their legitimate \nrequirements.\n  Sales of appropriate U.S. defense articles and equipment have and \nshould continue.\n  But, collective arms restraint should also be a part of any effort by \nregional leaders to prepare their armed forces for their role in the \n21st century.\n  In that regard, I believe that the Governments of Argentina and \nBrazil deserve special recognition for the very significant progress \nthey have made in this area.\n  Mr. President, the region is at peace. Democracy is the order of the \nday. The demands on governments throughout the region to meet pressing \neconomic and social needs have never been greater while government \nresources are severely constrained. Now would seem a perfect \nopportunity to make real progress in reaching a regional arms control \nagreement to deter future arms races, and thereby better marshal scarce \nresources.\n  The entire region has just recently recovered from a decade of \nnegative growth. And, while growth is now on the upswing in many \ncountries, more than half of them currently have per-capita income \nlevels below those achieved by them 10 years ago. The educational \nsystems throughout the region need major infusions of resources to \nprepare the children of the Americas for the next decade. Currently, \nless than half of those children who enter the first grade remain in \nschool through the fifth grade. This is a staggering statistic and one \nthat needs to be changed. However, that isn't going to happen unless \ngovernment resources are devoted to this objective.\n  Perhaps that is why there has been no drumbeat from governments \nthroughout the hemisphere that President Clinton abandon our policy of \narms restraint. In fact, heads of state from Argentina, Brazil, \nUruguay, and Paraguay have publicly expressed their concerns about our \naltering the current United States policy.\n  They know better than we do, the kinds of pressures that they will \nconfront from their own militaries once this proverbial cat is out of \nthe bag.\n  One military instititution after another will seek to justify demands \nfor more and more costly defense expenditures in order to maintain \nparity with neighboring militaries--in some cases militaries that they \nhave been in conflict within the last 20 years--Peru and Ecuador as \nrecently as 1995.\n  I am strongly supportive of efforts designed to improve U.S. export \nperformance. Certainly we all want to see U.S. exports continue to \ngrow--exports are critical to the health of our own economy and are a \nprimary source of jobs for hard working American men and women.\n  However, I would argue that it is shortsighted on our part to push \ncountries in the hemisphere to divert scarce resources for \nnonproductive, one-time, arms purchases.\n  These resources could be more wisely spent repairing badly eroded \ninfrastructures and on other productive investments that will reduce \nunemployment in these countries and generate domestic purchasing power \nthat will provide for a more stable and sustainable market for U.S. \nnondefense exports.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the legislation I am introducing \ntoday will call attention to the issues and concerns I have raised \ntoday, and hopefully will provoke a serious debate on the wisdom of \naltering a policy that has worked so well to promote U.S. interests in \nthis hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from former President Jimmy Carter in support of this \nlegislation, along with the text of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill and letter were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Latin American Arms Control \n     Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It has been United States policy since the Presidential \n     directive of May 19, 1977, to refrain from making sales or \n     other transfers to governments of Latin American countries of \n     highly advanced weapons systems that could undermine regional \n     military balances or stimulate an arms race.\n       (2) There has only been one exception to that policy, the \n     sale of F-16 fighter aircraft to Venezuela in 1982, in \n     response to a perceived Cuban military buildup, including the \n     acquisition by Cuba of Soviet-made MIG-23 fighters.\n       (3) While United States defense companies have not been \n     able to sell highly advanced weapons to Latin America, they \n     are a major supplier of military equipment to the region and \n     hold the largest share of that market.\n       (4) From fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1996 the \n     United States Government sold $789,000,000 in arms to Latin \n     America.\n       (5) In August 1996, Secretary of State Warren Christopher \n     stated that his ``strong conviction is that we should be very \n     careful about raising the level of competition between \n     countries with respect to arms sales''.\n       (6) There are historic hostilities and mistrust in Latin \n     America that can flare into serious conflict, as evidenced \n     most recently\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\n     by the 1995 border war between Peru and Ecuador that required \n     international efforts to resolve.\n       (7) For the first time in modern history, all but one \n     country in the Western Hemisphere is governed by \n     democratically elected leaders.\n       (8) Latin America has just recovered from a decade of \n     negative growth, as measured on a real per capita basis, and \n     18 of the countries in the Western Hemisphere currently have \n     per capita income levels below those achieved by them ten \n     years ago.\n       (9) Poverty and insufficient educational opportunities \n     continue to be a major challenge to democratic governments in \n     the Western Hemisphere, with less than one-half of the \n     children entering first grade remaining in school until grade \n     five, and with more than 100,000 street children in cities \n     throughout Latin American countries.\n       (10) At the meeting of the Council of Freely Elected Heads \n     of Government on April 29, 1997, representatives of Latin \n     American governments on the Council discussed the issue of \n     arms sales to Latin American countries, pledged to accept a \n     two-year moratorium on the purchase of highly advanced \n     weapons, called upon countries in the Western Hemisphere to \n     explore ideas to restrain future purchases, and called upon \n     the United States and other governments that sell arms to \n     affirm their support for such a moratorium.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     respect the request of Latin American heads of government for \n     a two-year moratorium on the sale or other transfer of highly \n     advanced weapons to Latin American countries while proposals \n     for regional arms restraint are studied.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, under the Arms Export Control Act or any other Act--\n       (1) no sale or other transfer may be made of any highly \n     advanced weapon to any Latin American country,\n       (2) no license may be issued for the export of any highly \n     advanced weapon to any Latin American country, and\n       (3) no financing may be extended with respect to a sale or \n     export of any highly advanced weapon to a Latin American \n     country,\n\n     unless the requirements of subsection (b) are satisfied and \n     except as provided in subsection (c).\n       (b) Requirements.--The requirements of this subsection are \n     satisfied if--\n       (1) the President determines and certifies to Congress in \n     advance that the sale, transfer, or financing, as the case \n     may be, is necessary to further the national security \n     interests of the United States; and\n       (2) Congress has enacted a joint resolution approving the \n     Presidential determination.\n       (c) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply to any sale, \n     sales, financing, or license permitted by an international \n     agreement that provides for restraint--\n       (1) in the purchase of highly advanced weapons by countries \n     in Latin America; or\n       (2) in the sale or other transfer of highly advanced \n     weapons to countries in Latin America.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITION OF HIGHLY ADVANCED WEAPONS\n\n       In this Act, the term ``highly advanced weapons'' includes \n     advanced combat fighter aircraft and attack helicopters but \n     does not include transport helicopters.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            The Carter Center,\n\n                                       Atlanta, GA, June 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, Washington, DC.\n       To Senator Christopher Dodd: I have read the draft, Latin \n     American Arms Control Act, that you plan to introduce in the \n     Senate. It is a far-sighted statement, which I hope your \n     colleagues will endorse. Regrettably, the momentum for an \n     arms race in South America seems to be increasing at the very \n     moment that the Cold War is over and democracy has taken \n     root. Your bill offers an alternative to an arms race in a \n     way that respects Latin America.\n       I sincerely hope your colleagues join you in this important \n     endeavor at discouraging an arms race in Latin America. I \n     commend you for your leadership in Congress on this issue. \n     Let me know if there is anything else I can do to further our \n     shared goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jimmy Carter.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nConnecticut in sponsoring legislation aimed at preventing the \ncommencement of an arms race in Latin America.\n  For the past two decades, the United States has prohibited the sale \nor transfer of advanced military equipment to the region. The ban, \ninstituted by President Carter, has been generally maintained since the \nlate 1970's, including during the administrations of Presidents Reagan \nand Bush. The lone exception occurred in 1982, in response to a \nperceived Cuban military buildup, when the United States sold F-16 \nfighter aircraft to the Government of Venezuela.\n  The ban was instituted during a different era, when many nations of \nthe region were under the rule of military dictators. To be sure, the \nnations of Latin America have made important advances since that \nperiod. Politically, dictatorship has given way to democracy. Every \nnation of the hemisphere--with the glaring exception of Cuba--is now \ngoverned by a democratically chosen leader. Additionally, after the \nlost decade of the 1980's--a period of negative economic growth in many \nnations of the region--the region is beginning to recover economically. \nIndeed, the nations of the region have made tremendous progress in the \npast few years, shedding the statist policies of past decades and \nembracing free markets and free trade.\n  Although the times have changed, the need for restraint in the sale \nof arms has not. First, although the region is advancing economically, \nit is abundantly clear that few nations of the region can afford the \nhigh costs that an arms race would impose. Second, an arms race in the \nregion would be destabilizing--not only among nations of Latin America, \nbut within those nations where civilian control of the military is not \nyet fully consolidated. The Armed Forces remain important institutional \nactors in many nations of the region; the increased emphasis on arms \nprocurement and arms budgets could undermine the priorities and powers \nof the civilian leadership.\n  In the past year, there has been considerable discussion within the \nClinton administration, and among the nations of the region, about the \nwisdom of lifting the U.S. ban on the sale of advanced weapons. In this \nrespect, it is important to note that many senior figures in Latin \nAmerica have come down on the side of restraint. In April of this year, \nfor example, the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government--an \norganization consisting of current and former hemispheric leaders from \nleading countries in the region--called on Latin American governments \nto ``accept a moratorium of two years before purchasing any \nsophisticated weapons.'' In the interim, the Council urged governments \nof the region to ``explore ideas to restrain such arms,'' and urged \ngovernments that sell arms, including the United States, ``to affirm \ntheir support for such a moratorium.''\n  This legislation that Senator Dodd and I introduce today would heed \nthat request by expressing support for such a moratorium, and banning \nthe transfer to the region of highly advanced weapons by the United \nStates, unless such transfer conforms to an international agreement \ngoverning sales to, or purchases by, nations of the region. In other \nwords, if a regional arms control agreement is negotiated permitting \nsome sales but prohibiting others, arms transfers by the United States \nwould be allowed, provided such transfers conform to the arms control \nagreement then in place.\n  It should be emphasized that this bill would not ban all sales of \nmilitary equipment to Latin America. Rather, it would merely continue, \nin law, the policy and practice adhered to by the executive branch for \nthe past two decades: to not sell sophisticated military equipment such \nas advanced combat aircraft and attack helicopters to the nations of \nLatin America. It would permit U.S. firms to continue to sell other \nmilitary equipment to Latin America--a market in which the United \nStates now holds the largest share, and in which U.S. firms have sold a \ntotal of nearly $800 million over the past 4 fiscal years.\n  Mr. President, it is the policy of the United States to promote \ngreater hemispheric integration--an objective pursued in the process \ninitiated at the Summit of the Americas, which was hosted by President \nClinton in 1994. The policy set forth in this bill advances that \nobjective by honoring the request of several Latin American nations \nthat they pursue a regional arms control approach before advanced \nweapons are introduced into the region. I urge my colleagues and the \nadministration to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Mack, Mr. McCain, and \n        Ms. Moseley-Braun) (by request):\n  S. 984. A bill to promote the growth of free enterprise and economic \nopportunity in the Caribbean Basin region, increase trade and \ninvestment between the Caribbean Basin region and the United States, \nand encourage the adoption by Caribbean Basin countries of\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\npolicies necessary for participation in the free trade area of the \nAmericas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the united states-caribbean basin trade enhancement act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to introduce the \nUnited States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act, and I am proud to \nbe joined by my colleagues Senators DeWine, Mack, McCain, and Moseley-\nBraun.\n  This bill will enhance both our economic and national security, while \nat the same time strengthening that of some of our closest and most \nloyal neighbors and allies--the nations of the Caribbean Basin.\n  Over the last decade, the United States has played a vital role in \nthe spread of democracy and the growth of free enterprise throughout \nthe Western Hemisphere.\n  Today, every nation in the Western Hemisphere--with the notable, \nlamentable exception of Cuba, where despotism and communism are taking \ntheir last gasps of life--has a democratic government and is opening \nits economy in unprecedented ways.\n  Democratic elections have become the norm rather than the exception, \nand hemispheric trade integration is a common goal.\n  But we in the United States must not allow success to breed neglect.\n  Now is not the time to turn away from Latin America and Caribbean or \nto turn our back on our backyard, something, unfortunately, that we \nhave done all too often in the past.\n  Continued attention is required to consolidate and institutionalize \nthese democratic and economic gains.\n  As we have seen recently in Haiti, economic and political instability \nin the Caribbean region can have tragic consequences and impose \nenormous costs to the United States.\n  We must remain vigilant and engaged to ensure that other nations of \nthe Caribbean Basin do not experience similar turmoil and tragedy.\n  The United States-Carribean Basin Trade Enhancement Act is part of \nour effort to consolidate democracy and economic stability in the \nregion.\n  This act will bring tremendous benefits to the United States as well.\n  It is in both our economic and our national security interests to \nenact this legislation.\n  It will enhance our economic security both by opening new markets for \nAmerican goods, and by strengthening the economies of our closest \nneighbors.\n  Increased economic growth among the nations of the region will \nprovide growing markets for U.S. products.\n  The United States enjoys a trade surplus with the Caribbean Basin.\n  Historically, our economy has been the chief beneficiary of a \nlowering of trade barriers between the Caribbean Basin and the United \nStates.\n  The United States' trade position relative to the Caribbean Basin \ncountries improved dramatically following the implementation of the \n1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative, from a deficit of $700 million in 1985 \nto a surplus of $2.0 billion in 1993.\n  On a per capita basis, our surplus with the Caribbean has \nconsistently outplaced our surplus with any other region of the world.\n  In the past 3 years alone, U.S. exports to the Caribbean Basin \ncountries have increased by 22.8 percent.\n  This act also provides incentives for continued legal and regulatory \nreform that will make it easier for U.S. products to compete in the \nmarkets of the Caribbean Basin.\n  By conditioning full benefits on the progress of economic reform, \nthis act will benefit Americans as well as the people of the Caribbean.\n  It will open Caribbean markets to U.S. goods and services, and expand \nopportunities for U.S. businesses to enjoy the fruits of economic \nexpansion that is occurring in the region.\n  Let me give a couple of examples of ways that the incentives in this \nlegislation will help increase U.S. exports to the Caribbean.\n  First, in order to receive any benefits, a country must demonstrate \nits commitment to undertake its World Trade Organization obligations on \nor ahead of schedule, and it must participate in negotiations toward \nthe completion of a hemispheric free-trade agreement. Those are \nrequirements for initial participation in this program.\n  Second, Caribbean nations must meet certain economic requirements to \nreceive the full benefits of our legislation, which are only available \nafter the initial 3-year period.\n  These full benefits include equitable and reasonable market access to \nU.S. companies, protection of intellectual property rights, protection \nto investors and investments, aggressive action against corruption, \ntransparent and competitive procedures in government procurement, and \nthe adoption of internationally established rules on customs valuation.\n  This legislation also encourages our trading partners to enhance \nU.S.-Caribbean cooperation in fighting drug trafficking.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not a free ride. It is a two-way \nstreet.\n  We are providing these nations with economic benefits, while at the \nsame time expecting them to take steps that will be good for American \neconomic interests.\n  This act will strengthen Caribbean economies while providing \nincentives to implement reforms that will open new markets, and reduce \nrisk, for U.S. companies who wish to compete in the Caribbean market.\n  It will protect U.S. trademarks from piracy, permit U.S. companies to \ncompete fairly for government procurement contracts, and help to \neliminate corruption.\n  This is a good deal for both the United States the countries of the \nCaribbean Basin.\n  Our security interests are also at stake here. We have seen time and \nagain how economic instability can foment political turmoil, which in \nturn can require American political or military involvement.\n  In the past, as the citizens of my home State of Florida know all too \nwell, economic and political instability has also resulted in massive \nrefugee flows to the United States, which place an unfair burden on \nU.S. taxpayers.\n  Second, the Caribbean has been one of the principal transit regions \nfor drug traffickers moving their poisonous cargo from the source \ncountries of South America.\n  Several years ago, our efforts at reducing drug trafficking in the \nCaribbean were so successful that we diverted the traffickers to the \nSouthwest border.\n  Unfortunately, recent law enforcement efforts along the Southwest \nborder have resulted in intensified relocated, re-energized narcotics \ntrafficking in the Caribbean.\n  It is critical that the people of the Caribbean Basin have real \nopportunities in the legal economy so they are not forced to turn to \ndrug trafficking to feed their families.\n  In addition, the recent World Trade Organization decision on bananas \ncould have a devastating effect on the economies of several countries \nin the region, thereby exacerbating the potential for people to turn to \nillegal activities.\n  Strengthening Caribbean economies through enhanced trade and economic \nactivity will help keep drugs off the streets of America, and out of \nthe hands of America's children.\n  Mr. President, trade integration will occur in this hemisphere, \nwhether we choose to be part of it or not.\n  It is in our interest to bring more countries into bilateral and \nmultilateral trade agreements with the United States.\n  If we fail to seize this opportunity, others will take our place of \nleadership, and our economy will be the loser.\n  This legislation gives us an opportunity to set the parameters of \ntrade agreements, so that we can ensure that United States' interests \nare secured, and that truly fair trading relationships are established.\n  There is no region in the world in which the United States has a \nstronger and more mutually beneficial relationship than the Caribbean \nBasin.\n  This bill will enhance our trading relationship with our neighbors \nand have tremendous benefits for the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider and support the United States-\nCaribbean Trade Enhancement Act as a demonstration of our commitment to \nencouraging economic and political stability and to furthering the \ndemocratic progress that has been made in our hemisphere, and around \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask for its \nappropriate referral, and I ask unanimous consent that\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 984\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Caribbean \n     Basin Trade Enhancement Act''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (referred to \n     in this Act as ``CBERA'') represents a permanent commitment \n     by the United States to encourage the development of strong \n     democratic governments and revitalized economies in \n     neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.\n       (2) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at \n     the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a \n     Free Trade Area of the Americas (referred to in this Act as \n     ``FTAA'') by the year 2005.\n       (3) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean \n     Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA.\n       (4) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin \n     countries will enhance trade between the United States and \n     the Caribbean Basin, encourage development of trade and \n     investment policies that will facilitate participation of \n     Caribbean Basin countries in the FTAA, preserve the United \n     States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, \n     help further economic development in the Caribbean Basin \n     region, and accelerate the trend toward more open economies \n     in the region.\n       (5) Promotion of the growth of free enterprise and economic \n     opportunity in the Caribbean Basin will enhance the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (6) Increased trade and economic activity between the \n     United States and Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries will \n     create expanding export opportunities for United States \n     businesses and workers.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to \n     prepare to become a party to the FTAA or a comparable trade \n     agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that \n     accorded to products of NAFTA countries for products not \n     currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the CBERA; \n     and\n       (2) seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary \n     countries in the FTAA or a trade agreement comparable to the \n     FTAA at the earliest possible date, with the goal of \n     achieving full participation in such agreement not later than \n     2005.\n\n      SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Lautenberg \nto jointly recognize Larry Doby, the first African-American player in \nthe American League. Mr. Doby's lifelong dedication to major league \nbaseball, his community, and his country is truly remarkable and must \nbe recognized. As an ambassador for baseball, Mr. Doby has served the \nleague for nearly 20 years as a player, as a coach, and currently as a \nspecial assistant to the president of the American League.\n  Mr. Doby, born in Camden, SC, later moved to Paterson, NJ, where he \nstarred in four sports and ultimately garnered numerous offers for \nathletic scholarships toward his higher education. Although Larry Doby \naccepted an offer to play basketball for Long Island University, his \ncollegiate athletic career was shortened as he enlisted in the U.S. \nNavy to serve our country in World War II. Following World War II, Doby \nplayed for the Negro League Newark Eagles, where he led the league with \na batting average of .458 and 13 home runs.\n  Some of Larry Doby's major league baseball accomplishments include \nbeing the first African-American player in the American League, the \nfirst African-American player on a world series team, and the second \nAfrican-American to manage in the major leagues. Mr. Doby will be \nrecognized by major league baseball at the all-star game in Cleveland. \nThe naming of this post office in Larry Doby's honor in his hometown of \nPaterson would be a fitting tribute to this great American.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 985\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Larry Eugene Doby was born in Camden, South Carolina, \n     on December 12, 1923, and moved to Paterson, New Jersey, in \n     1938.\n       (2) After playing the 1946 season in the Negro League for \n     the Newark Eagles, Larry Doby's contract was purchased by the \n     Cleveland Indians of the American League on July 3, 1947.\n       (3) On July 5, 1957, Larry Doby became the first African-\n     American to play in the American League.\n       (4) Larry Doby played in the American League for 13 years, \n     appearing in 1,533 games and batting .283, with 253 home runs \n     and 969 runs batted in.\n       (5) Larry Doby was voted to 7 all-star teams, led the \n     American League in home runs twice, and played in 2 World \n     Series. He was the first African-American to play in the \n     World Series and to hit a home run in a World Series game, \n     both in 1948.\n       (6) Larry Doby was recognized for his remarkable \n     achievements in baseball with his induction into the Baseball \n     Hall of Fame in 1987.\n       (7) After his stellar playing career ended, Larry Doby \n     continued to make a significant contribution to his \n     community. He has been a pioneer in the cause of civil rights \n     and has received honorary doctorate degrees from Long Island \n     University, Princeton University, and Fairfield University.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF LARRY DOBY POST OFFICE.\n\n       (A) In General.--The post office located at 194 Ward Street \n     in Paterson, New Jersey, shall be known and designated as the \n     ``Larry Doby Post Office''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     post office referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to \n     be a reference to the ``Larry Doby Post Office''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Bob Torricelli, in introducing a bill to name a U.S. \npost office in my hometown of Paterson, NJ after a true American hero, \nLarry Eugene Doby.\n  Mr. President, 1997 marks the 50th anniversary of the breaking of \nmajor league baseball's color barrier. In April 1947, Jackie Robinson \nplayed his first game with the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers and \nended segregation in our national pastime; simultaneously, he entered \nAmerica's pantheon of heroes.\n  While we rightfully honor Mr. Robinson, we cannot forget that heroes \nrarely fight their battles alone. Larry Doby is one of those heroes. \nOnly 11 weeks after Jackie Robinson first graced a major league \ndiamond, Larry Doby of Paterson, NJ took the field with the Cleveland \nIndians, becoming the first African-American player in the American \nLeague. Once on the team, he brought an ability and level of \nconsistency to the game that few could match. He was the first African-\nAmerican player to hit a home run in the world series, and he was named \nto six straight American League all-star teams. During his 13 year \ncareer, he attained a .283 lifetime batting average and hit 253 home \nruns.\n  Mr. President, the day Larry Doby first took the field was definitely \na great day for baseball enthusiasts. Millions of fans were able to \nenjoy the excitement he brought to the plate and the skill he brought \nto the field.\n  But it was also a great day for every American. Along with Robinson's \nearlier integration of the National League, Doby's joining the American \nLeague was a double play against racism and inequality. And in the \nearly years it wasn't easy. Doby had to meet the challenges of the \ngame, while also facing sometimes angry opponents. But whether he was \nfaced with a curve ball hurled by an opposing pitcher, or a foul remark \nhurled by a bigoted fan, he handled it with dignity, grace, and skill.\n  Because of the manner in which he handled such adversity, he not only \ntore down the walls of exclusion, he also opened the windows of \nopportunity for many other African-American players, who followed him \ninto the major leagues. Thanks to his example, we all learned that, in \nthe words of Martin Luther King, ``We must judge a person on the \ncontent of his character, and not the color of his skin.''\n  Mr. President, Larry Doby is rightfully called a legend for his \nconsistency on the field and a hero for his character off the field. \nBut I have the privilege of also calling him a friend. We grew up \ntogether on the working class streets of Paterson. As a baseball fan, \nan American and a friend, I admire the contributions that Larry made to \nboth the game of baseball and to the struggle for equality.\n  When it comes to Larry, others may have filled his uniform, but no \none will ever be able to fill his shoes. Above all, Larry Doby proves \nthat good and great can exist in the same individual.\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to join with Senator \nTorricelli and me in celebrating Larry Doby by gracing the post office \nlocated at 194 Ward Street in Paterson, NJ with his name.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S.J. Res. 34. A joint resolution suspending the certification \nprocedures under section 490(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1991 \nin order to foster greater multilateral cooperation in international \ncounternarcotics programs; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I send to the desk a joint resolution \non behalf of myself and Senator John McCain which we believe will lead \nto more cooperative and effective efforts to meet the international \nthreat posed by international drug trafficking.\n  The resolution that we are introducing today calls upon the President \nto establish a high level, interdisciplinary task force under the \ndirection of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, Director of the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, to develop a comprehensive strategy for \ndealing with the supply and demand side of the drug problem.\n  It also urges the President to encourage other drug producing and \ntransit countries to undertake similar efforts. Within a year's time it \ncalls for an international summit to be held, at which time, the \nefforts of all the parties would be merged into a multilateral battle \nplan to engage the illegal drug trade on every front.\n  In order to create the kind of international cooperation and mutual \nrespect that must be present if this effort is to produce results, the \nresolution would also suspend the annual drug certification procedure \nfor a period of 2 years, while efforts are ongoing to develop and \nimplement a new strategy.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the issue of how best to construct and \nimplement an effective counter narcotics policy has been the subject of \nmuch debate in this Chamber, and I would add much disagreement.\n  My intention in introducing this resolution today is to try to see if \nthere is some way to end what has become a stale annual event that has \nnot brought us any closer to mounting a credible effort to eliminate or \neven contain the international drug mafia.\n  We all can agree that drugs are a problem--a big problem. We can \nagree as well that the international drug trade poses a direct threat \nto the United States and to international efforts to promote democracy, \neconomic stability, human rights, and the rule of law throughout the \nworld, but most especially in our own hemisphere.\n  While the international impact is serious and of great concern, of \neven greater concern to me personally are effects it is having here at \nhome. Today, approximately 12,800,000 Americans use illegal drugs, \nincluding 1,500,000 cocaine users, 600,000 heroin addicts, and \n9,800,000 smokers of marijuana. This menace isn't just confined to \ninner cities or the poor. Illegal drug use occurs among members of \nevery ethnic and socioeconomic group in the United States.\n  The human and economic costs are enormous: Drug related illness, \ndeath, and crime cost the United States approximately $67 billion in \n1996, including costs for lost productivity, premature death, and \nincarceration.\n  This is an enormously lucrative business--drug trafficking generates \nestimated revenues of $400 billion annually.\n  The United States has spent more than $25 billion for foreign \ninterdictions and source country counter narcotics programs since 1981, \nand despite impressive seizures at the border, on the high seas, and in \nother countries, foreign drugs are cheaper and more readily available \nin the United States today than two decades ago.\n  So, despite the fact that we have had this drug certification \nprocedure in place since 1986--more than 10 years--drugs continue to \npour into this country and to wreak havoc on our families and \ncommunities.\n  I think it is time to be honest and admit our international drug \nstrategy isn't working and that means the entire certification process. \nNor are efforts to revise the certification process to make it easier, \npolitically, for the U.S. Congress to stick a finger in the eye of \nother governments by unilaterally grading them, likely to materially \nimprove the situation--especially when we are not prepared to subject \nourselves to similar unilateral grading by others.\n  Rather, I believe that we need to reach out to other governments who \nshare our concerns about the threat that drugs pose to the very fabric \nof their societies and our own. It is arrogant to assume we are the \nonly Nation that cares about such matters. We need to sit down and \nfigure out what each of us can do better to make it harder for drug \ntraffickers to ply their trade. It is in that spirit that I commend the \nresolution that Senator McCain and I are introducing today to our \ncolleagues.\n  Together, working collectively we can defeat the traffickers. But if \nwe expend our energies playing the blame game, we are certainly not \ngoing to effectively address this threat.\n  We aren't going to stop one additional teenager from becoming hooked \non drugs, or one more citizen from being mugged outside his home by \nsome drug crazed thief.\n  I would urge my colleagues to give some thought and attention to our \nlegislative initiative. We believe it is worthy of support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 34\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SUSPENSION OF DRUG CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The international drug trade poses a direct threat to \n     the United States and to international efforts to promote \n     democracy, economic stability, human rights, and the rule of \n     law.\n       (2) The United States has a vital national interest in \n     combating the financial and other resources of the \n     multinational drug cartels, which resources threaten the \n     integrity of political and financial institutions both in the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (3) Approximately 12,800,000 Americans use illegal drugs, \n     including 1,500,000 cocaine users, 600,000 heroin addicts, \n     and 9,800,000 marijuana users.\n       (4) Illegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic \n     and socioeconomic group in the United States.\n       (5) Drug-related illness, death, and crime cost the United \n     States approximately $67,000,000,000 in 1996, including costs \n     for lost productivity, premature death, and incarceration.\n       (6) Worldwide drug trafficking generates revenues estimated \n     at $400,000,000,000 annually.\n       (7) The United States has spent more than $25,000,000,000 \n     for drug interdiction and source country counternarcotics \n     programs since 1981, and despite impressive seizures at the \n     border, on the high seas, and in other countries, illegal \n     drugs from foreign sources are cheaper and more readily \n     available in the United States today than 20 years ago.\n       (8) The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 \n     Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 \n     Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and \n     Psychotropic Substances form the legal framework for \n     international drug control cooperation.\n       (9) The United Nations International Drug Control Program, \n     the International Narcotics Control Board, and the \n     Organization of American States can play important roles in \n     facilitating the development and implementation of more \n     effective multilateral programs to combat both domestic and \n     international drug trafficking and consumption.\n       (10) The annual certification process required by section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     which has been in effect since 1986, has failed to foster \n     bilateral or multilateral cooperation with United States \n     counternarcotics programs because its provisions are vague \n     and inconsistently applied and fail to acknowledge that \n     United States narcotics programs have not been fully \n     effective in combating consumption or trafficking in illegal \n     drugs, and related crimes, in the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) existing United States domestic and international \n     counternarcotics program have not reduced the supply of \n     illegal drugs or significantly reduced domestic consumption \n     of such drugs;\n       (2) The President should appoint a high level task force of \n     foreign policy experts, law enforcement officials, and drug \n     specialists to develop a comprehensive program for addressing \n     domestic and international drug trafficking and drug \n     consumption and related crimes, with particular attention to \n     fashioning a multilateral framework for improving \n     international cooperation in combating illegal drug \n     trafficking, and should designate the Director of the Office \n     of National Drug Policy to chair the task force;\n\n[[Page S6761]]\n\n       (3) the President should call upon the heads of state of \n     major illicit drug producing countries, major drug transit \n     countries, and major money laundering countries to establish \n     similar high level task forces to work in coordination with \n     the United States; and\n       (4) not later than one year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the President should call for the convening of an \n     international summit of all interested governments to be \n     hosted by the Organization of American States or another \n     international organization mutually agreed to by the parties, \n     for the purpose of reviewing the findings and recommendations \n     of the task forces referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) and \n     adopting a counternarcotics plan of action for each country.\n       (c) Suspension of Drug Certification Process.--(1) Section \n     490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), \n     relating to annual certification procedures for assistance \n     for certain drug-producing and drug-transit countries, shall \n     not apply in 1998 and 1999.\n       (2) The President may waive the applicability of that \n     section in 2000 if the President determines that the waiver \n     would facilitate the enhancement of the United States \n     international narcotics control programs.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join with my colleague and friend, \nSenator Dodd, in introducing a joint resolution calling on the \nPresident to take concrete steps to increase the level of international \ncooperation in combating the flow of narcotics into this country, and \nto lead America toward coming to grips with the domestic demand that is \ntearing this country apart while enriching the drug cartels of Latin \nAmerica and our own organized crime groups.\n  This legislation acknowledges the problems endemic in waging the war \non drugs while domestic demand continues to remain high. It further \nrecognizes the failure of numerous previous efforts at stemming the \nflow of illegal narcotics. It consequently expresses the sense of \nCongress that the President should appoint a high level task force, to \nbe chaired by the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy, to \nestablish a framework for improving international cooperation in these \nefforts. Finally, and of particular importance, it suspends for 2 years \nthe process by which countries are certified as cooperating in the war \non drug.\n  The drug problem in this country dates at least as far back as the \nCivil War, when wounded soldiers were turned into morphine addicts as \nthe only way to deaden the horrific pain caused from battle and \ndisease. The problem grew to such an extent that President Nixon felt \ncompelled to establish the Drug Enforcement Administration in order to \nbetter coordinate the antidrug effort. President Reagan assigned Vice \nPresident Bush to oversee a major escalation in the war on drugs, a war \ncarried on at considerable monetary cost throughout the Bush \nadministration. President Clinton, to his credit, appointed perhaps our \nfinest ``drug czar'' in Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who has waged the drug \nwar as valiantly as he led troops in combat during Desert Storm.\n  And still, the flow of illegal narcotics continues virtually \nunimpeded. Record-breaking seizures serve mainly to remind us of how \nmuch more is getting through our porous borders undetected. Street \nprices alert us to the failure of our best efforts at putting a dent in \nthe problem of drug trafficking. To the extent that one area, for \nexample, cocaine, is tackled with any degree of success, another bigger \nproblem--the resurgence of heroin abuse comes to mind--rises up in its \nplace. Clearly, it is time to step back again and look more critically \nat every facet of the problem.\n  I do not believe ``chicken-and-egg'' debates about which problem, \nsupply or demand, should take higher priority serve any useful purpose. \nThe bill we are offering today addresses both problems. Nor I believe \nthe certification process has accomplished its intended goal any more \nthan such processes ever really do irrespective of the subject matter. \nIn fact, the decision by the White House to decertify Colombia, which \nhas waged a valiant and costly--in both lives and treasure--struggle \nagainst extremely powerful and ruthless cartels while recertifying \nMexico, whose law enforcement agencies are so rife with corruption that \nthat country's equivalent of General McCaffrey was arrested for drug-\nrelated crimes, illuminates all too well the impracticality of the \ncurrent process.\n  It is easy to argue that the drug problem has been studied to death. \nIt has not, however, been examined from the perspective, and at the \nlevel, recommended in this resolution. If I believed for a second that \nthis resolution represented just another attempt at studying the \nproblem of drugs, I would not have attached my name to it. The \nrecommended steps, however, combined with the suspension of the drug \ncertification process, constitute a real and meaningful effort at \nfocusing the Nation's attention on one of our most serious problems. \nDrugs are, in every sense of the word, a scourge upon our society. We \nmust take a comprehensive, sober look at the scale of the problem and \nwhat realistically can be done about it. We must do this domestically \nand internationally. We must, once and for all, wage the war on drugs \nas though we intend to prevail. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate \nand the House of Representatives will support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

OF THE FIRST WOMEN'S RIGHT CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 35\n\n       Whereas 1998 marks the 150th anniversary of the first \n     Women's Rights Convention, which was held at the Wesleyan \n     Methodist Church in Seneca Falls, New York, on July 19 and \n     20, 1848;\n       Whereas the Women's Rights Convention was called to \n     consider ``the Social, Civil, and Religious Condition of \n     Women'';\n       Whereas the Women's Rights Convention is considered by many \n     historians to be one of the most important events in the \n     history of the women's movement in the United States;\n       Whereas the Convention participants issued a Declaration of \n     Sentiments which was modeled after the Declaration of \n     Independence;\n       Whereas the Declaration of Sentiments further included a \n     list of the ``injustices'' that were imposed on women over \n     the centuries, such as denying them the right to participate \n     in government, to retain their civil rights after marriage, \n     to own property, to keep their wages, to vote, and to pursue \n     a college education;\n       Whereas the Women's Rights Convention and the Declaration \n     of Sentiments was a vital early step toward reversing such \n     injustices;\n       Whereas the participants in the Women's Rights Convention \n     also played a prominent role in the movement to abolish \n     slavery;\n       Whereas commemorating this historic anniversary will \n     highlight the importance of continuing the struggle for equal \n     rights and opportunity for women in such areas as health \n     care, education, employment, and pay equity;\n       Whereas Congress recently honored Lucretia Mott and \n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the organizers of the Women's Rights \n     Convention, along with Susan B. Anthony, as revolutionary \n     leaders of the women's movement by placing a statue of them \n     in the Capitol Rotunda with statues of other revolutionary \n     leaders of our Nation's history such as George Washington, \n     Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr.;\n       Whereas a portion of this statue purposefully was left \n     unfinished in 1921, the year following passage of the 19th \n     Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, to signify the \n     need to continue working for an Equal Rights Amendment, pay \n     and pension equity, and other women's rights;\n       Whereas, in light of the fact that commemorative stamps \n     have recently been issued to honor the marathon, the lunar \n     new year, and football coaches, honoring a historic \n     convention that led to many breakthroughs in the history of \n     the women's rights movement is highly appropriate;\n       Whereas honoring the first Women's Rights Convention is \n     educational, historically important, and of widespread \n     national appeal;\n       Whereas stamp issuance and stamp collecting teach children \n     about our Nation's history and our Nation's culture; and\n       Whereas in the history of the struggle for equality, the \n     significance of this event is immeasurable: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) a postage stamp should be issued to commemorate the \n     150th anniversary of the first Women's Rights Convention; and\n       (2) the Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee of the United \n     States Postal Service should recommend to the Postmaster \n     General that such a stamp be issued.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise along with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator D'Amato, to submit a resolution that urges the \nUnited States Postal Service to issue a commemorative postage stamp to \ncelebrate the 150th anniversary of the first Women's Rights Convention \nheld in Seneca Falls, NY. In 1980 I introduced legislation to \ncommemorate the idea of equal rights for women by creating the Women's \nRights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls. That is where the \nDeclaration of Sentiments was signed in 1848, stating that ``all men \nand women are created equal'' and that women should have equal \npolitical rights with men. From this beginning sprang the 19th \namendment and many other advances for women this century and last.\n  Western New York was home to an emerging reform movement during the \n1830's and 1840's. Among reformers settling in Seneca Falls were Quaker \nwomen such as Lucretia Mott who took an active role in the effort to \nend slavery. For Mott, Martha Wright, Mary Ann M'Clintock, and \nElizabeth Cady Stanton, reform also included demanding rights for \nwomen. In July 1848, they planned the convention and hammered out a \nformal list of grievances based on the Declaration of Independence, \ndenouncing inequities in property rights, education, employment, \nreligion, marriage and family, and suffrage. On July 19, the \nDeclaration of Sentiments was presented before an audience of 300.\n  The Women's Rights Convention and the Declaration of Sentiments were \na vital early step toward reversing these injustices against women. \nMany historians consider the convention to be one of the most important \nevents in the history of the women's movement in the United States.\n  The women of Seneca Falls challenged America to social revolution \nwith a list of demands that touched upon every aspect of life. Testing \ndifferent approaches, the early women's rights leaders came to view the \nballot as the best way to challenge the system, but they did not limit \ntheir efforts to this one issue. Fifty years after\n\n[[Page S6763]]\n\nthe convention, women could claim property rights, employment and \neducational opportunities, divorce and child custody laws, and \nincreased social freedoms. By the early 20th century, a coalition of \nsuffragists, temperance groups, reform-minded politicians, and women's \nsocial welfare organizations mustered a successful push for the vote.\n  Today Congress honors Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, along \nwith Susan B. Anthony, as revolutionary leaders of the women's movement \nby placing a statue of them in the Capitol Rotunda next to statues of \nother leaders in our Nation's history such as George Washington, \nAbraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  It is only fitting that a stamp be issued commemorating this historic \nanniversary highlighting the importance of continuing this struggle for \nequal rights and opportunity for women in areas such as health care, \neducation, employment, and pay equity.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, to \nsubmit concurrent resolution to commemorate the 150th anniversary of \nthe first Women's Rights Convention through the issuance of a U.S. \npostage stamp.\n  American women in the middle part of the 19th century had few \ndistinguishable rights. They did not possess the right to vote, \nparticipate in government and if married, were not allowed to own \nproperty or keep wages if they worked outside of the home. In the \nsummer of 1848, a group of five women sought to change these \ncircumstances.\n  On July 19 and 20, 1848, 300 women and men converged on Wesleyan \nMethodist Church in Seneca Falls, NY to consider ``the social, civil \nand religious condition of women'' at that time. Led by Elizabeth Cady \nStanton, Lucretia Mott, Jane Hunt, Ann McClintock and Martha Wright, a \nDeclaration of Sentiments was presented to the audience which listed \namong them ``all men and women are created equal'' and that ``women's \npolitical equality with man is the legitimate outgrowth of the \nfundamental principles of our government as set forth in the \nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution.''\n  This historic Convention marked a turning point in the condition of \nwomen in American society. The public airing of the Declaration of \nSentiments began a progressive pursuit of equality for women that has \nendured to this day.\n  The issuance of this stamp will honor the courage that these early \nleaders had in presenting their convictions and pursuing change for all \nwomen.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``National Fund for \n     Health Research Act''.\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\n     SEC. 5996. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly 4 of 5 peer reviewed research projects deemed \n     worthy of funding by the National Institutes of Health are \n     not funded.\n       (2) Less than 3 percent of the nearly one trillion dollars \n     our Nation spends on health care is devoted to health \n     research, while the defense industry spends 15 percent of its \n     budget on research and development.\n       (3) Public opinion surveys have shown that Americans want \n     more Federal resources put into health research and are \n     willing to pay for it.\n       (4) Ample evidence exists to demonstrate that health \n     research has improved the quality of health care in the \n     United States. Advances such as the development of vaccines, \n     the cure of many childhood cancers, drugs that effectively \n     treat a host of diseases and disorders, a process to protect \n     our Nation's blood supply from the HIV virus, progress \n     against cardiovascular disease including heart attack and \n     stroke, and new strategies for the early detection and \n     treatment of diseases such as colon, breast, and prostate \n     cancer clearly demonstrates the benefits of health research.\n       (5) Health research which holds the promise of prevention \n     of intentional and unintentional injury and cure and \n     prevention of disease and disability, is critical to holding \n     down health care costs in the long term.\n       (6) Expanded medical research is also critical to holding \n     down the long-term costs of the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act. For example, recent \n     research has demonstrated that delaying the onset of \n     debilitating and costly conditions like Alzheimer's disease \n     could reduce general health care and medicare costs by \n     billions of dollars annually.\n       (7) The state of our Nation's research facilities at the \n     National Institutes of Health and at universities is \n     deteriorating significantly. Renovation and repair of these \n     facilities are badly needed to maintain and improve the \n     quality of research.\n       (8) Because discretionary spending is likely to decline in \n     real terms over the next 5 years, the Nation's investment in \n     health research through the National Institutes of Health is \n     likely to decline in real terms unless corrective legislative \n     action is taken.\n       (9) A health research fund is needed to maintain our \n     Nation's commitment to health research and to increase the \n     percentage of approved projects which receive funding at the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n\n     SEC. 5997. ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of \n     the United States a fund, to be known as the ``National Fund \n     for Health Research'' (hereafter in this section referred to \n     as the ``Fund''), consisting of such amounts as are \n     transferred to the Fund under subsection (b) any sums \n     specifically designated for such purpose by future acts of \n     Congress, and any interest earned on investment of amounts in \n     the Fund.\n       (b) Transfers to Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     transfer to the Fund amounts equivalent to one half the \n     amounts for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002 \n     derived for each such fiscal year under Section 311 through \n     Section 314 of this act that exceeds the amount of Federal \n     revenues estimated by the Joint Tax Committee as of the date \n     of enactment of this act, to be gained from enactment of \n     Section 311 through Section 314 for each such fiscal year.\n       (B) Determination by secretary.--Not later than 6 months \n     after the end of each of the fiscal years described in \n     subparagraph (A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall--\n       (i) make a determination as to the amount to be transferred \n     to the Fund for the fiscal year involved under this \n     subsection; and\n       (ii) subject to subsection (d), transfer such amount to the \n     Fund.\n       (C) Fund Administered by Health and Human Services.--The \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall administer funds \n     transferred into the Fund.\n       (D) Cap on transfer.--Amounts transferred to the Fund under \n     this subsection for any year in the 5-fiscal year period \n     beginning on October 1, 1997, shall not in combination with \n     the appropriated amount exceed an amount equal to the amount \n     appropriated for the National Institutes of Health for fiscal \n     year 1997 multiplied by 2.\n       (c) Obligations From Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph \n     (4), with respect to the amounts made available in the Fund \n     in a fiscal year, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall distribute--\n       (A) 2 percent of such amounts during any fiscal year to the \n     Office of the Director of the * * *\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     Act with respect to health information communications; and\n       (D) the remainder of such amounts during any fiscal year to \n     member institutes and centers, including the Office of AIDS \n     Research, of the National Institutes of Health in the same \n     proportion to the total amount received under this section, \n     as the amount of annual appropriations under appropriations \n     Acts for each member institute and Centers for the fiscal \n     year bears to the total amount of appropriations under \n     appropriations Acts for all member institutes and Centers of \n     the National Institutes of Health for the fiscal year.\n       (2) Plans of allocation.--The amounts transferred under \n     paragraph (1)(D) shall be allocated by the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health or the various directors of the \n     institutes and centers, as the case may be, pursuant to \n     allocation plans developed by the various advisory councils \n     to such directors, after consultation with such directors.\n       (3) Grants and contracts fully funded in first year.--With \n     respect to any grant or contract funded by amounts \n     distributed under paragraph (1), the full amount of the total \n     obligation of such grant or contract shall be funded in the \n     first year of such grant or contract, and shall remain \n     available until expended.\n       (4) Trigger and release of monies.--\n       (A) Trigger and release.--No expenditure shall be made \n     under paragraph (1) during any fiscal year in which the \n     annual amount appropriated for the National Institutes of \n     Health is less than the amount so appropriated for the prior \n     fiscal year.\n       (d) Required Appropriation.--No transfer may be made for a \n     fiscal year under subsection (b) unless an appropriations Act \n     providing for such a transfer has been enacted with respect \n     to such fiscal year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                KENNEDY (AND D'AMATO) AMENDMENT NO. 580\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, and Mr. D'Amato) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 949, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 267, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 780.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Ms. Lesley \nMoss of Hoxie, KS, who has been crowned Miss Kansas. Lesley began \ncompeting in the Miss Kansas pageant at the age of 17--the youngest \nallowable age for a Miss Kansas participant--and was a top 10 finalist.\n  Last year Lesley won first runner-up in the Miss Kansas pageant. When \nthe 1996 Miss Kansas, Tara Holland, relinquished her crown after \nwinning the title of Miss America, Moss passed up the chance to take \nHolland's place, because she wanted to compete for the title again.\n  Growing up on a farm 3 miles north of Hoxie, Lesley realized that \nthere is a special sense of community throughout rural Kansas.\n  Lesley developed an original program called Project L.E.A.D. \n(Learning what leadership is, Exercising personal leadership skills, \nActing in collaboration with others, Devoting time and energy into \ncommunity service) which encourages leadership through volunteerism \nwithin schools and communities of all sizes.

Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate voted \non a reconciliation bill that will make some of the most significant \nchanges in the 30-year history of the Medicare Program, and I want to \nexplain to my colleagues and constituents why I opposed the Senate's \nbill.\n  I opposed the bill with some regret, because, for the most part, it \nreflects the bipartisan budget agreement, which I have supported. For \nexample, I voted for the bipartisan budget resolution earlier this \nmonth. That plan requires the Congress to pass legislation to cut the \ndeficit by just over $200 billion over the next 5 years, with about \n$115 billion of that deficit reduction to come from slowing down the \nrate of growth of Medicare. So I am not unwilling to vote for \nrestraining Medicare spending in order to reduce the deficit.\n  We must put this country on track toward a balanced budget while \nensuring the health and stability of the Medicare Program. Doing so \nrequires that we limit the rate of growth of the Medicare Program. The \nMedicare Program has been growing at a rate of about 10 percent a year, \na rate of growth that the country cannot sustain, especially once the \nbaby boomer generation begins retiring and putting additional financial \nstress on the program.\n  I had hoped to support the Senate's bill. In fact, the bill includes \nmany items I have supported for a long time, including expanding \nMedicare's coverage for preventive benefits, expanding the health plan \noptions available to seniors in North Dakota and across the country, \nand other changes to improve access to health care in rural areas and \nstrengthen our ability to fight fraud and abuse in the program. I voted \nfor a substitute Medicare package offered by Senator Reed that included \nthese provisions but did not include the more controversial provisions \nfound in the Senate bill. Most notably, the Reed substitute, like the \nSenate bill, would have extended the life of the Medicare trust fund \nfor 10 more years, but would have done so without asking Medicare \nbeneficiaries to pay significantly more for their health care and \nwithout knocking a number of seniors out of the Medicare Program.\n  Unfortunately, in several extremely important areas, this bill did \nnot abide by the bipartisan budget agreement achieved during months of \nnegotiations this spring. The Senate bill abandoned this approach by \nincluding several provisions that will result in significantly higher \nout-of-pocket health care expenses for our Nation's older Americans.\n  The Senate bill included two significant structural changes--an \nincrease in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 and a means test \nfor the Medicare part B premium paid by upper income older Americans. I \nvoted to strike these provisions from the Senate bill because I think \nit is inappropriate to make these kinds of central changes to the \nMedicare Program on the spending side of the budget ledger in order to \nmake room for larger tax cuts on the tax side of the ledger. It is my \nview that changes made to Medicare should be made for the purpose of \nstrengthening the program--not to provide room for tax cuts, the bulk \nof which will go to upper income earners in this country. Let's keep \nMedicare healthy and our older Americans healthy as well.\n  Why in this bill was it proposed that we ask seniors who make more \nthan $50,000 to pay higher prices for their Medicare policies so that \ninvestors who make $500,000 or more could be given tax cuts? There is \nno denying a direct connection when the Medicare changes were proposed \nin the context of reconciliation legislation that includes tax cuts. In \nthis reconciliation process, the act of achieving Medicare savings was \nintertwined with the desire for tax cuts on the revenue side.\n  There are some signs of reasonableness in this bill. For example, I \nsupport this bill's creation of a national, bipartisan commission \ncharged with making recommendations to Congress on the long-term \nchanges necessary to ensuring the extended solvency of the Medicare \nprogram. On the advice of this Commission we should confront the \ndemographic changes facing our country over the next 30 to 40 years as \nthe baby boomers retire and our Nation grays. The commission will have \none year to study and report its recommendations to Congress. Let's \nhope that this process will ultimately result in a solid package of \nchanges that the Congress will act on quickly.\n  With this package of recommendations on long-term solvency I am \nwilling to consider basic structural changes to the program, including \nmeans testing and/or increasing the eligibility age if the following \nconditions are met.\n  First, if we consider increasing the eligibility age, we must be able \nto respond to the needs of the retirees between the ages of 65 and 67 \nwho will still need affordable insurance coverage. The Senate bill does \nnot consider this issue. It simply proposes to leave these folks \nuninsured. Already, the number of retirees with employer-provided \nhealth insurance has dropped 14 percent in the six years between 1988 \nto 1994, and every indication is that this trend would be exacerbated \nby raising the Medicare eligibility age. Most low- or even middle-\nincome seniors in their mid-sixties will never be able to afford the \npremiums that will be assessed by the health insurance industry to \ncover people of that age.\n  Now, I voted in support of increasing the Social Security retirement \nage in 1983, as part of a plan to extend the solvency of the Social \nSecurity program well into the next century. But I do not agree with \nthose who compare the increase in the eligibility age for Medicare to \nincreasing the Social Security retirement age to 67. Under Social \nSecurity, seniors who need or choose to retire before age 67 will still \nhave the option to do so, at a reduced benefit level. The ramifications \nare very different for increasing the Medicare eligibility age. Under \nthe Senate bill, these seniors will not have an option for getting \nMedicare benefits before they turn 67 and many of them will become \nuninsured.\n  If we raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, we must \nprovide some means to guarantee the availability of affordable \ninsurance coverage for the citizens in that age group. One of the \nissues the Medicare commission created by this bill is charged with \nstudying is whether it is feasible to allow retirees who have not yet \nreached the eligibility age for Medicare to buy into the program. This \nidea deserves consideration before we act to increase the eligibility \nage.\n  With respect to means testing or income relating, as it is called in \nthe Senate bill, I am willing to support means testing for Medicare, \nbut again, only after careful consideration of the ramifications for \nthe entire Medicare program and for the purpose of extending the \nsolvency of Medicare, not as\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\npart of a reconciliation bill that is designed to cut spending for the \npurpose of accommodating additional tax cuts.\n  One of the reasons that Medicare has such widespread support is \nbecause it provides health insurance coverage for virtually all older \nAmericans. If through means testing we create an incentive for \nwealthier, healthier people to drop out of the program because they can \nget a better deal outside of Medicare, then we ought to at least \nunderstand and consider the ramifications of that.\n  There are other things about the Senate bill that create substantial \nnew burdens on low- and moderate-income older Americans. Under this \nbill, seniors will be asked to pay significant new out-of-pocket costs. \nIn North Dakota, 70 percent of our senior citizens have incomes under \n$15,000, and on average, they spend $2,500 for prescription drugs and \nother health care expenses not covered by Medicare or supplemental \ninsurance. Many of these folks simply cannot afford to pay much more.\n  I am concerned about the new $5 co-payment for home health visits. I \nvoted to eliminate this new cost from the Senate bill. While $5 may not \nseem like a lot of money to many of us, a lot of the seniors who rely \non home health care cannot afford this extra expense and might be \nforced to enter a hospital or nursing home at significantly greater \ncost to the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n  This bill also erodes the protections that currently exist in \nMedicare which limit the amount doctors can charge Medicare \nbeneficiaries above and beyond the Medicare-approved amount. This bill \nresults in millions of dollars in new out-of-pocket costs.\n  The conferees on this bill have an opportunity to address these \nconcerns and to drop troubling provisions from the bill, such as the \nmeans testing of the Medicare premium, the increase in the Medicare \neligibility age, and the new home health care co-payment. Eliminating \nthese provisions from the final bill would still lengthen the solvency \nof the Medicare program for 10 more years, and I hope the conference \ncommittee will take this action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6778-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO JESSE BROWN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the veterans' community is \nabout to lose one of its best and strongest champions--Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, Jesse Brown. After 4 years as the Secretary, Jesse \nBrown is retiring from Government service. He will be deeply missed by \nmillions of veterans and their families, and everyone else who has had \nthe good fortune of working with him.\n  Secretary Brown is one of the staunchest advocates the veterans' \ncommunity has ever known. A veteran himself, injured during the Vietnam \nwar, he articulated passionately and eloquently the needs of veterans, \nand the obligation of our Government to take care of those who served, \noften at great personal sacrifice. His oratory could move an audience \nto tears, and there was never any question but that his concern was \ngenuine and sincere. He truly was a ``veterans' veteran,'' as he was \noften called, and he fought to the last to further and protect \nveterans' best interests.\n  Jesse Brown undertook an ambitious agenda as Secretary. Under his \nwatch, the Veterans Health Administration was reorganized into 22 \nVeterans Integrated Service Networks [VISNs], the VA health care system \nbegan the transition from inpatient to outpatient care, the Veterans \nBenefits Administration moved to reduce its tremendous backlog of \ncases, and benefits were extended to Persian Gulf war veterans \nsuffering from undiagnosed illnesses and Vietnam veterans' children \nborn with spina bifida. Most significantly, he was tremendously \nsuccessful in protecting his department from some of the deep budget \ncuts suffered by most other Federal agencies.\n  Secretary Brown's departure is a great loss. I wish him every success \nin the years ahead--and I have every confidence that he will succeed in \nwhatever he undertakes.\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJesse Brown, who will retire as Secretary of Veterans Affairs on July \n1, 1997.\n  Since his appointment to this post on January 22, 1993, Secretary \nBrown has been the champion of our Nation's 26 million veterans. But \nhis commitment to those who fought for this country began long before \nhe accepted the awesome responsibility of heading the Federal \nGovernment's largest Department.\n  Secretary Brown's service in the Marine Corps formed the foundation \nfor his strong commitment to veterans. He later worked for the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, where he was an advocate for the highest quality \nhealthcare and benefits for veterans and their families. Secretary \nBrown translated his personal experiences into action as he accepted \nthe charge of providing for those who have protected our country.\n  As a fellow veteran, I appreciate all of Secretary Brown's work on \nbehalf of our Nation's veterans and their families. In the 4\\1/2\\ years \nsince he accepted this challenging post, he has worked diligently to \nmove the VA into the 21st century. His personal commitment to veterans \nhas produced numerous accomplishments.\n  Secretary Brown has overseen the Department's first national summit \non homeless veterans. He has worked to expand the Department's services \nto women veterans. And under his leadership, the VA has opened \ncommunity based outpatient clinics, giving more veterans wider access \nto VA healthcare services. In all that he has done, his commitment to \nbroadening veterans' access to the system has never faltered.\n  Throughout his service, Secretary Brown has gone out of his way to \nensure that those who honorably served their country receive the \nattention, benefits, and services they deserve. Last year, Secretary \nBrown visited New Jersey, where he personally met with veterans to \naddress their concerns about benefits and the VA healthcare system. \nAfter this meeting, numerous veterans from New Jersey contacted me to \nconvey their appreciation for Secretary Brown's work on their behalf.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Brown's service to this country will be \nsorely missed. As a fellow veteran, I join all of the veterans in New \nJersey and across the country in thanking him for his work and wishing \nhim well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6779-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6779-S6780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE JESSE BROWN\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ninnumerable contributions and outstanding leadership that have \ncharacterized the tenure of the Honorable Jesse Brown as the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs. It is with great appreciation, as well as sadness, \nthat I speak of his accomplishments today, as his term as the chief of \nthe second-largest agency in the Federal Government will come to an end \non the first of July. Under his guidance over the past 4\\1/2\\ years, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs has undergone some of the most \nfundamental changes in decades. In the past, such groundbreaking \nreforms and restructuring may have inspired fear on Capitol Hill and in \nveterans' facilities across the Nation, but with Jesse Brown at the \nhelm, the Department has undergone a transformation with support, hard-\nearned at times, from both budget-cutters in Congress and from veterans \nacross the country.\n  When Secretary Brown took office in 1993, he was faced with an \noutdated health-care delivery system stretched to its limits trying to \nmaintain too many large, aging hospitals. The Secretary rose to the \nchallenge by closing hospitals that did not serve their patients well \nand beginning an overhaul of the entire VA medical system into a \nnetwork of 22 regional provider regions. Within these regions, \nincreased attention is being given to the quality of care available as \nwell as to outpatient services. These changes, which are still taking \nhold in many places, demonstrate the vision that Secretary Brown \nbrought to his work; a vision of changing with the times, but never \ngiving up on the primary focus of providing services to veterans.\n  Secretary Brown's unyielding drive to ensure that veterans have \naccess to needed services is very important to Nevada, one of only two \nStates in the Nation where the population of veterans is growing. While \nmy State's problems are very different than those of a Northeastern or \nMidwestern State,\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nSecretary Brown took these differences into account and has been \ninstrumental in helping Nevada be more responsive to the needs of the \nmen and women who have served our country. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs has begun to reallocate its resources so that Federal funds are \nmade available where veterans' needs are most critical. In southern \nNevada, where approximately 118,000 veterans already crowd existing \nfacilities, new projects will allow Nevada's veterans to access \ndoctors, counselors, and other benefits to which they are entitled. The \nSecretary has helped Nevada's underserved veterans gain access to the \nservices they deserve through his active support for efforts to \nconstruct and expand desperately needed medical facilities in southern \nNevada. Secretary Brown has come to the aid of Nevada's veterans during \ncrises, as well, stepping in to help find a solution when one of the VA \nfacilities in Nevada faced administrative problems.\n  While I could go on much longer just discussing Secretary Brown's \ncontributions to Nevada's veterans, I would be amiss if I did not \nmention the profound impact he has had on all American veterans and \ntheir families. He has tackled the most sensitive issues facing \nveterans, including his work to enact laws authorizing the VA to \nprovide compensation and treatment for Persian Gulf war veterans' \nundiagnosed illnesses. He also expanded services to women veterans, \nwhich is evident at the new Addeliar D. Guy III Ambulatory Care center \nsoon to open in Las Vegas. Finally, Secretary Brown confirmed the VA's \ncommitment to all veterans in need by convening the first summit on the \nissues facing homeless veterans, and followed up on this by adding \nhomeless programs to the services provided at VA medical centers. \nAgain, this effort has a great impact in Las Vegas, where a large \nnumber of homeless veterans have needs that have, until now, largely \ngone unmet. With the help of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, \nhowever, Las Vegas will soon boast a new initiative that joins hands \nwith the city and county to provide assistance to the homeless veterans \nin Las Vegas.\n  Mr. President, I have only touched upon a few of the many positive \nchanges and initiatives launched by Secretary Brown, and I have not \neven made mention of his previous service to his country as a soldier \nin Vietnam or as the director of the Washington office of the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans. I am sure that Secretary Brown will continue to make \nthis world more livable and more enjoyable for veterans in whatever \nchallenges he pursues in the future, buoyed by his commitment to \n``putting veterans first.'' Whether guaranteeing a home loan for a \nveteran just returned from a tour overseas, streamlining health care \nprocedures at a local walk-in clinic, or intervening to prevent the \neviction of elderly VA nursing home residents, Jesse Brown has proven \nthat he, and the agency he led, do indeed put veterans first. When he \nannounced his resignation, Secretary Brown said he wanted to be \nremembered as ``someone who made a difference in the quality of \nveterans' lives.'' I speak for the veterans of Nevada, and across the \ncountry, when I say that Jesse Brown will be remembered not only for \nimproving veterans' access to needed benefits, but also for leading \nthis agency with skill, with compassion, and most of all with an \nappreciation for the noble service of our Nation's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6779-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6780-S6781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 450\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleague in offering this amendment.\n  Last year during the welfare reform debate, as part of the effort to \nbalance the budget, the 104th Congress made dramatic cuts to programs \nfor low-income families. According to the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, more than 93 percent of the cuts in entitlement programs in \nthe 104th Congress came from programs for low-income people. Congress \nreduced entitlement programs by $65.6 billion over the period from 1996 \nto 2002.\n  I am deeply concerned about the extent to which legal immigrants are \nbeing harmed under the Welfare Reform act. The Act cut $22 billion in \nservices to legal immigrants--a full 44 percent of the overall \nlegislation.\n  The House Ways and Means Committee reconciliation mark provided the \nleast generous allocation of funding for legal immigrants as compared \nto the budget agreement and the Senate Finance Committee mark. The $9 \nbillion allocation in the Ways and Means mark violates the budget \nagreement, and it covers fewer people. Since it does not cover those \nwho, in the future, could be eligible for SSI assistance, it will leave \nmany without any means of support. According to the Social Security \nAdministration, 125,000 fewer people will be served by the House \nagreement compared to the Budget Agreement. In Minnesota it puts 1,145 \nelderly immigrants at risk of losing benefits.\n  Moreover, it puts an additional 161,000 people at risk of losing \ntheir benefits because their citizenship is unknown or difficult to \nprove. Probably the worst provision in this agreement is that it makes \nan inhumane and irrational distinction among disabled people based on \nan arbitrary date on the calendar. If you were disabled and receiving \nSSI on August 22, 1996, then you retain eligibility. If not, there is \nno hope for receiving future benefits.\n  The Durbin/Wellstone amendment restores food stamp benefits to legal \nimmigrant families with children 18 years old and under at a cost of \n$750 million over 5 years. Our offset is achieved by placing limits on \nthe amount of Federal money that States can use to offset their cost \nshare requirements in the food stamp and Medicaid programs. Our \namendment would take a small step toward addressing the use of these \nfunds and target the savings into food stamp benefits for legal \nimmigrants who have dependent children. Over 5 years, we hope to save \n$1 billion, which fully covers the cost of restoring food stamp \nbenefits.\n  Unlike other low-income families in this country, legal immigrants \nare banned from receiving food stamp benefits. Food stamps are the \nNation's largest and most successful food assistance program and cuts \nto this program made up half of the savings in last year's welfare \nreform effort. According to CBO, 17 percent of the immigrants receiving \nfood stamps are children. This means more than 150,000 children have \nlost access to this critical program. In Minnesota roughly 15,900 \nindividuals are expected to lose food stamp benefits. According to INS, \nmost of these immigrant families will naturalize within 10 years, \nmaking them eligible to apply for food stamps. CBO estimates that it \nwill cost $750 million to restore food stamp benefits for children 18 \nyears and under. Senator Durbin and I have provided an offset that \nachieves that amount over 5 years. No matter what your position on the \noverall budget deal, you must agree that no purpose is served by \ndenying children food.\n  According to the Food Research and Action Center, approximately 13.6 \nmillion children under age 12 are at risk of hunger during some part of \nthe year. FRAC reports that although families who face real issues of \nhunger may not be hungry every day of the month, or even every month of \nthe year, the hunger affecting most low-income families is not a one-\ntime or infrequent occurrence. It is characterized--and this is \naccording to FRAC--by food shortages and chronic insecurity about \nwhether the family will have enough food.\n  We are now benefiting from scientific research that points to the \nsignificance of the early years on development of the brain. A \nconsistently nutritious diet is one of the most important if not the \nmost important ingredient to a child reaching his or her potential. In \na 1995 study entitled Community Childhood Hunger Identification \nProject; a Survey of Childhood Hunger in the United States, FRAC \ndetermined that undernourished children suffer from two to four times \nas many health problems. I quote from the survey:\n\n       Hungry children are more likely to be ill and absent from \n     school.\n       The infant mortality rate is closely linked to inadequate \n     quantity or quality in the diet of the infant's mother.\n       Iron deficiency anemia in children can lead to adverse \n     health effects such as developmental and behavioral \n     disturbances that can affect children's ability to learn and \n     to read or do mathematics. According to the Centers for \n     Disease Control, anemia remains a significant health problem \n     among low-income children.\n       Hungry children are less likely to interact with other \n     people or to explore or learn from their surroundings. This \n     interferes with their ability to learn from a very early age.\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\n       According to the Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty \n     and Nutrition Policy, evidence from recent research about \n     child nutrition shows that, in addition to having a \n     detrimental effect on the cognitive development of children, \n     undernutrition results in lost knowledge, brainpower, and \n     productivity.\n       Hunger and insecurity about whether a family will be able \n     to obtain enough food to avoid hunger, also have an emotional \n     impact on children and their parents. Anxiety, negative \n     feelings about self-worth, and hostility toward the outside \n     world can result from chronic hunger and food insecurity.\n\n  The food stamp is designed to reach those families most in need and \nthere is plenty of evidence that the children most at risk of hunger \nare in poor or low-income families. A 1996-study reported about 6.1 \nmillion children under 6 were living in poverty in 1994. An additional \n4.8 million young children lived near the poverty line, according to \nColumbia University's National Center for Children in Poverty. Sixty-\ntwo percent of poor children lived with at least one parent or relative \nwho worked. Fewer than one-third of the children's families relied \nexclusively on welfare. The poverty rate grew fastest among Hispanic \nchildren, rising 43 percent since 1979, compared with a 38-percent rise \namong white children and 19 percent among black children.\n  Last year's reform banned legal immigrant families with dependent \nchildren from food stamp benefits. This amendment is about restoring \ncritical food assistance to those children. We cannot say we are for \nchildren and then turn our backs on legal immigrant children. This \namendment is reasonable. It's paid for and it makes imminent \nsense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6780-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DECISION STRIKING DOWN PART OF BRADY LAW\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss today's Brady law \ndecision, in which a deeply divided Supreme Court put judicial activism \nover public safety. At a time when the United States leads the world in \ngun carnage, surely the Federal Government is entitled to enlist the \naid of States to keep guns out of the hands of felons, illegal \nimmigrants, and the criminally insane. Asking local police to conduct \nbackground checks--and nothing more--hardly amounts to a Federal power \ngrab, as the majority has claimed. Instead, the majority's opinion \nshould make us fear what the Supreme Court could do next.\n  Will the Court prohibit Congress from requiring States to report \nmissing children? Will it bar Congress from requiring states to get \nlead out of school drinking water? Will it stop Congress from requiring \nStates to publicly disclose where hazardous waste is being stored?\n  All of these requirements are now current law, and all of them are \nnow in peril.\n  We will have to consider these troubling issues in the future. But as \nfor today, this decision alone is hardly a fatal blow to the Brady law \nitself. Since its enactment, Brady background checks have stopped over \n186,000 persons from obtaining guns. And these Brady checks will \ncontinue for two reasons. First, virtually all of the police officers \nwe have spoken to say they will continue to do the Brady check \nvoluntarily--even if they are not required to do so. The reason why is \nsimple: they know these checks save lives. Second, the provision struck \ndown by the Court only relates to the so-called interim Brady law. By \nthe end of next year, Brady requires that a permanent instant check \nsystem be implemented. And that system, operated by Federal officials, \nwill be immune from constitutional challenge.\n  Still, the Supreme Court's misguided decision opens up the \npossibility that, before the instant check system becomes fully \noperational, a handful of rogue police officers will refuse to do \nbackground checks. As a result of such inaction, at least a few felons \nwill commit violent crimes with guns they never should have been able \nto obtain.\n  For this reason, we are working with the President to draft \nlegislation that will ensure 100 percent Brady compliance--for example, \nby allowing gun dealers to obtain background checks from any police \nchief in their State, not just the chief in the jurisdiction where the \nbuyer resides. Because the vast majority of police will continue to \nconduct Brady checks voluntarily, this approach will clearly preserve \nour no check, no sale policy.\n  Mr. President, today's Supreme Court ruling, while unfortunate, does \nnot take away from how effective the Brady law has been or will be. But \nit is nevertheless a bad decision that will hurt us in our fight \nagainst crime. We'll introduce bipartisan legislation to fix it, and I \nhope my colleagues will support our efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6781-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GARRETT RUSSELL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of a remarkable young man from the city of Midland, MI. \nGarrett Russell, an 8-year-old second grade student at Siebert \nElementary School, collected more than 100 bicycles and $25,000 worth \nof toys to give to victims of the flooding in Grand Forks, ND.\n  When Garrett saw footage of the flooding he was immediately moved \ninto action. He asked his classmates to help him provide toys to the \nthousands of the children in Grand Forks who were forced to leave their \nbelongings behind as they fled from their homes. Word of Garrett's \n``Kids Helping Kids'' campaign spread quickly and caught the \nimagination of the generous people of the Tri-City area. Donations \narrived daily, reaching a total of more than 3,000 toys and 100 \nbicycles.\n  Garrett, his sister Elise, and his parents, Dean and Kathy Russell, \nloaded the toys into a truck and drove to Grand Forks to distribute \nthem to the children there. Lutheran Social Services of Grand Forks \nheld a festival on Saturday, June 14, 1997, at which Garrett gave away \nmost of the toys to the 1,200 children who attended. The following day, \nGarrett and his family gave the rest of the toys away as they visited \nthe homes of families who had lost almost everything they owned.\n  Garrett has received praise from many people since he began his \ncampaign to brighten the spirits of the children of Grand Forks, \nespecially from his classmates and from the people who benefited from \nhis endeavors. The Midland Daily News quoted his friend, 7-year-old \nAnna Brown, who said, ``I think it was generous of him because most \nkids don't start a campaign just because they see something on the \nnews.'' Grand Forks resident Judy Holweger, whose son, Joel, received a \nbicycle at the festival, said, ``It really lifts these kids' spirits. \nThey've lost a lot.'' Garrett's schoolmate, Claire Liang, may have put \nit best when she said, ``Not everyone has a big heart like Garrett.''\n  We can all take inspiration from Garrett Russell's example of \ngenerosity and selflessness. I know my colleagues join me in commending \nGarrett for his outstanding accomplishments, and in wishing the people \nof Grand Forks, as well as all those affected by the flooding this \nspring, a speedy and complete recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6781-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6781-S6782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KIRSTEN FROHNMAYER\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the remarkable life of Kirsten Frohnmayer. Kirsten, the \ndaughter of University of Oregon president Dave Frohnmayer and his wife \nLynn, died last week after a courageous battle with Fanconi anemia, a \nrare genetic disease that also claimed the life of her sister, Katie.\n  Kirsten lived much of her 24 years on Earth with the knowledge that \nshe was battling a vicious disease. Yet she never gave up, and she \nnever allowed herself to wallow in despair. Rather, as her family and \nfriends have testified, she maintained an optimistic spirit that \ninspired countless men, women, and children. Kirsten also willingly \nvolunteered to undergo experimental medical procedures, in hopes that \nothers with the same disease might benefit from what doctors learned \nthrough the procedure.\n  Mr. President, the Eugene Register Guard recently published an \neloquent tribute to Kirsten which contains her own inspiring words. I \nask that this tribute be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by simply saying that the entire State \nof Oregon joins with me in extending our thoughts and prayers to the \nentire Frohnmayer family.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\n            [From the Eugene Register Guard, June 23, 1997]\n\n                                Kirsten\n\n       In her graduation speech at South Eugene High School six \n     years ago this month, Kirsten Frohnmayer said: ``My family \n     jokes that by having this serious health problem, we provide \n     an important community service. We remind people that things \n     in their own lives may not be as bad as they seem.''\n       That was no joke. Following the joys and sorrows of the \n     Frohnmayer family has been a community activity here for more \n     than two decades. Their lives are at least more instructive \n     than soap operas. Kirsten's own story, her cheerfully \n     determined battle against a mysterious disease with a strange \n     name and a lethal record, has been particularly gripping.\n       But not all stories have happy endings. This one is \n     particularly sad because all of us were rooting so hard, \n     hoping against hope. The community genuinely grieves with the \n     Frohnmayers, as in some degree does the whole state.\n       At 24, mentally and spiritually Kirsten had done more \n     living than many people twice her age. She had an immense \n     capacity for life. Partly because of her disease, she had a \n     keen appreciation for each day's possibilities.\n       Her positive outlook calls to mind the obituary editorial \n     famed Kansas editor William Allen White wrote 76 years ago \n     after his own 16-year-old daughter was killed in a freak \n     riding accident: ``Her humor was a continual bubble of joy. . \n     . . No angel was Mary White, but an easy girl to live with, \n     for she never nursed a grouch five minutes in her life.''\n       On the list of personal tragedies to which humankind is \n     vulnerable, the death of a child must rank at the top. It \n     does not matter whether the child is struck by a limb while \n     riding her horse or is worn down over many years and finally \n     defeated by a vicious disease; the loss is tremendously hard \n     to bear.\n       Hearts go out to David and Lynn Frohnmayer and to Kirsten's \n     three remaining siblings. But we know, too, that they will \n     manage, because they are blessed with intelligence and \n     strength of spirit--and because they understand the wisdom of \n     what Kirsten told her classmates at the close of her remarks \n     in 1991:\n       ``A final thought I'd like to share with you tonight is my \n     belief that sometimes we should live for the day. Too often \n     life consists of anticipation of the future or regrets about \n     the past. But we can't change the past, and we don't know \n     what the future will hold. So, at least some of the time, we \n     should concentrate on the present. Whatever path you've \n     chosen, whether you're talking about college, a job, \n     volunteer work, or family, you're talking about life and life \n     must be fun. Find the fun in life, for as Ferris Bueller said \n     on his day off, `life moves pretty fast, and if you don't \n     stop and look around once in a while, you are going to miss \n     it.'\n       ``So . . . I hope that you will remember to appreciate and \n     protect what you have, be optimistic and constructive in the \n     face of adversity, and stop to smell the roses. Good night \n     and good luck.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6781-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today the Senate completed action \non S. 949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, legislation \nimplementing the tax relief provisions from the historic bipartisan \nbalanced budget agreement. I support this legislation because it does \nprovide real tax relief and adheres to the balanced budget agreement, \nwhich we worked hard to achieve. American families need this tax relief \nand they need our continued commitment to a balanced budget.\n  I have listened to the concerns of many of my colleagues regarding \nthis legislation and the benefits for working families. There is no \ndisputing the fact that this legislation does benefit upper income \nfamilies, but it also benefits working families and the tax cuts are \nnot at the expense of vital, investment programs. I have heard a great \ndeal about the inequities in this legislation and I supported the \nDaschle substitute which would have eliminated many of these \ninequities. But, I do think it is unfair to make the criticism without \nexamining the entire balanced budget agreement and the tax relief \nadopted in 1993 for struggling, working families. The bottom line is \nthat working families will benefit from estate tax relief, capital \ngains tax reductions, education investment tax credits, a per child tax \ncredit and expanded IRAs.\n  Beyond taxes, my colleagues must remember that the balanced budget \nagreement was not only about tax relief, but it was also about helping \nworking families by allocating additional resources for health care, \neducation, environmental protection, and nutritional assistance. It \nalso protected Social Security and Medicare for our Nation's senior \ncitizens. Before weighing any inequities, let's make sure we examine \nthe complete picture.\n  The balanced budget agreement, which this body adopted on June 5, \n1997, calls for a significant investment in education. The agreement \nassumes additional Federal funding for important programs aimed at \nimproving access to quality education for our children. I can assure my \ncolleagues that working families will benefit from improved educational \nopportunities for their children. Quality education is one of the major \npriorities for many of the constituents that I talk to in Washington \nState. And again, there are education tax incentives which will help \nmiddle class working families who are facing escalating tuition and \nhigher education costs. The Hope tax credits and the permanent \nextension of section 127 employer-provided educational assistance tax \nexemption are the kind of tax relief that my constituents have \nendorsed.\n  There is no doubt that this legislation can and should be perfected. \nWe can work to target more relief to the middle class and I will be \nseeking these changes in conference. I am also hopeful we guarantee \nthat these tax cuts do not result in an explosion in the deficit. I \nwill not sit by and watch our deficit run out of control. When I first \ncame to the Senate in 1993, the deficit was close to $300 billion \nannually. For 1997, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nour deficit could be as low as $70 billion. This was not done without \nsome pain and sacrifice. It is imperative that we stay the course and \nmaintain a balanced budget well after 2002.\n  Now that the Senate has completed action on part II of the budget \nagreement, I sincerely hope that every effort will be made to correct \nthe problems with S. 947, the spending reconciliation legislation. The \nMedicare provisions added by the Senate Finance Committee go well \nbeyond protecting Medicare and will jeopardize access to health care \nfor millions of low income senior citizens. I supported a balanced \nbudget agreement that included constraints on spending and tax relief. \nIt is imperative that we enact both parts of the bi-partisan balanced \nbudget agreement, and I will be making every effort to improve S. 947 \nin conference and I will continue to oppose efforts that seek to \nundermine the historic, bipartisan balanced budget agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6782-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6782-S6783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY HOLIDAY\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate \nAmerica's national holiday, I would like to take a moment and pay \ntribute to the founders of our country. James Madison, in particular, \nis one of my heroes. I didn't know much about James Madison until I \nwent to college. I went to the University of Utah and majored in \npolitical science. I became acquainted with James Madison under the \ndirection of G. Homer Durham, who was chairman of the political science \ndepartment at the University of Utah. He had a very radical notion \nabout education. He said the most important course in the political \nscience department was political science 1. And he said, ``Since I am \nthe department head it follows that I should teach the department's \nmost important course.'' So as an 18-year-old freshman I sat at the \nfeet of Homer Durham and learned about the Constitution and James \nMadison. I read the Federalist Papers and began a lifelong love affair \nwith political theory and particularly the political theory that \nundergirds America starting with Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and \nthe Constitutional Convention.\n  As we approach the Fourth of July holiday, I am reminded of another \nimportant item which we all cherish: the American flag. The flag of the \nUnited States is a unique symbol of national unity and represents the \nvalues of liberty, justice, and equality that make this Nation an \nexample unmatched throughout the world. The American flag is recognized \naround the world as an icon of freedom, representing all that we hold \ndear as citizens of the United States. This preeminent symbol of our \nNation has flown in every conflict where American blood has been \nthreatened and shed, and will always deserve our unbending respect and \nprotection.\n  I rise today to support a bill which protects these two sacred items: \nthe Constitution and the American flag.\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\n Many of my Republican colleagues advocate passing a constitutional \namendment to prohibit flag desecration. I admire and agree with their \nintent to show proper respect to our flag, but I disagree with their \nbelief that a new constitutional amendment banning flag burning is the \nbest way to protect the flag and punish flag burners. To this end I, \nalong with Senator McConnell, introduce legislation which will \nsuccessfully and legally prevent the desecration of our national \nsymbol.\n  Our bill provides for the imprisonment and fining of those who damage \nan American flag intending to incite a breach of the peace. It also \npunishes anyone who steals a flag belonging to the Federal Government \nor a flag displayed on Federal property. In a review of our bill, \nsenior constitutional legal experts at the U.S. Library of Congress \nstated that if enacted, the bill would withstand Supreme Court \nconstitutional scrutiny. I agree with this analysis and believe it is \npossible to punish the despicable behavior of flag desecration, while \nstill preserving the stability of a document that has served us well \nfor over 200 years.\n  With these comments, I wish my colleagues a happy Fourth of July \nholiday. May we always remember the liberties and blessings which are \nours due to the sacrifice and inspiration of our American \npatriots.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6782-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONG KONG REVERSION\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, next week the eyes of the world will \nbe focused on Hong Kong when the British dependent territory reverts to \nChinese control. The end result of a negotiated agreement between the \nUnited Kingdom and China, the reversion itself is widely accepted and \nnot a matter of controversy. Nevertheless, how China will handle the \ndynamic and thriving territory of Hong Kong in the near and longer term \nfuture is a matter of great interest, and of considerable difference of \nopinion.\n  I count myself among those who are cautiously, I underscore \ncautiously, optimistic about the future of Hong Kong. The principle \nreason for my cautious optimism is a belief that, in this area, China \nwill be guided primarily by consideration of its economic self \ninterest. Many have likened Hong Kong to the goose that laid the golden \negg. That characterization is well deserved. Simply put, China has an \nenormous stake in continued economic growth and prosperity in Hong \nKong. Over the last several years, economic growth in Hong Kong has \naveraged 5 to 6 percent a year; Hong Kong is now the eighth largest \ntrader in the world; and its GDP of almost $24,000 per capita exceeds \nthat of several western industrialized nations. Hong Kong is an \ninternational business and financial center. The Hong Kong and Chinese \neconomies are already intertwined and codependent. Hong Kong is a \nsource of substantial investment in China and a conduit for Chinese \nexports around the world.\n  To a large extent the Chinese leadership has staked its legitimacy \nand its future on the ability to bring growth to China's economy and an \nimproving standard of living to its people. Over the next 5 years China \nwill have to find jobs for an estimated 216 million new or displaced \nworkers. Reason would argue that China simply cannot afford to \nsubstantially tamper with the economic growth engine that is Hong Kong.\n  In addition to the negative economic consequences of mishandling the \nHong Kong reversion, China has other incentives to try hard to make \nthings work. China has advertised the Hong Kong one country-two systems \nprinciple as a model for any potential future discussions on \nreunification of Taiwan with the mainland. While it's still unclear \nwhether or not this is even a feasible proposition, you can be sure if \nthings do not go well in Hong Kong, any possibility of talks with \nTaiwan on reunification will continue to remain remote for the \nforeseeable future. Finally, the success or failure of the Hong Kong \ntransition will have a substantial impact on United States-Chinese \nbilateral relations, as well as on the worldwide perception of China.\n  Having outlined the reasons for my optimism, I must now explain why I \ntemper that optimism with a healthy dose of caution. I am not sure, Mr. \nPresident, that the leadership in Beijing understands what it takes to \nnurture the robust and thriving socioeconomic system of Hong Kong, \nparticularly the relationship between the political and economic \nspheres. I am not sure that the Chinese leadership will necessarily \nfavor their economic interests over political or perceived security \ninterests, if the two sets of interests collide.\n  The record of the period of preparation for reversion is mixed. Hong \nKong continues to thrive economically and business confidence remains \nhigh. China has agreed to Hong Kong's continued membership in \ninternational institutions as a separate entity and to the continuation \nof Hong Kong's experienced and professional civil service. On the other \nhand, China's decision to replace the elected legislature, Legco, with \nan appointed provisional legislature and certain statements by Chinese \nofficials concerning definition of freedom of the press have caused \nconsiderable unease among Hong Kong's democratic political \norganizations, in the United States and in Britain.\n  The great unanswered question is whether the Chinese leadership will \nbe willing and able to effectively implement the one country-two \nsystems model, preserving Hong Kong's economic prosperity as well as \nthe political freedoms the people began to enjoy under British rule. If \nalternatively, they begin to roll back the political freedoms and \nindividual liberties, in my view, the economy will not be immune, and \nthey may well end up sacrificing that fabled golden goose.\n  We may not know the answer to that question for several years. As I \nsaid earlier, the eyes of the world will be on Hong Kong next week. \nBut, those eyes will not be taken off Hong Kong on July 2. You can be \nsure the world will continue to watch China's stewardship of Hong Kong \nwith intense interest for many years.\n  And, we shouldn't just watch. The United States should do everything \nit can to support the people of Hong Kong. The United States should \nencourage China to see and understand that its own interests are best \nserved by maintaining true autonomy for Hong Kong. Anything less would \nbe a failure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6783-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6783-S6784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WILL ISEA PART WAYS WITH THE NEA?\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know that all of us agree there is no \ngreater national treasure this Nation has than our children. Nurturing \nand encouraging them to live up to their potential is one of the most \nimportant things we can do. That is why our educational system must be \nthe best it can be and our Nation's educators must be the best they can \nbe. But there is something that I believe all the members of congress \nneed to be aware of because it may have a profound and lasting effect \non educators throughout the country. I am referring to the ongoing \nmerger talks between the National Education Association and the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers.\n  This matter is of prime importance to NEA members across the United \nStates and I know it is of tremendous importance to the Iowa State \nEducation Association. It is disturbing that many members of the NEA \nare not aware of this because this is not just joining of two teachers' \norganizations. Given the AFT's affiliation with the AFL-CIO and the \napparent willingness of the NEA to accede to the demands of the AFT. \nShould the merger go through, this new organization would be a member \nof the AFL-CIO, which could have tremendous policy implications for the \nlargest organization representing educators. For that reason, I urge \nother members of congress to read the article I am submitting for \nconsideration.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   Will ISEA Part Ways With the NEA?\n\n                          (By James Flansburg)\n\n       The Iowa State Education Association is thinking about \n     dropping its affiliation with the National Education \n     Association.\n       At ISEA's annual meeting in Ames in early April, a number \n     of members said they fear that the NEA is moving toward a \n     militant unionism that could severely harm professionalism in \n     teaching.\n       The course being followed by the NEA would take away the \n     independence of local and State affiliates, while, at the \n     same time, putting them deeply into partisan politics and \n     formal efforts to control local school boards and policies.\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\n       ISEA represents about 35,000 Iowa teachers, and a vast \n     majority of them have misgivings over terms of a proposed \n     merger between NEA and the late Albert Shanker's American \n     Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.\n       Critics of the proposed merger contend that, more than an \n     endeavor to improve the lot of teachers, it's a surreptitious \n     effort aimed at strengthening the labor movement and \n     rebuilding the Democratic Party.\n       NEA has a membership of about 2.2 million and AFT about \n     800,000, but the merger terms being pushed by NEA's national \n     leaders endorse AFT's way of doing business instead of the \n     more moderate approach of the traditional NEA.\n       An indication of that came in a February speech by NEA \n     President Robert Chase at a National Press Club luncheon.\n       ``I came here this afternoon to introduce the new National \n     Education Association--the new union we are striving to \n     create in public education,'' he said.\n       Chase called for ``building an entirely new union-\n     management relationship in public education.''\n       No one knows more than teachers what schools need, he said: \n     ``higher academic standards; stricter discipline; an end to \n     social promotions; less bureaucracy; more resources where \n     they count, in the classroom; schools that are richly \n     connected to parents and to the communities that surround \n     them.''\n       ``To this end,'' he continued ``we aim not so much to \n     redirect the NEA, as to reinvent it.\n       ``The new direction . . . is about action. It is about \n     changing how each of our local affiliates does business, \n     changing how they bargain, changing what issues they put on \n     the table, changing the ways they help their members to \n     become the best teachers they can be.''\n       The union's goal? ``An agreement that allows teachers, in \n     effect, to co-manage the school district.''\n       Terms of the NEA-AFT merger would make the new organization \n     a member of the AFL-CIO, with the power to override the \n     concerns of local and State affiliates.\n       Such things as student welfare and professional teachers' \n     concerns and local school conditions could be lost in the \n     dust of battle over union politics, local and national, and \n     wages, hours and working conditions.\n       Local concerns would come behind the union's national \n     priorities. A community might find itself held hostage by \n     national union goals that have nothing to do with the \n     community itself.\n       The new national organization would have the power to take \n     control of local and state organizations for refusing to \n     follow the national organization's policy and political \n     lines.\n       In effect, it would have the power to trample the \n     professional and ethical considerations that have led the \n     huge majority of teachers in Iowa and the nation to join a \n     professional association such as ISEA rather than a local of \n     the AFT.\n       The Iowa and New Jersey state affiliates of NEA have been \n     the most vocal critics of the merger terms, which seem \n     basically dictated by the AFT's power sources in New York and \n     other big urban centers.\n       Although a substantial majority of teachers across the \n     country may oppose merger terms, top NEA officials and \n     staffers have the power to bring it off.\n       That's because a number of state organizations are \n     financially dependent on NEA and have little choice except to \n     do its bidding.\n       ISEA, in contrast, is not financially dependent on NEA. But \n     it might have to drop its affiliation with NEA to avoid being \n     taken over by the newly merged organization.\n       So the ISEA has no alternative but to think about and start \n     making contingency plans to cancel its NEA affiliation.\n       The details of that dominated a number of private \n     discussions at the ISEA's delegate assembly at the Hilton \n     Coliseum at Ames in April.\n       In most places, the merger seems a well-kept secret.\n       The idea is to keep the implications of the merger from the \n     teachers in the states where local organizations and their \n     leaders are beholden to NEA and AFT leaders.\n       ISEA has kept Iowa teachers up to date on the merger talks, \n     and has advocated that other state organizations mirror the \n     effort.\n       ``The more information that comes out on the proposed \n     merger, the more the membership seems disinclined to do it,'' \n     said one person who has been following the merger talks.\n       It's probably not hard to find people who would dismiss all \n     this as intramural arm wrestling between two unions.\n       That may well be. For the public, it may not make any \n     difference which view prevails.\n       I've fought with ISEA over the years, and have been soundly \n     denounced by dozens of teachers for dismissing it as little \n     more than a trade union.\n       Whatever. If I were an Iowa teacher, I'd be against the \n     merger because it surely would take away all hopes of the \n     organization ever becoming a professional association that \n     cared about anything except wages and hours.\n       On a practical basis, moreover, a merger would take away \n     the implicit threat that many teachers' groups now are able \n     to use.\n       Deal with the moderate ISEA or its equivalent, they lead \n     the school boards and others to believe, or you may end up \n     with the blood-letting unionism of the AFT.\n       On the other hand, I'd choose the AFT's militance before \n     I'd relegate Iowa teachers to the kind of second-class \n     citizenship--lots of respect and no money and no say about \n     their working conditions--they suffered under before they \n     acquired the ability to collectively bargain with the school \n     districts about 25 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6783-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997 AND MEDICARE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with Wednesday's passage of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, the Senate with some trepidation, has \ntaken a number of courageous steps toward ensuring long-term solvency \nof the Medicare Program.\n  Specifically, I believe that the adoption of means testing of \nMedicare premiums moves us in the right direction toward the long-term \nsolvency of this critically important program. It is important to \nremember that this provision will affect only those seniors with \nindividual annual incomes over $50,000 and married seniors with incomes \nabove $75,000, on a sliding-scale basis. While some tried to portray \nthis provision as a retreat from protecting our Nation's seniors, I \nview it as a step toward ensuring that our seniors will be well served \nfor a long time to come. The adoption of this provision simply says \nthat those Americans who can afford to contribute a little more for \ntheir health care should do so. Such a measure is surely needed if we \nare to sustain the safety net that Medicare provides to millions of \nsenior citizens.\n  While I supported that particular part of the bill, I must share my \ndeep concern over other provisions that I feel go too far. I find \nparticularly unacceptable the provision which will raise the age at \nwhich individuals are eligible to receive Medicare from 65 to 67. The \nlikelihood of these seniors finding affordable private insurance is \nslim--many will be forced to forego coverage. At a time when the number \nof uninsured individuals in this country is growing and employer-\nsponsored insurance is declining, I find it astonishing that some would \nchoose to exacerbate the current problem further with this measure.\n  I also opposed a provision that will require the poorest and sickest \nseniors to pay up to $700 a year in home health costs. One-quarter of \nthe home health users are over 85; 43 percent have incomes below \n$10,000. Forcing the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries to bear \nthis significant financial burden under the guise of addressing the \nlong-term financial challenges of this program is indefensible.\n  Because of these concerns, I was unable to support this bill. It is \nmy sincere hope, however, that these issues will be resolved in \nconference and that ultimately we will pass into law a measure that \ntruly will protect our Nation's seniors and the vital safety net that \nMedicare provides to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6784-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6784-S6785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AN INDEPENDENCE DAY TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today so that this great \nbody may momentarily reflect upon the importance of our upcoming Fourth \nof July celebration.\n  Over 200 years ago, this country began a historic experiment. Our \nFounding Fathers were told it would fail. Yet, after many trials and \ntribulations, the United States of America stands, it can fairly be \nargued, as the greatest Nation in the history of the world. \nIndependence Day is our annual celebration of this achievement.\n  Yet, we must have the courage and honesty to admit that we are not \nall that we hope to be. We have much work to do, and we have many \ndreams to make a reality. This is our American journey. And let us not \nforget the debt we owe to those who sacrificed to make this journey \npossible, the men and women who have stood sentry as our country \nmarched to greatness. Today, they protect the finest democracy the \nworld has ever known and keep watch around the globe. They are a beacon \nof hope, freedom, and justice to all the world's nations. Today, we \ntrumpet the personal courage of our forefathers and the continuing \nsacrifices of the members of our armed services.\n  Who are these veterans and service members? We all know them. He was \nyour friend in school. She was the kid next door. You go to church with \nthem, and you pass them in the grocery store. They are Americans just \nlike you and\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\nme, but when our Nation called, they willingly put themselves in harm's \nway. We asked them to serve their country and they obliged us. They \nhave made this celebration possible.\n  Many of these regular Americans found themselves in extraordinary \ncircumstances. They were only expected to do their duty, but they found \nthe strength to do more. It is for these uncommon displays of valor \nthat we have reserved the Congressional Medal of Honor. It is the \nhighest honor which we can bestow on a member of the Armed Forces, and \nit is but a small demonstration of our gratitude for their acting above \nand beyond the call of duty.\n  The men who have earned this award do not ask for recognition or \nacclaim. They believe they were only doing their jobs. They consider \nthemselves ordinary soldiers, sailors, and airmen. But, we call them \nheroes. I dedicate this day to them, and I humbly thank them for their \nspecial sacrifice to guarantee the privileges we too often take for \ngranted.\n  I am proud to say that Alabama is home to 27 of these great \nAmericans. Seven of these Alabama Congressional Medal of Honor winners \nare still alive today. Henry Eugene ``Red'' Erwin, Robert Lewis Howard, \nWilliam Robert Lawley, Jr., Ola Lee Mize, Michael J. Novolsel, James \nMichael Sprayberry, and Harold Edward ``Speedy'' Wilson all have \ndifferent heroic tales but common heroic traits. They steeled \nthemselves with tremendous gallantry and fought without regard for \ntheir safety. From where did this courage come? For some, it was their \nloyalty to a fellow serviceman. For others, it was the strength of \ntheir convictions. And most certainly, it was done with God's help.\n  Let us today take a moment to congratulate each veteran we know for a \njob well done and come before them with a spirit of the humblest \ngratitude as we enjoy the bounty of this great, independent Nation. For \nwe are the Nation that people in every corner of the world wish to call \ntheir own. We are a people who will not stop short of greatness, a \nnation who earns her prosperity with the labor of her citizens, and the \nland of opportunity whose hand extends for both rich and poor alike. We \nneed not only be proud of our veterans but also of every citizen who \nholds the same ideals and dreams for America. She is great because of \nthe businessmen who fuel her economy, the religious leaders who guide \nher morals, the farmers who provide her bountiful sustenance, and the \nmany other Americans who are free to fulfill their dreams each day.\n  God bless those who have stood and fought on her behalf and, most of \nall, God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6784-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JAMES S. TODD, M.D.\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. \nJames S. Todd, executive vice president and chief executive officer of \nthe American Medical Association from 1990 until 1996.\n  Dr. Todd was a dynamic leader and advocate for physicians and \npatients throughout the country. His advice and example were invaluable \nto lawmakers in Washington and to his peers throughout the Nation.\n  He steered the AMA through a time of stress and change in American \nmedicine, and made great strides in preparing the AMA to lead the \nmedical profession into the next century. But, more than anything, Dr. \nTodd loved his profession. He called medicine ``the most demanding, \nregarding, and enjoyable profession there could possibly be.''\n  One of Dr. Todd's many accomplishments included guiding the American \nMedical Association through the implementation of a dramatic revision \nin the Medicare payment system. His efforts changed the old \n``reasonable and customary fee'' basis to a system that takes into \naccount the resources that doctors bring to their profession, including \neducation, and training.\n  Dr. Todd worked aggressively with a coalition of companies providing \nprofessional liability insurance for physicians, on ways to curb the \nescalating cost of malpractice insurance. He was deeply involved in \ndrafting the guidelines for the practice of various medical specialties \nto reduce the number of errors committed by doctors.\n  As executive vice president, Dr. Todd also oversaw preparations for \nthe establishment of the National Patient Safety Foundation. Its chief \nmission is to protect patients by identifying and correcting errors in \nmedical systems, notably in the hospital system.\n  The physicians and patients of America alike have lost a friend and \nchampion. We will miss Dr. Todd's spirit, integrity, and love for \nmedicine.\n  Born in 1931, Dr. Todd graduated cum laude from Harvard College and \nHarvard Medical School. He interned and served his residency in surgery \nat Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, becoming \nchief resident in 1963. He was a Diplomate of the American Board of \nSurgery and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. He was in \nprivate practice many years in New Jersey.\n  Dr. Todd, who retired in 1996 after 6 yeas as executive vice-\npresident, was first elected a member of the board of trustees in 1980. \nHe became senior deputy executive vice president in 1985, and was named \nexecutive vice president in 1990.\n  Dr. Todd is survived by his wife, Marjorie Patricia Thorn Todd, and \nhis son, Kendall Scott Todd.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6785-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6785-S6786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CHANGES TO THE BUDGET RESOLUTION DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS, \n    APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES, AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE \n                               ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I wholeheartedly endorse the confirmation \nof Kathryn O'Leary Higgins as Deputy Secretary of Labor. Kitty Higgins \nis the right person with the right experience at the right time. As \nchief of staff for former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, she showed that \nshe knows how to pull the levers, she knows how to motivate people, she \nknows how the Labor Department works and she knows how to make the \nDepartment work for people.\n  I've known and admired Kitty Higgins for years. She is the kind of \nperson we need more of in Government. She's intelligent and efficient \nand tenacious. She's idealistic and pragmatic. And, if that's not \nenough, she's from South Dakota. In fact, she is the highest-ranking \nSouth Dakotan in the administration.\n  Kitty Higgins has spent her entire career in public service. For the \nlast 2 years, she has served as Assistant to the President and Cabinet \nSecretary in the White House. Before that, she was Bob Reich's chief of \nstaff at Labor. She is a former administrative assistant to Congressman \nSander Levin and a former minority staff director for the Senate Labor \nand Human Resources Committee under Senator Kennedy. In addition, she \nhas served as the former assistant director for domestic policy during \nthe Carter administration and a former Manpower specialist with the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  She understands the executive branch of Government, the House and the \nSenate. More importantly, she understands what each of us needs to be \nable to work in good faith with the others to get results.\n  There is one other chapter in Kitty Higgins life that I believe makes \nher the right person at the right time. Kitty Higgins started her \nworking life at the Department of Labor as a clerk-typist. When her two \nsons were still young, her husband, Bill, died. She raised her sons as \na single mother. She knows what it's like to be stretched thin between \nwork and home. She understands the pressures that so many families are \nunder today and she is determined to help alleviate those pressures for \nother working parents.\n  The national economy is the best its been in years. The deficit is \ndown, interest rates are down. The stock market is up, as well as \nemployment and business investment and home ownership and virtually \nevery other economic indicator that ought to be up. But there are still \npeople left out of this recovery. Making sure that working families \nbenefit from this economic recovery--keeping the American dream alive--\nis the most important thing this Congress can do. And it is the most \nimportant thing the Labor Department can do. Kitty Higgins has the \nright qualities and the right background to help both institutions live \nup to that responsibility. I wish her the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6787-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is very powerful, and I \nurge my colleagues to take the opportunity to read this article, \nbecause I think it will affect their lives also.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\n          [From the National Right to Life News, May 23, 1997]\n\n                 A Brief That Changed Our Lives Forever\n\n                           (By Rick Santorum)\n\n       On September 26, 1996, the Senate voted to sustain \n     President Clinton's veto of the partial-Birth Abortion Ban. I \n     led the fight to override the veto on the floor of the \n     Senate.\n       Central to the debate was the assertion by opponents of the \n     ban that this procedure is necessary later in pregnancy in \n     cases when a severe fetal defect is discovered. I was told \n     that I could not understand what these women, who experienced \n     this procedure, has gone through. ``It has never touched your \n     life,'' one senator said.\n       This is a story of how just one week after that vote, it \n     did.\n       We had been through the joyous sonogram routine before--the \n     technician would turn out the lights, spread gel on Karen's \n     growing adbomen, and then right there on the screen in front \n     of our eyes we would get the first glimpse of our baby--a \n     fuzzy, back-and-white picture that told us all was well.\n       This time, however, was different. Sitting in the darkened \n     room explaining what we were seeing to our three children--\n     ages 5, 3, and 1--everything seemed fine. But the woman with \n     the instrument was strangely quiet, examining and re-\n     examining a dark circle on the screen. The doctor entered and \n     silently repeated the routine. Finally, we were coldly given \n     the verdict: ``Your child has a fatal defect and is going to \n     die.''\n       It's not that the world stopped, nor that is moved in slow \n     motion, it was just that the world took on a new meaning. \n     Suddenly, our child whom we loved, prayed for, dreamed about, \n     and longed to meet was diagnosed with a fatal condition. \n     Through our tears erupted the most basis of all parental \n     emotions--we were going to save our child.\n       I took the kids out into the hallway to the phone and \n     called Dr. N. Scott Adzick, who is the surgeon in chief of \n     pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. Six months \n     earlier, I had gone to Children's Hospital and seen a world I \n     had never known existed--a world of Dr. Adzick's creation--a \n     world of surgery and care for children still in their \n     mother's womb. I remembered his amazing skill and how I \n     sensed an aura of peace and a certainty of purpose \n     surrounding his mission.\n       I frantically described what had transpired and asked if he \n     could help. Before he peppered me with questions, he calmly \n     reassured me that all was not lost. He had seen cases like \n     this before and knew immediately that it had to be post-\n     urethral valve syndrome. Scott's principal concern had to do \n     with the absence of fluid in the amniotic sac, which meant \n     that our baby likely had a complete obstruction of his \n     urinary tract--in short, a very rare condition that carried \n     with it a 100% mortality rate if untreated.\n       Not typically understood is that the element comprising the \n     amniotic fluid encompassing the baby during development is \n     the baby's urine. The fluid not only provides a barrier of \n     protection from outside trauma, but it is necessary in the \n     development of the baby's lungs. Without the fluid his lungs \n     would not develop enough for him to survive outside the womb. \n     In addition, this condition would cause the kidneys to cease \n     functioning.\n       Dr. Adzick arranged for tests to be done the next day at \n     The Pennsylvania Hospital. The initial results did not look \n     good. Seated in front of our second sonogram machine in as \n     many days, Dr. Adzick and Dr. Alan Donnenfeld, an ob/gyn and \n     perinatologist, told us that the kidneys looked like their \n     function was severely compromised. Dr. Adzick told us that \n     though he, too, was discouraged, there was an occasion where \n     he had seen damaged kidneys have sufficient levels of \n     function, enabling a baby to survive until a transplant.\n       We adjourned to a supply room next to the treatment area. \n     The purpose of the meeting was to discuss options. Dr. \n     Donnenfeld took the lead, saying that things were grave, and \n     presenting us with three options. ``Your first option is to \n     terminate the pregnancy.'' As the word pregnancy left his \n     lips the room instantly went dark. The doctor quickly reached \n     up and turned on the light, which was on a timer. Through \n     nervous and awkward laughter I said, ``I guess that answers \n     your question.''\n       We knew that abortion was a legal option, it just wasn't a \n     sane one. It was inconceivable to us as parents to kill our \n     baby because he wasn't perfect or because he might not live a \n     long life. While we couldn't look into his eyes or hold him \n     in our arms, he was no less our child than our other three \n     children. And we loved him every bit as much. He was our gift \n     from God from the moment we found out Karen was pregnant. In \n     our mind, from that time on our job as parents of this tiny \n     life was to do everything we could to nurture him through \n     life. Karen and I have this saying, ``life is about being \n     there,'' and we were going to be there for our baby.\n       The second option was to do nothing. In this case our son \n     would live only as long as he was in the womb. While in the \n     womb our baby's lungs and kidneys were not necessary for him \n     to survive--Karen was performing those functions for him.\n       The third option would entail several tests and possibly \n     intrauterine surgery. Karen's immediate response was to do \n     whatever it took to save our son.\n       Our son went through two days of tests to determine kidney \n     function. If there was no kidney function there would be no \n     point in proceeding further--he would not develop enough in \n     the womb to survive outside. The first day the test results \n     were so bad that we discussed whether it was worth going \n     through a second painful day for Karen. Dr. Adzick said we \n     needed a miracle overnight to get those kidneys to work \n     better.\n       We prayed more than I can remember for our son, who we \n     named that day Gabriel Michael, after the great Archangels. \n     The next day our prayers were answered with a miraculous \n     improvement; the kidneys were not just okay, but functioning \n     normally! We could now do the surgery that would save his \n     life.\n       Had this occurred in our lives years earlier, I don't know \n     how we would have dealt with it. But in the past several \n     years we had found a closer relationship with God.\n       Shortly after being elected to the Senate, Sen. Don Nickles \n     of Oklahoma invited me to come to a small Bible study. I went \n     that day and I have attended faithfully ever since. I found \n     the piece that fit what C.S. Lewis has called that ``great, \n     God-shaped hole in our soul.'' I found a new and better \n     relationship with God. And I learned one of life's best \n     lessons: that I can't do anything alone, that I had to give \n     up my illusion of control and put my trust in God.\n       Karen's story is little different than mine. For the past \n     several years Karen has pursued her faith on an ever \n     ascending level. Through prayer, studying the Bible and \n     Catholic catechism, and now attending daily mass, she too \n     learned to try to give up her control and rely on God's \n     grace.\n       Thanks to Lloyd Ogilvie, the Chaplain of the Senate, our \n     parish priests and the prayers of our friends, this crisis \n     was not so much a ``faith check'' for us as it was a time of \n     reassurance. For we knew that no matter what happened, God \n     held all of us in his hands. With that knowledge there is a \n     peace beyond human understanding.\n       The surgical procedure to drain the urine into the amniotic \n     sac, in an effort to create the proper fluid environment for \n     Gabriel, was scheduled at The Pennsylvania Hospital with Dr. \n     Bud Wiener. Dr. Wiener had done more of these procedures than \n     anyone else on the East Coast and had pioneered the plastic \n     tube that would be inserted in Gabriel's bladder to drain the \n     urine.\n       The idea that surgery on a child in only his 20th week of \n     life inside the womb boggles the mind. And watching Dr. \n     Wiener at work was something to behold as he guided the tube \n     into place. We would check in three days to see if the tube \n     was working, and of course there is the customary surgical \n     concern about infection.\n       Two days later while we were at home in Pittsburgh, Karen \n     began feeling both chills and cramping--the chills were a \n     sign of infection and the cramping was the beginning of \n     labor.\n       Hoping desperately that it was food poisoning or the flu, \n     Karen fought to hold it together. A call to Dr. Donnenfeld \n     was met with an order to rush to Magee Women's Hospital.\n       There a doctor performed another sonogram. What we saw made \n     this moment even more tragic. The fuzzy picture on the screen \n     showed an active baby jumping and moving freely in a sac of \n     amniotic fluid. The procedure had worked like a charm, but \n     there was infection.\n       Karen was seized with horrible chills. Huddled under a \n     dozen blankets her temperature soared to over 105. By this \n     point there was little that could be done. Intra-uterine \n     infections are untreatable as long as the source of the \n     infection--the amniotic sac--is in place. We knew that at \n     20 weeks [4\\1/2\\ months], Gabriel could not survive \n     outside the womb. But, unless the amniotic sac and thereby \n     our son was delivered, Karen would soon die, and Gabriel \n     with her.\n       Karen was given an antibiotic which reduced the fever, made \n     her comfortable and took her out of immediate danger. She \n     clung to the baby with all her strength, but nature was \n     relentless. Soon the labor intensified--the body had \n     identified the source of the problem and took measures to \n     eliminate the infection. She did everything she could to \n     delay the inevitable, putting her own life in danger in the \n     process. I talked to everyone I knew to see if there was \n     something that could be done. There was no answer to be \n     found.\n       Here again the doctors told us that abortion was a legal \n     option to protect Karen's health and possibly save her life. \n     But with the support of Dr. Cynthia Simms we arrived at \n     another way--a way that gave our son the love and respect he \n     deserved, and gave Karen and me a gift that we will forever \n     cherish.\n       Our call to Dr. Adzick, who had become a supportive force \n     for us throughout, put an end to our search for alternatives. \n     He told Karen that Gabriel would have to be delivered. I \n     thanked God for the presence of Karen's parents who provided \n     so much love and support and our friend Monsignor Bill Kerr \n     who was also there providing spiritual guidance.\n       We knew the end was very near, so we tried to pack a \n     lifetime of love into those few hours. I put my hands on \n     Karen's abdomen. We prayed and we cried. We told him how much \n     we loved him--how much we will miss mothering and fathering \n     him, and how his brothers and sisters will miss his presence \n     in their lives.\n       Within hours, at 12:45 a.m., our son was born. He was a \n     beautiful, fully formed creation--a small, pink package of \n     joy, sorrow, hope, and questions. We bundled him up and put a \n     little hat on his head to keep him warm. We held him, sang to \n     him and cried\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\n     for him. He was too small to make a sound, but he spoke so \n     powerfully to our hearts. His eyes never opened to see his \n     mommy and daddy, but he allowed us to see in him the face of \n     God.\n       Two hours later, he died in my arms.\n       We tried to make Gabriel's short time on earth filled with \n     love, only love. We told him that soon he would experience \n     something we are striving for. He will be with God in heaven. \n     Finally, we pledged to him that we would rededicate ourselves \n     to joining him someday.\n       This is our story. The irony of finding ourselves \n     confronted with a baby with a fatal defect--when only a few \n     days before some considered the absence of such experience to \n     disqualify me from the debate on partial-birth abortion--was \n     truly overwhelming. On two occasions, we too could have \n     chosen the option to abort. We knew that Gabriel's life would \n     probably be measured in minutes and hours, not in years and \n     decades. We chose to let Gabriel live and die in the fullness \n     of time--being held and loved and nurtured by two parents who \n     loved him.\n       We wouldn't have traded the gift of those two hours with \n     our son for anything in the world. And we know that he \n     wouldn't have either.\n       In the midst of the debate that fall, worried about the \n     impact of the gruesome description of the procedure, one of \n     the senators opposing the ban said that a partial-birth \n     abortion, like a simple appendectomy was bloody--that was \n     just the nature of the event.\n       The Washington Post described what happened next.\n       ``Republican Sen. Rick Santorum turned to face the \n     opposition and in a high, pleading voice cried out, `Where do \n     we draw the line? Some people have likened this procedure to \n     an appendectomy. That's not an appendix,' he shouted, \n     pointing to a drawing of a fetus. `That is not a blob of \n     tissue. It is a baby. It's a baby.'\n       ``And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in \n     one of those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like \n     a stage set, with its small wooden desks somehow too small \n     for the matters at hand, the cry of a baby pierced the room, \n     echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.\n       ``No one mentioned the cry, but for a few seconds no one \n     spoke at all.''\n       A freak occurrence--a visitor's baby was crying in the \n     hallway as a door to the floor was opened and few seconds \n     later closed.\n       A freak occurrence perhaps--or maybe, a cry from the son \n     whose voice we never heard, but whose life has forever \n     changed ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/27/senate-section/article/S6790-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE RETURNED TO CALENDAR--S. 949\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO SELF-EMPLOYMENT \n                   TAX OF LIMITED PARTNERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Department of the Treasury issued Proposed \n     Regulation 1.1402(a)-2 in January 1997 relating to the \n     definition of a limited partner for self-employment tax \n     purposes under section 1402(a)(13) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code;\n       (2) since 1977, section 1402(a)(13) of such Code has \n     provided that--\n       (A) a limited partner's net earnings from self-employment \n     include only guaranteed payments made to the individual for \n     services actually rendered and do not include a limited \n     partner's distributive share of the income or loss of the \n     partnership, and\n       (B) a general partner's net earnings from self-employment \n     include the partner's distributive share;\n       (3) the proposed regulations provide generally--\n       (A) that a partner will not be treated as a limited partner \n     if the individual--\n       (i) has personal liability for partnership debts,\n       (ii) has authority to contract on behalf of the \n     partnership, or\n       (iii) participates in the partnership's trade or business \n     for more than 500 hours during the taxable year;\n       (B) that an individual meeting any one of these three \n     criteria will be treated as a general partner, and net \n     earnings from self-employment will include the partner's \n     distributive share of partnership income and loss, resulting \n     in substantial tax liability because there is a 15.3 percent \n     tax on self-employment income below $65,400 in 1997 and a 2.9 \n     percent hospital insurance tax on self-employment income \n     above that amount;\n       (4) certain types of entities, such as limited liability \n     companies and limited liability partnerships, were not widely \n     used at the time the present rule relating to limited \n     partners was enacted, and that the proposed regulations \n     attempt to address owners of such entities;\n       (5) the Senate is concerned that the proposed change in the \n     treatment of individuals who are limited partners under \n     applicable State law exceeds the regulatory authority of the \n     Treasury Department and would effectively change the law \n     administratively without congressional action; and\n       (6) the proposed regulations address and raise significant \n     policy issues and the proposed definition of a limited \n     partner may have a substantial impact on the tax liability of \n     certain individuals and may also affect individuals' \n     entitlement to social security benefits.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue \n     Service should withdraw Proposed Regulation 1.1402(a)-2 which \n     imposes a tax on limited partners; and\n       (2) Congress, not the Department of the Treasury or the \n     Internal Revenue Service, should determine the tax law \n     governing self-employment income for limited partners.\n                     Subtitle E--Foreign Provisions\n\n                       PART I--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 741.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REFORM OF THE \n                   INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (``tax code'') is \n     unnecessarily complex, having grown from 14 pages at its \n     inception to 3,458 pages by 1995;\n       (2) this complexity resulted in taxpayers spending about \n     5,300,000,000 hours and $225,000,000,000 trying to comply \n     with the tax code in 1996;\n       (3) the current congressional budgetary process is weighted \n     too heavily toward tax increases, as evidenced by the fact \n     that since 1954 there have been 27 major bills enacted that \n     increased Federal income taxes and only 9 bills that \n     decreased Federal income taxes, 3 of which were de minimis \n     decreases;\n       (4) the tax burden on working families has reached an \n     unsustainable level, as evidenced by the fact that in 1948 \n     the average American family with children paid only 4.3 \n     percent of its income to the Federal Government in direct \n     taxes and today the average family pays about 25 percent;\n       (5) the tax code unfairly penalizes saving and investment \n     by double taxing these activities while only taxing income \n     used for consumption once, and as a result the United States \n     has one of the lowest saving rates, at 4.7 percent, in the \n     industrialized world;\n       (6) the tax code stifles economic growth by discouraging \n     work and capital formation through excessively high tax \n     rates;\n       (7) Congress and the President have found it necessary, on \n     2 separate occasions, to enact laws to protect taxpayers from \n     the abuses of the\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\n     Internal Revenue Service and a third bill has been introduced \n     in the one hundred fifth Congress; and\n       (8) the complexity of the tax code has increased the number \n     of Internal Revenue Service employees responsible for \n     administering the tax laws to 110,000 and this costs the \n     taxpayers $9,800,000,000 each year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 needs broad-based \n     reform; and\n       (2) the President should submit to Congress a comprehensive \n     proposal to reform the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 781. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX TREATMENT OF \n                   STOCK OPTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) currently businesses can deduct the value of stock \n     options as a business expense on their income tax returns, \n     even though the stock options are not treated as an expense \n     on the books of those same businesses; and\n       (2) stock options are the only form of compensation that is \n     treated in this way.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Finance of the Senate should hold \n     hearings on the tax treatment of stock options.\n\n     SEC. 782. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ESTATE TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that whereas--\n       (1) the Federal estate tax punishes hard working small \n     business owners and discourages savings and growth;\n       (2) the Federal estate tax imposes an unfair economic \n     burden on small businesses and reduces their ability to \n     survive and compete with large corporations; and\n       (3) a reduction in Federal estate taxes for family-owned \n     farms and enterprises will help to prevent the liquidation of \n     small businesses that strengthen American communities by \n     providing jobs and security.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the estate tax relief provided in this bill is an \n     important step that will enable more family-owned farms and \n     small businesses to survive and continue to provide economic \n     security and job creation in American communities; and\n       (2) Congress should eliminate the Federal estate tax \n     liability for family-owned businesses by the end of 2002 on a \n     deficit-neutral basis.\n\n     SEC. 783. QUALIFIED GAMES OF CHANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The term ``unrelated trade or business'' \n     does not include the activity of qualified games of chance.\n       (b) Qualified Games of Chance.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term ``qualified games of chance'' means any \n     game of chance, other than provided in subsection (f), \n     conducted by an organization if--\n       (1) such organization is licensed pursuant to State law to \n     conduct such game;\n       (2) only organizations which are organized as nonprofit \n     corporations or are exempt from tax under section 501(a) may \n     be so licensed to conduct such game within the State; and\n       (3) the conduct of such game does not violate State or \n     local law.\n\n     SEC. 784. SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS KILLED \n                   IN THE LINE OF DUTY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 \n     (relating to items specifically excluded from gross income) \n     is amended by redesignating section 138 as section 139 and by \n     inserting after section 137 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 138.
