COHEN\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank all of you here. I thank our \nChaplain, Dr. Ogilvie, and I thank you, Mr. President, for the \nopportunity to present my rabbi. Youthful though he is, he is wise. I \nthink the Presiding Officer knows one does not have to have age to have \nwisdom. And we credit Rabbi Daniel Cohen with having wisdom.\n  This is an honor that I so much wanted to have bestowed upon him \nbecause he has earned the respect and the admiration of so many in our \ncongregation. I think about 800 families worship and have their \nchildren taught by Rabbi Cohen.\n  He is a native of New Jersey, as I am. And it is just an honor to \nhave him and Mrs. Cohen, who is witnessing this from the balcony, join \nus this morning.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to hear from Rabbi \nCohen.\n  I am pleased and proud to have Rabbi Daniel Cohen from my own Temple \nSharey Tefilo-Israel in South Orange, NJ here today to convene this \nsession of the Senate.\n  The fact that Rabbi Cohen is here to give this invocation means a \ngreat deal to me. It speaks to the diversity of religions and races \nthat make up this body, and this great Nation.\n  As Rabbi Cohen said, we are all privileged to live in this country. \nAnd it benefits us to work together and to use our individual talents \nto make this place as great as it can possibly be. I couldn't agree \nmore.\n  Rabbi Cohen and I have similar family backgrounds and share many \nvalues.\n  He and I are respectively the grandson and son of immigrants. We have \ngotten to where we are today by taking advantage of the opportunities \nthat were given to us, and we are both committed to giving back to the \ncommunities that treated us so well.\n  We both believe in the right and ability of all people to be accepted \nand get ahead. It is symbolic that the name of our synagogue, ``Sharey \nTefilo,'' means the ``Gates of Prayer.'' These gates of prayer to me \nrepresent open gates through which people of all faiths and backgrounds \nshould be able to pass in order to succeed, find refuge from \npersecution, or simply start a better life.\n  I want to add some quick words about Rabbi Cohen himself:\n  He grew up in Berkeley Heights, NJ.\n  He did his undergraduate work at Duke University, getting his degree \nin anthropology and religion. Some of that time he spent abroad \nstudying in Israel.\n  He went on to receive his masters in Hebrew letters from the Hebrew \nUnion College-Jewish Institute of Religion, and received his rabbinic \nordination in 1993.\n  He has been with my temple in New Jersey since his ordination, first \nas a rabbinic intern and then as the assistant rabbi. He currently \nserves as the associate rabbi of our congregation, enjoying a great \ndeal of respect from members of the temple.\n  He does a great deal of work in our synagogue with youth groups and \neducational programming, but has an exceptional ability to reach \neverybody in the congregation, both young and old.\n  I want to thank Rabbi Cohen for coming today, and I am proud to have \nbeen able to share a bit of my heritage and home State with my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8385-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8385-S8386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 2015, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 2015, an act to provide \n     for reconciliation pursuant to subsections (b)(1) and (c) of \n     section 105 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 1998.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 1 hour remaining equally \ndivided between the chairman and the ranking minority member of the \nBudget Committee.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if my friend from New Jersey has no \nobjection, why don't we just agree that time will expire promptly at \n10:15 so everybody will know the vote will start at 10:15.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will speak for a couple minutes.\n  There is a sense of the historical significance of what it is that we \nare about to do. It is not simply the accomplishment of having put in \nplace a balanced budget. It goes further than that; that is, to note \nthat this agreement has been developed, if I might use the word \n``hammered'' out, by bipartisan cooperation. My friend and colleague, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and I and \nothers, of course, labored long and hard to help present the views of \nall of our colleagues into an understanding and a package that would be \nacceptable as a consensus product.\n  So we are here at this moment, and within 1 hour it is believed that \nwe will have passed this reconciliation bill and will embark upon the \nwork of passing the second reconciliation bill which will complete the \ntask.\n  I think we have set some records here this year, not only because we \nwill have achieved a balanced budget, which is the best belief of all \nMembers here who will be supporting this, but I took a moment, I say to \nSenator Domenici, to check on where we stand with our appropriations \nbills. There were 9, I believe, that have been completed, and perhaps a \n10th one ready. That is quite fantastic, not yet August and having done \nthose.\n  I want to say to all of my colleagues, I am proud that we were able \nto get this job done under fairly stringent conditions. We do not have \nas much money as we were accustomed to having in the past, but with \nwhat we had we made it do very well. We have covered lots of things \nthat needed attention, child health care, assurance of the solvency of \nMedicare, an opportunity for kids to get an education, to be investing \nin research in our society, a number of things that are very positive \noutcomes, again, within the context of the resources we had available.\n  All Members of both parties deserve to be proud of our \naccomplishment. We have shown America something, that we can work \ntogether for the common good, and at the same time we can be fiscally \nresponsible and we can help prepare for the next century, which is \naround the corner.\n  This agreement will lead us, I think, to a positive path as we \nprepare to enter the 21st century, investing in all kinds of good \nthings, as I have said, and education, particularly, I think as the \ncornerstone for the development of our society.\n  The agreement shows that it is not inconsistent to be both fiscally \nresponsible and progressive. There is now broad consensus that we \nsimply have to live within our means, but there is also appreciation \nthat the future will not simply take care of itself. It takes work. We \nhave to prepare for it, investing to make sure that our people are \nready for it.\n  That is what we are doing in this legislation: getting our fiscal \nhouse in order. We are investing in our children. We are extending the \neducational opportunities for millions of Americans. In short, we are \ngetting ready, and our children and grandchildren will reap the rewards \nin decades ahead.\n  So, Mr. President, I am proud to be here as this balanced budget \nlegislation is approved. We want to see it get to the White House. It \nis a moment in history, and I hope it will be regarded as a very \npositive moment in the record books years from now. I am grateful and \nproud to have been a part of the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, Senator \nThurmond, has asked me if he might speak as in morning business for 3 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to do that and it \ncome out of my time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thurmond pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n111 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will save a few remarks until just \nbefore the vote. Certainly, if anybody else on our side wants to speak, \nthey are welcome. Nobody is bound to speak, but if they would like to, \nwe have 15, 20 minutes on our side.\n  I would like to make just a few comments about some of the processes \nwe have been involved in and thank a few people.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe 15 years ago that anybody assumed the \nBudget Act could be used to balance a budget as we are doing it here \ntoday. The reconciliation instruction and then the reconciliation bill \nare strange-sounding words and a strange-sounding name for a bill. But \nessentially we have, by evolution and development and some changes in \nthe law, permitted a budget resolution which does not involve the \nPresident; it involves just a majority vote in both Houses. We \npermitted it to be used to force the passage of reform legislation or \ntax bills such as the one we have before us.\n  I think everybody should recognize a couple of very interesting \nhistoric evolutions as this process developed. One is the adoption of \nthe Byrd rule by the U.S. Congress as part of the law that applies to \nthe Senate of the United States. And, obviously, one need not search as \nto where that came from. It came from Senator Robert Byrd.\n  Essentially, one of the Parliamentarians has praised it this way, \nthat the Byrd rule limits our ability to ride the budget horse into \npassing all kinds of legislation that have little to do with the \nbudget.\n  I am very pleased to say, and I was able to say to the distinguished \nSenator Byrd yesterday, that when you put a bill together as large as \nthis, with as many committees and as many innovative minds, you cannot \nhelp but try to ride the budget horse beyond what it ought to be used \nfor. There were many, many, I would say scores of legislative language \nthat violated this rule as this process was evolving and\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\nthese bills were getting developed, because the rule is a tough rule \nand it has great, great impact in that those provisions are stripped \nfrom the bill if they are subject to a Byrd rule. Then we were able to \nbring down the scope and numbers to a very, very small number that \nremained as of yesterday, and I am very pleased, working together, \neverybody has come up with the conclusion, from what I can tell, that \nwhatever Byrd rule language or violation of Byrd rule language is in \nthis bill has been thought by almost everyone to be necessary and \nsomething that we can leave in the bill. I am very pleased with that. I \nmust make sure everybody knows that there were many, many more before \nwe exerted the power and pressure of the Byrd rule. And I think that \nbodes well in terms of not abusing the process.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, again, I yield the floor. If anyone \nelse on our side would like to speak, time is available to them. I \nsuggest that if no one is speaking, the time be charged equally, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 limited tax benefits in reconciliation\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as required by the Line-Item Veto Act, \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation has informed the conferees that the \nconference report on H.R. 2015, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \ncontains one limited tax benefit. It can be found in section 5406 and \nconcerns the treatment of services performed by certain inmates. As \nrequired by the Line-Item Veto Act, section 9304 of the conference \nreport specifically designates section 5406 as a limited tax benefit \nand as such, it is therefore subject to the President's cancellation \nauthority under the Line-Item Veto Act.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today represents an enormous accomplishment \nfor me and for the Republican Party. The budget agreement now before us \nis the culmination of years of hard work and concerted effort. I want \nto especially commend Chairmen Domenici and Roth for their hard work \nand diligence. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Chairman Domenici \non the Senate Budget Committee and commend him for his extraordinary \nefforts to broker this agreement. My staff affectionately calls him \n``the legislative warrior'' and I agree. He has fought a major battle \nfor the Republican Party and the American people this year--a battle to \nbalance our Federal budget and to eliminate our Federal deficit.\n  Three years ago, as I campaigned across the State of Tennessee, I \nlistened to the concerns of the people that I met and I made some \npromises to them. These men and women were concerned about the amount \nof money they were able to bring home after Uncle Sam had taken his \nshare. They were outraged by a government that was unable to live \nwithin its means. They were worried about their retirement and the \ncontinued existence of Medicare and Social Security.\n  I promised the people of Tennessee that we would do something about \nthese concerns. I promised them that we would give them tax relief, so \nthat they would be able to keep more of what they make and decide for \nthemselves how to spend, save, or invest their hard-earned money. I \npromised them that we would pass a balanced budget--the first since \n1969--and eliminate our Federal deficit. And I promised them that we \nwould protect, preserve, and strengthen Medicare and Social Security to \nensure that these programs would still be around for their children and \ntheir children's children.\n  I am proud to be able to return to Tennessee and tell my friends, \nrelatives, and neighbors that we have made good on two of these \npromises and have taken the first steps toward fulfilling the third. \nThe bills that we will pass over the next couple of days will give \nhard-working Americans the largest tax cut that they have seen in 16 \nyears--over $90 billion. This tax relief will benefit Americans of all \nages and in all tax brackets. We have included tax credits for children \nand for education and capital gains and estate relief. Almost 80 \npercent of these benefits go to families earning less than $75,000 a \nyear.\n  Over 43 million parents will owe $500 per child less in taxes. \nTaxpaying students and nearly 5 million parents of kids in college will \nowe $1,500 less per student in taxes as a result of the college tuition \ncredit.\n  Last year, 2.4 million Tennesseans filed tax returns with the \nInternal Revenue Service. Over the last 16 years, these taxpayers have \nnot seen one tax reduction--only increases. As the cost of raising a \nfamily and sending kids to college has become increasingly expensive, \nthe value of the personal exemption has dropped dramatically. In 1948, \nthe average American family paid about 3 percent of its total income to \nthe Federal Government in taxes. Today, that family is paying closer to \n25 percent.\n\n  The Federal Government claims approximately 19 percent of every \npaycheck that an employee in Knoxville, TN who makes $22,000 a year \ntakes home. That $22,000 figure doesn't mean much to her--she sees only \n$17,820--and that's before State and local taxes take their bite. The \ntime has certainly come to give these hard-working people some much-\nneeded tax relief.\n  In addition to the $500 per child tax credit and the $1,500 college \ntuition tax credit, the tax package will cut the capital gains tax rate \nfrom 28 to 20 percent for the highest bracket and from 15 to 10 for the \nlowest. It will raise the exemption for taxable estates and family-\nowned businesses and farms. And it will expand the options for \nindividual retirement accounts.\n  Despite the belief that a capital gains tax cut is only for the rich, \nin 1995, more than 226,000 Tennesseans paid capital gains taxes to the \ntune of $2.65 million. More than half of these--160,786 to be exact--\nhad incomes of $75,000 or less. And 40,000 of those who paid tax on \ncapital gains actually had an income of less than $15,000.\n  This budget package will also balance the budget by 2002 and restore \nfiscal responsibility to our Federal Government. For years, Republicans \nhave called for a balanced budget and an end to the reckless spending \nfor which Washington to famous--or rather infamous. A balanced budget \nwill lower interest rates, and generate higher economic growth--\nincluding more jobs and lower inflation. An article in this week's \nWashington Post touted that the ``Deficit Effort Really is `a Big \nDeal'.'' Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard University economist, noted:\n\n       For every dollar that the government doesn't have to \n     borrow, there's an extra 50 cents invested in new plant and \n     equipment by American businesses. And experience shows that \n     investment eventually raises profits, wages and the U.S. \n     standard of living.\n\n  The challenge before us now is to keep the Federal budget in \nbalance--and I am committed to ensuring that we do that.\n  The third promise was one to protect Medicare and Social Security. We \nhave made a first step toward strengthening Medicare by cutting $115 \nbillion to health care providers and extending the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund for 10 years. But I remain deeply disappointed that the \nSenate-passed provisions that would have enacted structural changes in \nthe Medicare Program were excluded from this conference agreement. I \nhave spoken many times about the need for entitlement reform. And \nunfortunately, this budget does nothing to address it. If we do \nnothing, entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will \nconsume all Federal revenues by 2012--leaving not a single dollar for \nimportant Government priorities like roads, education, national \ndefense, and medical research.\n  The Medicare trust fund will become insolvent in 10 years. Real, \nstructural reforms are absolutely necessary to preserve Medicare for \nour children and our children's children. In 2010, the cash flow of the \nSocial Security trust fund turns negative and by 2029, the Social \nSecurity trust fund will be bankrupt. This must be the next priority of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  For years, our focus has been to balance the budget. Today, we have \nachieved that goal. I join with my colleagues to congratulate the \nCongress and the White House on working together, in a bipartisan \nfashion, to bring real fiscal responsibility back to Washington.\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\n  But we must look ahead to tomorrow and pay close attention to the \nimpending fiscal disaster that lies ahead if we do not make some hard \nchoices to reform our entitlement spending. Today, 200,000 Americans \nturn 65 every year. By 2011, 1.5 million Americans will turn 65 every \nyear. Today, 3.3 workers pay for the benefits that every retiree \nreceives from Medicare and Social Security. By 2025, there will be only \ntwo workers to pay for each beneficiary. It is clear that something \nmust be done.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that we have made a considerable \ndownpayment on our promises to the American people with this budget \npackage and I look forward to the challenges ahead.\n\n\n        CLARIFICATION OF TWO PROVISIONS IN THE BUDGET AGREEMENT\n\n  MR. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to clarify two items of \nconcern in the budget agreement.\n  Last year, when Congress passed the welfare reform bill, it granted \nStates the authority to deny State and local public benefits to certain \nimmigrants. Included in that bill was a provision that exempts \nnonprofit charitable organizations from verifying immigration status.\n  The conference report on the budget bill explicitly grants the States \nauthority to require immigrants to provide proof of eligibility for \nState and local public benefits. This new provision allows States to \n``require an applicant for State and local public benefits (as defined \nin section 411(c)) to provide proof of eligibility''. Section 411(c) \nrefers to the definition of State and local benefits in title IV of the \nwelfare bill.\n  It is my understanding that this provision does not grant the States \nauthority to require charities to conduct immigration verification for \nState and local public benefits. The nonprofit exemption in section 432 \nof the welfare bill explains that a nonprofit charity, in providing \n``any State or local public benefit (as defined in Section 411(c)) * * \n* is not required under this title to determine, verify, or otherwise \nrequire proof of eligibility * * *.'' As Congress has plenary power in \nthe immigration arena, it seems that States may not add a requirement \nfor charities to verify immigration status without express authority \nfrom Congress. States were not granted that authority in last year's \nwelfare bill, and States are not granted that authority in this budget \nbill.\n  Since the clarification of State verification authority is being \ninserted into title IV of the welfare reform law, the nonprofit \nexemption applies. Authority, if any, to require charities to conduct \nimmigration verification would have to be found in a distinct, express \ngrant of Federal authority outside title IV of the welfare bill.\n  I would also like to clarify that under the conference report on the \nbudget bill, refugees, asylees, and certain other immigrants currently \nreceiving SSI will not lose their eligibility for SSI.\n  Section 402 of last year's welfare law instituted a bar on SSI for \ncertain qualified aliens. Section 402(a)(2)(A) created an exception to \nthis bar for refugees. Refugees can receive SSI benefits for five years \nfrom the date they are admitted into the United States.\n  The conference report on the budget bill modifies these provisions in \ntwo ways. First, the conference report extends the refugee exception \nfrom 5 years to 7 years. An additional, separate provision of the \nconference report, section 402(a)(2)(E), creates a new exception to the \nbar on SSI benefits which reinstates SSI benefits for qualified aliens \nreceiving benefits on August 22, 1996.\n  For refugees, these are two independent sources of SSI eligibility. \nIt is my understanding that refugees not receiving SSI benefits on \nAugust 22, 1996 will qualify for SSI through section 402(a)(2)(A) for a \nperiod of 7 years. Refugees already receiving SSI benefits on August \n22, 1996 will be eligible to keep those benefits, even after their 7 \nyears has expired, under section 402(a)(2)(E) without regard to the 7 \nyear cutoff.\n  Thank you for letting me briefly clarify those two points, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n\n                         TITLE XI OF H.R. 2015\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and the distinguished majority leader, on the \ninclusion of a little noticed provision in this conference report. I am \nreferring to the National Capital Revitalization Act. This provision \nis, in my view, an important step in cleaning up the District of \nColumbia and making our Nation's Capital City once again the safe and \nbeautiful place we all expect it to be.\n  Among other important changes, this bill completely overhauls the \nDistrict of Columbia's broken criminal justice system. If implemented \nproperly, I am certain that this legislation will result in a criminal \njustice system for the District of Columbia that is fairer for the \nvictims of crime, that appropriately punishes criminals, and that \nincarcerates criminals in a secure, appropriate environment.\n  I see that my colleagues from Kansas and Florida are on the floor, \nand I would like to commend them for their hard work on this issue, as \nwell. They have worked tirelessly to see these provisions included in \nthe budget reconciliation conference report.\n  Mr. President, I am committed, as I know my colleagues are, to \nensuring that these provisions are implemented in the most effective \nmanner. A number of the provisions in the National Capital \nRevitalization Act, particularly as they relate to, among other things, \nthe transfer of District of Columbia corrections functions to the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons and the assumption by the U.S. Parole \nCommission of parole functions of the District government are issues \nwithin the authorizing jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. I would \nlike to ask my colleagues, the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from \nFlorida, if this is their understanding, as well.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Utah for his kind remarks, \nand note that I agree with his assessment. I look forward to working \nwith him and the Judiciary Committee on the important work of ensuring \neffective implementation of the National Capital Revitalization Act.\n  Mr. MACK. I also appreciate the comments of the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and agree with him that the Judiciary Committee \nhas jurisdiction over a number of these matters. I share Senator \nHatch's commitment to a safe and beautiful national capital, and look \nforward to working with him to implement this important act.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their comments, \nand look forward to working with them as implementation of the National \nCapital Revitalization Act goes forward.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am compelled to vote against H.R. \n2015. This legislation will put us on a track to reduce the deficit. It \nwill save us more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It puts \nbinding caps on spending increases, so that a super majority will have \nto vote to increase spending. The bill continues the pay-as-you-go \nprovisions of past budget deals, so that any new spending has to be \noffset by other spending reductions. It seeks to make Medicare solvent \nfor the next 10 years and creates a National Bipartisan Commission on \nthe Future of Medicare to address the long term solvency of Medicare.\n  Regrettably, while all of the aforementioned is positive, there are \nsignificant drawbacks in this bill.\n  First and foremost, the legislation raises taxes on tobacco by 15 \ncents a pack. When I was elected, I said I would never vote for a tax \nincrease and I never have. This is a clear and punitive tax increase on \ntobacco. If we needed this revenue to reduce the deficit, rather than \nraising taxes, we could have cut more wasteful and unnecessary \nspending. We should have done that.\n  Second, while the bill puts us on a path to deficit reduction, it \nraises the debt ceiling which allows the Treasury to go $450 billion \ndeeper in debt than we already are. I think that being $5 trillion in \ndebt is shameful enough. We do not need to raise the debt ceiling.\n  Third, Mr. President, this legislation weakens last year's welfare \nlaw. When I ran for the Senate, I said that I wanted workfare, not \nwelfare. Last year, we passed landmark legislation to end the welfare \nsystem as we know it in the United States. But it became clear soon \nafter the bill was signed into law that the President was not committed \nto welfare reform. Just weeks after the bill was signed by the \nPresident, he went to the Democratic Convention in Chicago and promised \nto undo it next\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\nyear. This bill weakens the work requirements. It builds in more \nflexibility to the work program. In Washington, flexibility is a code \nword for weakening, and that is what we have done to the work \nrequirements for food stamp recipients.\n  Not only have we weakened the welfare law, but we have restored $11 \nbillion in welfare benefits for noncitizens. We seemed to have \nforgotten that welfare was and is a failure. Putting more people on \nwelfare doesn't help society. But that is what we have done in this \nbill. We have increased the welfare roles, and we have added people who \nare not even American citizens. The very fact that non-citizens are \nreceiving welfare is testimony to a system that has gotten out of \ncontrol. Welfare is also prone to great fraud. Why else would we have \nto clarify that a noncitizen who is receiving welfare from the U.S. \nGovernment must actually be residing in the United States. Can you \nimagine that we would be paying welfare to people who are not even \nliving in the United States.\n  Mr. President, we have also created a new program regarding welfare. \nWe are spending $3 billion to put welfare recipients to work. Welfare \nreform was supposed to save money and now we are spending money to \nreform welfare. Again, this kind of backward logic only seems to work \nin Washington. I am supportive of helping move welfare recipients to \nwork--but another Government jobs program is not what we need.\n  Mr. President, as I said, there are many good aspects to the bill, \nbut it violates the fundamental promises I made to the people of North \nCarolina when I ran for the Senate regarding welfare and taxes. I will \nnot break my word to the people that supported me in 1992, and I will \nnot vote for this bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to support the \nconference reports on the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief \nAct. Together, these bills will bring us to a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002, while providing vitally important investments in education, \nin children's health, and in economic development.\n  I believe that my job as the Senator from Maryland and the Senator \nfor Maryland is to save jobs, save lives, and save communities. I \nbelieve these bills will help us to do all three.\n  These bills address the day-to-day needs of America's families, and \nthey keep faith with America's seniors. They open the doors to \nopportunity and give help to those who practice self help.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that the conferees rejected \nthe unnecessary and harmful structural changes in the Medicare Program. \nAs my colleagues know, I adamantly opposed the means testing of the \nMedicare program, and the change in the age of eligibility for Medicare \nfrom 65 to 67. Such major changes should not be considered without \nPresidential leadership and a national discussion. I am pleased that \nthese changes were not included in the final budget package. I believe \nthe commission established by this agreement is a better way of \naddressing the long-term solvency concerns of Medicare.\n  There is much good news for senior citizens in the Medicare portions \nof this budget. We have ensured the solvency of the Medicare Program \nfor at least the next 10 years. We have provided funds for critical new \npreventive care benefits, by expanding coverage for mammography and \ncolerectal screening, and by improving self-management of diseases like \ndiabetes. These are investments that will pay off, improving the health \nof Medicare beneficiaries and saving lives.\n  Having said that, however, I am disappointed with other cuts that \nthese bills make in the Medicare Program. It is disturbing that the \nFederal guarantee of adequate reimbursement rates to nursing homes has \nbeen abandoned. I believe this will put nursing homes in a budget \nsqueeze and will have a negative effect on the quality of care that we \nprovide to our most fragile elderly. I am also disappointed with the \nexcessive cuts in the reimbursement rates for such key services as home \noxygen therapy. I believe seniors will be hurt by this change. I hope \nthat we will have an opportunity to revisit these issues in the future.\n  This legislation also will provide a tremendous investment in the \nhealth of America's children. The $24 billion provided for health care \nfor uninsured children in this bill is the single largest increase for \nchildren's health efforts in over 30 years.\n  Mr. President, there are 10 million uninsured children in this \ncountry; 1 in 8 of the children in my own State of Maryland have no \nhealth insurance coverage. It is really shameful that we have allowed \nso many children to be at risk.\n  I believe we have to do all we can to ensure that no child goes \nwithout adequate health care. I wish we could have reached every \nuninsured child with this bill. I pledge to do all I can to work toward \nthat goal. While it does not reach 100 percent coverage for our \nchildren, I do believe that this bill makes tremendous strides in the \nright direction.\n  Over 5 million children who currently have no health care will now \nget their immunizations, early screening, and other health care \nservices. We have taken a great step in ensuring healthy children who \nare ready to learn and ready to succeed.\n  I like this budget package because it also opens the doors to \neducation for young people and to people seeking to further their \neducation. The $1,500 HOPE scholarship contained in this bill will help \nto make available to every student the first two years of college. The \ntuition tax credit the bill provides for juniors, seniors, and graduate \nstudents will enable thousands more young people and returning students \nto get the education and skills they'll need to succeed in the 21st \ncentury.\n  The tax provisions of this package will provide much needed tax \nrelief for working families, for family-owned businesses and farms, and \nfor those who have invested in their homes and communities. This bill \nis good for those who work hard, play by the rules, and pay their \ntaxes.\n  The child tax credit will provide relief to some 27 million families. \nWhen the credit is fully phased in, families with children under 17 \nyears of age will be able to claim a $500 per child credit. We ensure \nthat working families who qualify for the earned income tax credit--who \nmay not pay income taxes but who do pay payroll taxes--will also \nbenefit from the child tax credit. That means we will provide help to \nfamilies with incomes below $30,000--from the firefighters in Baltimore \nCounty to the watermen on the Chesapeake Bay. They work hard, they \ncontribute to our economy and our communities, and they deserve our \nhelp.\n  This bill rewards investment and thrift. It will allow Americans who \nhave invested in their communities by the purchase of a home to be able \nto recoup their investment when they sell that home, without being \nsubject to onerous capital gains taxes. It ensures that people who have \nbuilt a family farm or a small business with a lifetime of hard work \ncan pass that enterprise on to the next generation.\n  It encourages savings. The bill's new IRA provisions will reward \nthose who practice self help, by increasing access to IRA's, and by \nallowing withdrawals from IRA's for the first-time home buyers and for \neducational purposes.\n  Mr. President, this budget package does not provide everything I \nwould like, and I do not like every provision of this package. But I \nbelieve overall, this is an agreement well worth supporting.\n  These conference reports finish the job the Congress began in 1993, \nwhen the President and congressional Democrats passed the deficit \nreduction bill. In 1992, our deficit was $290 billion. This year, it \nwill be less than $45 billion. This historic economic plan started us \non the road to elimination of our deficit. The bills we are passing \nthis week will finish the job we began in 1993.\n  This is a victory for fiscal responsibility. It is a victory for \nAmerica's families. It keeps faith with our seniors, opens the doors of \nopportunity to those seeking an education, protects children's healthy \nand rewards those who save and who invest. I am proud to support it.\n\n\n                duopoly and newspaper-tv cross ownership\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I share Senator Hollings' concern that the \nprovisions in the reconciliation bill on the duopoly and newspaper-TV \ncross ownership rules which affect television broadcast license \nownership violate the Byrd rule.\n\n[[Page S8390]]\n\n  The duopoly rule limits the number of television stations a single \nperson can own in a market and the newspaper/broadcast cross ownership \nrule makes it difficult for newspapers to own a television station in \nthe same market where it publishes a paper to assure that there is not \na monopoly on information.\n  The conference provisions violate the Byrd rule because they make \nsubstantive changes in policy which have no budgetary effect.\n  At a time when the Congress and the American people are concerned \nabout the growing concentration in the broadcast industry, this is not \nthe time or place to consider these changes.\n  The Congress ordered the Federal Communications Commission to review \nthe duopoly rule in 1996. The budget agreement should not pre-empt that \nreview.\n  I join my colleagues in observing that a point of order would lie on \nthe broadcast provisions of this bill.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, back in May of this year, the leadership \nand the administration reached a historic agreement. That agreement was \nthen supported overwhelmingly by the House and the Senate when the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998 came before \nthe two bodies for consideration, putting forth the blueprint by which \nthe Federal Government could reach a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  This week the Congress and the administration have reached yet \nanother monumental agreement, ensuring passage of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997 and its companion, the Taxpayer Fairness Act. These two \nbills, together, put forth the spending and revenue changes for the \nnext 5 years. And, the passage of these measures and their subsequent \nenactment into law will signify the first balanced budget since 1969. \nFor 28 years, the Federal Government has run a deficit and has talked \nabout the need to balance the budget. Finally, due to the extraordinary \nleadership of the House and Senate, as well as the incredible amount of \nbipartisanship and cooperation, Americans are witnessing the Federal \nGovernment take the necessary action to get its fiscal house in order.\n  The tax portion of this agreement will provide Americans with the \nfirst major tax cut in 16 years. This bill provides for a net tax cut \nof more than $90 billion over the next 5 years. This is slightly more \nthan the $85 billion agreed upon in the budget agreement of earlier \nthis year, and I am delighted that the budget negotiators were able to \nprovide a little extra for this country's hard-working families and \nindividuals.\n  Specifically, this bill is an investment in our children. After years \nof trying to get a child tax credit enacted, the Taxpayer Fairness Act \nwill provide families with a $500 per child tax credit for children \nunder the age of 17. Over the years I have received many a letter from \nColoradans who are supportive of this tax credit, and finally, they are \ngoing to be able to take advantage of it. Imagine what a family of four \ncan do with a $1,000 credit. They can use the money to invest in their \ntwo children's education. They can put the money toward a downpayment \non a house or simply use the money to ease their financial burdens. \nThis child tax credit will mean different things to each of the \nmillions of families that is eligible for it. But what it means to me \nis that this Government cares enough about this country's children and \nthe hard-working parents struggling to raise their children to offer \nthem some much-needed and well-deserved tax relief.\n  And the benefits for families and their children do not stop there. \nOnce a child is ready to go on to higher education, millions of \ntaxpayers will benefit from the tuition tax credit and millions more \nwill benefit from the student loan interest deductions.\n  Equally important to my home State of Colorado are the benefits from \ncapital gains and estate tax relief. I cannot begin to quantify how \nmany Coloradans--homeowners, small business owners, farmers, ranchers--\nhave written or spoken with me over the years urging the Federal \nGovernment to ease the burden from these taxes, and while I would have \nliked to see these provisions go a little farther, I am pleased about \nthe benefits this bill will bring to the many farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall business owners in my State. Capital gains and estate tax relief, \nin combination with other tax provisions in this bill including IRA \nexpansion, will contribute to economic growth and create jobs, thereby \nonce again assisting America's families.\n  In all, the tax bill represents a major step forward for the economy \nas a whole and for the pocketbooks of taxpayers. Out of every dollar \nearned by an individual today, roughly 25 cents of that goes toward the \nindividual's Federal tax burden--this is just the Federal taxes. And, \ntoday, we are going to do some truly significant by passing a bill \nwhich will provide major tax cuts, benefiting Americans at every stage \nof life.\n  While the accompanying spending bill is more contentious by nature, \nit provides for several important and necessary reforms to our Nation's \nlargest entitlement programs. The Medicare Program, which was facing \ncertain insolvency within the next 5-year span of the balanced budget \nagreement, is now actuarially sound for the next decade. Most \nimportantly, the savings achieved in the program are not unfairly \nachieved on the backs of beneficiaries, but rather through expanded \nchoice, competition and a curbing of the rampant fraud and abuse. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services cites $23 billion in fraud and \nwaste under the current Medicare structure. This bill finally provides \nus with a mechanism to protect those taxpayer dollars.\n  Further reforms in Medicaid, the section 8 assisted housing program, \nand improvements to the welfare to work legislation of last year have \nresulted in a historic starting point for meaningful and fair reform. I \nmake no bones about my dissatisfaction with certain provisions included \nin the bill, as well as the exclusion of others, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to address these concerns. However, the \nbenefits and the great need for the reforms this legislation \nprecipitates have won it my support.\n  On a larger scale, this tax bill and the Balanced Budget Act, taken \ntogether, will finally get the budget balanced. Since first coming to \nCongress in 1987 as a Member of the House of Representatives, I have \nbeen a proponent of a balanced budget and have supported efforts to \nachieve this goal. And, I am pleased to be here today to be a part of \nthis historic moment. I would be completely remiss if I did not \nacknowledge the hard work of the House and Senate leadership, including \nthe chairmen and ranking members of the Budget and Ways and Means \ncommittees. In 10 years in Congress, I have never before witnessed a \nbudget bill, and a balanced one at that, which has passed with such \nease and cooperation. With that, Mr. President, I will vote for these \ntwo bills, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer a few comments on the \nrecently negotiated bipartisan budget agreement. The past few months \nhave been truly historic. We have seen both parties come to the table \nin good faith and negotiate a budget agreement that puts us on the \ntrack toward a balanced unified budget. And all of that has been done \nwithout a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Indeed, as I \nhave noted before, I am convinced the presence of such an amendment \nwould only have delayed such an agreement, perhaps by a decade or more.\n  Mr. President, balancing our budget has been my highest priority as a \nMember of this body. I ran on that issue in 1992, and I am pleased that \nwe will enact a budget package that puts us on track to achieve that \ngoal.\n  As we congratulate ourselves on fashioning this agreement, however, \nwe should recall that this agreement would not have been possible \nwithout the President's deficit reduction package enacted in 1993, a \npackage some now estimate will achieve approximately $2 trillion in \ndeficit reduction between 1993 and 2002. The heavy lifting needed to \nbalance the budget was done in that package, and while this budget \nagreement puts the finishing touches on the work of eliminating the \ndeficit, it was that 1993 budget package that made it much easier to \nreach an agreement.\n  But Mr. President, though I am pleased we are on track to balancing \nthe unified budget, I have mixed feelings with regard to the specifics \nof the tax cutting aspects of the bipartisan\n\n[[Page S8391]]\n\nagreement. As the headline of the editorial in yesterday's Milwaukee \nJournal Sentinel stated, this budget deal is well-intentioned, but \nflawed. I am particularly concerned at what appears to be backsliding \non our commitment to fiscal prudence and responsible budgeting by \npassing a tax cut before we have eliminated our budget deficit. As the \neditorial stated, ``any balanced budget strategy that also cuts tax \nrevenue is inherently risky.''\n  The tax-cut package in this agreement has the strong odor of business \nas usual about it, a return to the 1980's when politicians stumbled \nover themselves to promise newer and bigger tax cuts without regard to \nour budget deficit. The result was an explosion of deficits and debt \nwhich has taken years to contain. Even now, we are still coping with \nthe legacy of fiscally irresponsible tax cuts.\n  I was the first Member of either body to oppose the tax cut proposals \nof both parties nearly 3 years ago, and I am disappointed to see that \nsome of the concerns I expressed then have been realized. Instead of \nremaining focused on how to balance the budget in the near term and how \nto address the fiscal pressures facing the budget in the long term, \nmuch of the discussion between the negotiators of both parties amounted \nto a tax cut auction, with each side bidding up their own favorite tax \ncuts in an appeal for political credit.\n  As I noted almost 3 years ago, a tax cut bidding war will only serve \nto undercut the efforts we have already made and the work which remains \nto get our budget under control. Aside from the fiscal hole tax cuts \nproduce, they divert us from the tough and unpleasant task of finding \nneeded spending cuts.\n  Mr. President, who wouldn't rather talk about cutting taxes than \ncutting programs that people like? Unfortunately, to some extent, this \nis what has happened in the budget agreement, with the result that the \ngoal of a balanced budget may be taking a back seat to the more \npolitically appealing debate of how to cut taxes.\n  The evidence is fairly compelling in this regard, Mr. President, and \nboth political parties are at fault. The movement of any tax-cut bill \nwhile we are still experiencing budget deficits is the most obvious \nsign. Moreover, that tax cut measure has grown over the past few weeks. \nIn order to accommodate all their constituencies, negotiators for both \nparties produced a tax cut package even bigger than the plan agreed to \nthis spring.\n  And, there is reason to believe that in order to accommodate this \nexpanded tax-cut package, the budget negotiators resorted to what some \nwould describe as accounting gimmicks.\n  Mr. President, these signs all indicate a potentially troubling \ntrend. The desire of the negotiators for an even larger tax cut was \nsuch they were willing to resort to cooking the budget books. It is \nfair to conclude the national priority of fiscal prudence and a \nbalanced budget are in danger of being pushed aside by politically \nmotivated tax-cut proposals.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. I very much want to support a \nsignificant tax cut, but I won't support one until we balance the \nbooks. We do a disservice to those who elect us if we help shift the \nfocus away from fiscally sound budgeting and instead promote self-\nserving but fiscally irresponsible tax cuts.\n  At the time we passed the budget resolution, I expressed my concern \nthat while the tax cut agreement might be sustainable as part of the \nshorter-term budget resolution, it could become unsustainable in the \nlong run, and I am concerned that this is just what happened.\n  The tax-cut package which passed the Senate was heavily backloaded \nwith an annual cost of $54 billion. The negotiated tax-cut package \nproduced by the conferees is even worse, and while accounting gimmicks \nand timing shifts might help achieve technical balance in 2002, they do \nnot alleviate the problems we will face when the retiring baby boomer \ngeneration will put increased pressure on the budget. According to \nanalysis done by the tax watchdog group Citizens for Tax Justice, the \nactual annual cost of this tax measure will be $64 billion, even larger \nthan the cost of the bill as it left the Senate, and over twice the \nannual cost of the President's proposed tax cut.\n  Mr. President, as I noted before, I very much want to support a tax \ncut, but it simply isn't fiscally responsible to enact a tax measure \nwith an annual cost of $64 billion before we have balanced our budget.\n  Balancing the budget must be our first priority, and this tax measure \nis inconsistent with that goal.\n  Having noted my concerns about the tax package, however, let me \nconclude by expressing my support for the reconciliation measure which \ncuts spending. As I noted earlier, the bipartisan package is truly \nhistoric, and I applaud the work done by the negotiators from both \nparties who helped craft that measure.\n  Certainly more needs to be done. The Medicare Program needs to be \nfurther strengthened and modernized, as does the Medicaid Program. As I \nhave stated frequently, one of our highest priorities must be to reform \nour current long-term care system which is largely funded through \nMedicaid. I have introduced legislation which would implement reforms \nin this area, and I very much hope we can begin that absolutely \ncritical task soon.\n  We also need to continue to cut spending in Federal programs. Though \nwe may be on track to achieve balance in the unified budget by 2002, we \nmust dedicate ourselves to achieving the next goal of ridding the \nFederal budget of its dependence on the surpluses generated by the \nSocial Security trust fund. Those surpluses mask our true budget \ncondition, and if we are to ensure retirees will receive the benefits \nto which they are entitled, we need to pursue further spending cuts \nnow.\n  We must cut spending also to begin to pay down the massive national \ndebt, the bulk of which was generated between 1980 and 1992, and which \ncontinue to require increasingly large interest payments--payments that \naccount for a growing portion of our annual budget.\n  We must cut spending also so we can enact a fiscally responsible tax \ncut, one whose benefits are distributed equitably to families at all \nincome levels.\n  Finally, we need to cut spending to ensure Government works more \nefficiently and effectively and to bolster the credibility and national \nconfidence in our Government.\n  The work of cutting spending and reducing the deficit which was \naccomplished by the 1993 budget package, and to a lesser extent by the \nbipartisan budget plan negotiated this week, must continue. I very much \nhope the bipartisan efforts which led to this year's agreement can \ncontinue as we pursue those further spending cuts.\n  I congratulate the negotiators from both parties for their efforts on \nthe reconciliation measure which does the real work, the spending \nreduction measure, and look forward to working with them in taking the \nnext steps toward further spending cuts to balance the budget without \nusing Social Security trust funds, begin to pay down the national debt, \nfund a fiscally fair and responsible tax cut, and to make Government \nprograms more efficient and more effective.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the editorial \ntitled ``Budget Deal Well-Intentioned, But Flawed'' from the Wednesday, \nJuly 30, 1997 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Milwaukee (WI) Journal Sentinel, July 30, 1997]\n\n                Budget Deal Well-Intentioned, But Flawed\n\n       Americans deserve a tax cut, but even more they deserve \n     relief from the $5 trillion debt that is burdening them with \n     yearly interest payments of more than $200 billion. The \n     budget deal agreed to Monday by Republicans and Democrats \n     won't ease that burden, which is the chief reason this plan \n     isn't as good as it may seem.\n       The historic agreement ostensibly would balance the budget \n     for the first time in nearly 30 years and cut taxes \n     significantly for the first time since 1981. Among other \n     things, the measure would grant tax credits for children and \n     reduce the tax on capital gains.\n       The measure will be popular, which helps explain why GOP \n     and Democratic leaders were telling each other how \n     cooperative and constructive they were. Why is such \n     cooperation missing, however, in reforming scandalous \n     campaign finance practices by both parties?\n       Negotiators deserve credit for writing a blueprint to \n     balance the books in five years.\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\n     But any balanced-budget strategy that also cuts tax revenue \n     is inherently risky. If spending increases threaten to \n     produce red ink--and they do-- so do tax cuts. Reducing \n     revenue is premature.\n       It's true that the health of the national economy makes tax \n     cuts less risky than they would have been three or four years \n     ago. But if history is any guide, the boom won't last \n     forever. The stresses on the economy will become more intense \n     after five years have elapsed, when large numbers of working \n     men and women will retire. Unless more is done to curb the \n     growth of entitlement programs such as Social Security, the \n     deficit--and, thus, the national debt--will begin to soar \n     again.\n       Wisely, the negotiators agreed to raise cigarette taxes to \n     help provide health care for poor children. They also \n     abandoned a proposal--it would have made tax-filing even more \n     mind-numbing than it is now--that would have allowed \n     investors to subtract the effects of inflation when \n     calculating their capital gains.\n       The package as a whole, however, contains dangers that \n     could have been avoided. The time for tax cuts comes after, \n     not before, the mountain of debt has been reduced to a saner, \n     safer level.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is a good day for regular people. \nToday, we are putting our differences aside, making smart compromises, \nand getting the peoples' work done. After 3 years of strife, \npartisanship, and government shutdowns, I am glad to see that this \nCongress is finally coming together for the good of the people.\n  As I listen to the debate on the historic balanced budget \nreconciliation bill, I can't help but remember the first budget that I \nhelped draft as a new Member of the Budget Committee, the 1993 Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act. It was a 5-year deficit reduction plan that \nreduced the deficit from nearly $300 billion in 1993 to about $60 \nbillion for 1997.\n  The 1993 plan had deep spending reductions and ambitious goals for \nreducing the deficit. But it also contained important new investments \nin our economy, our work force, and our children. That plan passed \nwithout one vote from the other side, which I think is unfortunate. I \nstood on the floor of the Senate and listened to speech after speech \nfrom my colleagues on the other side claiming the plan would force the \neconomy into recession and explode the deficit.\n  I am proud to stand here today and say that the exact opposite \nhappened. Our economy is strong and growing at a steady rate, and the \ndeficit has declined each year since. Balancing the budget is no longer \nan insurmountable goal. The 1993 plan brought us within reach. A lot of \nMembers had the courage to make the tough calls back then. Some of them \nare no longer here in the Senate. But the state of the Nation today--\nthe low deficit and the booming economy--has vindicated the 1993 plan.\n  The Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act before us today finishes the \njob. We will balance the budget by 2002; we have protected the solvency \nof the Medicare Program without draconian cuts; we have expanded our \ninvestment in education; and we have created a new children's health \ninsurance program to cover an additional 5 million children who have no \nhealth security; and we have provided moderate tax relief. This is a \nbalanced and fair plan.\n  The real winners today are our working families; senior citizens; and \nour children. Not only do they benefit from the largest investment in \neducation since 1965; the largest investment in children's health since \n1965; and the fiscal soundness of the Medicare Program, but we all win \nwhen we reduce the deficit and balance the budget. We are already \nseeing the fiscal and economic dividends from reducing the deficit, and \nthis will only continue.\n  Let me say now I was deeply concerned when this legislation \noriginally passed the Senate. So concerned, in fact, that I had to vote \nno on the Senate bill. The changes in the Medicare Program that were \nincluded would have seriously altered the program and threatened the \nhealth care security for millions of senior citizens.\n  Immediately following that vote, I began working to ensure that these \nchanges were removed from the final conference agreement. I could not \nand would not support anything that would result in more individuals \nbeing un-insured. Increasing the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 \nwould have only added to the 47 million Americans with no health \ninsurance. The means testing of the part B premium was not just an \nadministrative nightmare, but a short-term solution that would have \nonly forced higher premiums on all seniors regardless of income. The $5 \ncopayment for home health care would have fallen disproportionately on \nlow-income women. Well over two-thirds of women over 65 earn less than \n$13,000 a year. A $5 copayment for each home health care visit could \nhave added hundreds of dollars a year to the cost of health care for \nmillions of low-income senior citizens.\n  I could not have supported the final agreement if these provisions \nhad remained. Because I was committed to a balanced budget, I knew I \nhad to work hard to ensure that these provisions were dropped. I spoke \nwith the White House, with the conferees, and with many of my \ncolleagues and constituents about this, and I am pleased our hard work \npaid off. The final agreement slows the growth of Medicare without \nforcing more seniors into poverty and does not jeopardize the level of \ncare that we have guaranteed to our senior citizens.\n  I know many families in Washington State who are struggling to pay \nfor college or who are worried about the financial burden of a college \neducation for their child. Included in today's agreement are real tax \nincentives to help families invest in their child's education and to \nprovide relief to today's students who are struggling under a huge \nburden of debt. As I said earlier, families are the winners today. This \nagreement will help those families who are struggling to help their \nchild and will keep a college education within reach.\n  In 1993, I worked with many of my colleagues in Congress and with the \nClinton administration in an effort to enact comprehensive health care \nreform that would guarantee health care coverage for all Americans. \nLack of affordable, quality health insurance coverage was and still is \na major problem for many individuals. Unfortunately, our plan was too \nambitious and the American people told us that they wanted smaller, \ntargeted reforms. In 1996 we enacted the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act Kennedy/Kassebaum, which expands health care \naccess for workers between jobs and provides protections for those with \npre-existing conditions. This legislation was an important step in \nimproving health care access for all Americans.\n  Today's agreement takes another big step by providing $24 billion to \nimprove access to health insurance for the 10\\1/2\\ million children who \nlack any direct access to quality, comprehensive health care. This new \nhealth insurance program that will improve the quality of life for \nmillions of children and families, is the real crown jewel of this \nagreement.\n  I have spent a great deal of time and energy pushing for expanded \nhealth care coverage for children. I have always considered this to be \none of my top priorities and feel some relief today knowing that we \nhave succeeded. In Washington State, we made a similar commitment to \nour children back in 1993, today's agreement will give us the \nopportunity to build on this commitment and reach out to more children.\n  While I feel a great sense of accomplishment today, there is one \ngroup of individuals who will not be celebrating. Despite the fact that \nmy family violence option clarification amendment was adopted on three \nseparate occasions, the budget conferees chose to once again try and \nsweep domestic violence under the rug. Victims of domestic violence \nwere forgotten in this agreement. My amendment, adopted three times by \nthe U.S. Senate, would have given States the ability to waive victims \nof domestic violence from the work requirements and time limitations \ncalled for in the new welfare reform law. It was not a secret way to \nallow women to stay on welfare, as many claim, but rather a way to \nprotect victims of domestic violence and help them get out of poverty. \nThere is no good reason--no excuse whatsoever--why this provision \nshould have been taken out of the agreement. This is perhaps the \ngreatest disappointment for me in this whole process.\n  I am committed to moving this amendment again and again until my \ncolleagues understand how violence and abuse can be life threatening \nbarriers to work. I will keep making my colleagues vote on this \namendment\n\n[[Page S8393]]\n\nuntil we have succeeded. Those who oppose this amendment need to \nunderstand that when they vote ``no'' they will be voting against \nvictims of domestic violence and abuse.\n  Looking back over the past 4 years, I am amazed at the progress we \nhave made on reducing the deficit and yet I know that it was not an \neasy task. I always believed we could balance the budget and still \nmaintain important investment programs, but it does take a great deal \nof work and many, many tough decisions. As a member of the Senate \nBudget Committee I have had to make those decisions and choices. But, I \nalways knew that it could be done. Today's agreement is my proof.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support the Balance Budget Act of \n1997 which takes us the final step in a process begun in 1993. It \nreflects a considerable bipartisan accomplishment. While I don't agree \nwith it in every specific, it gives a significant boost to education, \nprovides for the largest investment in health care for children in 30 \nyears, protects Medicare and Medicaid, and it reaches a balanced budget \nby the year 2002.\n  In 1992, the deficit in the federal budget was $290 billion which \nrepresented 4.7 percent of the gross domestic product. The most recent \nestimate of the deficit for fiscal year 1997 is $67 billion, \napproximately eight-tenths of 1 percent of the gross domestic product. \nOver the 5 years from 1993 to 1998, the deficit has been reduced by \nabout $1 trillion from the deficit for those 5 years projected at the \ntime. This remarkable progress has come about in large part as a result \nof the deficit reduction package which President Clinton presented in \n1993, and which this Senate passed, without a single Republican vote, \nby a margin of one vote, the Vice President's.\n  The economy has responded to the steady reduction of the deficit. The \neconomy grew for the first quarter of 1997 at a 5.9 percent rate, with \nan inflation rate of 2.7 percent. The unemployment rate is now 5 \npercent, the lowest in 24 years. This compares to an unemployment rate \nin 1992 of 7.5 percent. More than 12 million new jobs have been created \nsince President Clinton took office. Now, this bill holds the promise \nof bringing us even closer to finishing the job.\n  I opposed this bill when it originally passed the Senate in part \nbecause it included a provision to increase the eligibility age for \nMedicare, and a second provision to require a $5 per visit copayment \nfor home health care. I am pleased that both provision were deleted \nfrom the legislation by the conference committee.\n  I am also pleased that this bill restores benefits for legal \nimmigrants who are currently receiving assistance or who become \ndisabled and protects the minimum wage and other protections for \nwelfare recipients moving from welfare to work.\n  Mr. President, this bill will secure the Medicare trust fund for at \nleast the next decade, and provides for additional preventive benefits. \nIt represents hard work and compromise and demonstrates that when the \nCongress moves in a bipartisan way, much can be accomplished.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the chamber today to support this \nbalanced budget. We have worked for many years, making hard choices, \nfighting for our priorities, managing this country's budget process--\nall in order to be able to stand in the Chamber as members of both \npolitical parties in support of a balanced budget.\n  It is not the bill I would have written, but there is a large degree \nof foolhardiness in rejecting the good in favor of the perfect. A great \ndebt is owed to the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee and their counterparts on the Budget Committee as well as \ntheir staffs who have worked with us over the course of these many \nmonths in crafting this plan.\n  And, there is no question in my mind, Mr. President, that this \nlegislation is better than the deal the Senate passed last month--a \nplan I opposed because it did not do enough for hard-working American \nfamilies and largely ignored America's children. This legislation \nbefore us now incorporates many of the provisions I and others on this \nside of the aisle fought to have included.\n  For that reason, this is a day of vindication for Americans who \nbelieve, as Democrats have proven, that it is vital to balance the \nFederal budget and extend health care to children, provide broader \neducational opportunities, ensure the future for our senior citizens \nand safeguard our environment.\n  Since 1993, we have moved in this direction. In 1993, when the first \nDemocrat in a generation was elected President and Democrats formed the \nmajority in both Houses of Congress, we have worked arduously to break \nthe spiraling deficits which plagued our Nation for a decade and \nprovide a solid economic foundation for our Nation as we move into the \n21st century. And, Mr. President, we've succeeded. We have waited for \nthe day when the benefits of our hard work would be as obvious as they \nare today.\n  Even the possibility of the legislation before us now--a conceptually \nbalanced budget with tax breaks-- is testament to the application of \nDemocratic ideals to fiscal policy. In 5 years, we cut the deficit from \n$290 billion to the current level of perhaps less than $50 billion. \nInterest rates are subdued. We are seeing the lowest unemployment and \ninflation rates and the largest drop in poverty rates in a generation. \nConsumer confidence has shown the best improvement since the Eisenhower \nadministration and the value of the stock market has doubled since \n1993--the Dow break records every day--and the market itself is \nexperiencing the fastest growth since the Second World War.\n  We have been successful, because, since the Great Depression, our \nparty has stuck by the fundamental belief that sound economic and \nsocial policy go hand-in-glove, that our Nation is stronger when all \nAmericans have equal economic opportunity.\n  Thomas Jefferson taught us that ours is a Nation of the common man \nand enshrined this belief in one of our most treasured documents when \nhe wrote of the self-evident truth that all men are created equal.\n  Andrew Jackson echoed this creed when he restated the party's \ncommitment to the humble members of our society--the farmers, mechanics \nand laborers. That commitment, that core set of beliefs, is in fact, \nMr. President, the essence of the American dream and the foundation of \nwhat has become the greatest contribution this Nation has provided to \nthe world's social economic history--the growth of a vibrant middle \nclass. Universal economic opportunity, sound fiscal policy based on \nequitable distribution of benefits and assistance to those most in \nneed--those are the fundaments of Democratic economic policy. That is \nthe goal of the program we put in place in 1993, and that is the end to \nwhich our fiscal policies are directed. Franklin Roosevelt reminded us \nof our commitment to expanding opportunity when he said: ``the spirit \nof opportunity is the kind of spirit that has led us as a Nation--not \nas a small group but as a Nation--to meet very great problems.''\n  Mr. President, as Democrats, we believe that deficit reduction is a \nmeans to an end. We believe that tax breaks are a means to an end. But, \nunlike the Republicans, we do not subscribe to the callow notion that \ndeficit reduction is an economic policy in and of itself or that tax \nbreaks are an end which justify any means. We do not believe that \ncutting vital programs is a courageous or visionary act. We believe \nthat courage lies in advancing economic opportunity: this requires \nwisdom, innovation and prescience. It is chilling that this dichotomy \nof political and economic philosophy remains as obviously demarcated \ntoday as it was 100 years ago. I re-read the cogent description by \nWilliam Jennings Bryan of the two opposing ideas of government: he \nseparated the parties into those who ``legislate to make the well-to-do \nprosperous and wait for their prosperity to leak through on those \nbelow, or those who legislate to make the masses prosperous and \nensuring that their prosperity will find its way up through every class \nwhich rests upon them.''\n  Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator, I have an obligation to the \nconstituents who elected me to represent their interests, to act on \ntheir behalf and to present their views to this body. At times here, \nthere is often a temptation to acquiesce ones core set of beliefs to \nthe majority. It is easier to be hidden by the crowd than to stand \nalone and dissent, simpler to obey the tenets of a deal than the core \nof ones belief, more politic to do what is possible than do what is \nright, and more efficient to\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\nsave time by agreeing. But remember the words of Harry Truman, Mr. \nPresident, when he said that ``whenever you have an efficient \ngovernment, you have a dictatorship.''\n  I am pleased that our provocation, our urging, our insistence in \ncrafting this compromise that helps working class Americans was \nsuccessful. I cannot turn away from the long history which has shaped \nmy essence sense of fairness, my overarching insistence on making \ngovernment work for the common good and the needs of my constituents. \nMr. President, for that reason, I voted against the tax portion of the \nreconciliation bill as I voted against the spending portion when they \npassed the Senate the first time, and because these bills were \ndramatically improved, I am able to support the conference report \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for the work of the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Roth who chairs the Finance Committee and my friend \nfrom New York, Senator Moynihan, who serves as that committee's ranking \nmember. They have improved a gravely flawed piece of legislation passed \nby the House of Representatives and the Senate the first time.\n  During the course of the initial debate, I attempted to shape the \nlegislation so it would do more for more average citizens, but time and \nagain we were rebuffed. I said at the time, Mr. President, that before \nI could approve it when it returns from conference, this legislation \nneeded significant improvement, especially as regards the treatment of \nchildren and hard-working American families.\n  In the original Senate package, nearly 43 percent of the breaks went \nto the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans--those who earn more than \n$120,000. In the original plan, Mr. President, 60 percent of hard-\nworking poor and middle class Americans got only 12.7 percent of the \ntax breaks, while the richest 1 percent of Americans get 13 percent of \nthe benefits. In the original Finance Committee proposal, the poorest \n60 percent got as much as the richest 1 percent. This was a new \nstandard of unfairness. This was anathema to the party of Jefferson and \nJackson and Truman and Roosevelt. I tried to change it; I was \nunsuccessful and I rejected it.\n\n  I am pleased the conference report has a more equitable distribution \nby allowing more working class Americans to take advantage of the \nchild-tax credit, for example. By most measures, Mr. President, this \nproposal has moved closer to our ideals and is unquestionably more \nequitable.\n  There is no more obvious improvement in this bill, Mr. President, \nfrom the original Finance Committee plan than the treatment of hard-\nworking middle class families raising children. During the initial \ndebate, I attempted to give more help to the American families on the \nlower end of the economic spectrum--young families with young \nchildren--who will be doing the most for our country in the future.\n  Mr. President, I attempted to correct this basic inequity by offering \nan amendment which would have improved the bill by granting a \nrefundable child tax credit to all working families. Most Americans pay \nmore in payroll taxes than income taxes. Income taxes have remained \nstable for most Americans in the past 10 years while payroll taxes have \nincreased 17 percent.\n  My distinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, \nattempted to amend the original plan so families who receive the earned \nincome credit would not be penalized. She is a new member of this body, \nMr. President, but she has already made an enormous contribution. She \nis a young mother and as such speaks with a clear voice on the \ndifficulties of raising children today, and Mr. President, because this \nproposal incorporates her vision and my vision, it is a better deal for \nall Americans.\n  I am pleased also that this conference report allows Americans to \noff-set the credit against these payroll taxes. Now, it applies to all \nAmericans even those receiving the earned income credit. This is in \ndistinct contrast with the original Finance Committee plan under which \nnearly 40 percent of America's children were excluded from the tax \ncredit. Those 40 percent are the children of working class Americans, \nchildren of young teachers, police officers, farmers and nurses who \nwork hard and are the backbone of this country.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Democrat proposal--more measured and fair--\nhas prevailed. And, more Americans will be afforded a share of the \ngreat economic success this country has enjoyed since 1993. I could \ntell you that this bill provides a tax break for 5.9 million more \nAmerican families with children than the Senate bill and 7.5 million \nmore families than the House bill, but instead of relying dry \nstatistical analyses and distributional tables, let me take a moment to \nshow you some real people and compare how the different plans affect \nthem.\n  The Richards family from Sioux Falls, SD, Charlie and Karen and their \ntwo children, will receive $975 from the child tax credit and both \ntheir children will be covered by health insurance. Under the House \nplan, the family would have received no child tax break; under the \nSenate plan, $418. This legislation, incorporating my amendment, will \ngive them twice as much in the child tax break.\n  Under this plan, the Ussinger family from Albuquerque, NM will \nreceive $1500 in child tax breaks. The House plan would have given them \n$6 and the original Finance Committee plan would have provided $458. \nThis plan, incorporating my amendment, will give the Ussingers three \ntimes as much.\n  The Buckman family from Washington, DC, will now receive $594 in the \nchild tax break. Under the House bill, the Buckmans would have gotten \nnothing and the Senate version would have given them only $143. So, \nthis plan, incorporating my amendment, will give the Buckmans here in \nour Nation's capital four times as much in child tax breaks.\n  All of those children, Mr. President, every one of them, and 5 \nmillion more, will have health insurance thanks to our insistence and \nthe leadership of Senator Kennedy that we deliver the largest \ninvestment in the health of our children since the enactment of \nMedicaid, a generation ago.\n  This plan invests an unprecedented $24 billion for uninsured \nchildren, and since it is funded by a tax on cigarettes, it is, in \nfact, a double health benefit. This plan serves as a financial \nbarrier--a powerful disincentive for children to start smoking in the \nfirst place. It supplements, not supplants, current health care \ncoverage. Our plan requires that States maintain their current Medicaid \neligibility levels of spending to access Federal dollars to ensure that \nthis investment is not used to replace public or private money that \nalready covers children.\n  Mr. President, simply put, this is the embodiment of the Democratic \nprinciples I mentioned earlier. This victory for America's children and \nmiddle-income families is a victory for America itself. We will all \nbenefit from a healthier generation of children.\n  Mr. President, there are some elements of this package about which I \nam unsure. I would have preferred the approach to capital gains \nreduction for which Senator Bumpers and I have fought for a decade--a \nmeasured, targeted approach instead of the broad-based cut this bill \ncontains. I would have rejected the large back-loaded expensive IRA \nprovision. But, at the end of the day, we must ask ourselves if this \nlegislation meets the basic standards of fairness to which we attest; \ndoes it help average, hard-working American families? The answer is \nyes. Does it provide assistance for America's children and the young \nfamilies struggling to raise them--those who have as yet not enjoyed \nthe fruits of the economic boom? The answer is yes.\n  I am pleased to be able to join the majority of our colleagues, Mr. \nPresident, in supporting this plan.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I strongly support, and will be proud to vote for, \nthe Balance Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act. With these two \nbills, Congress has finally kept the promises made to Americans to \nbalance the budget and to cut their taxes.\n  When I talk to folks back home in Idaho, they always ask the same \nquestion: When is Congress going to get its act together and balance \nthe budget and reduce our taxes?\n  These folks aren't asking for much. They just want the Federal \nGovernment to stop spending so much of their hard earned money and \nleave more at home so they can pay their bills and raise their \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\n  Now, when these two bills become law, I can go home I can look them \nin the eye and say. ``We heard you and we took action.''\n  I am proud to be a member of the Congress that had the discipline and \nthe courage to balance the budget and cut taxes. This is a historic \ntime in Congress. We have stopped the out of control spending frenzy in \nWashington, DC and have reestablished fiscal responsibility to the \nFederal Government.\n  We balance the budget by 2002, the first time in nearly 30 years. I \nwas in high school when the budget was last balanced. My daughter just \ngraduated from high school. An entire generation of budget deficit. We \nmust stop accumulating debt for our children and their children to pay. \nWith a national debt of more than $5 trillion its time we balanced the \nbudget.\n  We also provide the first tax cut in 16 years--$96 billion over the \nnext 5 years. We didn't balance the budget by raising their taxes. We \nlet folks keep more of what they earn.\n  Three-quarters of the tax cuts from this bill go to those making less \nthan $75,000 a year. Taxes for a family with two kids making $30,000 a \nyear will see their taxes cut 50 percent. In a State like Idaho, where \nthe median household income is about $20,000, this is significant \nrelief to those who deserve and need it most.\n  This tax cut empowers American families with choices which allow them \nto better plan their future and the future of their children. This tax \ncut bill provides a permanent $500 per child tax credit for families \nwith children under the age of 17. Families can spend and invest this \nmoney in ways they think best, and families will do that better than \ngovernment ever will.\n  We also encourage the education of future generations. This bill \ncreates HOPE scholarship tax credits for families already paying for \nhigher education. We create tax free education investment accounts so \nfamilies can save for future education expenses. Families can also make \npenalty-free withdrawals from existing IRA's for educational purposes. \nWe've brought the dream of affording college to more American families.\n  We also reward the financial success of current generations, not \npenalize it, by reducing capital gains taxes from 28 percent to 20 \npercent. We increase the death tax exemption from the current $600,000 \nto $1,000,000 over the next 10 years. We allow families not to pay tax \non money they receive from the sale of their homes. We raise the death \ntax exemption on small businesses and farms up to $1.3 million \neffective January 1, 1998. No longer will we tax out of existence \nbusinesses that have been in families for generations by forcing the \nheirs to sell the business just to pay the estate taxes.\n  Last week an Idaho couple, Chuck and Sarah Johnson, came in to see me \nabout the death tax and the threat it poses to their families' future. \nThe Johnsons, who own and operate a dairy farm in Meridian, ID, told me \nthat unless Congress changes the current confiscatory estate tax laws \non small businesses they will not be able to pass on their lives' work \nto their sons.\n  The Johnsons' assets, like most family businesses, are in the land \nand equipment used to run the operation. They don't have nonproductive \ncash laying around to pay taxes. Small business is the economic life \nblood of Idaho and the nation, and this legislation recognizes and \nrewards families like the Johnsons for their hard work.\n  I am proud to vote in favor of the Balanced Budget Act and the \nTaxpayer Relief Act. In 1992, when I submitted my name for election to \nthe U.S. Senate, I promised to expand tax credits for parents with \nchildren, to cut capital gains taxes, to reduce death taxes, to expand \nindividual retirement accounts to pay for education expenses. With \npassage of these bills the Congress has accomplished these important \ngoals.\n  Promises made, promises kept; taxes cut and the budget balanced.\n\n\n                  colorectal cancer screening benefits\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to commend the conferees for \nthe provisions of this legislation that establish new preventive care \nbenefits within the Medicare Program. There has been some criticism of \nthese provisions by those who do not see the wisdom of adding new \nMedicare benefits at a time when we are cutting over $110 billion from \nthe program. However, at a time when we are forced to reduce program \nspending, our goal should be to make the overall program as cost-\neffective as possible. These new preventive benefits, particularly \ncolorectal cancer screening, are both medically wise and economically \nsmart. I am proud to have the opportunity to be in the Senate at a time \nwhen we enact these new benefits into law.\n  I am pleased that the conference report provides that the \ndetermination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services [HHS] \nregarding the coverage of the barium examination as a colorectal cancer \nscreening provision will be made by January 1, 1998 or within 90 days \nof enactment, whichever is earlier. Given the recent recommendations of \nthe American Cancer Society and reports by the Agency for Health Care \nPolicy and Research and other groups, I see no reason that HHS cannot \nmeet this deadline. Medicare coverage of colorectal cancer screening \ntakes effect on January 1, 1998. This deadline assures that the \ndetermination on Medicare coverage of the barium examination and other \nscreening procedures will be made as the program goes into effect.\n  I also note that the conference report incorporates language from the \nSenate provision directing the Secretary of HHS to consult with \nappropriate organizations in making the determination with regard to \ncoverage of the barium examination and other new screening technology. \nThe American Cancer Society is one of the organizations that HHS should \nconsult with because that group, more than any other, represents the \ninterests of cancer patients and their families. The new ACS \nguidelines, which I understand are based upon the results of a 2-year \nstudy by a panel of 16 experts on colorectal cancer, should be of great \nassistance to HHS in establishing the best possible colorectal cancer \nscreening program for Medicare recipients.\n  Mr. President, this budget agreement represents a major \naccomplishment for our Government, our economy, and our Nation as a \nwhole. It also represents a major step forward for elderly Americans \nacross this country. These new preventive benefits will help our senior \ncitizens and save thousands of lives. I am glad to have had the \nopportunity to work on this legislation. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I submit the following views in dissent \nto the provisions contained in title III, Communications and Spectrum \nAllocation Provisions of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997. As a \nsubconferee on title III, I stand in opposition to the provisions \nadopted by the subconference, and ultimately, the Congress. These \nprovisions are a classic example of the charade that is being \nperpetuated on the American public under the guise of balancing the \nbudget. The administration and the congressional leadership have \ndevised a plan that turns sound communications policy on its head.\n  The final product actually represents the first time the \nAdministration and Budget Committees admit that their original \nassessments on spectrum auctions were unrealistic. Their admission is \nreflected in the fact that, also for the first time, universal service \nfunds will be used to make up the shortfall in the auctions in order to \nbalance the budget. Unfortunately, the price that we will pay for their \nrecognizing the error of their ways, will result in higher phone rates \nfor rural America.\n  Title III contains dramatic changes to long-standing communications \npolicy. There were many policy changes made that I do not support and \ndeserve greater discussion. But for purposes of this statement, I will \nonly discuss the following three issues:\n  First, for the first time, the U.S. budget will be balanced by \nraiding the universal service fund. This is one of the most blatant \nbudget gimmicks to plug a shortfall as I have ever seen. The bill \nlanguage as provided to the Budget Committee actually had a blank line \nfor the dollar amount to be filled in at some later point. In the end, \nthe universal service plug was $3 billion. It is not quite clear how \nthe language will actually work--if it works at all. It clearly imposes \na financial burden on the telephone companies in an effort to float an \ninterest free loan\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\nto the Government. In essence, we are asking small telephone companies \nto make do without the financial support they rely on every month and \nmay force these companies to raise rates.\n  Second, the deal struck by the administration and the congressional \nleadership requires the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] to \nauction broadcast licenses. This is a fundamental change to our long-\nheld policy that broadcasters are licensed to serve the public \ninterest. The Congress and the FCC impose special public interest \nobligations on broadcasters and that is why broadcasters were exempted \nfrom auctions under the original auction authority. But now we need \nmoney to pay the bills and so the conference has selectively targeted a \ngroup of pending broadcast licenses to be assigned by competitive \nbidding, not by comparative hearings. These applicants had no notice \nand no opportunity to challenge this change in policy. All of the \npending applicants sought these licenses with the expectancy of \ncomparative hearings. Now we have budget folks coming in here and \ntelling us that budget policy is more important than communications \npolicy.\n  Along these same lines, the deal eliminates the FCC's ability to use \nlotteries as an assignment process, except in the case of assigning \npublic broadcast licenses. Here, we preserved the FCC's authority to \nuse comparative hearings to assign these licenses. I urge the FCC to \ndevelop appropriate criteria to assign these licenses. The local \ncommunities deserve the right to have qualified public broadcast \nlicensees. Public broadcasting is too important to leave to random \nchance.\n  Third, the last point I want to make relates to the change made to \nthe local ownership rules under the guise of increasing the pool of \nbidders for the analog auction. The deal waives the FCC's rules on \nduopoly and newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership for the purpose of \nallowing these parties to bid on the analog return spectrum in 2001. \nSubsection 3003(D) of the reconciliation conference report violates \nSection 313(b)(1)(D) of the Budget Act, also known as the ``Byrd \nRule.''\n  These provisions are in violation of the Byrd Rule because: First, \nthe inclusion of these provisions has no revenue impact as indicated by \nCBO letter dated July 14, 1997; Second these provisions fail to qualify \nas a necessary term and condition for the purposes of conducting the \nauction; third these provisions selectively benefit one competitor over \nanother by maintaining other ownership limitations; and fourth these \nprovisions represent substantive policy changes to the Communications \nAct of 1934, as amended, and can be achieved by the free-standing \npieces of legislation already introduced in the House and Senate.\n  Here, subsection 3003(D) is applicable only in cities with \npopulations greater than 400,000 as measured by the 1990 decennial \ncensus. For purposes of determining cities with populations in excess \nof 400,000, the FCC should refer to the April 1, 1990 Decennial Census, \nas referenced in PPL-27 Table 3, Resident Population for Cities with \nPopulation Greater than 100,000 Sorted by Population Rank. The FCC \nshould take note that this is the first time the Congress has directed \nthe FCC to issue a blanket waiver of these two rules and established a \nstatutory threshold that relief is only permissible in these specified \nmarkets; and furthermore, the relief is only justified when there is an \nincrease in the number of broadcast outlets in the large markets.\n  The legislative history supports this position. The House provision \nestablished a blanket waiver of these provisions for all markets. The \nfinal provision provides for relief only in cities with populations \ngreater than 400,000. In contrast to the general review of the duopoly \nrule required under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Congress \nhere has spoken clearly that media concentration is not warranted at \nthis time, particularly in cities with populations less than 400,000, \nand should only be allowed when there is a possible increase in the \nnumber of broadcast outlets. Here that increase in the number of \nbroadcast outlets is anticipated at the end of the digital TV \ntransition when the FCC will auction off the returned analog spectrum.\n  It is important to note that repeal of these two rules represents a \ndrastic change in policy. For years, the policy has been to preserve \ndiversity and sources of information. In particular, a merger between a \ndaily newspaper and a broadcast station will reduce the independent \nsources of news in the community. The budget deal's elimination of the \nnewspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule exacerbates the growing recent \nproblem of media concentration because even in large metropolitan areas \nthere is often only one major daily newspaper. In such a community, \nthat newspaper may be the only major source of non-broadcast local news \nand information. With a city's only newspaper aligned with major \nbroadcast stations, a great deal of power and influence is held by a \nfew individuals at the expense of the needs of the community.\n  For example, the October 23, 1995, edition of Electronic Media \nreports examples of newspaper/broadcast cross ownership situations \nwhere critical information for the community was stifled because of the \nlack of independence by the news outlets. For example, during a \nparticularly contentious strike at the major newspaper in Detroit, the \ncross-owned tv and radio stations were forbidden to air stories about \nthe strike. In addition, a broadcast story about cheating by automotive \nrepair shops was canceled because of potential loss of advertising \nrevenues at the cross-owned newspaper. A company that owns a broadcast \nstation and a newspaper would likely combine its news departments in \norder to achieve economies of scale. The problem though is not an \neconomic one, but one of information and diversity of views. Such \ncombinations reduce the diversity of sources of local news and public \naffairs in that community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Ranking Democrat, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As you requested, I am pleased to provide you \n     with additional information regarding CBO's estimates of the \n     receipts from auctioning licenses to use the spectrum that is \n     currently allocated for broadcasting analog television \n     signals. As you indicated in your letter, CBO estimated that \n     the analog spectrum provisions in the House-passed version of \n     the reconciliation bill would increase receipts by $500 \n     million more than those in the Senate-passed version of the \n     bill.\n       The difference between these two estimates is attributable \n     to language included in the Senate-passed version of the bill \n     that would direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \n     to extend analog broadcast licenses beyond 2006 under certain \n     conditions. Both versions would provide for the extension of \n     analog broadcast licenses under certain circumstances but \n     under the Senate version such an extension would be more \n     likely. CBO believes that the possibility of any extension of \n     the existing licenses would make the returned analog spectrum \n     less desirable to potential bidders because they would be \n     uncertain as to when they would be able to use the spectrum. \n     As a result, we have discounted our estimates of auction \n     receipts to reflect the probability of such an extension.\n       The provisions in the House version of the bill waiving the \n     duopoly and cross-ownership rules for newspapers and \n     broadcast stations did not contribute to the difference \n     between the cost estimates of the two versions of the bill.\n       If you wish further details, we will be pleased to provide \n     them. The CBO staff contacts are Rachel Forward, David Moore, \n     and Perry Beider.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. June O'Neill,\n     Director, Congressional Budget Office, Ford House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director O'Neill: In its June 27, 1997 cost estimate \n     of H.R. 2015, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored \n     the revenues generated from the auction of returned analog \n     spectrum at $3.2 billion. (See CBO June 27, 1997 Cost \n     Estimate at Table 5.) However, in its July 2, 1997 cost \n     estimate of S. 947, CBO scored the revenues generated from \n     the auction of returned analog spectrum at $2.7 billion. (See \n     CBO July 2, 1997 Cost Estimate at Table 4.)\n       My understanding is that the $500 million difference in the \n     CBO scores results from the\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\n     discretion granted to the Federal Communications Commission \n     (FCC) to extend a license beyond 2006. Is my understanding \n     correct? Therefore, based on that assumption, is it not the \n     case that the House provisions waiving the duopoly and \n     newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rules do not have a \n     revenue impact on the House score given by CBO?\n       Due to the fact that the Reconciliation Conference will \n     begin tomorrow, I would appreciate a response by noon \n     tomorrow. Thank you in advance for your assistance with this \n     matter.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings,\n                                                 Ranking Democrat.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when the budget agreement was announced in \nMay, I expressed a great deal of skepticism about whether it would \nprovide adequate tax relief to hard-working American families, whether \nMedicare's solvency would be assured, and whether the savings necessary \nto achieve a balanced federal budget would really be obtained.\n  After reviewing the two bills that are before the Senate today--bills \nintended to implement the budget agreement--I must still conclude that \nthey are, by themselves, inadequate. Too little tax relief is provided \nto Americans--with or without children--who go to work every day, play \nby the rules, and struggle to make ends meet. Too little is invested in \ncreating jobs and making our country more competitive.\n  The legislation does extend Medicare solvency, but only for a decade. \nIt is disappointing, to say the least, that President Clinton failed to \nstep up to the plate and fight for the significant reforms that an \noverwhelming, bipartisan majority of the Senate supported to put \nMedicare on a more stable footing for our children and grandchildren in \nthe decades to come.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, the bills represent steps in the right \ndirection. They provide at least some tax relief to millions of \nfamilies who are trying to do right by their children, to young \nAmericans who are striving to get a higher education and make our \ncommunities better and more productive places for us to live, and for \nseniors who need relief from capital gains or estate taxes to make ends \nmeet in their retirement years.\n  They will extend Medicare solvency, while expanding the health-care \nchoices available to seniors. There are tough, new antifraud provisions \ndesigned to weed out and punish those who would steal Medicare dollars \nfrom older Americans. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will be able \nto save money tax-free to pay for health care in new medical savings \naccounts, and seniors will no longer be denied the right to purchase \nhealth services from a doctor of their choosing.\n  In addition to Medicare reform, the bill reforms Medicaid, and \nachieves savings in the Student Loan Program, Federal retirement, and \nhousing. It raises money from the auctioning of broadcast spectrum. In \nall, the legislation achieves about $130 billion in savings over a 5-\nyear period.\n  Should we have done more? Yes. While many people will benefit from \nthe tax-relief bill, many others will be left out. But with President \nClinton opposed to a broader tax-relief package, and without the votes \nto pass a bill over his objection, it is clear that a more far-reaching \nmeasure has no chance of passage in the near term. So we are faced with \nthe choice of either providing at least a limited amount of tax relief \nthis year, or denying relief to everyone.\n  For me, that is an easy choice. We ought to do what we can now and \nkeep fighting for more. This is by no means the end of the fight. Just \nas the tax relief provided to small businesses last year was not the \nend of the road, this is not the end, either. It is one more step in \nthe direction of providing the tax relief that the American people so \nbadly need and deserve.\n  The amendment I offered to the budget agreement back in May makes \nclear that the door is open for additional tax relief next year, and I \nintend to be back fighting for more. And in any event, interim tax \nrelief, which really adds a great deal of complexity to the Tax Code, \nis no substitute for permanent structural reforms that will move us \ntoward a fairer, flatter tax that will provide relief for everyone.\n  Mr. President, the cornerstone of the tax bill before the Senate \ntoday is the $500-per-child tax credit that Senators Grams, Coats, \nHutchinson, Nickles, and I introduced on the day Congress reconvened \nthis year. It is an idea that many of us have pursued for a number of \nyears, and it has been a top goal of the Republican Congress since \n1994. With the idea finally on the verge of becoming law, others are \nnow claiming credit. As President Kennedy put it, ``victory has a \nthousand fathers.'' So be it.\n  Mr. President, just think what $500 per child will mean to a married \ncouple with two children and an income of $35,000 a year. That family \nwill see a 40 percent reduction in its tax bill. Think what that will \nmean in terms of helping to pay for child care, health or dental care, \nclothes, or a trip to summer camp. Obviously, $500 is no panacea--\nanyone who has raised a child knows how expensive a proposition that \ncan be--but it will help.\n  Think what a single mom in the inner city could do with an extra $500 \nper child. It might help provide after-school care to keep a son or \ndaughter off the streets, safe, and out of trouble. Maybe it would help \nher send her child to a better, safer school, or just put food on the \ntable.\n  We are talking here about letting hard-working, tax-paying families \nkeep more of what they earn to do what they know is best for themselves \nand their children. We put our faith and trust in families.\n  We also create new opportunities in this bill for people to save for \ntheir retirement in enhanced individual retirement accounts. Nonworking \nspouses will be able to save a full $2,000 annually in an IRA \nregardless of the working spouses' access to a pension plan. Penalty-\nfree early withdrawals would be allowed for first-time home purchases \nto make the dream of home ownership a reality for more Americans. For \nthose trying to sell their homes, we provide a meaningful capital-gains \nexclusion.\n  This legislation provides significant new incentives to help people \nsave for a college education. And what better way to ensure that the \nnext generation is prepared to lead us to a brighter future than to \nensure greater access to higher learning: new opportunities to save \ntax-free in education savings accounts, an extension of the tax \nexclusion for employer-provided educational assistance, and a $2,500-\nper-year student-loan interest deduction.\n  Mr. President, the family and education credits are probably the most \npopular parts of this tax-relief package, but there are other important \nprovisions included as well.\n  I know that not as many people are concerned about capital-gains and \nestate-tax relief compared to the education tax credits in particular, \nbut I would suggest that unless good paying jobs are available for \nyoung people when they graduate, education tax credits will amount to \nlittle more than empty promises. We need to do more, and that is why \nthe capital-gains and estate-tax provisions are in this bill.\n  Three decades ago, the Nation's bipartisan leadership joined together \nin calling for a deep reduction in the capital-gains tax rate. In fact, \nit was President John F. Kennedy who recommended a plan that would have \ntaxed only 30 percent of long-term gains. In other words, President \nKennedy would have excluded 70 percent of gains--a far greater \nreduction than is contained here.\n  There was a reason that he called for a significant cut in the \ncapital-gains tax. ``The present tax treatment of capital gains and \nlosses is both inequitable and a barrier to economic growth,'' the \nPresident said. ``The tax on capital gains directly affects investment \ndecisions, the mobility and flow of risk capital from static to more \ndynamic situations, the ease or difficulty experienced by new ventures \nin obtaining capital, and thereby the strength and potential for growth \nof the economy.''\n  In other words, if we are concerned about whether new jobs are being \ncreated, whether new technology is developed, whether workers have the \ntools they need to do a more efficient job, we should support measures \nthat reduce the cost of capital to facilitate the achievement of all of \nthese things. Remember, for every employee, there was an employer who \ntook risks, made investments, and created jobs. But that employer \nneeded capital to start.\n  President Kennedy recognized that. He recognized that our country is\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\nstronger and more prosperous when our people are united in support of a \ncommon goal--and alternatively, that we are weaker and more vulnerable \nwhen Americans are divided among lines of race, gender, and income.\n  While some politicians may employ divisive class warfare to their \npolitical advantage today, President Kennedy simply put good policy \nahead of good politics. And I am with him.\n  The capital-gains reductions in this bill will help keep the economy \non track, producing new jobs and new opportunities for all Americans to \nget ahead. It will free up resources locked up in old technology and \nold investments, and make them available to update equipment and \nfactories, and put Americans in a more competitive position in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  The estate-tax reductions, too, will help create new jobs. According \nto the Heritage Foundation, outright repeal would create as many as \n150,000 new jobs a year. But this bill does not repeal the death tax. \nIt effectively adjusts the tax for inflation over a 9-year period, and \nthat is all it does. While it provides an additional exemption for \nfamily owned businesses and farms, the rules are so complex that I \npredict few, if any, will actually benefit from them.\n  There is something unseemly, though, about a tax that forces grieving \nfamilies to visit the funeral home and the tax collector at the same \ntime. There is something wrong with a tax that takes more than half of \nwhatever someone has managed to acquire over his or her lifetime with \nafter-tax dollars. The death tax ought to be repealed outright, and I \nintend to continue to fight for that objective.\n  Mr. President, what a difference a Republican majority in Congress \nhas made. In 1993, President Clinton and the Democrat-controlled \nCongress passed the largest tax increase in history, increased spending \nand left a budget in deficit for as far as the eye could see.\n  This week, Congress will send to the President a budget that aims for \nbalance, limits government spending, extends the solvency of Medicare, \nand provides badly needed tax relief to millions of Americans. It is \nsafe to say that none of these things could have been achieved without \na Republican majority.\n  These bills will not accomplish everything we set out to do, but with \nPresident Clinton in office, it is unlikely that we can do much more \nright now.\n  I intend to support these bills as steps in the right direction, but \nI intend to keep pushing next year for the kinds of entitlement reforms \nthat will protect the next generation, and expand on the tax relief \nthat today's generation needs and deserves.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on this \nhistoric moment as we offer the American people a balanced budget for \nthe first time in almost 30 years. Mr. President, this agreement is \ntruly a remarkable accomplishment for both President Clinton and \nMembers of Congress, and it is a well-deserved victory for the American \npeople. This means less debt for our children's generation, lower \ninterest rates for families seeking to buy a car or a home, and a more \nvibrant economy for businesses to expand and create jobs.\n  This moment must not be viewed in isolation because, in many \nrespects, the victory we claim today stands on the shoulders of the \nprogress we have made to reduce the deficit over the past few years.\n  Let's give credit where credit is due. In 1990, President Bush put \nthis country above his party and above his own political ambitions by \nendorsing a plan that lowered the deficit by $500 billion. It was \nwildly unpopular in his own party because it raised taxes on affluent \nAmericans. But it was the right thing to do. President Bush's efforts \non behalf of his country should be remembered and commended.\n  When President Clinton came into office, he, too, stepped up to the \nchallenge of combating the deficit. He proposed a far-reaching economic \nplan in 1993--more appropriately called the balanced budget plan of \n1993--and it was enacted into law without a single Republican vote.\n  President Clinton's balanced budget plan, which I supported, has \nreduced the deficit by more than 75 percent from $290 billion in 1992 \nto an estimated $67 billion this year. That $67 billion represents less \nthan 1 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, the best we've seen \nsince Harry Truman's presidency. We have now seen four consecutive \nyears of deficit reduction, something that has not occurred since \nbefore the Civil War.\n  And our economy is only getting stronger as a result of what we did \nin 1993. The unemployment rate is at 5 percent, representing the lowest \nlevel in 24 years. There have been 12.5 million new jobs created in \nthese past 4\\1/2\\ years of the Clinton administration. That's more than \nany prior administration. Home ownership has increased from 63.7 to \n65.4 percent--the highest percentage on record. Median family income is \nup $1,600 since 1993, representing the fastest growth since the Johnson \nadministration. And the stock market continues to break records, \ngrowing from 3,200 to 8,000, the fastest growth rate since World War \nII. The list goes on and on.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, we no longer hear the voices that predicted \nthat President Clinton's plan in 1993 would not balance the budget, but \ninstead would cause a recession, raise interest rates, and put American \nfamilies out of work. Those voices of opposition have been drowned out \nby our overwhelming record of successes.\n  And without this tremendous record of progress, we could never have \nwhat we have today--the first time in a generation that our government \nwill not run a deficit.\n  The underlying bill represents the first tax cut in 16 years. It \nprovides much-needed tax relief for working American families. The 1981 \nand 1986 tax cuts, which I voted against and which set the Reagan \neconomic program in motion, blew a hole in the deficit and left us with \nan astronomical national debt. By contrast, this bill promotes fiscal \nresponsibility, sustains balance, and is the most progressive economic \npackage since the Lyndon Johnson package in the 1960's.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased with the child tax credit \nincluded in this budget agreement. Because of the efforts of President \nClinton and a number of my colleagues in Congress, the child tax credit \nwill be expanded to cover 7.5 million more children from lower income \nworking families than would have been covered under the congressional \nleadership's original plan. In my State alone, upwards of 692,000 \nfamilies will be eligible for this credit--almost 80 percent of \nfamilies in my State.\n  We succeeded in making this credit largely refundable against income \nand payroll taxes, benefiting 27 million families with 45 million \nchildren. Clearly, Mr. President, this is great news for the millions \nof families in America who, although they work very hard, still \nstruggle just to make ends meet.\n  Mr. President, this bill clearly reflects our commitment to expanding \neducational opportunity, as it is the largest investment in higher \neducation since the GI bill in 1945.\n  There are few issues more critical to American families than \neducation. I think we can all agree that unless we tap and nurture the \ntalents and energies of all our people, we won't be able to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century. This budget agreement recognizes this \nby providing American families with more than $35 billion in tax relief \nfor education.\n  The bill before us today provides increased funding for Head Start, \nprovides the largest Pell grant increase in two decades, includes \ncommunity service loan forgiveness, and allows students to deduct the \ninterest on their college loans. Further, this bill includes a $1,500 \nHOPE scholarship credit for the first 2 years of college, and provides \na credit for the second 2 years of college and for life-long learning, \nas well. For Connecticut, this package means that as many as 149,000 \nstudents will benefit--85,000 more Connecticut students than under the \nRepublican proposal.\n  This bill also provides targeted tax relief to middle class \ninvestors, small businesses and family farms.\n  It reduces the capital gains tax rate in a way that encourages longer \nterm investments and in a way that provides relief to a growing \npercentage of middle-class Americans reporting capital gains income on \ntheir tax return. And\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\nwe provide measured relief without indexing these gains for inflation, \na provision originally contained in the congressional leadership's \nproposal, which surely would have threatened to throw our budget out of \nbalance.\n  Further, if you've worked to own a home, and that home has increased \nin value, we exempt up to half a million dollars of that increase from \ncapital gains taxes. This provision allows homeowners to reap the \nrewards of home ownership, and encourage more people to buy homes. This \npart of the tax package is particularly meaningful to homeowners in my \nState of Connecticut who were hurt disproportionately during the \nrecession of 1991.\n  And, if you're a farmer of a small business owner, we exempt the \nfirst $1.3 million of the value of your estate from taxation, so you \ncan pass on the fruits of your labor to your children.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, the bill before us today, makes a difference \nto small investors, small businesses, and hard-working Americans. It is \nreasonable and responsible, and recognizes the value of providing \nmeasured relief to American families, small businesses, and family \nfarms. But fundamentally, this bill isn't about statistics. It's about \nmeeting vital family needs and providing additional resources to meet \nthe many challenges our working families face. This bill strengthens \nfamilies and puts working families first.\n  And yet, the underlying bill is not a perfect bill. In the midst of \nproviding tax relief that is fair and equitable, I believe it is \nimperative that we not lose sight of our obligation to enact \nlegislation that is fiscally responsible. We should be enacting \nlegislation that will allow us to maintain the fiscal discipline we \nhave worked so hard to achieve in recent years, dating back to the wise \ndecisions we made in 1993.\n  That is way I offered an amendment during the budget reconciliation \nnegotiations which demanded we adhere to our budget agreement in which \nwe agreed to a net tax cut of $85 billion through 2002, and not more \nthan $250 billion through 2007. And that is why, today, I have serious \nconcerns about Joint Committee on Taxation reports estimating that \nthese tax cuts will cost $95 billion through 2002 and upwards of $275 \nbillion by 2007.\n  Nevertheless, this bill takes several steps to ensure that the cost \nof the tax cuts will not spiral in later years. Most significantly, it \ndrops the proposal to index capital gains. In addition, it puts income \nlimits on individual retirement accounts.\n  Mr. President, we must be committed to preserving the integrity of \nthe balanced budget agreement. The American people will not be served \nby a budget that reaches balance briefly in 2002 and then veers back \nout of balance afterward.\n  Mr. President, on the whole, this agreement is more fair and more \ndisciplined than any in recent history. The bill before us today does \nmore for working families, more for small businesses, and more for \nfamily farms. We have stimulated jobs and growth, and encouraged \ninvestment, and most importantly, we have put America's families and \ntheir children first. I am proud of these accomplishments, Mr. \nPresident, and, let us not forget that we did it all while balancing \nthe budget, benefiting Americans today and in the future.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to discuss an issue that \nrelates to Medicare's diabetes self-management benefit.\n  As my colleagues know, the reforms we have under consideration \ninclude a provision which would extend Medicare coverage of blood \nglucose monitors and testing strips to type II diabetics. This seems to \nmake abundant good sense.\n  The provision would also reduce the national payment limit for \ntesting strips used by diabetics by 10 percent beginning in 1998.\n  I have some concern about these policies especially since the \nincidence of diabetes is growing and people are being afflicted at \nearlier ages. For example, it is an epidemic among Indians.\n  It could also impact diabetic patients. This 10 percent reduction in \npayment for diabetes test strips could prove harmful to many durable \nmedical equipment [DME] suppliers.\n  I call to my colleagues attention, a study that is currently being \nconducted for the Health Care Financing Administration by AFYA to \nconsider the reasonableness of Medicare payments for approximately 100 \nspecific DME items, including diabetic test strips.\n  Once that study is completed, Congress may want to revisit this \nissue.\n  By itself, the 10 percent reduction may cause some DME suppliers, \nparticularly the smaller operations, to sustain financial losses such \nthat they no longer supply test strips. Also, some suppliers may stop \ntaking assignment of diabetic test strips because they cannot afford to \nfurnish Medicare products under the reduced pricing scheme. This could, \nin turn, lead to a situation whereby the Medicare diabetic patient will \npay the difference and may have to pay the full amount up front and \nwait for Medicare to reimburse the reduced share.\n  Finally, another issue which I think is worth mentioning relates to \nhome oxygen. I have received many calls and letters from constituents \nwho oppose a reduction in the monthly payment amount for home oxygen. \nThis bill reduces reimbursements for home oxygen by 25 percent in 1998 \nand then an additional 5 percent in 1999.\n  I would hope that my colleagues would take these matters under \nconsideration, and that they join me at some future point in giving \nthese matters further consideration.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the impending passage of this balanced \nbudget agreement is a historic moment for our nation. This legislation \nrepresents a real victory for all Americans. Children, students, \nfamilies and senior citizens will all benefit from our actions today. \nThis budget not only puts us on a financially responsible path but also \nprotects the Federal social safety net.\n  This legislation is built on consensus, and no plan built on \ncompromise can make everyone happy. There are certain provisions that I \nwish were in this bill and there are other provisions that I feel could \nhave been changed. Overall, though this budget package provides \nbenefits that will strengthen our economy, reduce the tax burden on \nindividuals and families, and eliminate spiraling deficits.\n  The measure provides tax relief to families and children, with a \npermanent $500 per child tax credit under the age of 17. The bill \ncreates incentives for savings and investment with expanded individual \nretirement accounts, reducing capital gains and increased deductions \nfor small business. But most importantly, this legislation furthers our \nefforts to provide health care and education for all children.\n  This conference report will establish a new $24 billion health care \ncoverage program for as many as 5 million uninsured children. I would \nlike to express my special appreciation to Senator Roth and Senator \nLott for including in the children's health initiative a provision that \nwill allow States, like Vermont, whose Medicaid coverage for children \nalready extends beyond 200 percent of poverty, to cover children with \nincomes 50 percentage points higher than their Medicaid cutoff. I feel \nthis section will give these pioneering States the necessary \nflexibility and resources to continue moving forward toward the goal of \nensuring that all children have access to quality health care.\n  With $35 billion in education tax incentives, the bill will ease the \nburden on students and families paying for higher education. These tax \nincentives will help families save for college, pay tuition costs while \nstudents are in college, and repay funds borrowed to pay for college. \nThe bill's education tax incentives are not limited to college \nexpenses. The bill has a life-long education tax credit to help workers \nwho want to brush-up on their job skills or learn new employment \nskills.\n  In addition, the children's tax credit in this bill will result in \nmeaningful savings for families. For a family with two children, this \nbill will result in a 1999 tax bill that's $1,000 less than they would \nhave otherwise owed.\n  This agreement also recognizes the critical relationship between \neducation and our national economic well-being. In a day and age beset \nby downsizing, when job skills are constantly becoming outmoded by \ntechnological advances and break-throughs in learning, education will \nbe a lifetime endeavor. I am happy that the bill recognizes this, and \nmakes lifetime learning more easily affordable. Aid to education is not\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\nlimited to tax incentives; the tax incentives are supplemented by \nmeaningful spending increases for scholarship grants and literacy \nprograms. Throughout my years in the Congress, first on the Education \nand Labor Committee in the House, and now as chairman of the Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, I have worked to make education \nmore readily affordable and more easily accessible. This bill \nrepresents an important step in that direction.\n  During my tenure in Congress I have tried hard to put our fiscal \nhouse in order while protecting programs that are important to the \nnation. I am pleased to cast my vote in favor of this agreement, which \nI believe does just that. Today, this body is taking a giant step \ncloser to insure the future economic security of our children and the \nnext generation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe historic legislation we are considering today, which will have \nprofound effects throughout our Nation as we near the first balanced \nFederal budget since 1969. As a longtime supporter of the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment and the line-item veto, I am \nparticularly pleased to have this opportunity to reflect on the \nsignificance of this occasion.\n  I think the 5-year glide path to a balanced budget is very important \nfor America. I think the two big priorities for America today are \neducation and health care. I like what is being done here and in the \ntax reconciliation bill we will be considering, but I remain a little \nworried about our seniors. We might have to make some modifications for \ntheir benefit in the future after we see how some of these changes are \nimplemented. I will be keeping a close eye on this issue as I travel in \nPennsylvania's 67 counties, where we have more than 2 million senior \ncitizens.\n  From the beginning, I have said that a balanced budget could only \nbecome reality with support from the center. There is now a feeling \naround Congress that the American people are sick of all the bickering \nand they have asked us for action on the issues that mean the most to \nthem, chief among them balancing our Nation's budget. Since 1995, I \nhave worked with the Chafee-Breaux centrist coalition to try to \nreconcile the differences between the two parties on the major \nentitlement and tax issues which we needed to address if we were going \nto achieve a balanced budget. I was proud of my association with this \ngroup of 22 Senators, which got 46 votes for its substitute budget \nresolution in 1996 and showed that there was bipartisan support for a \ncentrist-oriented plan.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 represents what I have been saying \nfor several years, that the budget can be balanced without leaving a \nbad taste in the minds of the public toward Republicans. It can be done \nwithout appearing insensitive toward the poor, elderly, children, and \nwithout appearing unconcerned with education, health care, and the \nenvironment. The budget agreement reflected in this legislation \nrepresents the traditional Republican objective of balancing spending \nand revenues and reflects my approach of moderation within fiscal \nconservatism, or what has been termed compassionate conservatism.\n  I would not further that this legislation reflects my preference for \ncutting with a scalpel, not a meat ax. As chairman and ranking member \nof the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee, in the past 2 years Senator Harkin and I have succeeded \nin terminating 126 programs totaling $1.4 billion using this scalpel \napproach. The patience that has been demonstrated by our Budget \nCommittee chairman, Senator Pete Domenici and the other key budget \nnegotiators reflects their action to achieve the level of savings \nneeded to bring the budget into balance.\n  Throughout the budget process, I have sought to work with my \ncolleagues to protect programs and funding which was particularly \nimportant to groups of Americans least able to fend for themselves. In \nparticular, I am pleased to note that the Conference Report includes \nthe $1.5 billion in Medicare premium subsidies which are essential for \nthe estimated 3.2 million American seniors who earn in the area of \n$9,000 to $12,000 annually. I initiated an effort with several of my \nRepublican colleagues to restore these funds when they were initially \nleft out of this bill as reported out of the Finance Committee. After \nfive of us wrote Majority Leader Trent Lott to urge that the funds be \nrestored to the bill, the leadership accepted our request and added the \n$1.5 billion. Once the funds were restored, however, I still had some \nconcerns about the allocation of these funds and whether the subsidies \nwould continue as long as the premium increases. During Senate floor \nconsideration of the bill, I was pleased to offer an amendment \ncosponsored by Senator Rockefeller, Santorum, Snowe, Collins, and \nCampbell to make the premium subsidies permanent as is the premium \nincrease. Although a majority of Senators voted with us, the amendment \nonly received 52 of the 60 votes needed to meet certain Budget Act \nprocedural requirements and thus failed to be accepted.\n\n  Among the reforms I supported in the Medicare Program is the expanded \narray of choices from which beneficiaries can obtain coverage. These \nnew Medicare Plus plans will include traditional fee-for-service, \nprovider sponsored organizations, medical savings accounts, private \nplan/health maintenance organizations, and preferred provider \norganizations. Beneficiaries will be given the freedom to choose the \noption which best meets their health care needs. I have also supported \nthe addition of $4 billion in preventive health services to the \nMedicare benefit package, such as coverage of annual screening for \nbreast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, bone density screening, and \ndiabetes self-management services that would include nutrition therapy \nand blood testing strips.\n  This legislation is designed to protect the solvency of Medicare for \n10 more years. I view this program as part of our social contract with \nour senior and believe that we must keep our noses to the grindstone to \ndevelop a means of permanently protecting Medicare so that it remains \navailable to provide adequate health care for future generations of \nAmerican seniors.\n  Another group of Americans I have sought to help in the budget \nprocess are children who do not have access to adequate health care. I \nam quite pleased that the $24 billion child health program included in \nthis legislation has the potential to cover over 5 million children of \nthe working poor who currently lack health insurance. My Healthy \nChildren's Pilot Program Act of 1997 [S. 435] was the first Republican \nbill introduced in the 105th Congress which sought to bridge this \nglaring gap in the Nation's health care system. Although I believe that \nwe could have provided such coverage through a discretionary spending \nprogram that relied on the States to implement creative new programs, I \nfully support the program established under the Balanced Budget Act, \nwhich will direct $24 billion over 5 years to States for the purpose of \nproviding health care to children in low income families who earn too \nmuch for Medicaid, but too little to be able to purchase health \ninsurance. One specific concern of mine as Congress crafted this \nlegislation centered around ensuring that Pennsylvania's vanguard \nCaring and BlueCHIP children's health programs were protected rather \nthan superseded by a new Federal bureaucracy. I am pleased to see that \nthis bill specifically grandfathers Pennsylvania's programs, \nrecognizing them as examples of success and innovation.\n  During consideration of the Senate version of this legislation, there \nwere several provisions I could not support and I am pleased that the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 does not contain them. In particular, these \nwere the provisions to extend the Medicare age of eligibility from 65 \nto 67, to impose new copayments on Medicare beneficiaries receiving \nhome health services, and to means-test Medicare premiums. As the final \ncompromise legislation demonstrates, it is possible to reach the goal \nof a balanced budget while also protecting access to quality health \ncare, affordability, and choice in the Medicare program. This bill will \nalso begin what I hope is a bipartisan process to address the long term \nimplications of the baby boom generation for the Medicare program by \nestablishing a\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\nMedicare Commission which will report to Congress with recommendations \non how to ensure Medicare program solvency well into the 21st Century.\n  Another issue which I have worked on is preserving funding for \nPennsylvania under the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital \nProgram, which reimburses States for their payments to hospitals for \nmedical treatment for low income Americans. Of particular importance to \nPennsylvania were the proposed restrictions on the use of funds by \nStates to reimburse Institutes of Mental Disease [IMD's]. While we were \nable to convince Chairman Roth to delay the restrictions by 1 year \nduring Senate floor consideration of the bill, I continue to be \ntroubled that this legislation unfairly penalizes Pennsylvania by \nlimiting its ability to spend Federal resources on IMD's. I have worked \nwith Gov. Tom Ridge and Senator Rick Santorum to seek modifications to \nthese legislative provisions and would note that Pennsylvania faced \nlosses of as much as $1.7 billion under an early draft of the Medicaid \nreform proposal and will instead face reductions in the area of $131 \nmillion. I am not satisfied with the proposed reforms in this program \nand, since the IMD restrictions do not go into effect until fiscal year \n2000, I will work closely with Governor Ridge and Senator Santorum to \nsee what we can do to ensure that Pennsylvania receives its fair share \nof Medicaid DSH funds in the outyears.\n\n  In closing, I would note that as with any comprehensive reform \nlegislation, it will take some time to determine what, if any, \nmodifications will be needed to ensure that we protect seniors, \nchildren, and others who rely on the Federal and State programs that \nconstitute our social safety net. However, on the whole, this is a good \npiece of legislation which moves us toward the goal of balancing the \nFederal budget by 2002.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the balanced budget agreement before us is \nan historic document. The agreement puts us on the path to a balanced \nbudget in 2002, the first balanced budget since 1969.\n  The agreement contains significant changes for Medicare, Medicaid, \nand welfare. The Children's Health Insurance Initiative is also a \nmomentous move toward ensuring all children in this country will not \nwant for lack of health care.\n  This was my first year as a new member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. The committee spent many hours debating and considering the \nmyriad of issues involved in developing the Medicare and other health \nareas of this budget bill. These issues were complex, the debate long, \nand decisions very difficult to make. As with any far-reaching \nlegislation, no one, including myself, agrees with every provision \nincluded.\n\n\n                   New Medicare Choices and Benefits\n\n  New choices are provided for Medicare beneficiaries to choose how \nthey would like to receive their health care. These choices include: \ncontinuing the traditional fee-for-service Medicare; provider sponsored \norganizations which are similar to HMO's, except they are operated by \nmedical providers rather than insurance companies; private fee-for-\nservice; preferred provider organizations which allow beneficiaries to \nchoose doctors outside their HMO network; continuing current private \nplan HMO's that generally provide more benefits, including prescription \ndrug coverage, than traditional Medicare, at a lower cost. A medical \nsavings account combined with a $6,000 high-deductible policy option \nwill be tested as a demonstration project limited to 390,000 \nparticipants. This $6,000 deductible is nearly three times as high as \nthe maximum deductible allowed in last year's health care reform law. I \nsupported the Senate version which would have limited the demonstration \nto 100,000 participants, and established a cap on out-of-pocket \nexpenses of $3,000, which were not accepted in the final budget \nagreement. With the bill's high deductible, there is serious concern \nregarding whether any but the most affluent Medicare beneficiaries will \nbe able to choose this option, and if they do, what the impact of the \nloss of those generally healthier and younger beneficiaries will be on \nthe traditional Medicare fee-for-service option expenses.\n\n  Medicare beneficiaries' future health will be improved with the \ninclusion of new preventive health care services. These new services \ninclude mammography, PAP smears, diabetes, prostate and colorectal \nscreening, bone density measurement, and vaccines.\n\n\n                  medicare fraud and abuse prevention\n\n  This budget bill also builds on efforts to reduce Medicare fraud and \nabuse efforts included in last year's Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act. A new toll-free telephone number is established to \nallow Medicare beneficiaries to report fraud and billing irregularities \ndirectly to the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human \nServices. It is hoped the toll-free hotline will encourage \nbeneficiaries to be even more diligent in reviewing their Medicare \nbills, and reporting any discrepancies. Additionally, Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be given the right to request an itemized billing \nstatement for their Medicare services.\n  Suppliers of durable medical equipment must provide information as to \npersons with an ownership or control interest in the company. These \nsuppliers, and home health agencies, comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facilities and rehabilitation agencies are all required \nto post a surety bond of $50,000. These are efforts to ensure only \nlegitimate Medicare providers are certified, and to reduce the \nincidences of fraud and abuse in these services.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services will be able to refuse to \nenter into, or renew a Medicare agreement with a provider, either an \nindividual or an entity, who has been convicted of a felony under \nFederal or State law for an offense which would be inconsistent with \nthe best interests of Medicare beneficiaries. If a provider has been \nmandatorily excluded from participating in Federal and State health \ncare programs because of a conviction involving Medicare or Medicaid \nprogram-related crimes, patient abuse, or felonies related to health \ncare fraud or controlled substances, the exclusion shall be for a \nperiod of 10 years if the provider has been convicted on only one \noccasion, and permanently excluded if the provider has been convicted \non two or more occasions. Its the old three strikes and you are out \nreapplied.\n\n\n                       long-term medicare reforms\n\n  As a member of the senate Finance Committee, I supported efforts that \nwould have begun to make long-term Medicare reforms. I am disappointed \nnone of these proposals were included in this final budget.\n  Over the past 2 years, the rapidly rising costs of the Medicare \nprogram, and its future solvency, have been major concerns. The 1997 \nMedicare Trustees Report concluded the Medicare part A trust fund, \nproviding hospital service coverage, is likely to become insolvent as \nearly as 2001. This balanced budget does buy us approximately 10 more \nyears of trust fund solvency. But unless we promptly address the \nsolvency of Medicare, we will still face a medical and fiscal crisis as \nthe baby boomers retire, and begin to rely upon Medicare.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Medicare costs in 1997 \nwill be $212 billion. In 2007, the costs are estimated to total over \n$467 billion--well over a 100 percent increase.\n  In the year 2011 alone, the year the baby boom generation begins to \nreach 65 years of age, more than two and a half million individuals \nwill become Medicare eligible. Medicare cannot come close to covering \nthese future retirees, as well as those already retired, unless changes \nare made. This is the harsh reality we should have dealt with in this \nbudget.\n  I firmly believe a reduction in Medicare benefits for eligible \nbeneficiaries should not occur. Yet, to ensure these health care \nbenefits continue, changes must be made elsewhere in the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Raising the Medicare eligibility age to coincide with the Social \nSecurity eligibility age, and increasing the costs of the Medicare Part \nB--the physician and outpatient services coverage--monthly premium of \nthe most affluent 4 percent of all Medicare recipients are two ways to \nensure our Medicare program remains solvent past 2001--and that \nbenefits are not reduced for all older Americans.\n  In fact, in 1983, during the Reagan administration, similar age \neligibility requirement changes were made for Social Security \nbeneficiaries to help prolong the solvency of that program as well.\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\n  The Senate bill would have increased the age of eligibility for \nMedicare from 65 years to 67 years of age. Yet this shift would have \ntaken place during a span of 25 years--from 2003 to 2027--and would not \nhave affected anyone who is currently receiving Medicare benefits.\n  One of the major criticisms of the Medicare age increase proposal was \nthat it could leave many seniors without adequate health care coverage \nif they choose to retire earlier. Currently, if an individual wants to \nretire earlier than the Social Security retirement age of 65 years, the \nindividual takes a reduction in his or her Social Security benefit. We \ncould allow early retirees, who are Social Security eligible, to buy in \nto Medicare coverage earlier. This may, however, require higher costs \nfor such beneficiaries, until they reached the age of full eligibility \nfor Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\n  This final budget bill has bought us some time to deal responsibly \nwith preserving Medicare. A national bipartisan commission will be \nestablished to recommend long-term Medicare reforms to ensure this \nvital health care program can meet the challenge of providing coverage \nfor the baby boom generations. When this commission reports its \nrecommendations, Congress must act upon its reform recommendations \nimmediately. And it would be irresponsible of Congress not to make the \ntough, often unpopular, decisions that are going to be necessary to \npreserve this vital program. The sooner these reforms are made, the \nsooner we can ensure future Medicare beneficiaries will not face a \nreduction in covered medical services, and that Medicare survives into \nthe 21st century.\n\n\n                           CHILD HEALTH CARE\n\n  This budget agreement is also a pivotal effort to address the needs \nof the 10 million uninsured children in this country. An unprecedented \n$24 billion will be flowing to States to provide health care to these \nchildren. This new child health program will be paid for, in part, by a \n10-cent-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax for the years 2000 and \n2001, and another 5-cent-per-pack increase in 2002, for a total of 15 \ncents. Although I would have preferred the full 20-cent increase in the \ncigarette tax that the Senate included in its version of the budget \nbill, this increase will still provide a substantial increase in the \nnumber of children receiving health care coverage.\n  I am, however, concerned with these final child health provisions. \nThe Senate child health proposal would have ensured children had a \ncomprehensive benefits package. Children's health care coverage would \nhave specifically included such services as vision and hearing, \nprescription drugs, and mental health care. Instead, States will decide \nwhat benefits to offer.\n  The importance of a comprehensive benefit package, tailored to the \nspecific health care needs of children, is key to ensuring that these \nnew health care funds are used as to benefit children. This final bill \nprovides States a number of options to determine a benefits package.\n  As a former Governor, I understand the desires of State Governors who \nwant freedom to determine how to use the Federal child health funds. \nHowever, the goal, first and foremost, is to provide children \nthroughout this country the health care services they need. Given the \namount of Federal child health funds going out to the States, and the \ncreativity shown in the past by some States in skirting restrictions \nplaced on Federal funding, I am concerned some of these vital funds \ncould find their way to other areas.\n  Such a diversion of funds occurred several years ago, when Congress \nappropriated money for the States to begin receiving Medicaid DSH--\ndisproportionate share hospital--Federal funds. This money was to help \nhospitals providing care to the poorest and most vulnerable people \ncover their increased expenses. Some States' money found its way into \nState road construction budgets among other uses. Congress had to step \nin and take corrective action.\n  This budget bill will allow States to use 10 percent of the child \nhealth initiative funds for noncoverage purposes, which are defined as \nadministration and health care outreach. That 10 percent is $2.4 \nbillion of the total Child Health Care Initiative--and that is \nsignificant money. Congress must ensure States use all of the child \nhealth funds for the purpose for which they are intended--to provide \nthe children of this country comprehensive health care coverage period.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  As historic as this balanced budget may be, it marks a first step \ntoward what must be done to assure the millions of Americans who are \ncurrent and future Medicare beneficiaries that their health care \nbenefits will continue. There is much work yet to be done to honor the \ncommitment this country has made to Medicare to assure not only that \nthese health care services continue, but the quality and scope of care \nare sustained, and the rampant fraud and abuse of the program is \nbrought to a halt. Necessary reforms are required. The sooner they are \nimplemented, the sooner Medicare can be assured of continuing into the \n21st century. We are taking a major step toward this goal today, but \nmany steps are yet to be taken.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the impending passage of this balanced \nbudget agreement is a historic moment of our Nation. The vote that my \ncolleagues and I are making in support of this balanced budget \nagreement is a vote that each American should take pride in. This \nlegislation represents a real victory for all Americans. Children, \nstudents, senior citizens, and families will all benefit from our \nactions today. This conference report will put this country on a \nfinancially responsible path while also taking the necessary steps to \nprotect Medicare and provide health care coverage to our Nation's \nuninsured children.\n  This legislation is built on consensus, and no plan built on \ncompromise can make everyone happy. There are certain provisions that I \nwish were in this bill and there are other provisions that I feel could \nhave been changed. However, it is more important that we move the \nprocess forward instead of shutting down the system. Overall, though \nthis budget package provides benefits that will strengthen our economy, \nreduce the tax burden on individuals and families and eliminate \nspiraling deficits.\n  The measure provides tax relief to families by providing a permanent \n$500-per-child tax credit for children under the age of 17. The bill \ncreates incentives for savings and investment with expanded individual \nretirement accounts, reducing capital gains and increased deductions \nfor small business. The legislation provides for estate tax relief \nwhich will affect many residents of my home state of Vermont. The bill \nwill impose roughly $297 billion in savings over the next 5 years and \n$900 billion over the next 10 years while still protecting programs \nthat are vital to the interest of all Americans. But most importantly, \nthis legislation furthers our efforts to provide health care and \neducation for children.\n  Mr. President, there is no resource more precious than the children \nwho are right now playing in the school yards from Vermont to \nCalifornia. I worked closely with my colleagues Senator Hatch, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Chafee, and Senator Rockefeller to develop legislation \nthat would provide health care coverage for our Nation's uninsured \nchildren. This conference report will establish a new $24 billion \nhealth care coverage program for as many as 5 million uninsured \nchildren. The establishment of this coverage is not the end but only \nthe beginning to ensure that every child born in this country will have \na healthy start in order for them to fulfill their own personal \nAmerican dream.\n  I would like to express my special appreciation to Senator Roth and \nSenator Lott for including in the Children's Health Initiative a \nprovision that will allow States like Vermont whose Medicaid coverage \nfor children already extends beyond 200 percent of poverty to cover \nchildren with incomes 50 percentage points higher than their Medicaid \ncutoff. I feel this section will give these pioneering States the \nnecessary flexibility and resources to continue moving forward toward \nthe goal of ensuring that all children have access to quality health \ncare. In addition, the children's tax credit in this bill will result \nin meaningful savings for families. For a family with two children, \nthis bill will result in a 1999 tax bill that's $1,000 less than they \nwould have otherwise owed.\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\n  The children's tax credits in this bill will result in meaningful \nsavings for families with children. For a family with two children, \nthis bill will result in a 1999 tax bill that's $1,000 less than they \nwould have otherwise owed. In addition, the bill recognizes the \ncritical relationship between education and our national economic well-\nbeing. With $39 billion in education tax incentives, the bill will ease \nthe burden on families paying for higher education. These tax \nincentives will help families save for college, pay tuition costs while \nstudents are in college, and repay funds borrowed to pay for college. \nAnd the bill's education tax incentives are not limited to college \nexpenses. The bill has a life-long education tax credit to help workers \nwho want to brush up on their job skills or learn new employment \nskills.\n  This agreement also recognizes the critical relationship between \neducation and our national economic well-being. In a day and age beset \nby downsizing, when job skills are constantly becoming outmoded by \ntechnological advances and breakthrough in learning, education will be \na lifetime endeavor. I am happy that the bill recognizes this, and \nmakes lifetime learning more easily affordable. Aid to education is not \nlimited to tax incentives; the tax incentives are supplemented by \nmeaningful spending increases for scholarship grants and literacy \nprograms. Throughout my years in the Congress, first on the Education \nand Labor Committee in the House of Representatives, and now as \nchairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have \nworked to make education more readily affordable and more easily \naccessible. This bill represents important steps in that direction.\n  During my tenure in Congress, I have tried hard to put our fiscal \nhouse in order while protecting programs that are important to the \nNation. I am pleased to cast my vote in favor of this agreement, which \nI believe does just that. This plan finally puts four walls and a roof \non a foundation toward a balanced budget that this Congress has been \nbuilding over the last 15 years. Today, this body is taking giant steps \ncloser to ensure the future economic security of our children and the \nnext generation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, a little over two weeks ago, I sat down \nwith several Albuquerque families who are working hard to pay the \nbills, put food on the table, and give their children a good home. \nAmong those gathered at the meeting, there was Carol Howell, who is \nstruggling with the help of her husband to make ends meet and raise \nfour children. And there was Jan Usinger, a divorced mother with a \nMasters degree in French, working three jobs to build a decent life for \nher three children.\n  Each of the families I met were perfect examples of who should reap \nthe benefits of any tax relief package produced by Congress. And yet, \nwhat brought us together that day was the sad fact that none of these \nfamilies would be able to claim the highly-touted $500 per child tax \ncredit in the bill passed by the Senate --not because they earned too \nmuch money, but because they earned too little. In the eyes of some in \nCongress, these families were not rich enough to deserve the full child \ntax credit. Some even argued that to give hard-working families making \nabout $25,000 a year a tax break was like giving them welfare.\n  I'm pleased to say that in the heated debate that took place in \nWashington over who should be allowed to claim the child tax credit, \nthese families finally won--and they won big. Jan Usinger, who would \nhave seen only $6 in tax relief from the child credit under the House \nbill, will now get a tax break of $1,500 in the final bill negotiated \nbetween the President and Congress. That's no small change when you \nconsider the cost of clothing, school supplies and child care.\n  The final tax relief compromise enacted last week is a significant \nvictory for the Usingers, and for the millions of working and middle-\nincome families like them across the country. Some of the more helpful \nprovisions in the bill will help offset the cost of raising children, \nmake college more affordable, and even help adults go back to school \nfor more training. There is also a $24 billion set-aside to provide \nhealth insurance to more children from working families now unable to \nafford it.\n  The child tax credit tops the list of provisions New Mexico families \nwill find most helpful. This new child credit will be available to \nfamilies earning between $15,000 and $30,000, as well as those making \nbetween $30,000 to $150,000 a year. The size of the credit will vary \naccording to the number of children and parents in the family, along \nwith other factors.\n  Best of all, the credit can be used to reduce a family's total \nfederal tax burden--whether it's income taxes or federal payroll taxes. \nThis is a key change from earlier versions of the bill, and it will \nmake a big difference for the nearly three-quarters of lower-income \nworking Americans who pay more payroll taxes than income taxes. \nFurthermore, employers will be instructed to make adjustments on \nwithholding forms so that families can see the benefit of this credit \nas soon as possible.\n  While the economic benefits of a college-educated workforce have \nincreased tremendously over recent years, the financial obstacles have \nincreased even faster. To help make higher education more accessible, \nthe tax bill now includes a $1,500 tax credit for the first two years \nof college, and a credit of up to $1,000 for students after their first \ntwo years of college. Together, these credits would cover nearly all \nthe costs of the average public college in the U.S. Workers can also \nreceive up to $5,250 in employer-provided training each year, without \nhaving to count the benefit as taxable income. At a time when workers \nmust continually update their skills, this break will help them get the \ntraining they need to make it in today's job market.\n  Finally, a major source of economic anxiety for working families is \nthe cost of medical care. Almost 150,000 New Mexico children are \nwithout health insurance, and many of them come from working families \nwho earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford \nhealth insurance for their children. The provision setting aside $24 \nbillion for expanding children's health insurance was designed with \nthese working families in mind. It will provide states like New Mexico \nthe resources to cover these children, giving them access to everything \nfrom routine checkups and antibiotics to emergency medical care. This \nprovision will help more kids develop into healthy adults, and it will \ndo so without imposing unworkable new federal mandates.\n  It's important to note that this tax relief would not be possible or \nresponsible, were we not on the brink of balancing the federal budget. \nIn 1992, our nation ran a whopping $290 billion budget deficit, which \nhas been shaved down to an estimated $45 billion this year. I think it \nis fair to say that if our country had not tightened its belt in the \n1993 budget package to achieve this deficit reduction, interest rates \nwould probably be higher, unemployment higher, and our economic growth \nslower. Now the people who helped sacrifice to get us to the point \nwhere we are today--like the 70 percent of New Mexicans earning under \n$30,000 a year--are getting some deserved tax relief.\n  This tax deal is not perfect, and it certainly hasn't done much to \nmake the tax code any simpler. But this final compromise does deliver \nwhere it matters. It provides relief not just to upper-income families \nbut to the many new, young families in New Mexico who are working hard \nto deliver a decent quality of life to their children and to provide \nthe educational opportunities and health care support that will lay a \nstrong foundation for their success. In the end, this bill helps us \ninvest in all of our children--and for this reason I think we have \nactually achieved something worthwhile this week in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I do need to make references as well about certain \nprovisions in this tax bill which are very good for small businesses in \nNew Mexico as well as around the nation.\n  First, the bill reinstates the home office business deduction, which \nI know is a very important issue for many self-employed people in our \nstate and many other small business owners.\n  This legislation also includes an important provision phasing in an \nincrease in the self-employed health insurance deduction. The \npercentage of the deduction in 1997 is now at 40%, but it rises to 100% \nby the year 2007.\n  Also, many businesses benefit by investing in continuing education \nprograms for their employees, and this tax\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nbill extends for three more years the tax exclusion for employer-\nprovided educational assistance.\n  It also provides an enhanced deduction which businesses can claim for \nthe donation of computers and technology to schools.\n  Also, very importantly, a provision has been included that I have \nbeen working with a number of Senators over the last year. This \nprovision builds on a small business initiative included in the 1993 \nbudget plan. The original legislation stated that gains from stock held \nmore than five years in publicly traded firms with assets less than $50 \nmillion would be taxed after the sale of stock at 50% of the capital \ngains tax rate. The new provision allows this gain to be rolled over \ninto other small businesses of the same size on a fully tax-deferred \nbasis.\n  This will hopefully keep more capital in the small business sector. \nOvercoming venture capital deficiencies in New Mexico is one of the \nmajor hurdles that our state constantly faces. Hopefully, this \nprovision will do some good for our state.\n  Furthermore, small businesses with average gross receipts of less \nthan $5 million will be exempt from the corporate alternative minimum \ntax. This covers a great majority of New Mexico companies.\n  Also in the estate tax area, owners of qualified family owned \nbusinesses and farms will be able to exclude--starting next year--up to \n$1.3 million of their estate from inheritance tax. This is a very big \nprovision--particularly as the general estate tax will be incrementally \nincreased from $600,000 to $1 million by the year 2006. This family-\nowned estate tax relief puts the entire exclusion in place next year. \nThe requirements are that the family owned business or farm must be at \nleast 50% of the estate and heirs must participate in the business for \n10 years after descendent's death. This provision will help a great \nnumber of small firms, farms, and ranches pass on to their heirs \nestates which often have a vast majority of their value tied up in the \nbusiness. The failure to provide this exclusion in the past has \nunfortunately forced some families to liquidate businesses after the \nprincipal owner died.\n  Also on the farm front, farmers who often face years of boom and bust \nare provided the option of 3-year income averaging for the next two \nyears. I suppose we are going to see if this provides relief to farmers \nand consider whether to extend this option in the years that follow.\n  Finally, the tax deal also includes extension of the research and \nexperimentation credit for another year as well as it extends the \nGeneralized System of Preferences (GSP) through June, 1998. This \nprovision is particularly important to our state's jewelry firms that \nimport some of their stones and materials from lesser-developed \ncountries.\n  These are some of the items that I feel that small businesses should \nknow about. If you download the actual bill from the World Wide Web, \nMr. President (the address is http://speakernews.house.gov/\ntaxfull.htm), you'll be printing 304 pages. My staff had to do this, in \nfact. Hopefully, by highlighting these items, some small businesses \nwon't be completely dependent on H Block and the various computer tax \npackages that sort out this material.\n  I recognize that if the standard of living is going to increase for \ncitizens of this state, small business is going to be the primary \nengine in that effort. In any case, I am happy to report and restate \nthat I think we have actually achieved something worthwhile this week \nin Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8386-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WAIVING THE RULES REGARDING MEDIA CONCENTRATION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to address a provision in the \nreconciliation bill that deals with spectrum. In an ill-advised \nconcession, the Senate accepted a partial waiver of the duopoly and \nnewspaper-broadcast cross-ownership restrictions that will allow \nbroadcasters and newspaper owners in cities with populations over \n400,000 to bid for the returned ``analog'' spectrum in those markets. I \nbelieve this simply is bad policy. As plainly explained in the report, \nthe Senate, like the House--that originally sought an even broader \nwaiver--put revenue concerns first. First, and ahead of what I believe \nto be graver concerns for the intellectual wealth and benefits that \naccrue from a diversity of voices and opinions in a marketplace.\n  Fortunately, although we have, in my view, compromised unacceptably, \nwe have not done so unqualifiedly. The final bill provides for a waiver \nof the duopoly and newspaper-broadcaster cross ownership ban only in \ncases of cities of over 400,000. Moreover, the bill provides only a \none-time waiver, only in large markets, which are likely to have more \n(and more diverse) media, and only under circumstances (the auction of \n``duplicate'' spectrum) in which the number of broadcast voices could \ndouble.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8404-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8404-S8406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with today's passage of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997, the Senate has taken a historic step toward ensuring the \nlong-term solvency of the Medicare program.\n  I am pleased that many of the provisions that I found to be so \nobjectionable when this bill first came to the floor of the Senate one \nmonth ago, have since been removed. In stating my reasons for \noriginally opposing the bill, I shared my deep concern over the \nproposal to raise the age at which individuals are eligible to receive \nMedicare from 65 to 67. The likelihood of these seniors finding \naffordable private insurance would have been slim--many would have been \nforced to forego coverage. It was a wise decision on the part of my \ncolleagues serving as conferees on this bill that they did not decide \nto exacerbate the current problem of lack of health coverage for early \nretirees further with this measure.\n  I am also pleased that a provision that would have required the \npoorest and sickest seniors to pay up to $700 a year in home health \ncosts has also been dropped. Looking to the most vulnerable Medicare \nbeneficiaries to shoulder this level of cost under the guise of \naddressing the long-term financial challenges of this program would \nhave been indefensible.\n  In addition to the removal of these onerous provisions, this \nlegislation has been improved since the vote in the Senate by the \ncommitment to continue Medicaid coverage for the 30,000 disabled \nchildren who will lose their Supplemental Security Income benefits as a \nresult of eligibility changes in the welfare reform bill enacted last \nyear. This provision, which was highlighted as a priority in the \noriginal budget agreement between President Clinton and Congress, was \nnoticeably absent in both the House and Senate bills. Along with \nSenator Conrad, I offered an amendment to continue health insurance for \nthese children and was disappointed to see it fail by only nine votes. \nHowever, I am grateful to the conferees that protection for these \nchildren of working poor families was achieved in the conference \nnegotiations.\n  This legislation will also significantly increase health coverage for \nchildren who currently lack insurance. We certainly have come a long \nway on this issue since the debates of earlier years. Even as recently \nas last year, the question was still whether or not to provide health \ninsurance to our nation's children, rather than how we might accomplish \nthis admirable goal. By adopting the Senate provision, which calls for \n$24 billion for this new initiative, we can now offer the hope to more \nthan seven million children that cost will not be a barrier to securing \nhealth care.\n  Of course, I am disappointed that the important and courageous \nattempt to ask those Americans who can afford to contribute a little \nmore for their health care to do so was dropped. It is important to \nremember that only the wealthiest 8% of seniors would have seen a rise \nin their premiums. I maintain my conviction that the adoption of means \ntesting of Medicare premiums was a step in the right direction toward \nthe long-term solvency of the critically important safety net that \nMedicare provides to millions of senior citizens.\n  I also continue to have significant concerns about the reductions in \nMedicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and managed care \norganizations. In order to ensure that our nation's seniors and lower-\nincome citizens receive the affordable and high-quality\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\ncare they need, health care providers must continue to be adequately \nfunded. I am particularly concerned about the reduction in payments to \nteaching and disproportionate share hospitals. These hospitals serve a \npopulation that is sicker and poorer than most hospitals. Reduction in \npayments of this magnitude threaten the ability of these hospitals to \ncontinue to serve as a safety net for the most vulnerable in our \nsociety.\n  In addition, I am concerned about the impact of the new HMO payment \nstructure on low-income seniors who selected managed care plans because \nthey truly need the additional benefits and low out-of-pocket costs \nthat these plans can offer. These seniors cannot afford the high \ndeductibles and copayments of Medicare fee-for-service, nor can they \nafford to purchase expensive Medigap coverage. While I am pleased that \nCongress has attempted to provide more health care choices for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, I believe that without adequate funding, these choices \nwill not be viable ones.\n  Despite these concerns, this legislation goes a long way toward \nproviding many of our nation's citizens with the care they need and \nexpect from Medicare. I view it as an important step toward ensuring \nthat Medicare is here to serve future generations of Americans. It is \nfor this reason, Mr. President, that I am pleased to support the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, earlier this week, the \nWhite House and the Congress reached a historic agreement that will \nbalance the budget by 2002. Today, I rise in support of the portion of \nthe deal that provides tax cuts to American families and small \nbusinesses: the Taxpayer Relief Act, H.R. 2014. After enduring sixteen \nyears without any tax relief, Americans will finally benefit from tax \ncuts that will affect many aspects of their lives. Under our tax \npackage, not only will taxpayers immediately see their tax bill go \ndown, but saving for retirement, paying for college, and investing for \nthe future will be much easier. I am encouraged and pleased that the \nRepublican-led Taxpayer Relief Act provides $95 billion in tax cuts \nover five years and represents an improved standard of living for \ntaxpayers at every stage of life.\n  This tax relief comes at a time when the nation's tax burden is at an \nall time high. Partly due to President Clinton's tax hike back in 1993, \ntoday's taxpayers face a combined federal, state, and local tax burden \nof nearly 50% of their income--more than the cost of food, clothing, \nand shelter combined. In fact, for every eight hours of work, the \naverage taxpayer spends about three hours just to pay the tax \ncollector. And too many families could not survive without two incomes \njust to make ends meet. We cannot let this situation continue. By \nletting hard-working Americans keep more of their own money, we allow \nthem to preserve their family, prepare for their own future, and invest \nin the nation's economy.\n  The future of the family. I can no longer stand by while families in \nNew Hampshire lose more and more time together because they have to \nwork longer and harder to send their pay to Washington. The Taxpayer \nRelief Act addresses this growing problem in several different ways. \nFirst, taxpayers with young children will get a $500 tax credit for \nevery child. In 1999, a middle-income family in New Hampshire with two \nyoung children will save $1,000 with this credit! Second, the tax \nrelief measure reduces the capital gains rate for taxpayers who invest \nfor their future. If the same New Hampshire family realizes $2,000 in \ncapital gains to help pay for college or buy a home, they will save an \nadditional $100. It would also be easier for this family to sell their \nhome, as the tax package exempts $500,000 of capital gains on the sale \nof a principal residence. Equally important, this tax cut benefits \ntheir grandparents since many senior citizens depend on capital gains \nas a primary source of retirement income. Since 56% of taxpayers with \ngains have incomes of less than $50,000, and the percentage of families \nwho own stock has increased from 32% in 1989 to over 41% today, many \nAmericans will welcome this revision.\n  Our plan also offers relief to parents who face higher expenses as \ntheir children grow older. Families can save for higher education by \ntaking advantage of the plan's education accounts, penalty-free \nwithdrawals for education, or popular tax-free prepaid state tuition \nplans. When the student reaches college, parents receive a HOPE tax \ncredit for tuition and related expenses for four years of college. In \nthe first two years, for example, parents can receive a tax credit up \nto $1,500 to help pay for their child's education. These provisions \nhelp parents in New Hampshire face the challenge of saving and paying \nfor higher education in order to invest in a brighter future for their \nchildren.\n  Preparing for the future. Our savings rate is one of the lowest of \nall industrialized nations partly because too many Americans find it \ndifficult to save for retirement and pay high taxes. Under our Taxpayer \nRelief Act, individuals planning for retirement will benefit from \nexpanded Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Specifically, we \ncreated a new ``back-loaded'' IRA--contributions are not tax-\ndeductible, but withdrawals upon retirement are tax-free if the account \nis held for at least five years. Once the IRA is established, penalty-\nfree withdrawals are allowed for a first-time home purchase or for \nhigher education expenses. In addition, thanks to the efforts of \nSenator Judd Gregg, the bill allows non-working spouses to contribute \nto an IRA whether or not the working spouse is already in an employer-\nsponsored retirement plan. As a result, a New Hampshire couple can make \na yearly tax-deductible IRA contribution of $4,000, rather than just \n$2,000. After 35 years at a 7.5% rate of return, they will have saved a \nnice retirement nest egg totaling $617,000!\n  Investing in the future. Fortunately, small businesses will finally \nget a well-deserved break under the Taxpayer Relief Act. Under the \nbill, the home office deduction is expanded to help people who work at \nhome. In addition, the increase in the health insurance premium \ndeduction for self-employed individuals is phased in more quickly, \nrising from 40% this year to 80% in 2006. And by 2007, the premium is \nfully deductible. Most important to many New Hampshire families I talk \nto, the estate tax changes also help small businesses. Now, parents who \nwish to pass on their small, family-owned business or farm to their \nchildren can do so knowing that the first $1.3 million will be excluded \nfrom the extremely high inheritance tax.\n  Finally, the tax package addresses the need to encourage saving and \ninvestment by cutting the capital gains rate from 28% to 20% (and from \n15% to 10% in the lower bracket) for sales after May 6, 1997. The \ncurrent high rates discourage the risk taking and creativity necessary \nto achieve increased productivity and prosperity. A lower capital gains \nrate, however, will make it easier to free up capital to invest in \nresearch, technology and equipment; increase worker productivity; and \nultimately create higher paying jobs. Without a doubt, this pro-growth \ninitiative will enhance U.S. competitiveness.\n  I wish I could report the same degree of satisfaction with the final \nversion of the social spending component of this effort. When I voted \nfor an earlier version of this portion of the package, I did so with \nthe hope that the conference negotiations would result in its \nimprovement. I regret that the social spending provisions produced as a \nresult of negotiations with President Clinton failed to live up to that \nhope.\n  The conference report on H.R. 2015 contained many valuable \nprovisions. I am pleased that Medicare beneficiaries will have more \nchoice about the type of health care delivery plan in which they will \nbe enrolled, including--for 390,000 seniors--the option to open Medical \nSavings Accounts. I welcome the creation of a bipartisan commission to \naddress Medicare's long-term problems. And I believe that the effort to \nreform Medicaid undertaken in H.R. 2015 is overdue.\n  Unfortunately, however, H.R. 2015 fails sufficiently to move toward \nthe fundamental, structural reforms in Medicare we all know will be \nrequired to ensure the retirement security of future generations. \nFurthermore, I had serious concerns about the fiscal and social damage \nwe risk doing by retreating from welfare reform and by creating new \nentitlement, particularly a flawed child health entitlement which \nsome--inside and outside of government--plan to use as the foundation \nof\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\na government-run national health care system. Ultimately, these \nreservations dictated a vote against this portion of the legislation.\n  I have been a strong advocate for a balanced budget, tax relief, and \nentitlement reform for the past thirteen years and I am elated that we \nhave finally made it here. I support the tax cut portion of the \nBalanced Budget Act, which provides $95 billion in tax cuts for \nAmerican families including a $500 per child tax credit, tuition tax \ncredits, IRA expansion to include non-working spouses, a capital gains \nreduction to create jobs, and reductions in the inheritance tax. These \ninitiatives are long overdue, and I am proud to be an early and vocal \nsupporter of tax relief. However, I am concerned that the spending \nportion of the budget deal creates a new entitlement program, threatens \nto move us toward government-run health care, and significantly \nincreases social spending which could negatively impact the Balanced \nBudget Agreement.\n  Given that President Clinton submitted a budget earlier this year \nwhich would have added $200 billion to the deficit, the Republican-led \nCongress can take pride in this final agreement that implements the tax \ncuts fought for by our party for so long. The Tax Relief Act will help \nAmerican families keep more of what they earn, save for their \nretirement, and promote job creation and economic growth. I support a \nbalanced budget and look forward to voting to give New Hampshire \nfamilies their first tax cut in sixteen years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8404-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8406-S8410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to comment on Title XI of \nthis legislation, the District of Columbia Revitalization Act. This is \na major piece of legislation, and in many ways a major accomplishment, \ngiven that it was hammered out by a broad group of interested parties, \nincluding members and staff from the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nover a relatively short period of time. Agreement on this package was \npreceded earlier this year by considerable work in the Governmental \nAffairs Subcommittee chaired by Senator Brownback. Similar efforts were \nundertaken by the House Subcommittee on the District of Columbia. This \nRevitalization package was put together quickly, in a combined effort \nby all concerned parties, because of a mutual recognition that the \nDistrict of Columbia's problems had become untenable. The broad \nrecognition of the magnitude of the problem plus the possibly unique \nopportunity to come to agreement and enact reforms was what led so many \npeople to agree on a package that virtually everyone regards as less \nthan their ideal.\n  One significant concern I have about this package is the major \nfinancial responsibility the Federal taxpayer is undertaking in the \nyears to come. Technically, the D.C. Revitalization package meets the \nscoring requirements of this Balanced Budget Act, but the out-year \ncosts are enormous and have not been dealt with. We are still \nevaluating the full impact of this package, but Members should be aware \nthat the $4.8 billion in pension liability the Federal Government will \nbe assuming is actually closer to $48 billion over time. I do believe \nit may be possible for these potential out-year costs to be reduced. \nThe Revitalization package includes a provision which I requested \nrequiring the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study of the D.C. \npension assets and report back within a year on how the Federal \nGovernment might put them to best use. The Governmental Affairs \nCommittee will then have the opportunity to consider whether additional \nlegislation in this area could improve the financial outlook. The \nAdministration has indicated a willingness to work further on this \nissue with the Committee, and I certainly look forward to that. We \nshould be working together to institute reforms that make the District \nwork independently, not simply encouraging a Federal Government \ntakeover of all of its problems. There are assets currently in the D.C. \npension fund, and rather than simply spending down those assets, we \nshould build upon the assets so the funds are available to make \npayments in the future.\n  Another area in which I question estimates of future costs is with \nthe transfer of D.C. Corrections to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. I \nknow the pressure was intense to close the Lorton Correctional Complex \nin Virginia, but here again this bill makes the federal bureaucracy \nresponsible for absorbing the District's prison population. While the \nbill incorporates provisions for privatization, I believe the record \nwill show that the Bureau of Prisons has consistently stood in the way \nof increased privatization in the Federal prison system. I have no \nreason to believe they will have a different response with regard to \nthe Lorton prisoners.\n  Many may not know that the District of Columbia was already engaged \nin a program to privatize the corrections function and has already \nentered into private contracts for housing 2,400 prisoners. I know well \nfrom my experience in Tennessee that private corrections facilities are \na cost-effective, efficient and safe alternative to publicly-operated \nfacilities. I am disturbed that Congress has substituted its judgment \nfor the District's in this instance without evaluating whether the \nDistrict's privatization initiative for corrections would work.\n  Privatization can save valuable taxpayer dollars. In this instance, \nit is conceivable that the Federal Government could save the entire \n$885 million estimated for construction of new facilities if the \nDistrict were allowed to continue on its current course. Because I \nbelieve these cost savings are important--and because this agreement \nwas reached without sufficient debate--I want my colleagues to be aware \nthat I, and other of my colleagues, want to work on follow-up \nlegislation in this area as well. I think we can do better and I want \nto work toward that end.\n  In conclusion, while this D.C. Revitalization Act is the result of a \nmajor, almost unprecedented effort by many with the best interest of \nthe citizens of the District in mind, the reforms will require some \nadditional thought and work to make the package live up to its full \npotential.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have on each side \nequally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 10 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from New Jersey has 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 of our 10 minutes.\n  First, Mr. President, usually we thank a lot of people. There are so \nmany staff people that I am not going to thank them all, but I will put \nall of their names in the Record. There are so many heroes.\n  But I do want to pay tribute to a staff member from the House. His \nname is Rick May. He has been staff director of the Budget Committee in \nthe House. He is a graduate of Ohio State. He works for Representative \nJohn Kasich. He has been their budget overseer for 10 years, working on \nbudget issues since 1983. He helped put together the alternative that \nJohn Kasich offered in 1989. It started with just 30 votes. John \nKasich's leadership has grown. And right at his right hand has been \nRick May. He is going to join a firm here in town, and I wish him well, \nand want the Senate Record to reflect that we appreciate what he has \ndone.\n  Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I would like to take a \nmoment to thank all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, who \nhave seen me stand in this well time and time again, and have listened \nto me speak about a balanced Federal budget. I want to thank you all--\nfrom the bottom of my heart--for your patience and your support.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Lautenberg. I turn to him and just say thank you.\n  You have been an active member of the Senate Budget Committee for \nmany years, but in your first year as ranking member you have \nrepresented the interests of your party and your constituents in an \nhonest and forthright manner. I have enjoyed working with you.\n  I would like to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nRoth. Few have worked harder or longer to ease the tax burden on \nAmerican families. But the package that you helped fashion, Senator \nRoth, of lowering taxes is a significant step forward. It addressed a \nneed that has been\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\nthere for almost 16 years as far as middle-income America is concerned.\n  The package that you helped fashion in the Finance Committee was not \nonly a significant step in support of lower taxes, but also boldly \naddressed the need to reform Medicare and protect it for those who \ndepend upon it today, and those who will need it in the future. \nUnfortunately, we were not able to hold those reforms in our conference \nbut I believe your action has put us on the road to reform. Thank you \nand your staff for your support.\n  In addition to that, we praise the Finance Committee and its leader \nSenator Roth for reforms in Medicare. The protection of that will \ndepend upon whether these reforms work and whether we are successful in \nthe future in a major reform package for Medicare.\n  Finally, to our leader, Senator Trent Lott. In short, Mr. President, \nwe would not be standing here today, about to pass this historic \nbalanced budget package, if not for the leadership, the support, and \nthe efforts of Trent Lott. As majority leader I don't believe a day has \ngone by when he didn't take some action aimed at producing a balanced \nbudget for the American people. He has been direct, he has been \nfocused, and he has done everything you could ask a leader to do to get \nus to this point. The American people should know, that this bipartisan \nbudget and tax relief package is due, in no small part, to his \ndetermination, his drive, and his commitment. Mr. Leader, I thank you \nfor your leadership and your support.\n  I thank him for the support he has given me. I hope that I have been \nof support and help to him as we move down this course of very \ncomplicated negotiations as evidenced by the size of the bills we have \nand the scope of what we are accomplishing.\n  Mr. President, I began this debate by quoting from a newspaper that \nthis agreement is a big deal. And, I believe it is. Because while it \nhas taken us 7 months to put this specific balanced budget and tax \nrelief package together, the pathway to this point has been years in \nthe making.\n  This legislation is a big deal because we have followed through on \nour bipartisan commitment to implement the bipartisan budget agreement \nreached in May. It is a big deal because it will balance the Federal \nbudget for the first time in 30 years. It is, in short, a great victory \nfor the American people who are entitled to expect of their adult \nleaders that they work together in the best interests of our country.\n  For the past 2 years, many of my colleagues and I have insisted that \nany budget passed through Congress be a balanced budget, one which is \nfiscally responsible, reduces the deficit, protects our children, \nprovides much-needed tax relief for working American families, while \npreserving and strengthening Medicare and encouraging economic growth. \nThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 does just that.\n  It covers hundreds of Government programs; it has taken thousands of \nman-hours to put together; it will help millions of our citizens; and \nsave billions and billions of dollars.\n  The budget we will vote on today is a big deal because it offers \nAmerica hope. But not only is this package a big deal it is also a good \ndeal.\n  It is a good deal because it is a budget designed to help American \nfamilies, to make them more secure--in their homes, in their \ncommunities, in their jobs.\n  It offers them a more efficient government--one dedicated to economic \ngrowth and security, support for our children, and lower taxes on \nAmerica's workers.\n  This budget is a good deal because it recognizes the simple notion \nthat our Government cannot simply go on borrowing and spending our \nchildren's money. It will finally drive a stake through the heart of \nthe Deficit Dragon, and put an end to mounting Federal debt, a Medicare \nsystem that will go bankrupt and a crushing tax burden on those just \nstarting out in life.\n  The budget is a good deal because it will strengthen America. It will \nchange the way our Government works--to make it more efficient, more \nresponsive, and less expensive. And, most importantly, it will ensure a \nbetter future for our children and our Nation.\n  This budget is a good deal because it reflects our commitment to \nfiscal responsibility, generating economic growth, creating good jobs \nwith a future, and protecting the American dream for all our citizens--\nyoung and old alike.\n  This budget is a good deal because it will restore America's fiscal \nequilibrium. It will reverse the tide of 50 years of power flowing for \nthe rest of the country to Washington. We want to provide more freedom \nand opportunity to people at the local level so they might have more \ncontrol over the decisions on programs that effect their lives, their \nchildren, and their communities.\n  This budget is a good deal because it recognizes the need to ease the \ntax burden on America's middle-class working parents, to give them a \n$500-per-child tax credit. This credit will help more than 50 million \nAmerican children in nearly 30 million families. Under this plan a \nfamily with two children under age 17 would receive $1,000 in permanent \ntax relief.\n  It's also a good deal for family farmers and small business men and \nwomen; for homeowners who will someday sell their home; and for all \nthose who want to create incentives for economic growth and job \ncreation.\n  And, this budget is a good deal because while we are working toward  \nbalance and tax relief, we continue to support programs which provide \nneeded services to our citizens and we have been painstakingly careful \nto preserve a safety net for those in need.\n\n  To provide health care for poor children who have none. To strengthen \nMedicare and provide more health care options for our seniors. To \nimprove access to higher education and help parents and our young \npeople pay for college.\n  We support programs aimed at keeping Americans safe--in their home, \nschools, and neighborhoods--by funding needed crime programs.\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, we might wonder where that came from. Was that just a \nstatement here lately when our deficit and debt grew? No, it wasn't. It \nwas made by Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson was a wise man. He wrote \nthe Constitution. And he understood that if you pass on to the next \ngeneration, and the next generation--as he calls it, posterity--the \ndebts of your generation, you take the chance that their life being \nreasonable, good, prosperous, and successful is limited. It limits \ntheir freedom. That is why we have been so worried about the debt, and \nthe annual deficit that contributes to it.\n  Today we will cast a vote of great significance to the future of \nAmerica. It is the vote so many of us have said we wanted--a vote to \nfinally balance the Federal budget.\n  One of freedoms great leaders Winston Churchill told us the ``price \nof greatness is responsibility.'' We in government shoulder that \nresponsibility. We actively seek it by running for public office. I \nbelieve the time has come to shoulder our responsibility and enact a \nbalanced Federal budget.\n  In doing so, we are casting a vote in support of America's future. \nYou may serve here for years and never cast a more important vote. \nBecause you now have a chance to vote to protect America, to strengthen \nit, and improve it.\n  Today we can begin writing a new chapter in American history. That is \nwhy this is a big deal and that is why it is a good deal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a compilation of \nextraneous provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS--H.R. 2015--BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               Conference\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Provision                       Comments/violation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Title III--Communications and Spectrum Allocation\n \nSection 3002(a)(1)(C)(iii)............

Mr. President, I note the presence of our distinguished \nmajority leader. I wanted to reserve the remainder of the time for him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I understand the minority party has about 10 minutes and we have \nabout 5 minutes for you, Mr. Leader.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Lautenberg, is it your desire to yield the \nremaining time to the majority leader?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will in just a couple minutes because I want us to \nbe able to hear from the leadership. I did not know whether or not \nSenator Daschle had some remarks that he wanted to make, but I would \ncertainly be delighted to yield the time so that we apportion it with \nthe time remaining on the majority side, so that the distinguished \nmajority leader has the time that he needs to make his remarks. For the \nmoment, I would just say that we are not done yet, in the words of the \ndistinguished New Jersey philosopher Yogi Berra, who said, ``It's not \nover `til it's over.'' We are getting ever closer. I don't yet feel the \nattention that comes with championship bouts or things of that nature; \nwe have another 10 hours' worth of debate on the second part of the \nreconciliation bill.\n  At this point, I would be happy to yield the time back that we have, \nif the Parliamentarian could tell us how much time is remaining on our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Eight minutes. If I were to give up 5 minutes of that \ntime, how much combined time would the majority leader have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A total of 8 minutes. The majority has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will yield 5 and you have 5 so that the majority \nleader can have 10 minutes.\n  Senator Daschle is on his way, and I know he would like to have a \ncouple words, so we can extend the time if we need for just a couple of \nminutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I indicated last Saturday on a radio show \nthat if we could get this answer to the American people's prayers this \nweek, I would whistle ``Hail to the Chief'' in the Senate.\n  Well, the rules do not allow that. I am afraid that Senator Byrd \nwould come down and chastise me if I whistle, but let me tell you I am \nhumming ``Hail to the Chief'' to the American people today because we \nhave accomplished an awful lot in reaching the agreement on these two \nmajor bills.\n  I was reading an article last night entitled, ``O Ye of Little \nFaith,'' and it made me think about what we have gone through the last \nfew weeks. I just have to ask the Senate this morning, how many of us \nreally, really thought we were going to get this done and that we were \ngoing to get it done this week? Even 1 week ago there were those who \nwere saying, ``Oh, no, you can't get that done before we go out for the \nAugust recess. Wait until September; we will do it then.''\n  But we persisted. We just kept saying we can get through this. We can \ndo this together. We can do the right thing for the American people, \nand we can do it now, because it has been a long time coming.\n  I think it is appropriate that on both sides of the aisle and both \nends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Republicans and Democrats, House and \nSenate, and, yes, the President, all are saying this is good for \nAmerica.\n  It is not utopia. It does not solve all the problems. There are some \nthings in here I do not like. There are some things in here that the \nSenator from New Jersey does not like. But it is a major step forward--\nmaybe not a leap but a major step forward. We are doing some things we \npromised the American people, things that really matter. It matters \nthat we are going to get to a balanced budget, and this time it is with \nhonest numbers. We are really going to do it. And for a lot of reasons \nwe may do it before the year 2002. This is the type of commitment that \nI have not seen in the Congress in a bipartisan way in the 25 years \nthat I have had the honor of serving the people of Mississippi. So I \nthink we should declare this is a very important step forward. It is \nworth having.\n  I was doing an interview yesterday and somebody said: Well, not \nenough in the tax bill, not enough tax relief. Why wasn't there more? \nWhy didn't you insist on this? Why didn't you insist on that?\n  I have a simple question. Is some tax relief better than no tax \nrelief? There are those who would rather have nothing if they cannot \nget everything. Ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues in the Senate, \nthese bills are worth having. I am proud to say that I worked on it for \n8 months of my life. This past Saturday night and Sunday morning, I \nthought we had lost it. I was boiling inside. I was disturbed. I was \nhurt that we were going to let this moment get away from us. But I \nguess maybe after a Sunday morning of reflection and prayer, we said, \nno, we are going to do this. And so we did. The President made a \ncommitment. He wanted to get it done. The leadership in the Congress, \nHouse and Senate, Republican and Democrat, wanted to get it done, and \nthat is why we just did it. We went ahead and did it.\n\n  Let me say to my colleagues here today, there are so many I want to \nthank and congratulate for this step forward, but I have to begin with \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico. None of us has worked \nlonger, none of us has contributed more, none of us knows more about \nwhat is in this bill than Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico. He has \nbeen my confidante. He has been my trusted ally. He has done this when, \nin his own personal life, he has had problems to worry about. And so I \nknow that the President, the Democrats and Republicans on both sides of \nthe aisle, want to say thanks a lot, Pete. You did a great job for your \ncountry.\n  His colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator Lautenberg, \ncould have walked away from this. Even at the last moment, something he \ncares about tremendously, guaranteeing we get the Amtrak funds--it is \nin there, but with a condition--he could have said, if I can't get what \nI want, I am not going to do this.\n  He is not going to do that. He is going to do what is right for his \nState and the country.\n  My colleague, Tom Daschle, from South Dakota, yesterday said some \nvery nice things about my efforts, and I have to say the same about \nhim. He was reliable. He was honest with me. He stayed the course. He \ncame to the meetings. There were some meetings he didn't get to come \nto. A lot of people had an opportunity to get their egos hurt, but \neverybody rose above it.\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\n  Pat Moynihan, Finance Committee, bipartisan effort. We reported one \nof these bills, I think it was 18 to 2, the other one 20 to nothing, \nout of the Finance Committee, but it began with Bill Roth, the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, and the Senator from New York. They made up \ntheir minds they were going to get it done, and they were going to do \nit together, and the rest of us could come along if we wanted. Our \nscholar Senator helped lead the way.\n  I have to say again about Bill Roth, patience, tenacity, he was not \ngoing to relent on getting this job done. And the Finance Committee had \nboth of these bills. No other committee in Congress had to do it that \nway. In the House, it was Ways and Means and Commerce Committee as well \nas Budget. Over here, it was just Budget and Finance. He did a great \njob. We would not have what we have in the tax bill on IRA's; we would \nnot have what we have on Amtrak; we would not have what we were able to \nget on a myriad of issues in this legislation. He did a fantastic job.\n  I could go on down the list, but it truly is a bipartisan effort, and \nI am proud of that. Some people say, ``Why don't you draw the line and \nfight?'' I have done that. Sometimes it is fun, but it doesn't produce \nanything but a fight most of the time.\n  So there will be another day to differentiate between the parties, \nbut today we are going to do what is right for the country. This bill \nis rightly called the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It contains \nliterally hundreds of positions that will get us to that balanced \nbudget. But the bottom line is, it is something the American people \nhave been waiting to hear for many years. We will have a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002 and thereafter.\n  How is that accomplished? Well, it does have spending reductions of \napproximately $270 billion over 5 years. It has $140 billion in \nrestraint on appropriated accounts. It has $132 billion in entitlements \nand net interest savings. It does provide help for children's health, \nand that is a bipartisan effort.\n  Most of us are parents. Most of us have children in our States who \nare not covered. We disagree about how much we should pay for it, how \nmuch should be done, but it is something we care about and we should \ndo. And we get it done in this bill.\n  Now, we give as much flexibility as we can to the States, and that is \nthe way it should be. I have faith in my own Governor and my own \nlegislature. I want these decisions to be made as close to the people \nthat need this help, as close to the children as possible. What they \nneed in West Virginia may be different from what they need in Arizona. \nGive that flexibility so that the decisions are close to the people and \nso it is provided in a way that will really provide the help it should.\n  I want to make this important point about Medicare. We are going to \nimprove Medicare. We are going to save Medicare from going insolvent \nfor another several years at way out to, I believe, close to the year \n2007 probably, and we are going to do it with flexibility. We are going \nto give the seniors a chance to choose. They can go with the old \nsystem; they can go with an HMO; they can go with a professional \nservices organization; they can have medical savings accounts.\n  We have done what we have been arguing about for 4 years. We are \nactually doing it. We are doing what we said we were going to do in \nMedicare and that alone, what we are doing in Medicare alone is worth \nvoting for this legislation. What other problems you may have with this \nbill--some of the changes in welfare, I think, go the wrong direction; \nwe really want to get people from welfare to work. This bill has some \nproblems, but just the Medicare provision makes it worthwhile.\n  We have some savings in Medicaid. The States will have a greater \nability to deliver health services more efficiently for poor persons. \nWhen you look through the list of things that we have done here, in \ninstance after instance, I think we should be very proud.\n  I am here today to tell you that I am going to vote for this \nlegislation with pride, not with fear and trepidation, not with \nreservations or grumpiness because I didn't get everything I wanted, \nbut because the process worked. Our system of Government worked here \nlike I think our forefathers intended for it to work, and we are going \nto produce genuine results that will be of benefit. In this bill and in \nthe other bill we will pass for our children our educational system in \nAmerica, child health care, the guarantee of the important programs \nthat we want for our seniors. From the day we are born to the day we \ndie, there will be benefits coming out of this legislation.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let us make this an overwhelming vote. I \nthink we will have as near to a unanimous vote as you will ever get in \nthe Senate on a bill of this magnitude, a bill of this size. I think \nwhen we vote on it, it is going to pass overwhelmingly. Then we are \ngoing to go to the tax relief package, which I am tremendously excited \nabout.\n  I am glad to have been a part of this effort. It has been worthwhile. \nIt has been long. It has been tedious. It has tried my patience. I lost \nmy temper a few times, along with others, and for those occasions I \napologize. But we got it done, and we will have more decisions made by \nthe people at the State level; we will have genuine tax relief; we will \nhave security for our seniors, and now and then we can move on and \naddress other problems that we need to take up for the future of our \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank all Senators for what you have done on \nthis.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the great senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe we have an opportunity to \nwrite a new chapter in American history, and I am very proud to be part \nof it, and I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n  Mr. LOTT. It would not have happened without the Senator from New \nMexico, and I thank him once again for all of his long hours and great \nleadership.\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the leader yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Might I thank him on behalf of Senator Roth, who is not \npresent at the moment, for his very generous remarks about the Finance \nCommittee, of which he is a member--not hardly the least of us. It is \ntrue that the overwhelming portion of both these measures fell to the \nFinance Committee, and we voted nearly, in one case, a unanimous \nmeasure, on one bill we are about to vote on, 18 to 2, the bill we are \ngoing to take up.\n  I think that has contributed considerably to the momentum that has \nsurrounded us and brought us to this moment. I thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for his generous remarks.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, do we have any time left here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the majority leader will yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am glad to yield the floor to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will try to split the time. I want to say, also, \nto the majority leader, thank you for the accolades and for the \nencouragement that you gave Senator Domenici and me throughout the \nprocess and for the comments about our other colleagues, all of whom \nworked diligently, worked honestly on getting the mission accomplished. \nAt times, I can tell you that Senator Domenici--it's no secret--would \nkind of lay down the book and say, ``We have to check this upstairs.'' \nI don't think he meant all the way up. I think he meant only as far as \nthe majority leader's office. Or, ``We have to turn to the \nleadership.'' I would do the same thing.\n  But persistence was the keynote, persistence and patience. I want to \nsay this about the majority leader and about the way he has conducted \nthings. Serving in the minority, it's easy to find fault with the \nmajority leader. But one has to give credit where due. The fact is that \nthis majority leader has, with diligence and persistence, moved \nlegislation through this place. He has come up to me, and I am sure \nother colleagues, and said, ``Frank, let's try to make sense out of \nthis. What is it that you are trying to accomplish? Can\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\nit be done this time? Well, I don't think so. I think we can get \nhalfway there, I think we can get three-quarters of the way.'' Or he'll \nsay, ``That's not a bad idea and I do want to help you with that.'' And \nhe made a commitment with me on trying to make sure our national \npassenger rail system keeps on functioning. He reaffirmed his \ncommitment to help find a way to get that done.\n  So I want to say, relatively, as we say around here--looking around \nhere, looking at my white hair, I can say it comfortably--the new kid \non the block, the majority leader, has done a good job. It's \nparticularly evident when we look at the accomplishment of this piece \nof legislation, the one we are about to pass. And he is right; it's \ngoing to pass overwhelmingly. We want to have as many people on both \nsides say yes as we can, to indicate to the American people that we \nbelieve in this assignment that we took on.\n  So, I thank the majority leader for his skill, his patience, and his \npersistence. I think he helped calm the waters a little bit. Because I \ndon't remember, throughout the 7 or 8 months of discussion, often late \nat night, often without lunch, munchies, or otherwise, that the \npatience--the tempers never really got real hot. Am I right? Pete, once \nin a while, you know, would stamp on the floor or something like that, \nbut he would come right back, bouncing up. We pushed our way through.\n  So I thank everybody involved in the effort, and I am delighted to be \nhere, to serve in this place and serve at a time like this when we have \naccomplished something.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You know that little hideaway, the Domenici hideaway \nwith that great view? I think when we are finished, we are going to put \na plaque in there; right? It's not mine anymore. But it's going to say, \n``In this little room this budget agreement was hatched and \ncompleted.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. May I add a word of poetry?\n\n       We stood and looked away,\n       Hoping for some accomplishment at the end of this day.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \nconference report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We don't have the yeas and nays yet. Mr. President, I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the conference report.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 134, Senate bill 871.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 871) to establish the Oklahoma City National \n     Memorial as a unit of the National Park System; to designate \n     the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering S. 871, \nthe Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. This important \nlegislation will establish the Oklahoma City National Memorial as a \nunit of the National Park Service and create the Oklahoma City Memorial \nTrust. The memorial will commemorate the national tragedy ingrained in \nall of our minds that occurred in downtown Oklahoma City at 9:02 a.m. \non April 19, 1995, in which 168 Americans lost their lives and \ncountless thousands more lost family members and friends.\n  The Oklahoma City National Memorial will serve as a monument to those \nwhose lives were taken and others who will bear the physical and mental \nscars for the rest of their days. The memorial will stand as a symbol \nto the hope, generosity, and courage shown by Oklahomans and fellow \nAmericans across the country following the Oklahoma City bombing. This \nwill be a place of remembrance, peace, spirituality, comfort, and \nlearning.\n   Under this legislation, the National Park Service Memorial site will \nencompass the footprint of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, 5th \nStreet between Robinson and Harvey, the site of the Water Resources \nBuilding, and the Journal Record Building. An international competition \nwas held to determine the design of the Oklahoma City National \nMemorial, and the winning design was announced on Tuesday, July 1. I \ncommend the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation for an excellent \nselection of the winning design.\n  In addition to designating the memorial site as a unit of the \nNational Park Service, this bill also establishes a\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\nwholly owned government corporation to be known as the Oklahoma City \nNational Memorial Trust. The trust, consisting of a chairman and an \neight-member board, will be charged with administering the operation, \nmaintenance, management, and interpretation of the memorial site.\n  Further, the legislation authorizes a one-time $5 million Federal \ndonation for construction and maintenance of the memorial. The Federal \nappropriation will be matched by $5 million from the Oklahoma State \nLegislature and $14 million in private donations.\n  While the thousands of family members and friends of those killed in \nthe bombing will forever bear scars of having their loved ones taken \naway, the Oklahoma City National Memorial will revere the memory of the \nsurvivors and those lost, and venerate the bonds that drew us all \ncloser together as a result.\n  Mr. President, while it is impossible to recognize everyone whose \nhard work and effort made this memorial possible, I will submit for the \nRecord a list of individuals who formed the core of the memorial design \nfoundation. In addition, I would like to extend particular appreciation \nto Gov. Frank Keating; Oklahoma City mayor, Ron Norick; Mr. Bob \nJohnson, director of the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation charged with \nselecting the design for the Memorial; Vice Chairman Karen Luke; Mr. \nTom McDaniel; Mrs. Polly Nichols; Mr. Don Ferrell; and Mr. Richard \nWilliams. Our country is proud of you, and I am confident our country \nwill be proud of the Oklahoma City National Memorial.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of individuals who formed the \ncore of the memorial design foundation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               Oklahoma City Memorial Board of Directors\n\n       Ann Alspaugh; Anita Arnold; Clark Bailey; Dr. Edward \n     Brandt; Ron Bradshaw; Terry Childers; John Cole; Richard \n     Denman; Tiana Douglas; Jeanette Gamba; Gerald L.

Rainey Williams; Richard Williams; Kathy Wyche; \n     Sydney W. Dobson.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am also proud to be joined by my \ncolleague and friend in the Senate, Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Nickles in support of S. \n871, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. I think it is a \ncompassionate piece of legislation that deserves and will receive \nsupport for immediate passage.\n  I thank, not just my colleague, Senator Nickles, for being the \ndriving force behind this, but also express my appreciation to my \ncolleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for acting so \nquickly to bring this matter before us.\n  Mr. President, it is very easy for us to stand here and for people \nwho were not out there at the time to be compassionate, to be sensitive \nto the needs of Oklahoma. But I can tell you, after having been there \nwhen it happened, it is indescribable when you go through a building \nthat has parts of human bodies stuck to the walls and you see things \nthat are crumbling.\n  My son is an orthopedic surgeon. One of his partners actually had to \ngo in during this thing and amputate a lady's leg, with no anesthetic, \nto extract her from that.\n  Good friends, my closest friends, Don and Sally Ferrell lost their \ndaughter. She was an attorney for HUD. Polly Nichols was not even in \nthe building and came within a quarter of an inch of dying from flying \nglass.\n  This is an opportunity for us to say to these people how much we love \nthem. The 168 individuals who were killed during this cowardly attack \nand those who were fortunate to survive deserve our honor and respect. \nIt is a fitting memorial that has been designed to honor not just the \nindividuals who lost their lives, but the families of those who lost \ntheir lives and those who are survivors.\n  Beyond the immediate victims of the bombing, we also recognize law \nenforcement officers and emergency people. I can remember on the first \nnight, as I was walking toward the building, hearing this thundering \ncadence behind me. I turned to see several hundred firemen, all dressed \nup with their emergency equipment. They were not just from Oklahoma; \nthey were from all over America, from as far away as right here, from \nMaryland. They were going in there, each one of them taking 30-minute \nspells. They were volunteers. They did not have to do this. They went \nin knowing they could very well lose their lives crawling through the \nrubble of a building still crumbling to save lives.\n  So there are many, many heroes in this thing. And this is certainly a \nfitting tribute.\n  I can only say, on behalf of all Oklahomans, we thank you for your \ngenerosity, your promptness, and your compassion.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with the passage of this legislation we \nare embarking on a new road. We will establish a new park area operated \nby the private sector rather than the traditional park operated by park \nservice personnel that we are accustomed to visiting.\n  Upon visiting the Oklahoma City National Memorial you will still \nobserve the traditional park ranger in his flat hat, but behind the \nscenes things will be a little different.\n  The legislation establishes a trust composed of civic leaders who \nwill manage the park in accordance with Park Service standards, rules \nand regulations. I anticipate these leaders will maintain and operate \nthe facilities at this memorial at the highest standard ever achieved \nby any NPS unit.\n  I do not believe we will ever have to revisit this issue in the \nappropriations process. I expect the leaders of the trust will maintain \ntheir facilities with proper preventative maintenance programs so \nAmerica's investment will be more than properly protected without the \ndeferred maintenance programs which currently plague the NPS and the \nCongress.\n  I expect that the programs and operations at the memorial will be \nabove and beyond anything we have ever experienced in a park unit to \ndate.\n  Is this road risky ? The answer is yes. We are now facing $8.6 \nbillion in unfunded NPS programs. The private sector has the answers, \nand it may teach us a few lessons on how to avoid the situation that we \nare currently facing in the National Park Service.\n  The passage of this legislation will begin to show us how to achieve \na National Park Service unit that will be a model for the future.\n  In the absence of a report, that will follow shortly, I have included \ninformation in my statement for the benefit of my colleagues that \nexplains the background and the provisions of the legislation.\n\n\n                               background\n\n  One hundred and sixty-eight Americans lost their lives and many more \nwere injured on April 19, 1995, when a bomb was detonated at the Alfred \nP. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, OK. This tragedy \nconstitutes the worst terrorist incident in American history.\n  This legislation would create a memorial at the site of the Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City on 5th Street, between Robinson and \nHarvey Streets, and would also include the sites of the Water Resources \nBuilding and the Journal Record Building.\n  Concepts for the Memorial were solicited through a design \ncompetition. We received 624 design submissions from 50 States and 23 \nforeign countries. The design selected was created by Hans-Ekkehard \nButzer, Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg, a German-based design team. The \ndesign includes 168 chairs in the Murrah Building footprint, a water \nelement designed to reflect a spirit of change, a survivor tree, \nenvisioned to reflect hope, and ``gates of time'' on each end of Fifth \nStreet that focus the visitor's attention on memorial inscriptions and \nthe other elements of the Memorial. Torrey Butzer of the German team \nstates, ``We watched Oklahomans and the world respond to\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\nthis tragedy from afar. This is our way of giving something to honor \nthe Victims, survivors and the heros. This design will tell the story \nof all of us changed forever.''\n  The Memorial established by this Act would serve not only as a \nmonument to those who died and were injured in the bombing on April 19, \nbut as a symbol of the courage and goodwill shown by local citizens and \nAmericans across the country following the incident. The Oklahoma City \nNational Memorial will be designated a unit of the National Park \nService. It will be placed under the charge of a wholly-owned \ngovernment corporation, to be known as the Oklahoma City National Trust \n(Trust). The Trust will be governed by a nine-member Board of Directors \n(Board) which will have the authority to appoint an executive director \nand other key staff. Interim staff are authorized for 2 years to assist \nin the development of the Memorial. Permanent National Park service \nstaff and the ability to retain staff from other Federal agencies are \nalso provided by this measure on a reimbursable basis.\n  The act authorizes $5 million of Federal funds for construction and \nmaintenance, but stipulates that any Federal expenditures must be \nmatched by non-Federal funds, dollar for dollar. It is expected that \nmatching funding sources will include the Oklahoma State legislature \nand private donations.\n\n\n                          legislative history\n\n  S. 871 was introduced by Senator Nickles and Senator Inhofe on June \n12, 1997 and was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources. The Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation \nand Recreation held a field hearing on the bill in Oklahoma City on \nJuly 3, 1997. An additional hearing was held by the Subcommittee in \nWashington on July 17, 1997.\n\n\n                      section by section analysis\n\n  Section 4(a) establishes the Oklahoma City National Memorial \n(Memorial) and further establishes the Memorial as a unit of the \nNational Park Service.\n  Section 4(b) directs that the lands, facilities and structures of the \nmemorial shall be depicted upon an official map and that the official \nmap shall be on file and available for inspection in the appropriate \noffices of the National Park Service and Oklahoma City Memorial Trust \n(Trust).

This section also directs \nthat the President appoint the Board within 90 days of passage of this \nAct.\n  Section 5(b)(2) sets the terms of Board members at 4 years and limits \nconsecutive terms to 8 years. The section also stipulates that in the \nfirst series of appointments, two members will serve for only 2 years \nand two initial members will serve a term of 3 years.\n  Section 5(b)(3) directs that 5 members shall constitute a quorum for \npurposes of conducting Board business.\n  Section 5(b)(4) directs that the Board shall organize itself in a \nmanner it deems most appropriate and that members shall not receive \ncompensation, but may be reimbursed for actual and necessary travel and \nsubsistence associated with Trust duties.\n  Section 5(b)(5) establishes that Board members will not be considered \nfederal employees except for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act, \nthe Ethics in Government Act and provisions of Titles 11 and 18 of the \nUnited States Code.\n  Section 5(b)(6) directs the Board to meet at least 3 times per year \nin Oklahoma City, with at least two of those meetings open to the \npublic. The Section also allows the Board to hold additional meetings \nand the authority to determine if those meetings are open or closed to \nthe public by majority vote. The Section also authorizes the Board the \nability to establish procedures for providing public information and \nsoliciting public comment regarding operations, maintenance and \nmanagement of the Memorial as well as input on policy, planning and \ndesign issues.\n  Section 5(b)(7) authorizes the Trust to appoint and fix compensation \nand duties of an executive director of the Memorial and other officers \nit deems necessary without regard to provisions of Title 5 of the \nUnited States Code. The Section also authorizes the Secretary of the \nInterior (at the request of the Trust) to provide interim employees as \nnecessary for appointments not to exceed 2 years; to provide uniformed \npersonnel on a reimbursable basis to carry out day to day duties; and \nat the request of the Trust, the Director of any other federal agency \nmay provide personnel on a reimbursable basis to carry out day to day \nvisitor services programs.\n  Section 5(b)(8) establishes that the Trust shall have all powers \nnecessary and proper to exercise the authorities vested in it.\n  Section 5(b)(9) establishes that the Trust and all properties \nadministered by the Trust shall be exempt from all city, state and \nlocal taxes.\n  Section 5(b)(10) establishes that the Trust shall be treated as a \nwholly-owned government corporation, subject to 31 U.S.C.

SHORT TITLE\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Oklahoma City National \n     Memorial Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Few events in the past quarter-century have rocked \n     Americans' perception of themselves and their institutions, \n     and brought together the people of our nation with greater \n     intensity than the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. \n     Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City;\n       (2) the resulting deaths of 168 people, some of whom were \n     children, immediately touched thousands of family members \n     whose lives will forever bear scars of having those precious \n     to them taken away so brutally;\n       (3) suffering with such families are countless survivors, \n     including children, who struggle not only with the suffering \n     around them, but their own physical and emotional injuries \n     and with shaping a life beyond April 19;\n       (4) such losses and struggles are personal and, since they \n     resulted from so public an attack, they are also shared with \n     a community, a nation, and the world;\n       (5) the story of the bombing does not stop with the attack \n     itself or with the many losses it caused. The responses of \n     Oklahoma's public servants and private citizens, and those \n     from throughout the nation, remain as a testament to the \n     sense of unity, compassion, even heroism, that characterized \n     the rescue and recovery following the bombing;\n       (6) During the days immediately following the Oklahoma City \n     bombing, Americans and people from around the world of all \n     races, political philosophies, religions and walks of life \n     responded with unprecedented solidarity and selflessness; and\n       (7) Given the national and international impact and \n     reaction, the federal character of the site of the bombing, \n     and the significant percentage of the victims and survivors \n     who were federal employees the Oklahoma City Memorial will be \n     established, designed, managed and maintained to educate \n     present and future generations, through an public/private \n     partnership, to work together efficiently and respectfully in \n     developing a National Memorial relating to all aspects of the \n     April 19, 1995, bombing in Oklahoma City.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I wish to compliment \nthem, incidentally, on the work that they have done in the last 3 \nmonths putting both bills together, both the Balanced Budget Act and \nthe Tax Relief Act that we will be passing later today. They worked \nunbelievable hours. I compliment them for their very fine work. I thank \nall of my colleagues for their cooperation in allowing us to pass this \nbill so quickly this morning.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8410-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8415-S8461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 1997--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \njunior Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for his courtesy and consideration \nin allowing me to take this time. I also congratulate both the Senator \nfrom Delaware and the Senator from New York for their ability in \ncrafting this particular piece of legislation.\n  When I ran for the Senate in 1992, I made tax reform one of my \nprimary goals. I must confess that this bill does not meet all of my \nexpectations and promises as I ran in the campaign, because one of the \nthings that I was most devoted to was a determination to make the Tax \nCode less complex, easier to understand, and tax returns, perhaps, \nfiled that are the size of a postcard.\n  This bill does not accomplish that, and I still hold that out as a \ngoal for the future. But if this bill does not make the Tax Code less \ncomplex, it at least makes the Tax Code less burdensome --less \nburdensome for middle Americans, middle-class Americans who have not \nreceived a significant tax break for a long, long time. There have been \ntax breaks at the other ends of the Tax Code, yes, at the bottom end \nfor people who received the earned income tax credit and, some would \nargue, too much at the top end. But there has not been the kind of \nmiddle-class tax relief talked about in the 1992 campaign until this \nbill.\n  So while it is not everything that I would want--and there is still \nmuch unfinished business to be taken care of in terms of tax \nsimplification--it is a step in the right direction that we should \napply. I intend to vote for it enthusiastically and urge all of my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  When I came here in January 1993, the atmosphere was completely \ndifferent than the one we find on the floor today. At that time, there \nwas a determination to see that spending would grow and that taxing \nwould grow. I am delighted to have been able to be a part of an effort \nthat has brought us to a case where spending is going down, at least in \npercentage terms, and taxes are going down, in terms of the burden that \nthey are placing on the American people.\n  So I congratulate all connected with this effort, including, yes, Mr. \nPresident, the President of the United States. I know it is not common \nfor people on my side of the aisle to stand up and say nice things \nabout this President, and I have said my share of unkind things in \nareas where I feel he has done things that I think are inappropriate. \nBut as I have said to the President when I have been to the White House \non occasions, ``When you are right, Mr. President, I will back you. \nWhen I think you are wrong, I will oppose you.'' I owe it to him and to \nthose in his administration who have worked with him on this agreement \nto publicly acknowledge that this time I think he has been right. I \ncongratulate him and those who work with him for their willingness to \ndo this. I must say that I still had hoped that Senator Dole would be \nelected President. I think if he had been, we would be here discussing \nthe tax simplification that I believe in as well as some tax reduction. \nWe had our opportunity to make that case in the campaign. For one \nreason or another, it didn't fly, and it will have to wait for another \nday. But I congratulate all those who have put partisanship aside and \nworked together for the good of the people and made a compromise with \nwhich perhaps none fully agree, but for which the American people, \noverall, will ultimately be grateful.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I am grateful to the two Senators for \nallowing me to take this brief time to make these expressions. I \nconclude as I began, with my congratulations to them and to their \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee, to the leadership of both Houses \nin both parties, for their ability on the legislative side to work out \nan agreement with the President and his associates in the executive \nbranch to give us at least this first step in the direction of making \nthe Tax Code less burdensome and less onerous on the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, when the 105th Congress began, a promise was made to \nthe American people. They were concerned about Washington's addiction \nto spending, and the high deficits that were a consequence of that \nspending. We promised to give them a balanced budget. They were \noverburdened by rising taxes. They had been shackled with a record-\nsetting increase in 1992, and were paying more to government than they \nwere for their own food, shelter, and clothing. We promised them \nrelief. Our American families were concerned about the education of \ntheir children--about the rising costs of post-secondary schools, and \ntheir ability to help their children enter our colleges and \nuniversities to learn and to prepare for productive futures. We \npromised to make education more accessible.\n  Young Americans, just out of school--many of them starting families--\nwere finding it increasingly more difficult to buy a home. As a \nproportion of their income, they discovered that a mortgage today is \ntwice as much as it was for their parents. Valiant small businessmen \nand -women were finding it increasingly more difficult to build \nsuccessful companies. They had lost their home office deductions, the \ndeductibility of their health insurance, and then--when their company, \ndespite these and other challenges, proved successful--they had to fear \nlosing it to death taxes. Again, we promised relief. We promised peace \nof mind to senior Americans who were worried about Medicare and its \nfuture. We promised to provide future generations the opportunity to \nbecome more self-sufficient through enhanced individual retirement \naccounts, and less dependent on government for their support in the \nyears to come. And we promised that we would do something to increase \nhealth care coverage for America's children--for America's future.\n  These, of course, Mr. President, were bold promises. For years, the \nRepublican Party had advocated these measures, but in a city built on \npromises--the majority of which unfortunately go unfulfilled--it was \nreasonable that Americans felt that these, too, would remain empty. But \ntoday, Mr. President--today, we can say that these promises made, are \npromises kept.\n  For the first time since 1969, Americans have a balanced budget--a \nbalanced budget that will be realized within 5 years. For the first \ntime in 16 years, Americans have real and meaningful tax relief. For \nthe first time ever, our families will have tax-free education savings \naccounts, and for the first time in a decade, we are bringing back the \nstudent loan interest deduction. And these, Mr. President, are not our \nonly firsts. We are allowing penalty-free withdrawals from IRA plans to \nmake first-time home purchases.\n  We are eliminating the capital gains taxes on $500,000 of gain for a \ncouple that sells their home. We are strengthening and preserving \nMedicare by introducing choice and competition to that program. We are \ngiving States\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\ngreater flexibility and authority to administer Medicaid, and we are \nincreasing health care coverage for millions of children.\n  These are all firsts, Mr. President, but there is another first--one \nthat is more philosophic in nature. For the first time since President \nJohnson's Great Society exploded the size and costs of Federal \nprograms, Americans have a government that is focused on doing more \nwith less.\n  When historians look at what has been accomplished here these past \nfew months, I believe our work will mark the beginning of a new era--an \nera which the Republicans have long promised and which President \nClinton articulated when he said that the days of big government are \nbehind us.\n  This budget reconciliation package is a strong first step toward \nrealizing that promise. It is a bipartisan effort--one that could not \nhave been accomplished without a spirit of cooperation between \nRepublicans and Democrats, between the Senate and the House, and \nbetween Congress and the President. I'm proud of what we've \naccomplished. Members in both Houses of Congress, and on both sides of \nthe aisle, have reason to be proud, as does Bill Clinton.\n  Certainly, there are differences between the parties--those \ndifferences can be valuable in the battle of ideas. But this package \nrepresents a collective effort, an effort that is a far cry from the \nacrimony, Government shutdowns and the vetoes that attended past budget \ndebates. I believe our work here demonstrates a coming together on \nfundamental issues. Taxes have been too high.\n  They are still too high. In fact, as a percentage of our GNP, they \nhaven't been higher than they are right now since 1960. Government has \ngrown too big, become too inefficient, too overbearing and costly. Too \nmuch power has been taken from our people--from our States--and it's \nbeen centralized here in Washington.\n  Yesterday we addressed the changes that will take place in Government \nprograms--especially in entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid. We \nexplained how this reconciliation package will deliver greater \nflexibility to the States for them to administer Medicaid in a more \ncost-effective, a more efficient manner.\n  Today, we focus on the major tax provisions included in our plan, and \nhow those provisions will provide relief for Americans of all ages--for \nour youth, going away to college, for our young families looking to buy \ntheir first home and raise their children, for older families running \nsmall businesses and preparing for retirement, and for those Americans \nwho are already retired and looking to find comfort and security on \nfixed incomes.\n  This reconciliation package provides relief for all of these. It \nincludes a $500-per-child tax credit for families with children under \nthe age of 17. The credit will be available to the working poor through \nan enhanced earned income credit. It will cover middle-class families, \ncouples earning up to $110,000 a year. At $110,000 it will begin to \nphase out. And this tax relief will begin next year with a $400 per \nchild credit in 1998, and the full $500 credit in 1999 and thereafter.\n  We also provide relief to hard-working, middle-class Americans by \nenhancing the individual retirement account. We raise the income limits \non traditional IRA's and create a new back-loaded IRA. In this back-\nloaded IRA, the contributions are not tax deductible, but the build-up \nand withdrawals are tax-free if the account is held for 5 years and the \naccount holder is at least 59\\1/2\\. The income limits for the new back-\nloaded IRA will be $95,000 for singles and $150,000 for married \ncouples. Our new IRA will allow penalty-free withdrawals for first-time \nhome purchases. Another very important change to the IRA is that we \nallow homemakers--below certain family income--to save a full $2,000 \nannually in an account, regardless of their spouse's pension plan.\n  Mr. President, I have worked for years to strengthen individual \nretirement accounts for working Americans. These changes will go a long \nway toward helping Americans prepare for retirement. They will \nencourage self-reliance and provide incentive for saving.\n  This is, indeed, an idea whose time has come. It will be a blessing \nto countless Americans as they prepare for the future. And beyond \nhelping individual families, these expanded IRS's will promote \ninvestment, capital formation and economic growth.\n  Another important provision of this reconciliation package--one that \nwill not only provide tax relief, but will, along with our IRA's, \npromote investment and jobs, is our capital gains tax cut.\n  Here, we drop the top rate to 20 percent on investments that are held \nfor at least 18 months. The rate will drop to 18 percent for assets \npurchased after 2000 and held for at least 5 years. For joint filers \nwith incomes less than $41,200, the top capital gains rate will be 10 \npercent of assets held for at least 18 months, and 8 percent for assets \nheld for at least 5 years. Our package does away with capital gains \ntaxes on the sale of a home, as long as the home is $500,000 or less \nfor joint filers and $250,000 or less for single filers.\n  The benefit of capital gains tax relief will be felt not only by our \nfamilies, but by America at large. According to economist Lawrence \nKudlow, in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial,\n\n       The budget's lower capital gains tax rate will help \n     maintain U.S. global economic leadership in the 21st century. \n     This is especially important in relation to the fast-growing \n     economies of the Pacific rim, with China looming not far \n     behind. Most of the Asian tigers have lower tax burdens on \n     capital formation that the U.S.\n\n  America, Mr. President, needs this capital gains tax relief. It is \nlong overdue.\n  However, the tax relief contained in this package does not end here. \nFamilies will also benefit by the way that this bill offers relief from \nthe estate tax--the tax that can rob a family of its farm or business \nwhen a father or mother passes away.\n  To help these families, we raise the unified credit to $1,000,000 per \nestate by 2006; and we provide tax-free treatment for family-owned \nfarms and small businesses for up to $1.3 million. I can't overstate \nhow important this estate tax relief will be to our families and small \nbusinesses. In 1995, delegates to a convention on small business \nsurvival, ranked killing the estate tax among the top five priorities \non a list of 60 recommendations to the President. This is because many \nsmall business men and women fear the enterprises they have worked \ntheir lives to create won't be around to pass on to their children. The \nestate tax relief provided in this package offers a strong first step \ntoward allaying that fear and providing families the protection they \ndeserve.\n  Beyond offering relief for estate taxes, this package also benefits \nAmerica's small businesses by accelerating the phase in of the self-\nemployed health insurance deduction, raising that deduction all the way \nto 100 percent, and by clarifying the deductibility of the home office \nbusiness deduction. These, Mr. President, are important provisions. \nThey will promote economic growth, jobs, and family security. They \nnaturally complement the overarching objective of this legislation to \nprovide immediate tax relief and to create conditions that will prepare \nAmerica and Americans for a bright and prosperous future.\n  Just how important this objective is can be seen by the fact that a \nfull 80 percent of the tax relief we offer in this package is directed \nat the $500 credit for children and provisions that will promote \neducation. These education-related measures will go a long way toward \nassisting students and their parents in affording the cost of post-\nsecondary education.\n  They include the Hope scholarship tax credit, a $2,500-per-year \nstudent loan interest deduction, and penalty-free withdrawal from \nIRA's. We can't overstate just how important these measures will be to \nAmerican families, to America's students, and to our future. I had \nhoped that we could have gone even further in promoting the educational \naspects of this bill. For example, I wanted to maintain a provision \nthat would offer tax-free treatment for State-sponsored prepaid tuition \nplans, a permanent extension of employer provided education assistance, \nand a comprehensive education IRA, but in these areas the White House \nwas unwilling to compromise.\n  And this brings up a point I would like to make--a point I touched \nupon yesterday. No one received everything they wanted with this \npackage. That, Mr. President, is the nature of compromise. Another \nlesson we learn from\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\ncompromise is that it tends to add complexity to the package under \nconsideration.\n  We learned how when you have three parties involved in the process--\nthe Senate, the House, and the administration--each compromise made in \nnegotiations rendered the final product that much more complex.\n  Having said this, let me be clear that I am generally pleased by the \noutcome. Certainly, I could be more pleased. But the bipartisan effort \nthat produced this reconciliation package is something to be \nappreciated. We accomplished what we set out to do. We provided tax \nrelief for middle-income families; we provided tax relief to promote \neducation; and, we provided tax relief that will stimulate economic \ngrowth, opportunity, and jobs.\n  Let me show just how that relief will affect typical American \nfamilies. When I first brought the Senate Finance Committee tax relief \npackage to the floor--about 6 weeks ago--I introduced three \nhypothetical families from Delaware: a single mother named Judy Smith, \na farming family--the Wilsons--and a young professional couple, John \nand Susan Jones. Let me show you how this package--in its final form--\nwill benefit them:\n  Let's begin with Judy. She has two young children and works as a \nlegal secretary in Wilmington, making $35,000 a year. Currently she \npays over $3,000 in Federal income taxes--over $3,000. When President \nClinton signs this bill, Judy's taxes will be cut by $800 next year and \nby $1,000 the year after. Why? Because of the child tax credit. Judy \nwill be able to spend that savings as she wants, or she can put it in \nan enhanced individual retirement account for her future.\n  Jim and Julie Wilson, our farming family with three children and an \nincome of $55,000, now pay over $5,500 in Federal income taxes. When \nPresident Clinton signs this bill, their taxes will be cut by $1,200 in \n1998, and by $1,500 in 1999 and beyond, as they will receive $500 for \neach child. Julie Wilson will be able to set up a homemaker IRA to save \nfor her retirement. Looking far ahead, if the farm prospers, Jim and \nJulie will be able to pass it on to their children free of the burden \nof the estate tax--all because of the middle-income tax relief \ncontained in this bill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let's look at John and Susan Jones. They live \nand work in Dover, DE. College graduates, John is a veterinarian and \nSusan is a physical therapist. They make $75,000 and have one young \nchild. Under current law, the Jones family pays about $11,500 in \nFederal income taxes. Because of this legislation, they will receive a \n$400 tax credit next year, and $500 each year thereafter.\n  Susan will be able to take the home office business deduction, as her \npractice is located within their home, and she will be able to \naccelerate the phase-in of the self-employed health insurance \ndeduction. John and Susan will also be able to deduct a portion of the \ninterest on their student loans, and they'll be able to set up new \nback-loaded IRA accounts for their retirement.\n  This is how our work will affect these three families, Mr. President. \nIt will provide relief--much needed relief. As I have said, today the \ntaxes paid by our families are higher as a percentage of GNP than \nthey've been since 1960. This bipartisan tax relief effort will do \nsomething about that. It will provide relief as part of a budget \nreconciliation package that will lead our Nation to a balanced budget \nin 2002. Having said that, however, I want to add that I consider this \nonly a beginning. Americans not only need tax relief; they need tax \nreform. They need tax reform that really does simplify the Tax Code.\n  They need reform that focuses on fairness. They need reform that \nmaintains and promotes strong economic growth--growth that will lead to \ncontinued job creation. And they need reform that promotes American \nexports and our competitiveness in the global economy.\n  This is what we will turn our attention to next. And it is my hope \nthat the same level of cooperation that sustained us in this debate \nwill attend us as we move from tax relief to tax reform. I appreciate \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been active, \ninvolved, and given to a spirit of willingness throughout this process. \nI am particularly grateful to Senator Moynihan--my friend and a \nthoughtful, well-esteemed leader.\n  And again, Mr. President--as I did yesterday--I thank the \nprofessional, capable staff of the Senate Finance Committee for their \ncountless hours and lost sleep. This was, indeed, a heroic effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the honor now to respond to my \nrevered chairman, who brought this extraordinary legislation to the \nfloor and in a very few hours from now will see it sent to the \nPresident to become law.\n  By day's end, the U.S. Senate will have voted overwhelmingly to \nreduce Federal taxes by a net total of $95 billion over 5 years and \n$275 billion over 10 years. Whatever one's view of this legislation as \na matter of tax policy, there can be absolutely no doubt that without \nthe dominant influence of the chairman of the Committee on Finance, we \nwould not be here today. Absent Senator Roth, we would not be here \ntoday. This conference agreement is a singular achievement for him, and \nwe congratulate him.\n  Among other provisions in the legislation, the Roth IRA will soon be \nas well-known as the Pell grant. It is a fitting tribute to Senator \nRoth's long, persistent, indomitable commitment to encourage savings by \nAmericans.\n  For those interested, this is in section 302, Individual Retirement \nAccounts, section 408(a), Roth IRAs. It is there in what I think others \nacross the park in the Supreme Court call black letter law. There, sir, \nit is.\n  There is another aspect of this legislation which has not been \ncommented on and, I hope, might be. Without perhaps entirely intending \nit, and not quite in the mode of how others have done it, after a half \ncentury of discussion, we are, in fact, establishing a children's \nallowance in our social policies.\n  I have had occasion to write about this over the years. We are the \nonly industrial democracy in the world that does not have a children's \nallowance--just a routine thing, a feature of social policy that goes \nback to the beginnings of the century. It had various motivations in \nSweden. There was a time when the Swedes thought they were dying out as \na race and needed to encourage more children. So they gave family \nallowances. Sometimes called a family allowance. The French much the \nsame. In places like Canada, just a good social policy.\n  During World War II, the late Senator Neuberger was working on the \nAlaska-Canada highway--ALCAN highway, as we knew it in those days--and \ninterested in what the Canadians were doing, came upon the family \nallowance, the children's allowance, and introduced legislation when he \nbecame Senator after the war. And John F. Kennedy was much interested \nin this and cosponsored the legislation. And I can say from the days of \nthe early Kennedy administration there was an active interest in this \npossibility--the elemental proposition that if you have children, it is \ngoing to cost money, and a family raising children needs a little \nsupport. We are giving it. Instead of a direct grant, we are providing \na direct tax credit. The end result will be the same, and a rather \nextraordinary bit of social policy is before us which has never been \ndebated as such, but as I get on in years I begin to think the more you \ndebate social policy, the less social policy you get, and so we could \nperhaps count our blessings in this regard.\n\n  But now my friend from Delaware has heard his ranking member say on \nmany occasions that if it were up to this Senator, we would have no tax \ncuts at this time, given the extraordinary condition of our economy \njust now, a condition for which many believe the deficit reduction law \nenacted in 1993, OBRA 1993, is largely responsible.\n  I continue to be concerned about whether cutting taxes might undo the \nastonishing progress we have made over the last 4 years, because OBRA \n93 took hold when we did it. It was, indeed, the largest tax increase \nin history, and it has produced extraordinary increases in wealth in \nour Nation because it sent a signal to the economy that this Government \nwas going to get hold of its financing, pay its bills in sound dollars, \nnot monetize the debt, as the phrase is among economists, inflate the \ncurrency and get rid of your\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\ndebt in that mode. Those are profoundly important signals to the \nmarkets, and we have seen, I believe, the result.\n  The deficit for fiscal year 1992 was $290 billion and growing. It was \nstrangling us. We had no prospect whatever of getting out of it. What \nearlier on, President Reagan's Director of OMB, David Stockman, had \nsaid, $100 billion deficits as far as the eye can see, had become $300 \nbillion deficits as far as the eye could see. And we turned it around. \nWe stopped it.\n  As a result of this aggressive deficit reduction program put in place \nby a Democratic Congress in 1993, the deficit for the current fiscal \nyear could be less than $30 billion, which is about one-third of 1 \npercent of gross domestic product, a matter of no consequence in the \nlarge sphere of things. The Federal budget is on the verge of balance \nat this very moment and for the first time in three decades, and it \nwould get there without any changes in law. I would estimate that we \nmight have a balanced budget in the fourth quarter of the next fiscal \nyear, a year from now. We would have it without change in law. Now we \nare putting the date off until the year 2002. I hope that does not \nbecome a fateful mistake. I am not here to alarm anyone, but I think it \nneeds to be said for the record if the time comes when we have to make \nchanges. Given the previous success of our action 4 years ago, we may \ncome to regret what we have done today, but there is not a majority for \nthat view. There is a very small minority for that view. The \ncongressional leadership and the President have agreed that there will \nbe tax cuts this year, and so, given that reality, I joined with the \nother Democratic members of the Finance Committee in working with \nChairman Roth in a bipartisan mode.\n  He has been generous enough to point out, as did earlier in the day \nthe majority leader, that the Finance Committee was unanimous in \nreporting out the measure that we voted on just an hour ago on \nspending, and there was an 18 to 2 vote in our Committee on the bill \nbefore us now.\n  Yesterday, Senator Domenici, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, said it was the bipartisan solidarity of the Finance \nCommittee which gave the real impetus to getting the budget agreement \nput in place, and I think that is so and nothing, no further tribute is \npossible to Senator Roth for having presided over that event.\n  It is a phenomenon which I hope, and I know he hopes, we might see in \nthe future. We found that we could do things on a bipartisan basis that \ncould amaze you. We could raise taxes on tobacco. We could provide the \nlargest incremental initiative in health care since Medicare and \nMedicaid were enacted in 1965--just like that, just in 2 days. Again, \nperhaps because it was not debated for a year, we were able to get it \ndone in an afternoon. I would like to explore that possibility \nsometime. Is there an inverse ratio between the amount of debate and \nthe legislation that emerges? I think you have seen some of that in the \npast many years.\n  I would take the time of the Senate to point to several measures in \nthe bill which are surely praiseworthy and equally important. One that \nhas not been commented on anywhere that I have seen in the press is \nthat the bill before us removes the present $150 million cap on the \nissuance of tax-exempt bonds by universities, colleges and nonhospital \nhealth facilities. It sounds like an esoteric matter. What could this \nmean? Well, it goes to something that is as important to American life \nas anything I know, and it is as characteristic of American democracy \nas anything I know.\n  We are the only democratic nation in the world that has a private \nsector in its higher education--not just a few Jesuit colleges here or \nevery so often a special arrangement in the north of Sweden or the \nsouth of France, and so forth. No, our system of higher education began \nas private denominational matters, and we continue to have just about \nan equal balance between the great private institutions and the great \npublic institutions. You could go out to California, in the San \nFrancisco Bay area, and you would see it is exemplary of Stanford \nUniversity, named for a great railroad magnate who gave his money in \nthe name of his son who died prematurely, and Berkeley, the University \nof California at Berkeley, a great State institution.\n  Now, we have earlier on enabled the private universities, colleges, \nand nonmedical health facilities to borrow money on a tax-exempt basis, \nwhich puts them partially on an equal footing with the State \ninstitutions which obtain money directly from the taxpayers, from tax \nrevenue, and can issue tax-exempt bonds because they are public \ninstitutions.\n  We capped that amount, and more and more of our institutions have \nreached it. And having done that, they are no longer in a position to \nbuild what you could call the capital-intensive science facilities and \nsuchlike facilities that you need in the area of research on the edges \nof knowledge in this country today. And we are the center of such \nresearch. You could hypothesize, if you like, a future where if we did \nnot do what we are doing, there would come a time when the finest law \nschool on the west coast would be at Stanford--law schools are not \nexpensive; you have to add 50 books a year in the library--but all the \nphysics would be done at Berkeley. Physics is expensive. All the \nchemistry, all the great research in astronomy, the outer edges of the \nuniverse to the very core of the Earth itself, all that would be in \npublic institutions. And the competitive urges and the range of variety \nof the private institutions--the University of Chicago, Rice \nUniversity, go right down the list of them--that would be lost. The \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, New York University, Columbia and, as I \nsay, across the Nation, those institutions are precious. There is no \nreason why Americans should know that the universities and colleges in \nthe United Kingdom are all public institutions, but it is important to \nknow that we are singular in this regard, and this legislation responds \nto that need. It may just be that no one is interested enough to care, \nto take note, but I can assure you the universities involved are very \nattentive and are very pleased.\n  We also extend for 3 years the provision for exclusion from income of \nemployer-provided educational assistance, which is section 127 of the \nInternal Revenue Code. This is a wonderfully unintrusive piece of \nsocial policy. It is probably the single-most successful tax incentive \nfor education we have. In a world of continuing education, of \ncontinuing developments in science and technology, we have arrangements \nwhereby an employer can send an employee to school to learn something \nspecial being taught--at night or weekends, whatever--get a degree, \nbring the skills back into the workplace. They will be paid more money, \nand they will get more income. We will get more revenue. Everyone wins \nall around. We in the Finance Committee made this absolutely easy, \nworkable, a successful program. We made it permanent.\n  For reasons I cannot understand, and I don't think the chairman could \npossibly understand either, the Finance Committee language, which made \nit permanent and applied it to graduate school, was dropped in \nconference. We had legislation in the Senate to do just this, Senator \nRoth and I, with 50 cosponsors. What is the matter with people who \ncan't see what elemental good sense this makes? The firm that wants to \nsend a chemist to do postgraduate work in a new field that is just \nopening up so he can come back and do it in the private sector of the \neconomy is just so elemental. That it was not done is disturbing. \nPerhaps we will get back to it. I can't imagine why it was not \naccepted, but we had no success.\n  The conferees included another salutary measure by extending for 1 \nyear the deductibility, at fair market value, of charitable gifts of \nappreciated stock to private foundations. Absent this, we would have \nseen a needless dropoff in charitable giving. And, again, we are trying \nto encourage the private sector, that private sector of education we \ntry to support, the private sector of employer-provided educational \nassistance, into giving to private charities.\n  Now, to another matter of concern--of large concern--just beginning \nto be noted. I observed in the Washington Post this morning a comment \non it, and also in the New York Times.\n  The Senate-passed bill included a measure written by our chairman and \nsupported by this Senator and others to provide $2.3 billion in \ncritically needed funding for Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger \nCorporation,\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\nthe last hope of rail passenger service in America. The distinguished \nCEO of the corporation, Mr. Tom Downs, said to me, as he would say to \nanyone who called and asked, that if he did not get this $2.3 billion, \nthe corporation would be bankrupt in February or March.\n  I say to you, Mr. President, that's what this period will be \nremembered for, that we did not do this. We had it in the bill. The \nSenate voted 80 to 18 for the provision that the chairman provided. And \nit was dropped. It was dropped owing to a dispute over other matters \naltogether--job protections and outside contracting by Amtrak. It is \nprovided in this bill that $2.3 billion is there, but it is not \navailable to Amtrak until some very controversial legislation is \nadopted making job protection and such like matters subject to \ncollective bargaining.\n  I will be blunt. This could mean the end of Amtrak, the National \nRailroad Passenger Corporation. Bankruptcy for Amtrak is an outcome we \nshould surely do everything in our power to prevent. It would be a \nnational calamity. I wish to be emphatic in saying that the possibility \nis now real, and I hope the administration will join in the effort to \nbring about a resolution.\n  I was surprised, in the often intense debates of this last week on \nthis matter, that nowhere did we hear from the Secretary of Labor. \nNowhere did we hear from the Secretary of Transportation. What do we \nhave Cabinet officers for? I don't mean to be critical of any \nindividual. It occurs to me that they were not invited in. I'll tell \nyou, I was once an assistant to Secretary Arthur J. Goldberg when he \nwas Secretary of Labor during the Kennedy administration. We had rail \nstrikes and soon thereafter, in the Johnson administration, disputes in \nthe steel industry. Arthur J. Goldberg would have been right in the \nmiddle of it, seeing that workers were protected and that the public \nwas protected.\n  This remains to be done. I hope I have sounded an alarm. If I sound \nalarmist, Mr. President, may I put it in the Record that I am and I \nintend to be alarmist.\n  Another matter on which we have made an error, in my view, was the \nhurtful provision revoking the tax-exempt status of the Teachers \nInsurance and Annuity Association and the College Retirement Equities \nFund, known as the TIAA-CREF, a 2-million-member retirement system that \nserves 6,100 American colleges, universities, teaching hospitals, \nmuseums, libraries and other nonprofit educational and research \ninstitutions. TIAA was founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1918. It has been \ntax exempt ever since. It is a nonprofit charity, and properly not \ntaxed.\n  In 1937 it was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York \nto ``forward the cause of education and promote the welfare of the \nteaching profession''--``forward the cause of education and promote the \nwelfare of the teaching profession.'' The law further states that the \npurpose of TIAA--this is the New York statute--is ``to aid and \nstrengthen non-proprietary and non-profit-making colleges, universities \nand other institutions engaged primarily in education or research.'' \nAnd it has done just that. It has long been recognized as a model of \nsuch programs.\n  As a somewhat unanticipated result, it brought to American higher \neducation portability of pensions. You did not have to start out in one \ninstitution and after a certain point stay the rest of your life \nbecause you had to have some retirement benefit. It has a great value \nto our educational system for the simple reason that it enables a young \nperson at, say, a 2-year college or a local college, who shows great \npromise, does good work, to end up at Chicago or Stanford or Duke, \nbecause they can move. This is part of the agility of American higher \neducation. There is no reason to tax this, and the Finance Committee \nsaid don't tax it. We never have. The Senate said don't tax it. But \nsomehow or other we have decided to do so.\n  Revoking TIAA-CREF's 79-year-old tax exemption will cost the average \nretiree who receives $12,000 a year about $600 in income. You know, \nlibrarians are not highly paid. Perhaps that is not widely known. A \n$12,000 pension would be quite normal. A $600 reduction would be 5 \npercent right away. Future retirees currently accumulating benefits are \nlikely to face reductions of 10 to 15 percent.\n  Why make the lives of librarians and assistant professors and \nteachers in community colleges harder? Why do we do this? Why wasn't \nthis something that people said no to? The Finance Committee said no to \nit. But we were not successful.\n  Two closing points. In an era in which the most recent Presidential \ncampaign was captivated--at least sectors of it--by the idea of a flat \ntax, it deserves pointing out that this 820-page piece of legislation \nwill add hugely to the stupefying complexity and mass of the Internal \nRevenue Code and its accompanying regulations.\n  Mr. President, this is not an exercise here in physical therapy. For \nas long as I can, I would like to hold it up to show it to you. I dare \nnot hold it up any longer. If I should drop it, there would go my right \nankle. Did that thump on the desk make itself heard?\n  In 1986, in the Tax Reform Act of that year, we moved toward the idea \nof simplicity in the Tax Code by a broader base and lower rates. Just \nan anecdote, the late beloved Erwin Griswold, sometime dean of the \nHarvard Law School, sometime Solicitor General of the United States, \nwas a friend. He used to write me each April describing how long it \ntook him to complete his tax returns, which he persisted in preparing \nhimself. Now, mind you, Dean Griswold was perhaps the Nation's foremost \nauthority on the subject of tax law. He almost began the subject. He \nwrote the first text. He describes himself as being a young attorney, \ngraduate of Harvard Law in the 1920s, in the Solicitor General's \noffice, and some matters concerning taxation came to him. He, as he put \nit in a wonderful address to the bar association tax section, said, ``I \nthought of going to the Solicitor General to tell him I didn't know \nanything about tax law, but I decided to go to the library instead.'' \nAnd he wrote the text.\n  In his last letter to me, dated April 12, 1994, 7 months before he \ndied, he wrote that his 1993 tax return took him almost 100 hours to \ncomplete--100 hours for Erwin Griswold to prepare his not very \ncomplicated financial affairs. He was a teacher and a lawyer, \nGovernment employee, and he knew all these matters--yet it took him 100 \nhours. It would be 110 were he alive into the next tax season.\n  Let me say, just as an example, a family with three children, two in \ncollege and one under age 17, could be required to calculate the new \nchild tax credit, a Hope scholarship tax credit for one college \nstudent, and a separate lifelong learning credit for the older child. \nEach of these different provisions will have different eligibility \nrules and complicated income phaseouts that will have to be calculated \non different worksheets and reported to the Internal Revenue Service on \na variety of forms.\n  It is no exaggeration, sir--I don't believe it is an exaggeration--to \nsay that anybody who could fill out the forms necessary to qualify for \nthese tax benefits would already be an accountant of advanced \nexperience and achievement and would have no need for the benefits.\n  I do want to point out that in the statement of the managers \naccompanying this conference report, it says, ``The conferees \nanticipate that the Secretary of the Treasury will determine whether a \nsimplified method of calculating the child credit, consistent with the \nformula described above, can be achieved.'' So there is hope. But I \nwouldn't hope too much.\n  President Ronald Reagan, our much-loved President Ronald Reagan, \nliked to say the Republicans are the party of the Fourth of July and \nDemocrats are the party of April 15th. With the passage of this \nlegislation, I think Democrats can no longer take all the credit for \nApril 15th.\n  A second and final point. This will be the first-ever tax bill \nsubject to the line-item veto, which gives the President, ``limited \nauthority to cancel specific dollar amounts of discretionary budget \nauthority, certain new direct spending, and limited tax benefits.''\n  Limited tax benefits are those that provide, a Federal tax deduction, \ncredit, exclusion, or preference to 100 or fewer beneficiaries.\n  In January of this year, I joined Senators Byrd, Levin and former \nSenator Hatfield in a legal challenge to the line-item veto on grounds \nthat it violates the presentment clause in article\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\nI, section 7, of the Constitution. The U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia agreed and promptly declared the statute \nunconstitutional.\n  But later, on June 26, the Justice Department took the matter to the \nSupreme Court itself, and the Court held that we, as legislators, had \nno standing to challenge the law, clearing the way for the President to \nexercise his new authority.\n  Now, just 2 days ago, on July 29, the Joint Committee on Taxation met \nto consider the list of limited tax benefits in this bill, a list \nprepared by the committee staff, that would be subject to the line-item \nveto. It was the first time we had done this under the new law, and I \nam pleased to report, upon being presented with the 6-page list \ntotaling 79 separate provisions in this bill subject to the line-item \nveto, some members of the joint committee began to display a visible \nlessening of enthusiasm for the concept itself.\n  I have a list here, Mr. President, and take the liberty of asking \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, so the \nadministration will have an opportunity to look up the items, veto them \nand then the injured parties can arrive across the park at the Supreme \nCourt with standing and the Constitution will be preserved.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\nTITLE XVII--IDENTIFICATION OF LIMITED TAX BENEFITS SUBJECT TO LINE ITEM \n                                  VETO\n\n     SEC. 1701.

I thank the President, and particularly thank him for \naffording that the Constitution be preserved.\n  Finally, as I have said, I would have preferred the Senate-passed \nbill, in many respects, but committees of conference work by \ncompromise, and we have a compromise before us which I will support, \nagain with great thanks to the chairman, to Lindy Paull and to Frank \nPolk, and to Mark Patterson and Nick Giordano. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I defer to the chairman. I am hoping to \nget a chance to speak.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe the chairman would like to \nmake a comment in response.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, I will be very brief. First of all, I just want to \npublicly recognize and thank Senator Moynihan for the role he has \nplayed. I think his statement today is another example of his towering \nintellect. We are very fortunate to have an individual who is renowned \nthroughout this country for his ability to analyze, to study, and come \nup with constructive proposals. Certainly, we have all benefited from \nhis rare intellect.\n  I would just like to comment on two or three things that he spoke \nabout in his opening remarks. First of all, I share the pride and \nsatisfaction in our higher educational system. I have often thought \nthere are few countries that have anything like ours. They may have one \nor two outstanding schools--Oxford and Cambridge in the British Isles; \nin Japan they have the University of Tokyo. But we have so many \noutstanding schools. My only criticism of what Senator Moynihan said is \nhe failed to mention the University of Delaware which, I must confess, \nis really a hidden jewel. But I share the pride, and I think it is \nimportant that we do everything that we can to strengthen this, both \nthe private and public sector, in these days where knowledge and \ntechnology is of even greater importance than any other time.\n  I would also like to speak very briefly about Amtrak, because it \nseems to me we have our last clear chance to do something about it. I \nhave to tell you that for the last several months, I have fought tooth \nand nail to try to bring about a solution. Mr. President, I cannot \nimagine the leading industrial nation of the world, the only superpower \nnot having a modern passenger rail system. It is just unconscionable \nfor that to happen, particularly in these times when we are running out \nof--I don't know about the State of New York, but I can tell you, in my \nlittle State of Delaware, we are running out of land. How many highways \ncan we build? How many planes can fly over? What are we going to do \nabout the environment? This is a critical matter, not only to the \nNortheast but to the entire country.\n  I couldn't agree more with Senator Moynihan than when he calls upon \nthe Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Labor to provide \nsome leadership. This can still be salvaged, it still can be saved, but \nit means that the parties that are involved and interested are going to \nhave to get together and bring about the kind of reform that assures a \nsound future for our rail system.\n  This, again I say, is our last clear chance. We have the funds in \nthere. They are available. Now it is up to those who have the voice on \nreform to get together and compromise and work together, just as we did \nin our committee.\n  I again express my appreciation to the distinguished Senator for his \ncontributions and cooperation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, can I just say thanks once again to the \nchairman, and add that there is every reason to think that Amtrak is on \nthe verge of financial stability, with a new rail system, fast rail \nsystem, and just when we are about to succeed, we can thwart the whole \nenterprise. I hope we will not do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I find my friend has been waiting \nso very patiently. The floor is now his.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank both colleagues. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to take 15 minutes off the time that has been given \nto Senator Bumpers, and I ask Senator Moynihan whether I might get 10 \nminutes from his time, if that would be OK.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator most surely can. I wish he \nwould.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say to Senator \nRoth and Senator Moynihan, since my comments will be in disagreement, \nthat I have tremendous respect for all the work that they have done. \nBoth of them represent the very best of public service. But I can't, as \na matter of principle, vote for this budget agreement. I support \nbalancing the budget through a process which observes basic principles \nof economic and social justice and embodies the notion of shared \nsacrifice in pursuit of the common good, the common interest, the \npeople's interest. But despite the cheers of its supporters, this deal \nfails miserably those tests.\n  In the midst of all the cheering over this deal, we face a quiet \ncrisis. It is not a war, it is not a broad economic calamity, but it is \na crisis, nonetheless. This is, by the averages and the indicators, a \nprosperous time for our country. It is a time of sustained economic \ngrowth and low inflation, of a booming stock market and low \nunemployment. There is no blare of bugles, no moan of universal \ndistress, no loud hordes of protesters clamoring in our streets. But \naverages are misleading. They tell nothing of the end of the curve, the \nheight at the top or the depth at the bottom, and that is where our \ncrisis resides. It is a quiet crisis of money, power, and injustice. It \nis the crisis of a nation in danger of abandoning the principles of \nequality and justice that are so fundamental to our resilience and to \nour future together.\n  The principle of economic justice in this bill has been eclipsed. I \nfear it will accelerate growing inequalities in our country that we all \nshould be committed to combat. We have moved in recent years back to a \ndarker time. It is a more stratified America. It is really two \nAmericas: one America with mounting access to the things that make life \nricher in possibility; the other caught in a constant struggle to make \nends meet.\n  One able to purchase the security of gated communities and private \nschools; the other beset by the dangers of a decaying social fabric.\n  One America swiftly navigating the information superhighway, the \nother lacking the rudimentary skills needed to navigate an ever-more \ncomplex society.\n  One enriched by a rising stock market; the other at the uncertain \nmercies of the job market.\n  One wondering when to take a vacation to Europe or Asia; the other \nhoping to save enough to take a family to a ball game.\n\n[[Page S8422]]\n\n  This other America, this second America is not inhabited by just the \npoor or neglected minority. It is, in fact, the residence of the \nAmerican majority. It is the homeland of most of our workers, most of \nour families, most of our children, and it is precisely this America \nthat the budget agreement fails to serve fully and fairly.\n  I would support a deal that required truly shared sacrifice while \ninvesting in our future, but shared sacrifice is not what this package \nis all about. Instead, it is about working families sacrificing and \nWall Street investors and big companies garnering the lion's share of \nthe benefits.\n  Balancing the short-term budget fairly is a responsible and it is a \nworthwhile goal, made easier by our recent economic boom. But building \na strong economy, preserving a shared prosperity, ensuring social and \neconomic stability for the next generation by investing in their health \nand their skills and their character, our children, this is a far \nloftier and far more difficult goal for which we should have been \nstriving in this budget agreement, and this agreement falls short of \nthose goals.\n  First, the agreement is unfair. At times, it is grossly unfair, I say \nto my colleagues, to the vast majority of working Americans who deserve \nreal tax relief but will not get it in this bill, because most of the \nbenefits go to the wealthiest 3 to 4 percent of the taxpayers and the \nprofitable companies.\n  Second, this agreement is shortsighted, starving our Nation's \ninvestment needs, investments critical to our future economic and \nsocial prosperity, in order to pay for large, unfair, and unwarranted \ntax cuts.\n  Third, and perhaps most ironically, since its ostensible purpose is \nto balance the budget, it is fiscally irresponsible. By locking into \nplace hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy, as \nfar as the eye can see, many of which will grow larger and larger over \ntime, it will cause the deficit to explode just as the baby boomers are \nexpected to retire and begin to draw on programs like Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  While this agreement has been hailed by some Democrats because it \npartially preserves funding for certain health care, education, and \nother programs that Republicans have been trying to slash for almost 3 \nyears, and it is hailed by Republicans because it contains the huge tax \ncuts for the wealthy for which they have so long fought and sought, a \ncloser look is called for in the midst of all this cheerleading.\n  As a legislator, I have discovered that too often if the deal appears \nto give all things to all parties, as this one does, something is not \nquite right.\n  Americans should take a closer look at the details of this package. \nWhen they do, they will be very troubled by what they see. Even with \nthe marginal improvements which were forced by the President and the \nDemocratic colleagues in the Congress, it still is a deeply flawed \nagreement which mortgages the economic futures of our children for the \nshort-term political benefit which some will derive by claiming to have \nbalanced the budget.\n  Unless we revisit this deal soon, it will lock us into a program of \nhuge tax cuts, mainly going to the wealthiest of people, funded by \nequally large spending cuts in virtually every single basic function of \nGovernment--environmental protection, airline safety, crime control, \nscience and health and technology research, health care for the frail \nand the elderly and the poor.\n  And, Mr. President, it will do so while continuing the Republican \nCongress tradition of stuffing more money into the Pentagon than even \nthe Pentagon has requested, more B-2 bombers and ships and fighters \nthan we need, mostly to preserve jobs in key congressional districts.\n  As one of my colleagues observed, this bill sacrifices tomorrow's \nhopes for today's headlines. That is a mistake for which we will all \npay for years to come, just as we did for the mistakes of the early \n1980's and its exploding deficits.\n  Mr. President, the President of the United States said, among other \nthings, he would only sign on to a deal that was fair, fiscally \nresponsible, with no exploding deficits in the next 10 years or so. \nThese were the basic tests that he said he would apply to any final \nagreement. But this agreement clearly fails the fairness test. The sad \nfact is that low-income families get virtually nothing--nothing--from \nthis tax cut bill, working families get very little, and the wealthy \nare the big winners in this tax bill.\n  While the ink is barely dry on the deal--and so we do not have any \nofficial information about its actual distributional impact--we are \nasked to vote on this without getting any official information about \nwho exactly is going to benefit and who is going to be asked to \nsacrifice.\n  Preliminary analysis suggests a disastrously lopsided approach skewed \nto the very rich, those making over $200,000 a year annually. That is \nnot the middle class in America. The nonpartisan group, Citizens for \nTax Justice, has run the numbers through a fairly sophisticated \ndistributional model. And they found that the tax package delivers \nabout half of its benefits to the top 5 percent of the taxpayers.\n  Half of the benefits go to the top 5 percent of the taxpayers. The \naverage tax cut for middle-class working families and individuals, when \nyou figure in all the tax hikes and cuts together, is about $200. For \nthe richest 1 percent, it is about $16,000. I had hoped for substantial \ntax relief for working families. This bill only offers about one-fourth \nof its overall relief to those making under $100,000 a year. I think \nworking families should not have to settle for scraps from the tax cut \ntable. They should have been the first in line for relief. But that is \nnot the case.\n  But just a few examples.\n  The alternative minimum tax was passed in 1986. With tax fairness, \nlarge companies ought to pay, large profitable companies ought to pay \nat least some tax. That has essentially been gutted. The Treasury \nDepartment estimates that these changes would take 76,000 profitable \ncorporations completely off the tax rolls, and to the tune of $18 \nbillion over the next 10 years.\n  Another example. While this budget provides little or no relief for \nworking families, it gives wealthy Americans huge capital gains tax \ncuts. The vast majority of these benefits from the cuts in capital \ngains go to big investors, people making $200,000, $300,000, and \n$400,000 annually. Hardly tax fairness.\n  Mr. President, not only is this deal unfair, it is shortsighted, it \nignores our most critical needs as a nation, including repairing and \nrebuilding our crumbling schools. Not one penny is invested in our \ncrumbling schools, including dealing with our crumbling inner cities, \nour underdeveloped rural areas.\n  Through its spending controls, it provides for huge and still \nunspecified cuts in Federal investments that my colleagues apparently \ndo not like to talk about much, an estimated $272 billion in such \nnondefense cuts over the next 10 years while it claims to ``protect'' \nsome priority programs.\n  I am very skeptical. There is not a penny here for crumbling schools \nto secure educational opportunities for children. How come that was not \na priority program? There is too little for job training for dislocated \nworkers, for workers struggling to move off welfare into good jobs, and \nthere is too little by way of reinvesting in our inner cities, the \nenvironmental protection, in basic key investments critical to our \nNation's future.\n  Mr. President, I voted against the spending bill. And I will vote \nagainst this tax bill. I do not understand how my colleagues can \nbasically view these matters separately. They are part of one package \nand one deal. And I will just give some examples.\n  We now have huge, significant cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. And they \nare being used to pay for the tax cuts in this deal, which \ndisproportionately go to the top 1, 2, 3 percent of the population that \nneed the assistance the least. That is part of the tradeoff.\n  Mr. President, Medicare will be cut by $115 billion over the next 5 \nyears. And the proposal assumes $385 billion in cuts over 10 years. In \nMedicaid, we will be cutting $13 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Mr. President, in rural Minnesota, where the hospitals and the \nclinics are not greedy--a small profit margin--60, 70, 80 percent of \nthe patient payment mix is Medicare and Medicaid. Please, do not have \nany illusions about this.\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\n The cuts to the providers will make it difficult for some of these \nhospitals and clinics to go on. When they no longer exist, that hurts \nour rural communities.\n  Mr. President, the cuts in medical assistance disproportionately hurt \nour children's hospitals and disproportionately hurt our inner-city \nhospitals which are safety net hospitals for the poorest Americans--\nincluding children--in America.\n  My colleagues say to me, ``Well, but this overall agreement, it's not \nthat bad, after all.'' And I say, ``Compared to what?'' To the earlier \nRepublican bills, which the huge majority of American people rejected, \nthis is an improvement. We did not go forward with a $5 copay, even \nthough it passed in the Senate, for elderly people for home health care \nvisits.\n  We have done better by way of graduate medical education. And, yes, \nMr. President, we have $24 billion more in children's health care. And \nit includes also some additional parity, nondiscrimination for children \nand families struggling with mental illness. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Domenici. It is a labor of love to work with him on this.\n\n  But, Mr. President, we still do not know at the State level how much \nof this will reach the children. We hope it does. There are 10 million \nchildren without coverage. I have seen projections anywhere from 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion to 5 million will be covered, though it is block granted to the \nStates. And we do not have the ironclad guarantees that we need. We \nneed to fulfill our goal of providing adequate and complete care for \nall children in America.\n  But, Mr. President, irony built upon ironies. My colleagues say it is \nnot that bad, we are doing better for children. I give credit where \ncredit is due. But last Congress we cut $25 billion in the major food \nnutrition program for children. It ultimately will be a 20-percent cut \nin food stamps, and about 70 percent of the recipients are children. \nAlmost all of them are in working families, usually families with \nincomes under $7,000 a year. This directly affects the quality of their \nhealth care. I did not see any restoration of any funding for the major \nchild nutrition program in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues say we did better for legal immigrants. \nWe restored some of the supplemental security income for those \nimmigrants that have been in this country, but, Mr. President, we \neliminated all of the food nutrition assistance. So if you have an \nelderly Hmong woman in Saint Paul, and she has $450 of SSI and another \n$75 in food stamps, and that is her total monthly income--and that is \nexactly the figure for many people --we did not restore any, we did not \nrestore one penny of food nutrition assistance. It is not that bad but, \nMr. President, this piece of legislation is also not that good.\n  Mr. President, I do not understand exactly what the concept of \njustice is here. I do not know what happened to the principle of \njustice and fairness. Not only do we have the tax cuts going \ndisproportionately to the top 5 percent of the population, but even \nwhen we say we are going to help children and families, we decide that \nwe will do nothing for the poorest.\n  The child tax credit is refundable. And now we say it is refundable \nto families with incomes over $100,000 a year. But if you are a family \nwith an income of under $18,000 a year, you are not eligible at all. We \ndecided that families with over $100,000 a year needed the assistance. \nBut since we have the earned-income tax credits, we decided that \nfamilies with incomes under $18,000 a year would not be eligible for a \nchild credit at all. What kind of standard of justice is that?\n  I spent a lot of time with those families. I see their struggles. \nDon't tell me that those families, families in America with incomes \nunder $18,000 a year, could not also have benefited from the tax credit \nso they could have provided their children with a little bit more. \nDon't tell me they would not have benefited. What concept of justice \njustifies a tax credit for families with incomes over $100,000 a year, \nbut zero, no assistance, for families earning under $18,000 a year?\n  Mr. President, on higher education, we have seen a great deal of \ndiscussion. I find it difficult to say this, but I am going to because \n20 years of my life was devoted to higher education. Some of this is a \nbit hyped. Some of it is a bit hyped. Some of it is a bit of hype.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for the tax deductions. I am grateful \nfor the tax credits which are nonrefundable, but every single financial \naid officer you want to talk to, everyone involved in financial aid \nwill tell you we should have expanded the Pell grants. The statistic \nthat is unconscionable is that a flat 8 percent, since 1979, of those \nfamilies with incomes under $20,000 a year, only a flat 8 percent have \nbeen able to graduate, men and women from those families, with \naffordability being a key problem. There are other problems but that is \nthe major problem. There is really nothing in this piece of legislation \nfor them.\n  We expanded the Pell grant by $300, but the Pell grant is now meeting \nat best about 16 percent of the student's overall need. We could have \nexpanded the Pell grant program up to $5,000 a year. It would have \nreached middle income as well for the same price tag as to what we did \nhere with the tax deduction and the tax credits.\n  But, Mr. President, the tax credits are nonrefundable. The tax \ncredits are not refundable. I will just tell you that if you spend any \ntime at the community colleges, you will find that most of the students \nare older and going back to school, and they have incomes of around \n$25,000, $26,000 a year. They are ineligible because they do not have \nthe tax liability. And we are making the claim that this is essentially \n2 years more of free education? It does not hold up. It does not hold \nup.\n  Mr. President, we say we protected priority programs. We have \nhundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, which will increase with \nevery year, disproportionately going to the top 5 percent of the \npopulation, and altogether, Mr. President, we came up with not $5 \nbillion that we were going to leverage for some investment in \nrebuilding crumbling schools, but we threw in $10 million at the end, \n$10 million for all of America. Mr. President, what kind of priorities \nare these? How could the administration have bargained this away?\n  I was down in Delta City, MS, in Tunica, MS. I visited a school. This \nwas an all-black school. The ceiling was kind of crumbling in. The \ntoilets were decrepit. If you had wanted to wash your hands after going \nto the bathroom, you would not have been able to.\n  But, Mr. President, I was in Chicago on Monday visiting with some of \nthe housing projects, and I saw the same kind of schools. You look at \nthese schools, they are so uninviting. They are crumbling. And we tell \nour children we put no value on them when we send children to such \nschools. The General Accounting Office tells us it costs $110 billion \nif we want to invest in rebuilding these crumbling schools. We have not \ninvested anything in rebuilding crumbling schools--not really--just $10 \nmillion for the whole Nation. That is a joke, and it is a cruel joke. \nHow can we say that we have protected our major priority programs when \nwe don't invest anything in rebuilding crumbling schools in America?\n\n  Mr. President, it is not just Chicago and Mississippi; it is North, \nEast, South, and West. I say to my colleagues, if you say you are \ncommitted to education, we can have a debate about educational \nstandards. Maybe they are good, maybe they are not. We can debate about \nhow you measure academic performance. We can have all those debates. \nBut this is simple: Don't send children to schools where the ceilings \nare falling in and the stench of urine is in the hallways and the \nbuildings are decrepit and expect those children to do well. We say \nthat this budget agreement protects our major priorities. What about \nthese children? Aren't they our major priority?\n  Mr. President, I was in Chicago on Monday in the Pilsen neighborhood \nwith Congressmen Gutierrez and Bobby Rush at the Robert Taylor Home \nHousing Project. St. Augustine had a wonderful Head Start Program. It \nwas a great program. I was inspired by their work. But, Mr. President, \nthey could take 30-some children at the site we visited, and they have \n335 children who want to participate--335 children who could be given a \nhead start if we fully funded this program.\n  Altogether we have added $324 million. We have 4 million children in \nthe United States of America, from birth\n\n[[Page S8424]]\n\nto age 5, who were not served by the Head Start Program, and we have \ninvested a measly $324 million, which we claim--and it doesn't hold up \nunder scrutiny--will lead to an additional 1 million children. Why \ndon't we fully fund Head Start? If the program does what it says it \ndoes, which is to give children a head start, why give the tax benefits \nto the wealthiest of people and, at the same time, not the investment \nin rebuilding crumbling schools and not an investment in Head Start? \nEverywhere I go, all across the United States of America, whether it is \nrural or urban, I see the successes with kids, I see men and women who \nwork with these children. They should be famous. They make too little \nmoney as Head Start teachers or as teacher assistants. We say these are \nthe critical years, and we say the very early part of children's lives \nis the most critical time, and we invest $324 million, and that is it.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues support this bill and they call \nit, on balance, a good piece of work. I simply cannot join them in \ntheir enthusiasm because I am too painfully aware of the people this \nbill leaves behind. Mr. President, the benefits are skewed toward \nAmerica's very wealthy, and when working families find this out, they \nwill not be pleased.\n  Mr. President, this piece of legislation, this budget deal, leaves \ntoo many Americans behind. We can and we should balance the budget \nfairly and responsibly, observing the principle of shared sacrifice and \neconomic justice, making the Tax Code fairer, simpler, and flatter in \nthe process, and investing in our Nation's future. We could have done \nthat because the economy is booming and it is much easier to do it now \nthan a few years ago. But with this bill, Mr. President, we have failed \nin that effort at fairness.\n  If this balanced budget agreement is to be the great accomplishment \nof 8 years of Democratic Presidency, then history will judge us \nharshly. With a budget that we already have, that is essentially in \nsubstantial balance because of the policies of the past 4 years, this \nagreement today is really a triumph of the past rather than a bridge to \nthe century to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating the Senator \nfrom Delaware for the extraordinary job he has done in putting together \nthis tax reduction package, which is directed primarily to assisting \nAmerican families, working families of middle-income means, to make it \neasier on them to meet the day-to-day expenses of raising a family. It \ntakes giant strides in assisting especially the American middle-income \nfamily in dealing with the cost of education, which is absolutely \ncritical. The effort that was put into this by the Senator from \nDelaware in leading this initiative and pulling this together and \ngetting it passed is nothing short of extraordinary. It will go down as \none of the finest hours, I think, in this body and certainly in this \nCongress. I congratulate him for it.\n  I wanted to speak briefly about a couple of areas in the bill that I \nthink are especially positive and for which I thank the Senator from \nDelaware for working so hard on them.\n  First is the area of estate tax reform. We have heard a lot about how \nthis bill greatly helps especially the small businessperson and farmer \nin being able to retain their business and pass it on to their heirs--\ntheir children, in most instances--so they can continue to run the \nbusiness, so that all the years of sweat equity put in on building a \nfamily farm or a small business won't be lost or confiscated on the \ndeath of the primary owner of the estate, but rather will be passed on \nto his or her family, and the tax burden on that small businessman or \nfarmer is dramatically reduced.\n  But there is another item in this bill that has not been talked about \nat all, which I think is especially important in places like New \nHampshire, and that is the conservation tax--a tax break for people who \nleave their land or keep their land in conservation, or in the \nsilviculture activities, upon the death of the primary owner of the \nestate. This section of the bill, which was initiated by myself and \nSenator Chafee from Rhode Island, is basically directed at addressing a \nproblem which we see especially in New England. There is tremendous \npressure on our forest areas to convert those areas to development. \nMany people in New England--especially in New Hampshire--run very small \ntree farms, or operate a lumber business, or a logging business, or a \nbusiness that in some way uses the forest lands. In addition, there are \na lot of people who, just for the purposes of being good citizens, keep \ntheir lands open. They don't develop them. They keep their lands in a \nnatural, or fairly close to natural, state, and their lands in many \ninstances are used for recreation or are used for hunting and used, \nobviously, to maintain the environment.\n  Unfortunately, when these folks pass on, because of the nature of New \nEngland today and the heavy populations that we have and the expansion \nof population that we have, in most instances these pieces of land \naren't valued for the purposes of running a tree farm or maintaining \nwood lots. They usually are valued for some higher use, defined by the \nterms of cost, such as a mall or, in many instances, a housing \ndevelopment of some nature. The result of that is that the property in \nthe estate ends up being valued at an extraordinarily high level. The \nheirs who receive the land have no option but to sell the land, develop \nthe land, and as a result, convert the land from forestry use into some \nsort of commercial or construction use, which has two events. First, it \nobviously ends the ability of the forestry industry to use that land \nfor the purposes of maintaining forest and silviculture activity. \nSecond, it ends up developing land. That changes the character of the \nState in many ways.\n\n  There are a lot of people who would rather not develop the lands. A \nlot of heirs are willing to keep the land as a production for forestry \nactivities, or as a conservation area, but they can't afford to do that \nbecause the taxes are so high. So in this bill, as a result of the \nefforts of the chairman of the committee, myself, and Senator Chafee, \nthere is now a new deduction that allows people, who agree to do it, to \nretain their land as a conservation easement when they receive it from \nan estate and, thus, keep it as land that is protected for the purposes \nof keeping it in a fairly natural state--using it for timbering if they \ndesire to do so. There will be a deduction relative to the value of \nthat land of about 40 percent, which is a major plus. It is a major \ncommitment to the community, a major commitment, obviously, to the \nindividuals who will be receiving the land, that the Federal Government \nisn't going to force people to sell their land in order to pay their \ntaxes by putting a value on the land that is so high that they have no \noption but to sell their land. That is good news.\n  Now, this only applies to certain types of land. It applies to land \nwhich lies within a certain distance of a national forest or an urban \nforest. So it doesn't apply to all of the land in New England or all of \nthe land in the country. It does apply to land which is basically in \nthe same area as the area which has already been protected for the \npurposes of maintaining its pristine qualities. That only makes sense \nthat that type of land should be the land that we are targeting, so \nthat we don't end up with large commercial developments surrounding our \nnational forests and urban forests.\n  As a result of this language being put in the bill and the way it was \nput in, it will actually apply to about 90 percent of New Hampshire \nbecause so much of it is a national forest. We have the largest \nnational forest, I believe, east of the Mississippi. Certainly, we have \nthe largest national forest in the Northeast, or the most visited in \nthe Northeast, the White Mountain National Forest, which takes up about \n17 percent of the State, I believe. Therefore, it has a very \nsignificant land mass within the State. So this is good news for those \nof us who believe very strongly that maintaining the character of the \nland, in the State of New Hampshire especially, is critical. This will \nallow those folks who receive land coming out of an estate to keep that \nland as forest land, if they desire to do\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\nso, and not be forced to sell in order to pay taxes. That is a very big \nplus.\n  The second element I want to congratulate Senator Roth for deals with \nretirement provisions in this bill. There is a very positive expansion \nof the ability of people to save for retirement in this bill. Of \ncourse, there is the famous Roth IRA accounts, which we heard a fair \namount about, which are a series of expansions of IRA accounts. More \nimportant, this is a whole series of initiatives which came out of a \nworking group I chair, the leadership task force on retirement reform. \nThirteen of those items are in this bill. They give the small \nbusinesspeople in this country much more flexibility in putting in \nplace retirement accounts and gives individuals much more flexibility \nin the area of being able to participate in saving for their \nretirement, and they are very strong initiatives.\n  I will say a few words about what this tax bill will mean to American \nfamilies and to their ability to save for retirement.\n  Earlier this year I was named to chair a Republican Retirement \nSecurity Task Force. We introduced a series of reforms as S. 883.\n  Senator Roth's contribution to the task force's work was vital. I \nalso appreciate his willingness to work in favor of many of these \nprovisions in this tax legislation.\n  This Nation faces a dire need to expand retirement saving to meet the \nretirement needs of an aging 21st century population.\n  But behind this general national picture are the real-life concerns \nof millions of hard-working American families, who are concerned about \ntheir prospects for retirement. This bill will significantly increase \ntheir chances to achieve a dignified and secure retirement.\n  I would like to describe some of these provisions and the effect that \nthey would have for families.\n  Consider a family, John and Mary Smith, where John is a full-time \npaid employee, and Mary is working within the home. Or, perhaps Mary is \nworking full time, and John is working within the home. Between them, \nthey earn $50,000. And suppose that John, but not Mary, is able to \nparticipate in a pension plan at work.\n  Under the old law, this couple could not make a deductible \ncontribution to an IRA. But under this bill, now Mary can make a fully \ntax-deductible $2,000 contribution to an IRA.\n  And the same is true whether this family earns $50,000 or $60,000 or \n$70,000--on up to $150,000. Because of this tax legislation, a huge \nnumber of families will now be able to participate in tax-deferred IRA \naccounts.\n  An article in the Washington Post this morning indicated that fully 7 \nmillion new IRA accounts will be opened because of this measure alone. \nThink of what that will do for a couple's retirement security--if they \nare able to put away $2,000, tax-deferred, every year.\n  Consider another couple: Michael and Susan Jones. Suppose they have a \nfamily farm. And because of the fortunes of farming, their income goes \nup and down from year to year. Perhaps one year they earn $50,000--and \nthe next year they only earn $30,000.\n  Under current law, this couple is going to be very concerned about \nwhether they can save in an IRA. They don't know whether their \ncontributions will be tax-deductible or not. One year it is, the next \nyear it isn't. It's very difficult for them to know, as the year \nprogresses, whether they can afford to put the money in.\n  Under this legislation, we have created something new for them--the \nback-loaded IRA. Now Michael and Susan can make contributions to an IRA \nwithout worrying about whether they will get the tax benefits--because \nthose tax benefits will come at the end of the road. They don't get the \ntax deduction now, when they contribute to the IRA, but they know that \nat the end of the game, they will have tax-advantaged earnings through \nthe IRA. This legislation gives them a new way to gain tax advantages \nfrom savings.\n  And, this legislation also vastly expands traditional IRA accounts--\ndoubling the income limits for tax deductibility over the next 5 years. \nAs a result, millions of Americans will find it easier to save for \nretirement.\n  This legislation also contains many of the pension reform provisions \nwhich we worked so hard to create in S. 883.\n  This legislation increase the security of employer-provided \npensions--by increasing the amount of employer funding to meet those \npension liabilities.\n  Under current law, Mr. President, most employers do not have enough \nfunding in these pension plans to meet eventual liabilities. Not \nbecause the employers won't do it--but rather because the Government \nwon't let hem. We had sharply limited the amount of funding that \nemployers may put in these pension plans.\n\n  So when Frank Williams goes to work, there is often only enough \nfunding in his pension plan to support benefits that he would receive \nif he and everyone else in the company retired today. Frank hopes to \nwork longer, to accrue a larger pension benefit someday, as does \neveryone in the company. And the liabilities of the pension plan will \neventually be much larger, because everyone working there will someday \nbe entitled to much higher benefits than are accounted for in current \nmeasures of liability.\n  Under this legislation, we will raise the limits on employer funding \nof pensions--from 150 percent of current liability to 170 percent. \nEmployers will be permitted to fund at a level that is closer to their \nprojected liability. This means greater retirement security for all \nAmericans. It means that there will be more funds in Frank Williams' \npension plan.\n  Now consider the case of another hard-working American, Walter \nTaylor, an aspiring entrepreneur, starting his or her own business. \nUnder the old law, if he started a pension plan, and he was therefore \npaying both the employer match and the employee contribution for his \nown pension benefits, he would not get the same tax treatment that \nother employers get. This legislation will create a level playing field \nfor the self-employed, and says that they too will receive the same tax \ntreatment of their matching contributions that other employers receive.\n  This will be a tremendous benefit to small businesses, which is where \nwe most need to expand pension coverage.\n  This legislation will also make it easier and more convenient for \nfamilies to save through IRA's--by facilitating automatic payroll \ndeductions into IRA's.\n  This legislation will also make it easier for State and local \ngovernment plans to operate, by exempting them from the cumbersome \nnondiscrimination rules that were not intended for Government plans.\n  This legislation will streamline and simplify paperwork and reporting \nrequirements. It will eliminate the need for obsolete and unnecessary \nforms, and will also facilitate the use of electronic technology to \nreplace old paperwork.\n  Finally, the legislation will make a number of technical corrections \nto the law, straightening out inconsistencies between tax and \nregulatory treatment of pension contributions, inconsistencies that \nhave frustrated employers and pension administrators alike.\n  I am pleased to have been the principal sponsor of these provisions, \nand I commend and thank those who have worked to bring us closer to \nenacting them into law.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for allowing me to \nprecede her. I thank the Senator from Delaware for allowing me to speak \nand for his extraordinary effort.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for his very gracious remarks.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I am now pleased to yield 15 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman, Senator \nRoth, for the extraordinary work he has done to bring this before us \ntoday for passage.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference \nreport on the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the first major tax cut for \nthe middle class that the Congress has passed since 1981.\n  This historic tax cut bill, along with the companion Balanced Budget \nAct, represents very good news for the American people. These measures \nput the Federal Government on the road to a balanced budget, and will \nprovide much-needed tax relief for middle-class families in Maine and \nacross the Nation.\n  There are several small business and education provisions that I am \nparticularly pleased to see included in the legislation before us \ntoday. These proposals have been among my highest priorities since \ncoming to the Senate.\n  In fact, the very first bill I introduced as a Senator was designed \nto provide tax relief for family-owned businesses and farms. I am, \ntherefore, delighted that the Taxpayer Relief Act will provide \nsubstantial estate or death tax relief for family-owned businesses and \nfarms, the backbone of our economy in Maine. Effective in January of \nnext year, these businesses and farms will be eligible for a $1.3 \nmillion exemption from Federal estate taxes, more than double the \ncurrent $600,000 exemption.\n  Mr. President, I cannot tell you how strongly I feel about providing \nthis relief. Time and again family business owners in Maine have told \nme of their painful decisions to dismember their companies, to sell \nthem to large out-of-State corporations, in order to avoid saddling \ntheir children with enormous debt to pay the estate tax. The tax is \nwrong. It is simply unfair. We ought to be encouraging family \nbusinesses to prosper and to continue from generation to generation.\n  Given that family businesses will create two-thirds of the new jobs \nin the future, our Tax Code should encourage their creation, expansion, \nand continuation. The current estate tax structure penalizes job \ncreation and, according to several studies, has actually cost our \nNation as many as 220,000 jobs--220,000 jobs lost because of this \nonerous tax. Passing the estate tax relief provisions of this bill will \nallow family business owners to invest in their companies, rather than \nin a platoon of attorneys, accountants, and insurance agents attempting \nto alleviate the estate tax bite.\n  Adopting this proposal will mean that these businesses and farms can \nstay in the family, and be passed from generation to generation, from \nparents to their children, instead of being sold in order to pay taxes \nas happens all too frequently under the current estate tax laws. These \nreforms will help keep the family in our family businesses and good \njobs in our communities.\n  In addition, the tax package contains some very important reforms \nthat will help make a college education more affordable for middle-\nincome families, another of my top priorities.\n  Mr. President, prior to serving in the Senate, I worked at Husson \nCollege, a small college in Bangor, ME, whose students primarily come \nfrom lower and middle-income families. Most Husson students are the \nfirst members of their family to attend college.\n  At Husson, I came to appreciate the critical role that Pell grants \nand student loan programs play in making college available to many \nstudents, but I also learned that our current programs do far too \nlittle to help many middle-class families who have to carry the heavy \nburden of college costs for their children largely by themselves.\n  This is a very serious problem. I am pleased that this legislation \ncontains several provisions that are specifically designed to make it \neasier for middle-income families to save for their children's \neducation and to help graduates pay back their student loans.\n  For example, families will be allowed to establish tax-deferred \neducation IRA's that reward them for planning and saving for their \nchildren's college education.\n  Especially important, this legislation allows students to deduct up \nto $2,500 annually in interest on their student loans. Many college \ngraduates are faced with daunting debts that will strain their finances \nfor years. We currently do not do enough for those for whom the road to \ncollege ends not with a pot of gold but with a pile of debt. Many \ncollege graduates are faced with daunting debts from their student \nloans that will strain their finances for years.\n\n  Many students in my home State of Maine, when confronted with this \ndilemma, either decide not to pursue a college education at all, or \ndecide to drop out of college. That is one important reason why Maine \nranks a dismal 49th out of the 50 States in the number of high school \ngraduates going on to college. That is why this student loan interest \ndeduction is so critical to bringing college within reach of many \nmiddle-income families.\n  Mr. President, these proposals--the education savings account and the \ntax deduction for student loan interest--were included in legislation I \nintroduced earlier this year, the College Access and Affordability Act \nof 1997. I am very pleased to see that they were included in the \nconference report. Making higher education more accessible and \naffordable is essential if we are to have a high-quality work force \nable to compete in a global marketplace in the 21st century.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to note several other important \nprovisions that will help our small businesses--the job creators in \nthis country. This legislation will make health insurance more \naffordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-employed. They \ninclude our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our electricians, our \nplumbers, and many owners of our small mom-and-pop stores that dot the \ncommunities throughout our State.\n  Under this package, self-employed workers will be able to deduct 100 \npercent of their health insurance premiums by the year 2007. \nEstablishing parity of health insurance costs between the self-employed \nand those working for large businesses is a matter of basic equity, and \nit will also help to reduce the number of uninsured, but working, \nAmericans.\n  Finally, another important provision for small businesses is the \nrestoration of the home office tax deduction, which was nullified by a \nSupreme Court ruling several years ago. Home-based businesses are \nexploding all over Maine. This bill will enable many entrepreneurs in \nMaine and throughout the Nation to once again deduct the very \nlegitimate expenses associated with working out of their homes.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to once again commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senator Nickles, \nSenator Moynihan, the ranking minority member, and all of those who \nhave played such a vital role in crafting such historic legislation. It \nwill provide tax relief to our families, to our small businesses, to \nour family farms, and to our students--to our entrepreneurs.\n  It is a terrific bill that deserves broad bipartisan support. This \nlegislation has my enthusiastic support, and I appreciate very much \nbeing able to speak to my colleagues on this issue.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume off Senator Moynihan's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  I say to my colleague, Senator Hagel, that I think they are under an \ninformal understanding of going back and forth. I would be glad to hold \noff, if the Senator has another responsibility elsewhere. I would be \nhappy to stand down and allow him to proceed.\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. My friend and colleague is very generous. My only other \nresponsibility, after just a couple of brief comments, would be to \npreside over your insightful commentary on the floor of the Senate. If \nI might take advantage of the Senator's generosity, I would not need \nmore than 5 minutes at the most.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the chairman, and to my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota, I thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a couple of minutes to give some \nperspective about what this body has been doing the last few months, \nculminating in a vote shortly today or tomorrow on the Tax Relief Act, \nand what we have just done this morning in the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Four years ago almost exactly, the Congress of the United States \npassed the largest tax increase in the history of America. I bring that \npoint to the front because, Mr. President, the agenda has changed. The \nissues have changed. We are now talking about cutting spending, cutting \ntaxes, balancing the budget, and actually stepping up to the short-term \nand long-term challenges in our entitlement programs. I might add as \nwell that this is a bipartisan effort. The vote that we just held this \nmorning on the balanced budget amendment was 85 to 15 with strong \nbipartisan support--Democrats and Republicans working together.\n  As we approach a new century--a hopeful, dynamic, energetic, new \ncentury full of great promise for our next generation--it is very \nappropriate that we take in this body the responsibility to focus on \nfiscal change and infrastructure change to prepare us as we go into \nthis next century. We cannot hope to compete in a global economy when \nwe overtax, overspend, and overregulate. I believe that all of us in \nthis body have come to that conclusion.\n  The House overwhelmingly last night passed the balanced budget \namendment. They, too, will vote on the tax act, as we will shortly. But \nsometimes in the rush of the activity and the heat of the moment and \nthe passion of the politics, we tend to forget what has been \naccomplished here. This has been a remarkable accomplishment. \nImperfect? Of course. Tax cuts--not deep enough. Spending cuts--not \ndeep enough. This body is on record in going further on dealing with \nsome of the tough, tough issues that we are going to have to deal with \nin Medicare and entitlements. But what is important is that we have \nmade a beginning--a very strong, substantive beginning. It is due to \nthe efforts of both sides of the aisle and all in this body who have \nhelped to make this happen.\n  I listened to my colleagues this morning walk through some of the \nspecifics of the tax bill. I think they are worthy of what we have done \nbecause, as you frame it up and understand it, what we have done is, \nfor the first time in 16 years, we are about to bring real tax relief \nto Americans. By our vote this morning we have started to begin to \nharness the energy and the resources that we have in this country with \nshowing some fiscal responsibility--balance the budget and, again, in a \nbipartisan way. Those are elements that should not be forgotten or \ndismissed easily when both sides of this debate talk about what we have \ndone and what we have not done.\n  So I, Mr. President, appreciate the opportunity to bring some general \nperspective to this, because occasionally we don't step back enough and \nunderstand what really has happened here and how this will strengthen \nthis country and the opportunities for our young people as we go into \nthe next century.\n  Again, imperfect, more to do, strong beginning. And I, for one, Mr. \nPresident, as a new Senator to this body, am proud to have voted for \nthe balanced budget amendment this morning, and I intend to vote for \nthe Tax Relief Act when it comes to this floor.\n  I appreciate the time which my distinguished colleague from North \nDakota and the chairman of the Finance Committee have given me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield myself such time as I might consume off the \nranking member's time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and the very great \ncontribution of the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator \nLautenberg. In addition, I want to recognize the exceptional efforts \nwith respect to the tax bill of the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, and Senator Moynihan, the ranking member.\n  First, let me say with respect to Senator Roth, that he conducted the \nFinance Committee as I hope all committees of Congress would be \nconducted. He was absolutely fair. He conducted that committee with a \nbipartisan spirit. I think it made a great difference in bringing us to \nthis point.\n  I think for too long in Congress on both sides there have been those \nwho conducted themselves in a very partisan way. Senator Roth chose to \nconduct himself in a bipartisan way. That did not mean Senator Roth \ngave up his long-held views on taxes and spending. He certainly did \nnot, nor did others of us who may disagree. We had a full and fair \ndebate, and all of us took principled positions that were ones we \ndeeply hold. But there is no reason we cannot have full and fair debate \nand treat each other with respect. That occurred in the Finance \nCommittee, and Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan deserve great credit. \nI want to say that at the outset. I hope that serves as a pattern of \nhow we conduct ourselves going forward in the Senate. I think that is \nthe model of how people in this country would like to see us conduct \nour business. So I want to say to Senator Roth, thank you for being a \ngentleman and conducting yourself with grace.\n  Mr. President, I, too, am proud to have voted for the provisions that \nwe passed this morning that will finish the job of balancing the \nunified budget. I am also going to be proud to vote for the tax bill. \nWhile it is not precisely as I would have written it if I were given a \nfree hand, none of us can be given a free hand. We are part of a \nlegislative body, 100 on this side, 435 in the House and, of course, we \nhave the White House to consider because the President can exercise a \nveto.\n  We worked together to fashion a result that is a compromise. I think \nit is a very principled compromise. I think it is a fair result. \nFrankly, I would have done more by way of deficit reduction. I wish we \nhad been more ambitious. I wish we would have done more in long-term \nreform of entitlement programs. But that was not to be. That is for \nanother day.\n  Mr. President, we have made progress. This package in total does not \nreduce the deficit as much as I would have liked. But nonetheless there \nis solid deficit reduction here, about $175 billion of net deficit \nreduction over the 5 years.\n  I have been part of a group of centrists, a group of 25 Senators \nevenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. We had a more \nambitious package of deficit reduction, I would say perhaps twice as \nmuch. I would like to have seen that package passed. We also supported \nin the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis more far-reaching \nentitlement reforms, especially with respect to Medicare, but others in \nthe House would not vote for those changes. Notwithstanding the fact \nthat I would like to have seen a different package, a more ambitious \npackage, the fact is this package is worthy of support. It does further \nreduce the deficit. It does bring us to unified balance. I want to make \ncertain we all understand the difference between unified balance and \nwhat I would consider a true balanced budget. But it also provides \nexpanded educational opportunity for our children. There is provided in \nthe previous legislation we passed this morning a broader coverage for \nchildren in health care. It provides for tax relief. There are a whole \nseries of provisions that I think are going to be useful, including \nchild tax credits and educational credits. There is also tax reform in \na number of other areas, including estate taxes. Estate tax relief will \nbe especially important in a State\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\nlike mine where we have many small businessmen and farmers. We have a \npackage of increased savings opportunities. Nobody is more responsible \nfor those than Senator Roth of Delaware. He has had a passion for \nexpanding IRA's and they will provide an incentive, I believe, for \nfurther savings and investment.\n  There are also capital gains changes that will be welcome in many \ncircles. I personally would not have favored the extent of capital \ngains changes passed here. I would have favored a more targeted \napproach. But nonetheless, we did reach an agreement, and as I said \nearlier, this agreement is worthy of support.\n  I, too, want to put this in perspective. I may have a different \nperspective than the occupant of the Chair as he expressed it a few \nmoments ago. I remember 1993 very well. The deficit was $290 billion, \nand every projection that we had said the deficit was going higher. The \nDemocrats at that time had just been elected to the White House. \nDemocrats had control of the Senate and the House. We had to produce an \neconomic plan, a 5-year plan, and we did. We passed that plan without \nany votes from the other side of the aisle, not one.\n  In that plan, it is true, we raised taxes. I would not agree that it \nwas the largest tax increase ever. I believe the tax increases that \nwere passed in the early 1980's were larger in terms of relationship to \nthe size of our economy. But nonetheless, we did raise taxes, raised \nincome taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. We also cut \nspending--$250 billion of spending cuts--over 5 years.\n  That package worked. Some on the other side said that if we passed \nthat package it would crater the economy, that it would increase \nunemployment, that it would increase the deficit, that it would reduce \neconomic growth. Well, the record is now in. The record is clear. Our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle were simply wrong. That package \ndid not increase unemployment. Precisely the opposite occurred. We had \nthe creation of 12\\1/2\\ million new jobs in the last 5 years. Inflation \nis at a 31-year low. Unemployment is at a 24-year low. We have had \nremarkable economic growth. We have had business investment expanding \nat a rate of 10.5 percent a year. We have had the largest reduction in \npoverty in our history. This has been an economic plan that has worked \nremarkably well. So that is my perspective on how we get to where we \nare today.\n  I will just show this chart. It shows the 1997 budget agreement is \nonly possible because of the savings generated by the 1993 plan. \nInterestingly enough, if you look at the years from 1994 to 2002, the \n1993 plan generated over $2 trillion of deficit reduction--$2 trillion. \nThe plan we are talking about today will further reduce the deficit, \nbut it will produce less than $200 billion of net deficit reduction \nthrough 2002. So most of the heavy lifting was done by the 1993 plan.\n  I am extremely proud to have been part of that plan because it took \ncourage to pass that plan. It was controversial and it was difficult, \nbut it worked.\n  Mr. President, today we are talking about a tax plan that, as I \nindicated, has many important elements. One of the elements that I \nthink is very important in this debate is we are able to extend the \nchild credit to people who are paying payroll taxes that do not have \nfurther income tax obligation.\n  Some said it would be welfare to give a child tax credit to those who \ndo not have an additional income tax obligation but are paying payroll \ntaxes. I am very pleased that we were able to prevail in that debate \nbecause the reality is we have tens of millions of people in this \ncountry who are paying more in payroll taxes than they are paying in \nincome taxes. In fact, 73 percent of the people in this country pay \nmore in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. Those payroll \ntaxes are not just being used to finance Social Security and Medicare. \nThey are also being used to finance the ongoing operations of \nGovernment, because every year we are taking the Social Security \nsurpluses and spending them. We are spending the Social Security \nsurpluses to support the ongoing operations of Government.\n  I will display this chart because it shows what has happened with \npayroll taxes. They have increased dramatically. They now make up about \n35 percent of the revenue of this Government; and, again, 73 percent of \nthe people in this country are paying more in payroll taxes than they \nare paying in income taxes. So I think it is entirely appropriate that \nwe extended the child credit to offset payroll taxes for those folks \nwho earn less than $30,000 a year.\n  I might say, in my State, that is very nearly a majority of the \ntaxpayers.\n  The other provisions of this tax bill are also critically important. \nI am especially pleased with the education component because we have \nmade an enormous investment in American families being able to send \ntheir kids on to higher education. That is good news for American \nfamilies. The good news does not stop there. We have also expanded the \nincentives for people to save and invest. Again, I want to acknowledge \nthe role of Senator Roth in that regard.\n  In my State of North Dakota, we have tens of thousands of small \nbusinessmen and farmers who have looked at the estate tax provisions of \ncurrent law and said, Senator, these have not been adjusted for \ndecades. We are still stuck at $600,000, and it is time for an \nadjustment. I am especially pleased that in this legislation small \nbusinessmen and farmers next year are going to see that basic estate \ntax provision raised to $1.3 million. That is going to make a real \ndifference in the ability of small business people in my State and the \nState of the occupant of the Chair to pass on their businesses or their \nfarms to family members.\n  I think that is what we want to do in this country. We do not want to \nbreak up a small family business or a small family farm. Someone may be \nlistening and thinking, is a small family farm, 1.3 million? Given \nwhat's happened to land values in parts of our State and other parts of \nthe country, as urban pressures have grown, absolutely that can be a \nsmall family farm. You can have a land value of $1.3 million and have \npeople who are cash poor. I have friends who are in farming. If you \nwent to their homes, you would find them living very modestly, very \nmodestly, indeed--driving old cars, living in homes that have not had \nmuch done to them in maybe 20 years. Yet they have a land value of $1.5 \nmillion. But they have very little in the way of cash income. Yet the \ncurrent estate tax works to break up those family operations. That is \nnot what we want to be doing. These estate tax changes are going to be \nvery positive.\n  Mr. President, I want to end as I began by saying this has been a \nbipartisan effort, it has been a constructive effort, and it has \nbrought us to this result. It is a good result. I also want to say that \nwe have more work to be done. When we talk about balancing the unified \nbudget, what that means is that we are taking Social Security surpluses \nand counting those in order to achieve balance. It is not my idea of a \nreal balanced budget. I will really celebrate the day that we are no \nlonger counting Social Security trust fund surpluses in order to say \nthat we have balanced the budget.\n  Let me just show this last chart, because this shows what has \nhappened to the so-called unified deficit. It is the blue line. It \nshows back in 1992 we had a deficit of $290 billion. It has gone down \nevery single year since the 5-year plan that we put in place in 1993.\n  This year the projection is $67 billion. I think when the new figures \ncome out in the next couple of weeks they will show that the deficit \nthis year, instead of being $67 billion, as is the current projection, \nwill be down even substantially from that, perhaps as low as $45 \nbillion. Some are even now saying the deficit this year will be as \nlittle as $30 billion.\n  We have had a cumulative deficit of only $11 billion in the first 9 \nmonths of this year. That is a remarkable success, from a deficit of \n$290 billion in 1992 to a deficit this year that may be as little as \n$45 billion. Then, under this plan we bump up next year. We don't know \nwhat the new projections will show. Then we are on a steady, declining \npath to unified balance in 2002.\n  But the red line shows something else. It shows that while the \ndeficit is in fact declining each and every year, we will still be left \nwith a $109 billion deficit in 2002, when one includes the Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses. So I think it is fair to say that this \nplan does balance the unified budget, it\n\n[[Page S8429]]\n\ndoes provide tax relief, it does do other things that are very helpful \nto the American people. But I think it is also important to remind \nourselves we still have progress that needs to be made. Because in 2002 \nwe will still have a real deficit, when we consider those Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses that are being thrown in the pot to claim \nbalance.\n  Even with that said, the fact is this package does represent progress \nat further reducing the deficit. It does represent tax relief. It does \nrepresent the other things that I referenced earlier, like expansion of \neducational opportunity for our families. It also provides, in the \nearlier legislation passed, a dramatic expansion of health care \ncoverage for kids in this country who need it.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I again thank my colleagues who have \nworked on a bipartisan basis to achieve this result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, before yielding time to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio, I would like to thank my good friend and colleague \nfrom North Dakota for his knowledge, his background, and contributions \nto this effort. No one has, I think, greater expertise in such matters \nas these than this distinguished Senator. I just wanted it to be \npublicly known that I appreciate his contribution and look forward to \ncontinuing in a bipartisan spirit.\n  I am now pleased to yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Roth, for the fantastic job that he has done. I congratulate \nalso our majority leader, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, as well as the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, John \nKasich, and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill \nArcher--all of the people who have been involved in this really \nhistoric piece of legislation. I rise today in strong support of this \nconference report, the Taxpayer Relief Act. This historic budget \nagreement is an important step forward for fiscal responsibility, \nfiscal responsibility that will balance the budget for the first time \nin 30 years. And it will provide much-needed tax relief for working \nfamilies.\n  When we implement this budget agreement, the result will be the first \nbalanced budget since 1969. That is great news for the U.S. economy as \nwell as for the working families who will see a decline in the interest \npayments they have to carry. This bill will give working families some \nlong-needed, much-needed, much-deserved tax relief--$90 billion of tax \nrelief over the next 5 years. Today, the working families of Ohio and \nthe rest of America are paying record-high taxes. All across America, \ntotal taxes eat up 38 percent of the typical family's budget--38 \npercent. That is more than the typical family spends on food, clothing \nand shelter combined. On these family necessities they only spend 28 \npercent of their income.\n  The people who are particularly helped by this are the lower middle \nclass, the middle class, the working American. A family of four, two \nchildren, two adults, with an income of $30,000, will see tax savings \nof 53 percent--53 percent. A family with a $40,000 income, that same \nfamily, would receive a 30 percent tax savings. That same family, at \n$50,000, would still receive a 21-percent tax savings. That is real \nmoney. That is very, very significant.\n  The education tax incentives will also help the next generation. It \nwill help Ohio families, it will help American families. We all know \neducation is getting more and more important as we move to a skill-\nbased economy. We also know it is very expensive. This tax relief bill \nwill help Ohio's families save and pay for their children's education. \nIt will expand the IRA's available for education and create tax-free \nprepaid tuition plans. It makes interest on student loans deductible \nfrom Federal taxes. It also encourages employers to invest in the \neducation of their workers by giving them a tax deduction for employee \ntraining and employee education.\n  This historic tax bill will help families make ends meet over the \nshort term, and will help them educate their children over the long \nterm. In my view, this is a modest bill, but it is a very important \nbill. It is a historic bill. It is important because it helps America \nas a nation reverse course. Mr. President, 50 years ago Americans paid \n2 cents out of every dollar they earned to the Federal Government. \nToday they are sending 25 cents to Washington alone, and that is not \ncounting all the other State and local taxes. That's going in the wrong \ndirection. What we do with this bill is change course and begin to go \nin the right direction. The $500 per child tax credit, in particular, \nwill help ease the burden of working families who need to hold down two \nor more jobs to make ends meet.\n  The tax relief in the agreement will also do a great deal for small \nbusiness men and women. The capital gains cuts and the lowering of the \nestate tax will help promote economic growth and help preserve family \nowned and operated businesses. All of these policy changes in my view \nare extremely positive. They represent substantial progress over where \nwe are today.\n  I hope that we soon will address the long-term problem, though, of \nrunaway entitlement spending. We begin to make progress with this bill. \nClearly we have to go further. To balance the budget by the year 2002, \nas the budget agreement would in fact do, is very, very important. In \nfact, it's a prerequisite for any other progress we intend to make in \neconomic policy. However, while it is essential, it is only a first \nstep. We need to view what we are doing today, really, as just that, a \nfirst step. Our next necessary step is to prepare the Federal budget \nfor the fiscal tidal wave that will occur when the baby boomers start \nto retire and become eligible for Social Security and for Medicare. In \nmy view, we have to start reforming the entitlements in a responsible \nand bipartisan way. Congress has been talking about this for years. It \nis essential that we make it happen and we make it happen as soon as \npossible.\n  But, for today, this bill and its companion measure are an excellent \nstep forward, a first step. I am proud to vote yes on both of these \nhistoric conference reports.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume of the time allocated to our side.\n  I come to the floor today to say I intend to vote for this conference \nreport and am pleased with the work that has been done in the Congress, \nand especially the work that has been done by so many people who \ninvested so many hours to try to do the right thing.\n  The Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth, who heads the Senate Finance \nCommittee, has disproved the old adage about what a committee is, which \nis: A group of the unwilling chosen from the unfit to do the \nunnecessary. This committee, under this chairman's leadership, and the \nmen and women from the Republican and Democratic caucus who were \nassigned to that committee, I think have done some very substantial \nwork that will engender a substantial vote in the U.S. Senate, a \nbipartisan vote. I am glad to stand on the floor in this circumstance \nand say, finally, we have reached a point where both parties have come \ntogether to say that we fashioned something that we think will work for \nthis country.\n  We have a very different view of how we got here. I heard some \nremarks earlier. Some of that is probably typical and traditional \nrhetorical comments from both sides about where we have been and where \nwe are going. I can remember 4 years ago on the floor of this Chamber \nwhen the deficit was going up, up, up and out of control, following a \ndecade in which the description by the new economic guru to previous \nadministrations was, ``Well, let's double defense, cut taxes and things \nwill be just peachy.'' Defense spending doubled, taxes were cut, and we \nnearly choked on deficits in this country.\n  We came to an intersection in 1993, 4 years ago, with a new President \nand a Congress, and this President said, ``Let's take a hunk out of \nthat deficit and tackle that Federal deficit,'' and we voted for it and \ndid it by one vote--one vote.\n  I can recall the cries of alarm on the floor of the Senate:\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\n  ``You're going to throw this country into a recession.''\n  ``You're going to ruin this country's economy.''\n  No, we didn't do that. We were willing to stand up and vote for harsh \nmedicine to say this fiscal policy has been out of control, we need to \nget it back into control and play no more games. We cut some spending, \nwe increased some taxes, yes, and we cut this deficit down, down, down \nand down, and guess what happened as a result of it? Unemployment \nplummeted. More people are working, inflation is down, the deficit is \ndown, the economy is growing, and it is a better place because of it, \nand only because we are standing on the shoulders of those in 1993 who \ncast that vote, some of whom are not here, because we took a clobbering \nfor that medicine in 1993. Only because of that tough decision are we \nnow able to do the rest of the work and say to the American people, \nthis country is moving ahead, moving in the right direction, and \neconomic growth is sufficient so that now we can provide some tax cuts, \nas well as some spending cuts, and not only tackle the rest of the \nbudget deficit problem, but also provide some much-needed relief to \noverburdened American families.\n  Carl Sandburg said once:\n\n       I see America not in the setting Sun of a black night of \n     despair ahead of us, I see America in the crimson light of a \n     rising Sun, fresh from the burning creative hand of God. I \n     see great days ahead, great days possible to men and women of \n     will and vision.\n\n  My attitude about where we are in this country is we are headed in \nthe right direction. As I said, unemployment is down, jobs are up, \ncrime is down, the country is growing. Is everything perfect? No, not \nat all. We have a lot of changes ahead of us. Is everything in this \nbill perfect? No. If I had written it, I would have made some changes. \nBut have we come together at this juncture, together with a Democratic \nand Republican Party, a Democratic President, a Republican Congress, \nmen and women of both parties to do something that is good? Yes, I \nthink so.\n  In this legislation, today we say to the American people we think \neducation is critically important and we are going to not only invest \nin education in the bill we passed yesterday, we are going to provide \nsignificant new tax cuts to relieve the tax burden on families who are \nsending their kids to college. The effort that is made in this piece of \nlegislation to value education is critically important because this \ncountry's future is in educating its kids.\n  Yesterday, we talked about expanding Head Start to a million new \nAmerican children. That is a significant achievement.\n  Today, we say that families--45 million children in this country--\nwill receive ultimately a $500-per-child tax credit, which I think will \nbe a significant benefit to American families.\n  In addition to the significant achievements in education and the \nsignificant achievements in investing in jobs and other things, \ninducing savings and the things that, I think, have great merit for the \nfuture of this country, this legislation provides some specific things \nI want to mention just very briefly.\n  One, there has been a lot of controversy about estate tax reform. \nPeople say if you provide estate tax reform, that affects a small slice \nof people with an enormous amount of income. I come from a part of the \ncountry that is sparsely populated and losing population. My home \ncounty has 3,000 people living in an area the size of the State of \nRhode Island. It used to be 5,000, but people are moving and leaving \nmany rural areas. I want to do everything I can to encourage every \nfamily business and every family farm to be passed from parents to \nchildren, to keep operating and keep open and stay there in rural \nAmerica, and this estate tax provision is going to be enormously \nhelpful in doing that.\n  I might say that one other piece of good news in this legislation is \nparochial, but important, to people of South Dakota and North Dakota, \nMinnesota, and other disaster victims around the country. There is in \nthis legislation several provisions that I had asked be put in that are \ngoing to be helpful to disaster victims. There are a number of \nprovisions that say, because of disasters you are unable to file your \ntax return, and the IRS extends the time in which you are able to file \na return--the IRS said, ``We'll do that, but we still must charge \ninterest''--this waives the interest for taxpayers who were not able to \nfile a tax return because their house and all their records are down \nthe river someplace in a massive flood. That is a tiny little issue, \nbut important, and I am very pleased that it was put in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  The folks who were victims of blizzard after blizzard after blizzard \nin the Dakotas, Montana, in our part of the country, who had to sell \ncattle because they had no feed and now are going to restore their \nherd, this piece of legislation says you are not going to have to pay \ncapital gains tax on the herd that you sold.\n  This piece of legislation has a very important benefit to livestock \nproducers who were victims of the disaster in our part of the country. \nIt overturns an IRS ruling, a tiny little thing, but it is going to \naffect tens of thousands of farmers. The IRS took a position a while \nback on what are called deferred contract sales that farmers have made \nroutinely for years and years at the country elevator, that they were \ngoing to be taxable under certain circumstances. We have no idea where \nthe IRS came up with that interpretation. It is completely wrong. They \nhad no basis for doing that.\n  This legislation says to the IRS that you can't do that. Senator \nGrassley and I, and nearly 60 of our colleagues in the Senate, joined \nand said to the IRS, ``Look, everybody in America has a right to be \nwrong, it is a democracy, but when the IRS is wrong, America pays. In \nthis case, you're wrong, and we're going to change the law so you can't \nmisinterpret what we write.''\n  Those are the kind of things in this piece of legislation that have \ngreat merit. Those are some of the smaller things I wanted to mention.\n  Finally, in closing, because I know other colleagues have things they \nwant to talk about, I think this piece of legislation represents an \nawfully good instinct of the political system to get together and see \nif we can't do things together that represents a consensus that will be \ngood for the future of this country.\n  We so often fight among the political parties to prevent the other \nside from winning that, instead of getting the best of what each has to \noffer, we get the worst of what both can offer. That makes no sense for \nthis country. This piece of legislation is a credit, yes, to this \nPresident and the White House who worked so hard for it and proposed so \nmuch of this; it is a credit to Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan and so \nmany others on the House and Senate side from both political parties \nwho I think have done a commendable job. Would I have written it \ndifferently? Yes. Am I concerned about the outyears a bit? Yes. We need \nto put up fences to make sure we don't go back into a deficit \nsituation.\n  We haven't finished dealing with the deficit. As my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad, pointed out, this is a unified deficit. \nWe still have a Social Security problem we must deal with. I probably \nwould have preferred to take even more benefits in this piece of \nlegislation and provided it to working families, but I didn't write \nevery piece of it, and this is a compromise. I also would have \npreferred to have some limit on the issue of capital gains. I support \nthe capital gains tax treatment that exists, but I would have had some \nlimit on it.\n  Having said all that, I am pleased to come to the floor today to say \nI can vote for a piece of legislation that I think advances this \ncountry's interest, and it rests on a bed of good news that comes from \nour colleagues who, in 1993, stood up and said, ``Count me in, let me \nvote for the first giant step in tackling this Federal deficit.'' And \nthis next step, a bipartisan step which is good for this country, is \none which I hope will give the American people a good feeling about \ntheir future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my support for this legislation. I \nwant to\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\ncommend Chairman Roth and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, and \nSenators Lott and Daschle for their leadership. A great deal of good \nhas come from the bipartisan cooperation put together to produce this \nlegislation. I certainly will vote for it.\n  Much has been said by some about the historic nature of this \nlegislation. Perhaps that is true. But I have to say, in following the \ncomments of my colleague from North Dakota about the historic context \nof how we arrived at this point, that some observation needs to be made \nthat the truly historic legislation that was passed was the 1993 Budget \nAct.\n  President Clinton inherited a hemorrhaging pool of $290 billion of \nred ink that was projected to grow annually when he came to the White \nHouse. His first step was to work with Congress to pass a 5-year budget \nplan that passed without a single Republican vote. At that time, I \nserved in the other body. I remember the immense political pressure \nthat was brought to bear at that time. I remember the 30-second \ntelevision spots that followed, accusing every Democratic Member of \nhaving cast the deciding vote on something that would be catastrophic.\n  What happened? The $290 billion of red ink has now plummeted this \nyear to an estimated $67 billion, perhaps as low as $30 billion. We now \nhave the smallest Federal budget deficit relative to the size of our \neconomy of any Western industrialized nation on Earth. We have a \nvibrant economy, high employment, low unemployment, low inflation, and \nwe find ourselves now in the midst of a remarkable era.\n  This legislation is important legislation, but it will finish what we \nbegan in 1993 when we had a $290 billion deficit and brought it down to \nas low as $30 billion. This will get us from $30 billion to the finish \nline by the year 2002, a good thing to do, a positive thing to do. But \nthe historic step, the politically courageous step, was taken 4 years \nago.\n\n  Is this legislation perfect? No. No, it isn't. That is the nature of \nany legislation, particularly, I suppose, of a piece of legislation \nthat is a product of compromise between very different approaches. I \nthink some of the high-fiving that has gone on around town may be a bit \nunwarranted. I would say, however, that this bill has been made much \nbetter during the course of the debate. The initial legislation, the \nreconciliation legislation that we dealt with in both the House and the \nSenate, provided very little tax relief, essentially no tax relief, for \nfamilies making less than $30,000 per year. There was certainly no \nchild tax credit for these families.\n  Now, as I see it, this problem has been corrected, thanks to the \nleadership, particularly of the President of the United States, but \nalso of Senator Moynihan and Senator Daschle, and others who worked \nvery hard on this. Take a family, for example, with an income of \n$23,000 per year, perhaps a teacher, a firefighter, a policeman, a \nfarmer, a store clerk, any number of people across our country who get \nup every morning--they play by the rules, they try to raise their kids \nwith decent values, they try to keep jeans and tennis shoes on their \nkids, they are doing the right thing, they are not on welfare, they are \nworking hard, oftentimes with two jobs.\n  But wages, particularly in my State of South Dakota, are not always \nwhat we would like them to be. Farm prices are sometimes low. And these \npeople, who are working their hearts out, oftentimes are living on very \nmodest wages. And that family, with a father, in this case, who is \nearning $23,000 a year, and mom who is staying home with two kids, \nunder the original bill and under the original Republican plan, would \nhave gotten zero in child tax credit. Under the Clinton plan, they \nwould have gotten $767.\n  Well, the dust has now settled, and under the conference committee \nbill that we are voting on today, that family will get a $675 tax \ncredit, a very useful sum for those families. People can make a car \npayment, a house payment, they can get their kids started with clothes \nfor school, they can do some positive things. And I think we need to \nreward work, particularly at a time when we are reforming welfare and \nessentially ending the guarantee of federal support of families. We \nneed to focus on what more can we do, then, to make work pay. Certainly \nthis improved child tax credit, along with augmenting the funds in this \nlegislation relative to health insurance for kids, is a positive step \nforward.\n  It is true that this bill still has some unevenness to it. I have \nnoticed that a group called Citizens for Tax Justice has an analysis \nout that indicates that the wealthiest 1 percent of American families \nwill benefit by about a $16,000 tax cut because of this legislation. \nThe average middle-class family will benefit by something less than \n$200. That isn't the kind of division that I would have made if it were \nup to me exclusively.\n  But nonetheless, I do see the need to balance the budget by 2002, \nprovide some key relief, not only with the child tax credit, but \ncertainly, in the case of education assistance, to provide a $1,500 tax \ncredit for tuition, tax-deductibility of interest on student loans, and \nto expand Pell grants, not only the numbers who are eligible but also \nthe size of the grants. That is investing in kids, and investing in the \nbrain power of this country. That is really where we must make a \ncommitment if we are going to compete in a global economy, not just now \nbut for generations into the future.\n  I see positive things relative to agriculture. My colleague, Senator \nDorgan of North Dakota, has gone into much of that. Capital gains \nrelief for small businesses and family farmers will be helpful. There \nis also estate tax relief. Certainly, there are some targeted kinds of \naid for those who have had to liquidate their herds. There is \nrestoration of income averaging. There are a number of provisions that \nwill be of great help. That I have to applaud.\n  I am concerned about the backloading of some of the tax reductions \nwhich has the potential consequence of making balancing the budget \npost-2007 more difficult. It would be disastrous for us to have gone \nthrough all of this and then find ourselves the year after balancing \nthe budget, or only shortly thereafter, going back into red ink again \nbecause of backloaded or phased-in tax cuts that had negative \nconsequences in the outyears.\n  That is something we are going to have to be very conscious of in the \nfuture. This is not a matter of turning the Federal budget over to \nautomatic pilot and now we are home free. It is going to involve \ndifficult, contentious, but hopefully bipartisan, annual debates about \nhow to maintain equilibrium between our revenue and our expenditures \nwhile still using our budget for the correct priorities.\n  I think one of the key political issues in America over these last \nseveral years has been, how do we balance the budget? There is \nbipartisan agreement we need to do that. But how, at the same time, do \nwe protect Medicare, do we continue to invest in education and protect \nthe environment? How do we do it in a way that reflects the best of our \nvalues and our priorities in this country? Can that be done?\n  Some of us remember only a couple years ago when there was a proposal \nthat would have arguably balanced the budget, but it would have \ndecimated Medicare, it would have taken investment away from education, \nit would have been destructive to the environment, and certainly to \nrural Americans. Thankfully President Clinton vetoed that legislation. \nHe said we can do better, we can do better with our priorities and \nstill get to a zero deficit.\n  Thankfully, this legislation, for all of its warts and all of its \nshortcomings, does in fact get us that remaining $30 billion to $60 \nbillion that we need to balance the budget, and it expands the number \nof kids who have access to health insurance. It will be helpful to \nsmall businesses and farms. This bill will increase the tax-\ndeductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed to 100 \npercent, something long overdue. And it will, I think, help continue \nthe economic growth that we have seen over these last 5 years where we \nhave had 5 consecutive years now of deficit reduction and economic \ngrowth.\n  And so, Mr. President, I think that this is a positive piece of \nlegislation. It is the product of bipartisan agreement. Thankfully, the \nPresident has used his leverage to make sure that we do in fact live up \nto these priorities and to bring some common sense back into this bill. \nThe truly historic legislation was that of 1993, but this is important \nlegislation. I support it.\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\n  I voted earlier for the budget portion of reconciliation. I will vote \nfor this tax portion of reconciliation. I am proud of what our \ncolleagues on both the Republican and Democratic sides have been able \nto do to pull together, to set aside some of the anger and some of the \nhostility that too often has characterized political debate in this \ncountry, and to spend a little less time being Republicans and \nDemocrats and a little more time being Americans.\n  I think that is what the American people really want. And they want \nto see an end result that reflects the best of our cooperative efforts. \nThis legislation does, I think, take us down that road.\n  So, Mr. President, while there are things I would have done \ndifferently, and while we do need to understand the historic context of \nhow we arrived here, this is good legislation, and I yield the floor \nexpressing my support for this bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, under our order, we are now going back and \nforth. Senator Hutchison was next, and she was here just a minute ago. \nAnd I believe she is coming on the floor now. So I ask Senator \nHutchison, are you ready to go?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be happy to yield to my colleague from \nMinnesota who I think was here first, and then if I could follow after \nthe next Democrat.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It would then go back over to this side-- Senator Baucus \nhas been waiting--and then back to you.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That would be fine.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. I want to thank my colleague from \nTexas for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to discuss in detail my \nstrong support for the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. I do not intend to \nrepeat the arguments I made then, but I do have just a couple of other \npoints I think need to be made.\n  When my good friends, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas and Senator Dan \nCoats of Indiana, and I first proposed the $500-per-child tax credit \nback in 1993, we were not doing it to grab headlines and it was not a \npiece of cheap political theater. We pursued the $500-per-child tax \ncredit because we believed that working families are horribly \novertaxed. And how did we know that? Because the American people told \nus so.\n  Americans are by nature a very giving and generous people. For a long \ntime, they did not complain--at least too loudly--that their tax burden \nseemed to be rising every year even though they were not seeing any \nimprovements in Government services. If anything, their tax dollars \nseemed to be buying less and less. But when taxes reached the point \nwhere working Americans were spending more of their hard-earned money \nfeeding the Government than they were spending to feed, clothe, and \nshelter their families, well then, the taxpayers started feeling as \nthough their generosity was being taken advantage of. They began \ndemanding that the Government stop spending their dollars so \nrecklessly. They began asking for tax relief, so they could start \nmeeting the needs of their own families, instead of feeding \nWashington's mixed-up priorities.\n  So what do working families want from their Government? Well, let me \nfirst tell you what they do not want.\n  America's working families do not want handouts.\n  They do not want more government agencies or programs.\n  They do not want their tax dollars feeding bigger Government.\n  They do not want the Government to intrude unjustly into their daily \nlives.\n  They just want to go to work to make a good living, have a decent \nplace to call home, and to have the opportunity to provide for their \nchildren. And they want to keep a little bit more of their own money at \nthe end of the day. That is what this package of tax relief will \ndeliver. For my home State of Minnesota, the $500-per-child tax credit \nat the heart of our legislation adds up to at least $300 million that \nwill stay in the hands of families every year. More than 700,000 \nmiddle-class children will benefit. That is what families have told me \nthey want, and that is what we are on the verge of delivering.\n  It should not be an occasion to celebrate when politicians actually \nkeep their promises. That is how the process ought to work. But we all \nknow that Washington has gotten pretty good at making promises, but too \noften fails miserably when it comes time to keep some of those \npromises. But, today, Congress is delivering on what I consider to be \nan irrevocable promise we made to the taxpayers 2\\1/2\\ years ago. Send \nus to Washington, we said, and we will cut your taxes. That is not a \npolitical slogan--that was a promise.\n  Now, let us not kid ourselves--our package of tax relief is not going \nto make anybody rich. As tax cuts go, it is pretty paltry. The net tax \nrelief amounts to less than 1 percent of all the tax revenue collected \nby the Federal Government over the next 5 years. It begins to roll back \nthe President's 1993 tax increase, but we would have to pass a bill \nthree times bigger than the one before us today to wipe out the 1993 \nincrease completely. It is an important start, however, in moving the \nGovernment in a new direction.\n  Relying on a radical philosophy of faster, better, cheaper, NASA \nlaunched the Pathfinder probe and successfully--and dramatically--\nopened a new era of exploration on Mars. The return on that investment \nhas gone far beyond anything that can be totaled up on a balance sheet. \nI would like to see the same philosophy of faster, better, cheaper \napplied to the rest of Washington as well, for a payback I believe can \nbe equally as impressive. A faster government has fewer layers of \nbureaucracy, so that it can more quickly meet the needs of the people. \nA better government is responsive to its citizens and responsible to \nits taxpayers. A cheaper government needs fewer dollars to carry out \nits work, opening the door to future tax cuts that leave even more \nmoney in the hands of the taxpayers.\n  Faster, better, cheaper is an idea that worked on Mars. It is an idea \nthat ought to work just as well here on Earth.\n  To paraphrase a favorite quote of mine, Mr. President, politics are \ntemporary--but the American family is permanent. Enactment of the $500-\nper-child tax credit is a great victory for families, one I believe \nwill help bring them together, and hopefully keep them together. I am \nproud that I can go back home this weekend and tell the working \nfamilies of my State--who for years have watched their taxes rise and \ntheir take-home pay shrink--that Washington finally got the message. We \nare at last going to cut their taxes, not because it is the politically \neasy thing to do, but because it is the right thing to do.\n  Again, I want to thank and commend the majority leader and my \ncolleagues, the chairmen of the Finance and Budget committees, for \nhaving the determination to bring the Taxpayer Relief Act to the floor. \nThis is a great day in the history of the Senate, and it is also a day \nthat I am proud to be a part of.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as my side is \nallowed to consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think that the American people \nessentially want us to do the right thing. They care less whether it is \nthe Democratic policy or the Republican policy. They care less whether \nit is conservative or liberal. Essentially, they say, ``You folks back \nthere in Washington, come together, do what's basically right, what's \nwithin the realm of reasonableness. Just get your job done. If you do \nthat, you're doing a pretty good job.''\n  Mr. President, I think that is what happened here. We Democrats like \nto claim lots of credit for this legislation. A lot of us talk about \nthe 1993 Deficit Reduction Act, which I do think is the cornerstone \nwhich led to declining deficits and allowed the American economy to \nbegin to prosper, interest rates dropped, with inflation rates lower, \nunemployment rates lower, et cetera. Republicans like to claim that, \noh, no, they are the ones that basically did all this. After all, they \nare the majority party in the Congress right now.\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\n  But the truth of the matter is that it is the combination of both \nsides working together to reach this agreement. And even more truthful, \nwe have a big assist, and that is the national economy. The economy is \ndoing very well. We all know that. And that enables President Clinton \nto negotiate with the Republican majority in the Congress, and with all \nCongress for that matter, an agreement which makes most people pretty \nhappy. That is, it cuts taxes. When the economy is doing very, very \nwell, the U.S. Government is bringing in more revenue than it usually \ndoes, and it is easier to cut taxes. That is what we have done here. We \nall like to have our taxes cut.\n\n  Second, there are additional spending programs in here. One big one \nis education, which is very needed in America. We must invest more in \neducation. All of us know that. If we are going to compete with \ncountries around the world and we are going to increase the quality of \nliving for all of our people, it is critical that our young people get \na better start and a better education. We spend quite a bit of money in \nthis bill on education, whether it is direct spending or tax credits.\n  So the economy has helped us very much. I wonder where we would be \ntoday, Mr. President, if the economy were not doing well today. Would \nwe be balancing the budget as quickly? Would we be working as well \ntogether? Would there be as much peace and harmony on both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue? I see the occupant of the Chair shaking his head \nin the negative, and I agree; we would not be doing as well. The \neconomy gave us a big boost. We are here, in some respects, because of \nthat.\n  I, like most Members of this body, support this conference report. It \ndoes do basic things which are important. No. 1, it moves us toward a \nbalanced budget. We are going to have a balanced budget at least by the \nyear 2002. My guess, Mr. President, is that we will probably reach a \nbalanced budget before the year 2002. In fact, the projected budget \ndeficit for this year is to be as low as $50 billion. So we will \nbalance the budget. We will be living within our means. That is no \nsmall matter.\n  We also have tax cuts which help small businesses and help families \naround our country and help the country generally. That is good. This \nbill also keeps hospitals and clinics open in rural America. I mention \nrural America because my State tends to be rural, and we have been \nworking for many years to be sure that we have quality health care in \nour part of the country, as well as in the cities.\n  This will also help make sure America's children have health \ninsurance. Not too long ago, we passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, \nwhich would disallow preexisting medical conditions as a condition for \ndenying insurance to insureds. That helped to buy more health insurance \nfor programs. We also allow for something called portability; that is, \nif a person has health insurance, he can carry it to his next job. We \nAmericans don't have the world's best health insurance program. Other \ncountries insure their people a little bit better than we do. But the \none area this bill addresses is health insurance for kids, which is \nvery important and critical. All of us here are very happy for that.\n  The bill has some drawbacks and I will address a couple of them later \non. By and large, the benefits far outweigh those drawbacks. Let's \nstart with the good news.\n  As work on this agreement began earlier this year, I set a few basic \npriorities for myself by which to judge the final result of this bill. \nOne was that this bill must balance the budget, it must help small \nbusinesses, and it must promote education--those were all priorities of \nmine--and, finally, it must be fair; that is, the distribution effect \nof this bill must be fair to all Americans. On the whole, I think this \nagreement reaches those criteria.\n  First, we will see a balanced budget by the year 2002. It might even \nbe earlier. But to be realistic, this bill deserves only a bit of the \ncredit. I believe that the 1993 budget bill made the real tough \nchoices, and that was the bill that began us on a glide slope toward a \nbalanced budget. It was a tough bill. We took some tough medicine back \nin 1993. But that laid the foundation for where we are today. It \nbrought us from a deficit of $290 billion in 1992 to a deficit of \nperhaps just $35 billion this year. So we started this effort with most \nof the work already done. This is just a small finishing-up effort on \nthat 1993 bill. I must say, a booming economy is helping us as well.\n  Second, this bill goes in the right direction on taxes. That is, it \nlowers taxes. Overall, it will cut taxes by $90 billion over 5 years. \nThat is not a revolutionary change, but it is significant, and it is \ngoing to help make a difference to some people. Particularly, the $30 \nbillion in education tax credits is going to help families send their \nchildren to college. That is going to help.\n  By cutting the estate and gift tax, we will help farm families, small \nbusiness owners, and ranchers all across our country keep their land \nand their businesses and their operations in the family. That is very, \nvery important to the people in the State of Montana. We have a lot of \nfarmers and ranchers who have virtually no return on their investment, \nvirtually no cash flow, but their land values are accelerating because \nsome people are moving to Montana--wealthier people--which are pushing \nup land values.\n  Relief in Federal estate and gift tax is critical. We phase in 100 \npercent health insurance for the self-employed, and that means a lot to \nsmall business people, self-employed people who can't take nearly the \nsame deduction in taxes and health insurance they pay compared to \npeople who work for big companies. Generally, in America, the more you \nwork for a large corporation, the better your health insurance policy, \nbecause your employer takes the full deduction for the health insurance \npolicy. If you are self-employed, you don't get that; you have to pay \nfor it all yourself. We began a couple of years ago to phase in a \ndeduction for the self-employed. This legislation will bring that to a \nfull 100 percent, albeit over the next 7 years.\n  A capital gains tax reduction is very important. That should help \nsavings and investment in our country.\n  With respect to health care, this agreement also means significant \naccomplishments, essentially by providing $24 billion for health \ninsurance and services for working children. This is $8 billion more \nthan the original plan, and it is paid for with a cigarette tax that \nwill create its own health benefits by reducing smoking.\n  We also set up a new limited-service hospital program, modeled on the \nMontana Medical Assistance Facility, or MAF's, which allows hospitals \nto keep their doors open in small towns. The MAF is a proven success in \nmany communities like, in my State, Circle, Culbertson, Big Timber, and \nEkalaka, and this agreement will make those MAF's permanent. This will \nalso slow a two-decade-long trend that has closed nearly 10 percent of \nall rural hospitals.\n  We also allow rural family practice residency programs that are just \ngetting started to expand. That is very important. Montana's two \nresidency programs, one in Billings and other in Glasgow, are critical \nto attracting doctors to our State's rural communities. It makes sure \nthat rural areas get fairer managed care payments from Medicare \ncompared to the big urban areas.\n  And not least, we objected to proposals in the last Congress to make \nlarge cuts in Medicare and abolish Medicaid's guarantee of health \ninsurance for poor people.\n  But the agreement is not perfect. I would like to note four areas \nwhere I think it falls short.\n  First, it contains many special interest tax provisions. This means a \nmuch more complicated Tax Code and more tax advantage to wealthy people \nand big companies who can hire large numbers of lawyers and \naccountants. This tax bill makes our Tax Code much more complicated, \nunfortunately. We should return to this issue in the future and work to \nsimplify the Tax Code and eliminate loopholes.\n  Second, it includes unreasonably tough cuts in Medicare and Medicaid \nreimbursements to health care providers. These reimbursements make up \nan average of 55 percent of Montana hospital revenue. And the smaller \nfacilities, with under 30 beds, already are collecting, on average, \nover 4 percent less in revenue than their costs. It is tough to squeeze \nthese facilities any further.\n  Third, it misses a chance to improve our national transportation \ninfrastructure. I, with Senator Warner, and 80\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\nother Senators, requested extra money for highway and transit \nconstruction. That money would have meant safer travel and a more \nproductive economy. But this agreement does not have that.\n  It does move the 4.3-cents-per-gallon motor fuel revenues from the \nTreasury to the highway trust fund. But for accounting reasons--that \nis, the lack of an offset--that is only phantom money. It will not mean \nany real change in the highway and transit budget, and I regret that. I \nalert my colleagues that when we take up the transportation bill after \nthe August recess, we are going to realize how much we regret that.\n  Finally, this bill ducks some of our long-term fiscal challenges. As \nwe look 15 or 20 years ahead, we know Americans will live longer. So \nthe bills we pay for health care and pensions for older men and women \nwill be much higher than they are today.\n  With the healthy economy and a good fiscal situation we have today, \nwe could have taken some steps now to ease the problems this situation \nwill cause the next generation. This agreement doesn't take those \nsteps. It is a missed opportunity. I wish we had taken this \nopportunity.\n  But on the whole, this is a reasonably good effort. It does balance \nthe budget. It helps small business and families. It makes sure \nAmerica's children have health insurance, more than today. Those are \nvery important things for our country, and we ought to get them done. \nSo I support the agreement, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I might say at this point, Mr. President, how much I appreciate the \nbipartisan efforts, particularly of the chairman of our committee, \nChairman Bill Roth, who worked very, very diligently to help make sure \nthat both sides of the political aisle worked well together. That \ndoesn't always happen in this body. There are some committees where \nthat doesn't happen much at all. But Chairman Roth, chairman of the \nFinance Committee, did work very hard to bring both sides together, and \nI think that is one reason we are here today finally with this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We yield such time as the Senator from Texas requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. Today is a historic day. We will \nvote and pass the first substantial tax cut in 16 years, giving much-\nneeded, long-overdue tax relief to working American families. We have \nbeen working for tax cuts for 3 years now, and we are making a \ndownpayment on that commitment.\n  I view the bill that we are debating today as the second half of an \nentire economic package. We passed the first half this morning. I was a \nsomewhat reluctant supporter because, while it does take steps toward a \nbalanced budget, we missed the opportunity for historic Medicare reform \nthat would have created real consumer choice and preserved the program \nfor the next generation. The Senate spoke on this issue. But the \nPresident's opposition to real Medicare reform prevailed in the final \nversion.\n\n  He also walked away from some very important decisions we made last \nyear on welfare reform. We have hampered the ability of States to \nimplement the welfare-to-work law. The President has already denied \nStates, including Texas, the ability to privatize and consolidate \nwelfare services. In Texas alone, such consolidation would yield annual \nsavings of some $200 million. The President's continued opposition to \ntrue welfare reform carried the day.\n  Mr. President, I did support the bill this morning because it is \nlinked to the tax cuts we are now discussing, and it does bring us \ncloser to a balanced budget. The tax bill is long overdue relief for \nhard-working American families. Republicans took the majority of \nCongress with a very clear mandate to make Government smaller, control \nspending, and let hard-working Americans keep more of the money they \nearn.\n  We are trying to live up to that promise. We passed a budget plan \nthat will lead to a balanced budget, and now we are succeeding in \nproviding substantial tax relief for all Americans.\n  Who will benefit from this plan? It is the mothers and fathers who \nwill get help raising their children with a $500 per child tax credit; \nhomemakers who want to build retirement systems through an IRA; young \ncouples who are trying to buy a first home, pay for college for their \nchildren, or retirement for themselves; small business owners and \nfarmers who have spent their lives building a business or farm and want \nto pass it to their children; investors who have provided the capital \nto start new businesses and create jobs.\n  A $500-per-child tax credit will mean over 3.5 million families will \nno longer pay taxes at all. Instead of writing a $500 check to the IRS, \nfamilies will get to keep the money they earn and spend it as they \ndecide to spend it. Americans really do not need the U.S. Government to \ntell them how to spend their money. I think they should be able to \nchoose for themselves. American families know best whether they need to \nspend money on their children, or save it for retirement, or enjoy a \nvacation. The Government shouldn't take that money and make their \nchoices for them. In fact, with this tax cut, roughly 28 million \nfamilies will pay fewer taxes. In my home State of Texas the child tax \ncredit alone will benefit almost 2 million American families.\n  With the passage of this bill, we will cut the capital gains rate to \n20 percent. This will encourage and reward investment and create new \nbusinesses and new jobs. A low capital gains rate is important to our \nfuture and our Nation's ability to save and invest. Our current Tax \nCode punishes people for saving and investing. This is wrong. We are \ntrying to change it.\n  Lowering the taxation of capital gains will do more than release \nhundreds of billions of dollars of tied-up capital. It will bring \nimmediate relief to investors, small businesses, workers, farmers, \nhomeowners, and the elderly. We need to encourage investment so that we \ncan generate the technology, the market, and the jobs of tomorrow.\n  Today, more than 41 percent of American families own stock. Fifty-six \npercent of capital gains are reported by families who earn under \n$50,000. Two-thirds of mutual fund shareholders today in America have \nhousehold incomes under $75,000. Fifty percent of those who claim \ncapital gains are senior citizens, many of whom need this money to \nimprove their quality of life.\n  In the livestock industry in Texas, over 60 percent of those polled \nrecently admitted to holding onto assets because they couldn't afford \nto give Uncle Sam 28 percent of a capital gains tax.\n  We cut death taxes so that years of hard work and success won't be \nwiped out in one generation. According to a recent survey, 51 percent \nof family-owned businesses would have significant difficulty surviving \nin the event of a principal owner's death, due to the death tax. The \ndeath tax brings little revenue into the Federal Government--only 1.1 \npercent in 1997 of all of the Federal revenue. But it does affect \nhundreds of thousands of small business owners, family farmers, and \nordinary Americans who work, save, and invest for a lifetime, just to \nturn more than half of their hard-earned dollars over to the Federal \nGovernment when they die.\n  Mr. President, this is walking away from the American dream. What we \nhave said for over 200 years to people all over the world is, if you \ncome to America and you work hard, you will be able to keep the fruits \nof your labors and give them to your children to give them a little \nbetter start in life than you probably had.\n  So walking away from that American dream is what we are trying to \nprevent today by having some relief in the death taxes that people have \nbeen paying.\n  What does this mean for homemakers? We build on the progress that we \nmade last year in giving for the first time the homemakers of our \ncountry the ability to save for their retirement security. This time we \nare adding to that by allowing the full deductibility of that $2,000 \nregardless of what the spouse earns or has in a pension.\n  How big are these few changes? Let me just give you an example.\n  Under the old law, a single-income, married couple saving $2,250 a \nyear--which was their maximum--would have, over 40 years, starting at \nthe age of 25, when they are 65 approximately\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\n$629,000 in their retirement nest egg. But today, because of the bill \nwe passed last year, and this bill combined, after 40 years of setting \naside the $4,000 that they will be able to earn tax free, this couple \nwill have $1.119 million in their nest egg, an increase in savings of \nalmost $500,000.\n  So, Mr. President, when you put this together with the death tax \nrelief we are giving, you can really see that we are making a \ndifference for ordinary Americans. Economic growth does result from \nlower tax breaks. History shows us that expanded opportunity and \nprosperity flourishes under such conditions.\n  These are the foundations for our democracy. As a result of the \npassage of this historic bill, Americans will be keeping more of the \nmoney they earn in their pockets.\n  Sometimes I hear debate on this floor when people are talking about \nthese tax dollars as if it is Federal dollars. Federal tax dollars \nbelong to the Americans who earn them. We want Americans to keep the \nmoney they earn rather than having to send it to Washington for someone \nhere to make a decision for their families.\n  We are going to create new jobs, new investments, lower interest \nrates, lower home mortgage payments, lower car payments, lower student \nloan payments, and higher income for working Americans.\n  Mr. President, it is not everything we hoped it would be. But it is a \nsignificant downpayment for the hard-working American families. That is \nsomething that I hope we can add to as we look toward the future going \ninto the 21st century. Hard-working Americans should be able to realize \nthe American dream of working hard, doing better for their family, and \nbeing able to give their children a start that maybe they didn't have.\n  That is what this bill will start the process of doing for American \nfamilies. I hope we can continue to work even harder for them in the \nfuture.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Rhode Island yield to \nthe Senator?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, under the previous agreement, I guess on \nthe Democratic side, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, my colleagues, it has been interesting to \nhear all of the various Members of the Senate come to this floor and \ntalk about the product that is before us. We have had a few people who \nhave expressed concerns to the extent that they cannot support the \nagreement that is now before the Senate. I think that is unfortunate.\n  I remember, when I first came to the House of Representatives, I read \na book that was written by Lawrence O'Brien, who had been in the \nservice of both President Kennedy and President Johnson as the head of \ncongressional relations. The title of that book was ``No Final \nVictories.'' The gist of the story that he was trying to convey was \nsimply that in this business of governing, in this business of \npolitics, there are never really any final victories. There are a whole \nseries of small steps that are taken, small accomplishments and small \nachievements that are reached. But there is really never any final \nvictory because the job is really and truly never done.\n  When I look at the package of spending cuts and the package of tax \nreductions that we have before the Senate this week, I am really \nreminded of that whole theme and thesis of Lawrence O'Brien in ``No \nFinal Victories.'' Because if you ask a question, Is this a perfect \npackage? the answer, obviously, is no. If you ask the question, Should \nwe have done more? the answer is obviously yes. If you ask the \nquestion, Are you disappointed and discouraged that things that you \nworked on are not in this package? I would say, absolutely. Discouraged \nand disappointed in some areas, yes. But defeated, no. Because I think \non balance these agreements that are now before the Senate are major \nachievements. They are major steps in the right direction. The work is \nnot yet finished. There is a great deal more that needs to be done. But \nwe have, I think, set this country on a course and moving in a \ndirection which is the correct one for all of us.\n  One of the things that I am so encouraged by is the fact that we were \nable to do it in a bipartisan fashion. The vote in the Senate of 80 to \n18 and the vote in the Senate of 72 to 27, I think, on spending cuts \nand tax reductions is in fact a major accomplishment. These problems \nare too difficult and too serious for one party to be able to do by \nthemselves. The only way we are ever going to be able to reach these \nagreements that put us on the path of really reforming the Government \nis to do it together. I think that where we worked best was when we \nworked with both sides trying to meet in the center and trying to \ncooperate in a fashion that could really bring true reform to this \ninstitution.\n  The disappointment that I see in the bill is that we missed, for one, \nan opportunity to really reform Medicare. I think that what we \nessentially did was to follow what I call the SOS premise --same old, \nsame old. We essentially looked at Medicare and said, ``Well, we have a \nlot of problems with it and we all know it is going to go bankrupt and \ninsolvent at the end of the year 2001. So let's appoint a commission to \ntry to recommend to Congress what we already know needs to be done.''\n  I stand here with a great degree of pride and am so pleased that our \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, is on the floor with us \ntoday because some of the things that we all know need to be done we \nalready did when we worked together in the Centrist Coalition in the \nlast Congress and recommended some real strong, difficult things that \nneeded to be done with regard to the Medicare Program--which was \noffered by our group, a bipartisan group equally divided in the last \nCongress, when we took on the tough recommendation of means testing for \nwealthier seniors to help contribute more to ensure that the program is \ngoing to be there for their children, for their grandchildren, and for \ntheir great grandchildren.\n  We needed to recognize that people live longer. So we took the \nposition of recommending a gradual increase, I might add over the next \n30 years, in the eligibility age for Medicare recipients merely \nreflecting the increase in life expectancy of all of our citizens, \nwhich is a very good thing to do. We also made tough recommendations, I \nthink, in trying to bring about more competition in the Medicare \nSystem. But basically those ideas and those concepts, which got 46 \nvotes on the U.S. Senate floor in the last Congress, were dumped in the \nconference, dumped not really on the merits but because we needed more \npolitical cover.\n\n  What is the political cover that we have decided upon? Well, it is \n``same old, same old,'' let us appoint a commission. I would love to \nserve on the commission, quite frankly. I would love to try to make the \nrecommendations that are needed for us to be able to take the action \nthat is necessary. Unfortunately, while the commission will prepare a \nreport by March 1999, Congress does not have to act on any of their \nrecommendations. We can just say: Thank you. It's been a wonderful \nopportunity to hear what you have to say, but we don't have to do \nanything about it.\n  I think my colleague from Nebraska said: Wait a minute; we already \nhad a commission. I served as a cochair of it. We have already made \nthese recommendations. Why do we need another commission? Why do we \nneed a commission at all? Why doesn't Congress act as a commission?\n  You know what. Maybe the answer is that we can designate ourselves a \ncommission, and instead of calling ourselves the U.S. Senate, we will \ncall ourselves the U.S. Commission and then we can make the same \nrecommendations that we have already made and act on it and say, well, \nthe commission made the recommendation to get the job done that way.\n  But I think we have missed an opportunity, and that is unfortunate. \nIf we can't do it this year, it is going to be difficult to do it in an \nelection year. I am always amazed that everybody tells us to fix it. \nHow many times have we heard seniors and others tell us to fix \nMedicare. They say fix it but don't increase the premium; fix it but \ndon't increase the age of eligibility. I have said several times \nbefore, if not now, when?\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\n When are we going to do it? And if not this, what? And if not us, who? \nSomeone has to take the actions to do the things that are difficult and \nmake the tough decisions needed to fix the problem.\n  What is going to happen when we wake up on December 31 in the year \n2007 and we still haven't acted on the recommendations of the \ncommission and we need to do something to fix a program on the brink of \ninsolvency again? What kind of an answer are we going to come up with \nin an emergency? It is far better to try to do this at a time when the \neconomy is good and people are working together in a bipartisan spirit.\n  So the fact we have another commission which succeeds the last \ncommission which succeeds previous commissions is certainly not an act \nof courage. It will not make a chapter in the next Profiles in Courage \nbook that is written about what we have done in the Congress, and that \nis unfortunate. But I say that because we should not let the perfect be \nthe enemy of the good in the sense that we will never be for anything \nunless it is perfect. While this is not a perfect package by any \nstretch of the imagination, it is a good package. It is one that merits \nour support. As long as we know that this package, the tax cut and the \nspending cuts and what we have done in Medicare is not the final answer \nbut just a beginning, I think I would say this to our colleagues who \nhave worked together on this: At least we have paved the road to make \nit easier for future Congresses to reach tough conclusions and make \ntough decisions that are really necessary to save Medicare.\n  So I support the tax package and commend Senator Roth and Senator \nMoynihan for doing something that has not been done in a long time, \nmaybe since the days of my predecessor, Senator Russell Long, on the \ncommittee, when both sides were able to say, all right, we are \ndifferent parties but we are all Americans and we need to ultimately \nwork together if anything is going to be done.\n  I always take the position that in politics it is better to get \nsomething done and then fight over who got it done, rather than to get \nnothing done and then blame the other side for failure. I am glad that \nthe Finance Committee was truly able to work together and get something \ndone in a bipartisan way. Now we can go fight about who got it done. \nBut at least we got something done for the American people. We did that \nin this Congress. We did that with these bills. We made tough decisions \nboth in taxes and in spending. I hope that one day in the not too \ndistant future the rest of the Congress will be able to act in an \nequally bipartisan fashion and get the rest of the job done.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank \nand acknowledge the tremendous work of the Senator from Louisiana in \nconnection with the Medicare reforms that we undertook. No one was a \nstouter soul in that effort to face up to what had to be done if we are \ngoing to continue to have Medicare. It was the Senator from Louisiana \nwho joined in leading the effort, in having the means testing in the \npart B premium and raising the eligibility age to 67 and having a \ncopayment, a payment for the home health care visits, of 7 percent.\n  I share the disappointment that the Senator from Louisiana has voiced \nin that these elements we worked on did not survive. But I see others \nhere. The distinguished Senator from New York was right in the lead in \nthese efforts. All I can say is, disappointed though we were, despite \nthe overwhelming vote that took place on the floor of the Senate on \nboth the means testing and the raising of the eligibility age, up or \ndown votes--one got 70 votes, the means testing, 70 to 30, and the \nother got something like 62 to 38, in that neighborhood, over 60 votes, \nin raising the age to 67--they didn't survive the conference because of \nobjections from the other body.\n  But this is what I want to say, Mr. President. Disappointing as that \nwas, nonetheless it showed that it could be done, and now it is an \naccepted fact in this Senate that all three of those elements are \nnecessary, and the votes are there to sustain them and make them part \nof any further legislation.\n  So now we have a commission, and as was pointed out, there is no \nreporting date for the commission. There is no fast track consideration \nfor the commission. I may be wrong in the reporting date.\n  March 1, 1999, I am informed. Well, it is not exactly tomorrow. \nHowever, there is no fast-track procedure; in other words, that it has \nto be considered, has to be voted on up or down, one way or another. It \ncould be like so many other commissions we have had in this body.\n  Mr. President, disappointed though we might be in those particular \nfacts, those particular undertakings, nonetheless we have made some \nsubstantial achievements in having them so accepted here.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Might I simply join my friend and old colleague on the \nFinance Committee in his remarks commending the Senator from Louisiana. \nTypically, he did not mention his own work, his own role in this--it \nwas indispensable--to have a unanimous Finance Committee in these \nmatters and to make a point. It had been assumed there would be a storm \nof disapproval for what we did. There was none. There was none. The \nusual interest groups wrote the usual letters and the usual people took \nthem too seriously. But a day will come when we have learned from this \nexperience because it was an event.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield to the Senator from Indiana such time as he \nrequires.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. First of all, I wish to associate myself strongly with the \nremarks of the Senator from Louisiana and Rhode Island and the Senator \nfrom New York relative to entitlement reform. I spoke at length on it \nyesterday, and I will not repeat all those remarks. It was with great \nsadness and disappointment we came what I think is as close as we have \never come in this Congress to addressing the fundamental reforms, \nstructural reforms that need to take place in our entitlement programs, \nparticularly Medicare, if we are going to ensure the long-term \nviability of that program, which I think we are all committed to do, \nand if we are going to prevent a crisis situation in which we will not \nact perhaps in a rational, reasonable manner but address it under the \nthreat of massive underpayment or massive deficit in that program.\n  It is interesting to me that in the Chamber just a moment ago were \ntwo Republicans and two Democrats, probably covering the ideological \nspectrum within our respective parties, all speaking in favor of \nentitlement reform. So I am hopeful that we are at least moving in the \nright direction. The Senator from New York said that even though we \nexpected a firestorm of political opposition, it wasn't heard. It \nwasn't heard because the American people need to be given more credit \nfor understanding the nature of the problem and the solutions to the \nproblem than we give them credit for.\n  There might have been a time politically when retribution would have \nbeen rendered across the spectrum for anybody who even breathed the \nidea that we ought to change Medicare. But today even senior citizens \nunderstand that this very important program cannot maintain its \nviability unless some reasonable changes are made, structural changes \nare made, in the current program in the way it is currently operated. \nYounger people understand, and if you ask them today whether or not \nthey think there will be a viable Medicare Program for them when they \nretire, an alarmingly high percentage say, no, I don't; I think the \npayroll taxes that are being extracted from my paycheck are going into \na fund and I will never see the benefits.\n  So I share the disappointment of our Members in terms of coming so \nclose and yet not succeeding at this important time. I made the point \nyesterday that during difficult economic times,\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\nwhen unemployment is high and deficits are running high, we say we \ncan't make these changes now because it will result in too much \neconomic dislocation. Here we have the best of times. We have never had \na more favorable time economically and politically in which to address \nthese questions. Our economy is humming along at a rate that none of us \nanticipated, pouring revenues into Washington--which we are giving some \nback with this tax cut--which were reducing the deficit, which is what \nwe need to do. We are balancing the budget. We are the recipients of \nvery good economic fortunes. And we have in place politically an \nadministration that doesn't have to stand for reelection, a Congress \nthat has already gone on record in support of entitlement reform. It \njust seems as if all the political stars and economic stars are lined \nup and that this is the moment.\n\n  I hope these good times last. I hope these good political stars \ncontinue to line up in a way that we can accomplish this. But I think \nthose who have experienced some years of history understand that the \ngood times do not always last, that we will be facing different \ncircumstances in the future, and we may not have the pieces in place to \naccomplish this. We do not need another commission. The Senator from \nLouisiana is absolutely correct. We have had commissions. We have had \nstudies. We have more information than we know what to do with. We have \neducated the American people. The seniors understand. The young people \nunderstand. Everybody seems to understand. Unfortunately, we always \ncome down to the point of not now; let's do it after the next election. \nLet's get past this next period of time. That is, indeed, unfortunate.\n  Today I want to focus the remainder of my remarks, and they will be \nbrief, on the continuing effort to bring tax equity to families. This \nis a process that began in the 1980's. I was pleased to be a part of \nthat, leading the effort in the House of Representatives along with my \ncolleague Jack Kemp in pushing for family tax relief. We were able to \ndouble the personal exemption, the first major adjustment in the amount \nof tax relief that families get for raising children since the \ninception of the dependents deduction in 1948. We continue that now \nwith this bill. I introduced the child tax credit in the Senate in 1992 \nas part of my families first legislation. I was joined by then \nCongressman Rod Grams, now Senator Grams from Minnesota. As he was my \ncompatriot in this in the House of Representatives, he has continued \nthat leadership in the Senate. I am pleased to have worked with him in \nthat effort. This is a culmination of a long effort to readdress the \nimbalance that exists within the Tax Code in terms of family tax \nrelief.\n  Many people have fought for it, and I commend those who have worked \nso hard to achieve this. A disproportionate share of the tax burden on \nfamilies has been a problem in both good economic times and bad \neconomic times. It has increased over the decades even as the cost of \nraising children has increased. The Tax Code has been a symbol in the \npast of public indifference to the challenge to families, and this tax \nmeasure today is a symbol that our thinking and our actions are finally \nchanging. Clearly we are beginning to understand that a dollar spent by \nfamilies is far more helpful to children and compassionate than any \ndollar spent by the Federal Government.\n  In 1997, Americans will work until the middle of May just to earn \nenough to pay their tax bill. Most families must have both parents \nworking, one to provide for the family, one to pay taxes to the \nGovernment. In fact, families today spend more in taxes than they do on \nfood, clothing, and shelter combined. The evidence is overwhelming. The \nfacts are no longer contestable.\n  The answer is to return public funds to the people and not to funnel \nthem through the Government. The child tax credit is a tangible \nachievement for the people of every State. In my State of Indiana, the \n$500 child tax credit will give over 850,000 Hoosier families \nrepresenting 1.1 million Hoosier children an average of over $80 a \nmonth extra money for family income. I am as proud, I think, as \nanything else that I have done in this body, to be a part of this \neffort to restore equity to families, to give them the ability to \nretain more of their hard-earned dollars to help raise their children \nand pay for the costs of raising those children. It is the most \nimmediate practical form of compassion I can imagine, allowing them to \nspend their own money on their own needs.\n  Mr. President, I have walked the Halls of Congress for nearly 20 \nyears, and I have watched the high-powered lobbyists gain funds for \nspecial interests and for powerful groups. There have been those who \nhave stood up over the years for the interests of families. But, \nthankfully, over time, those numbers have changed. Today they include \nthe leadership of Congress in both parties. The largest portion of \nrelief in this tax bill, 56.2 percent, goes to families, and that is an \nachievement in which we can all take pride.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President I believe the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana would like to speak at this point. She can have as much time \nas she would like from our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share \njust a few remarks about this important budget reconciliation and \nadoption. I first thank and congratulate the leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle, to the chairman and to our ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee and the Budget Committee, for all of their hard work and \nleadership. Nothing of this magnitude is accomplished without good, \nstrong, well informed leadership. I think we have it in our leaders \nhere.\n  This bill is not everything that I hoped for. It is not everything \nthat any one individual Member would have wanted. And it is not \nperfect. But it is a good bill. It is a good start to getting our \nfiscal house in order. Getting our fiscal house in order and making \nsure we are spending our money wisely, saving where we can and giving \ntax relief, is something that I personally feel is supported by the \nvast majority of Americans, regardless of party, and so many people in \nLouisiana feel this way. On these difficult problems, such as balancing \nthe budget, neither party can get the job done by themselves. It is \ngoing to take both parties to get the job done in the right way for the \nAmerican people.\n  I am very proud, though, of a couple of points in this bill. Again, I \nshow the Meyers family from Shreveport. Because of the good work that \nwe did here in the Senate, and with the leadership of the President--\nand I will say many of the Democrats supported the expansion of this \n$500 child tax credit to hard-working, not welfare but hard-working \nmiddle-class and moderate-income families--this family, Lois and Scott \nMeyers, of Shreveport, will be able to take part in the $500 tax \ncredit. Families with earnings up to $110,000 will be able to benefit, \nwhich, in Louisiana, covers just about all of our families. The \nhousehold incomes of 95 percent of our families are under $75,000. So \nthe work that we did, and the fight to make this child credit available \nto working families like this, I think is something we can all be very \nproud of.\n  Mr. President, 46 percent of Louisiana taxpayers earn less than \n$20,000 a year--not get less than $20,000, they work hard and only get \n$20,000 a year. This will really help almost 50 percent of the families \nin my State and that of Senator Breaux, and we are happy for that \nvictory.\n  I also want to say how pleased I am to see our first step, but I hope \nnot our last step, in providing health care to uninsured children. \nAgain, these are children who are of working families, whose parents \nhave jobs--sometimes not just one, sometimes not two, but three jobs--\nand are still without health insurance for their children. We could, as \na country, make no better investment than providing critical health \ncare to zero to 3, zero to 6--helping children to develop in ways that \nwill save us all, as taxpayers, millions and millions of dollars down \nthe line for other expenses like criminal justice or special education. \nI am looking forward to working with my State leaders to design the \nkind of health care program for them that is cost-effective, quality \noriented, child centered and family centered. I am looking forward to \nthat.\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\n  I also want to say how thrilled I am about the investment in \neducation. Because, really, with President Clinton's lead, we have now \ninvested more money in education than since President Johnson was in \nthe White House. Why is that important? It's important because our \ncountry doesn't have a future if our children and our workers are not \nwell educated and well trained, to take advantage of the jobs and \nchallenges that the next century will hold. So the Hope scholarships, \nthe Pell grant expansions, and the student loan deductions, I think, \nare excellent provisions, to say we believe in education. It is the \nfoundation of our economic development plan for the Nation and we are \ngoing to put our money where our mouth is.\n  Let me also say to my senior colleague from Louisiana, who worked so \nhard on expanding the IRA, I have heard many of our colleagues say that \ngiving people money to spend is what it's about. I do believe people \ncan make good choices about the way they spend their money. But I think \nthe real need is to encourage people to save their money. Our savings \nrate in this country is much lower than it needs to be. If we can \nencourage people to save for the right things--to purchase a home, for \ncatastrophic health care needs, for education to improve their \nproductivity and to give hope to their children--that is really what \nthis is about.\n  I thank the members of the committee for fighting hard for expanding \nIRAs. It is important to people everywhere, and very important to \npeople in Louisiana.\n  Finally, just a word on the estate tax and small business and \nfarmers. We believe, on this side of the aisle, and there are many on \nthe other side who thought it was important, if a grandmother, \ngrandfather, great-grandfather built a farm on the sweat of their brow, \ninvested in their land, invested in their equipment, they should be \nable to pass that farm down to the next generation without having to \nsell off the land or sell off the equipment to pay the taxes to our \nGovernment. We heard that. We have responded, and we have now given a \ntax incentive to be able to pass those small businesses and farms on, \nto people in our country.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address the body, \nto say this is not a perfect bill but it is a very good step toward \ngetting our fiscal house in order, to providing much-needed tax relief \nto hard-working, middle-class families in our country and to making the \nkind of investments that are going to make our country even stronger \nand more productive in the future.\n  On behalf of the Meyers family, to the 236,000 children that will be \nable to benefit from health care, and to the almost 400,000 children \nthat will be able to benefit from this tax credit, and for others, I \nthank you so much and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the absence of the Senator from \nDelaware I believe I am entitled to yield myself 6 minutes from his \ntime.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of course, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on all too many occasions in this body, we \nhave been a part of debates, pointing fingers over failure, over a \nfailure to balance the budget, over a failure to meet the needs of the \nAmerican people. We are in a competition again here today, but it is a \nfar more pleasant competition. It is competition for credit for a \nsuccess. It is my view that there is plenty of praise to go around for \nthat success, from the Republicans and Democrats to the leadership of \nthe Congress and to the President of the United States.\n  I believe we have heeded the counsel of the people of the United \nStates who were not willing to trust either party last November with \nfull control over the Federal Government, and demanded that we work \ntogether and craft solutions to the challenges facing the American \npeople. So we have passed a bill that will lead us to a balanced \nbudget. And so we are about to pass a bill that will: Give needed and \noverdue tax relief to the American people; a credit to most hard-\nworking American families of $500 for each of their children 16 years \nold and under; credit and relief for the expenses of higher education \nto those same hard-working middle-class American citizens; relief from \nthe savage impacts of the death tax on small businesses and on farms; \nhelp for the self-employed, in paying for the rising cost of health \ncare insurance; relief from burdensome taxation on the sale of homes or \nthe sale of other assets that will lead to more investment and to \nbetter jobs and opportunities for the future; encouragements to save.\n  Mr. President, is this the last answer to each of these challenges, \nto all of our challenges? It is not. I share with the Senator from New \nYork, the Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from Rhode Island, \ndisappointment that we missed this opportunity, an opportunity granted \nby the courage of Members of both parties in this Senate, to deal with \nthe underlying challenges to Medicare and to an aging population. But \nwe did find that we could debate those issues and vote on those issues \nconstructively and positively in this Senate. I believe we have built a \nbase on which that debate will be renewed next year, one hopes with \nreal opportunities for success.\n  We did not simplify the Tax Code in this bill by any stretch of the \nimagination, but I believe we built a foundation upon which we can \ndebate next year over whether or not we ought to dramatically simplify \nand make more fair and easy to understand and easy to comply with, our \ntax system. But the fact that we didn't do everything should not \ndetract from the fact that we did something. We have moved dramatically \nforward toward a balanced budget, and dramatically forward toward tax \nrelief for the American people.\n  This is a partnership program for which much credit is due very \nwidely and across both parties. I trust that partnership will be \nrecognized by an overwhelming vote of approval tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Mexico wishes to \nspeak, I will yield the floor, of course, but the Senator from Arkansas \nwould be the next?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bumpers, do you want to go next? You are \nentitled to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No, I am willing to let you go and I'll follow you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are on the threshold of passing the \nlargest tax cut in 16 years. It's a package that benefits Americans of \nall ages and in all tax brackets. Mr. President, 82 percent of the \nbenefits in this bill go to families earning less than $110,000, during \nthe first 5 years.\n  I commend the chairman once again, and the entire Finance Committee \nand certainly the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, for their fine \nbipartisan work. The hard-working parents of 45 million children will \npay $500 less per child in taxes as a result of this tax credit for \nchildren--45 million children. At least 5 million parents with kids in \ncollege and taxpaying students will have $1,500 per student more to \nspend at college, as a result of the tuition credit, and 7.2 million \nrecent entrants into the job market will be able to deduct their \nstudent loan interest. This package will mean that the American \nfamilies will get to keep more of their hard-earned money, instead of \nsending it to Washington. This is a very large number of American \nfamilies. I have just given you the numbers in millions, and they are \nvery, very significant in all our towns, all our cities in all areas of \nour respective States, be it yours, Mr. President, or mine.\n\n  Let me quickly outline the major components of this package, because \nI think they are very exciting. Some have said it is a very small tax \ncut and, yes, in terms of our gross domestic product, or even our total \ntax, it is not a very big tax cut. But I believe we prove here that we \ncan help many, many Americans, especially those most entitled to help \nin areas where we most want to encourage achievement.\n  The $500 child credit to help the working poor and middle class, the \nvalue of the personal exemption has been eroded over time, and the cost \nof raising a family has become more expensive. We all know in our youth \nthat\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\nthe deduction that our parents got to take because they had a child \nthey were raising was a very, very significant economic advance to that \nfamily. We let it erode. The credit in this bill will totally eliminate \nthe Federal income tax burden for more than 30,000 families in New \nMexico and 300,000 New Mexican children's families will be able to take \ncredit to reduce their taxes. I am particularly pleased that the \nFinance Committee decided to design the credit so that the working poor \nwould also see the benefit of the $500 credit.\n  In New Mexico, there are 175,087 claimants of the earned-income tax \ncredit. I applaud the final bill's approach. It is a logical sequel to \nthe new welfare reform laws we have passed, because it, too, emphasizes \nmoving from welfare to work.\n  The $500 child credit will save New Mexico families $461 million over \nthe next 5 years. For a small State and a poor State, that is a lot of \nmoney that will stay home in the pockets of people and stay in our \nStates. This is money that they can choose to spend, or they can save \nit to meet their needs. A family with two children eligible for two \n$500 credits would have an extra $1,000 a year in the family budget.\n  Some think that is not much, but this would pay the mortgage for 1\\1/\n2\\ months, or pay half of a year's worth of car payments, or buy gas \nfor the family car for 8 months or groceries for 3 months.\n  In New Mexico, while 78 babies are born each day, Congress is passing \nthis bill so that these children and their families will have a \nbrighter future, more opportunity and keep more of their money.\n  This tax cut is overdue. Let me repeat, in 1948, the typical American \nfamily sent 3 percent of its income to Washington in the form of \ntaxes--3 percent. Today, the number is closer to 25 percent with the \nFederal tax. Prior to the passage of this bill, most working mothers \nwere working to pay taxes instead of improving the standard of living \nfor their families, and that isn't right. Lowering the tax burden will \nlet moms' paychecks go toward family expenses instead. It is not as \nmuch as everyone would like, but certainly better than doing nothing. \nAs I see it, the entire package is a giant step in the right direction.\n  Most people's vision of America and the American dream includes a \ncollege education for their children. This bill helps fund that dream. \nIt is a big expense and tuition costs have risen far more than \ninflation. Parents have told me that they have nightmares about \nfinancing college for their children. In New Mexico, tuition ranges \nfrom $18,700 at St. John's College, to $2,080 at the University of New \nMexico or New Mexico State. Community and technical college tuition is \nabout half that.\n  This bill provides a number of separate provisions that help finance \ncollege, but the most significant of them is a $1,500 tax credit that \nreduces taxes dollar per dollar for the first $1,000 worth of tuition \npaid and 50 percent for the next $1,000 of tuition paid for the first 2 \nyears of college, community college or technical school. A good idea.\n  During the junior and senior years of college, the tax credit is 20 \npercent of the first $5,000 in tuition paid. Over time, these tax \ncredits get bigger so that by the year 2002, the tuition tax credit is \n$10,000.\n  I am pleased that the technical colleges and community colleges \nqualify. They are needed. They are filling an ever-more important role \nin our changing educational needs.\n  Student loans are one of the broadest based forms of financial aid \nfor graduate students. They are instrumental in financing undergraduate \nstudy as well.\n  The deductibility of student loan interest automatically shifts the \nbenefit of the provision toward children of low- and middle-income \nfamilies. The deduction of student loan interest is well designed to \nprovide annual tax relief, and can provide a powerful incentive for \nmore citizens to pursue and push hard for graduate and advanced \ndegrees.\n  The deduction is phased in: $1,000 in 1998; $1,500 in 1999; $2,000 in \n2000, and $2,500 in 2001.\n  Mr. President, this bill has a number of IRA's that our distinguished \nchairman has been the advocate of. He has adequately explained them and \nI won't go into them in detail.\n  This bill also allows penalty-free withdrawals from all IRA's for \nundergraduate, post-secondary vocational and graduate education \nexpenses.\n  The bill also makes the exclusion of $5,525 worth of education \nassistance paid for by employers permanent. This provision has helped \nmillions of workers maintain their state-of-the-art skills. As we move \ninto the 21st century life-long learning will be a way of life.\n  The great educator Horace Mann said, ``Education is the great \nequalizer.''\n  In our technological society the reverse is also true, lack of \neducation can leave people behind. For example, while in 1980, a \nstudent graduating from college could expect to earn about 45 percent \nmore than a high school graduate, today the differential has almost \ndoubled.\n  This bill provides $207 million in tax relief over the next 5 years \nfor New Mexicans to better educate themselves and their families.\n  Actions have consequences and tax policy has mammoth consequences. \nThe United States has one of the highest capital gains tax rates and \none of the lowest savings rates among the seventh wealthiest countries \nin the world. If we cut the capital gains rate, our economy could \ncreate 150,000, as much as 280,000, new jobs next year. Besides being \ngood for the economy, this capital gains tax will benefit everyone. \nOver a 10-year period, about one-third of all taxpayers sell at least \none capital gains asset. Over a 10-year period, one-third of our \npopulation can take advantage of capital gains. It is not for one small \ngroup; it is for one-third of Americans.\n  We need to update our image of who benefits from a capital gains tax \ncut. In 1990, the typical mutual fund owner is someone in the $35,000 \nto $75,000 income bracket. The average portfolio is $14,000. Half of \nthese investors do not have a college degree. This is a very different \nimage from the wealthy widow toting a pampered poodle down Fifth Avenue \nin New York and being the one who can take advantage of capital gains. \nBut I don't know anyone in New Mexico who has a numeral after his last \nname. I do know that New Mexicans pay $638 million in capital gains in \n1995. Under this bill, that tax would be considerably reduced.\n  When the investor invests in companies, the result is capital \nformation. Dale Jorgenson of Harvard has noted that almost half of the \neconomic growth between 1948 and 1980 was due to increased capital \nformation and influx into American businesses. Greater economic growth \nresults as more and better paying jobs arrive on the scene.\n  I am also pleased that the bill expands IRA's and allows penalty-free \nwithdrawals for the first-time home buyer and, obviously, we have other \nprovisions that help homeowners because they, too, get a very \nsignificant capital gains differential when they sell their homes.\n  As baby boomers age it is very important that they save more for \nretirement. The IRA provisions encourages everyone to save more. I see \nthis as a step toward enacting the U.S.A. tax reform plan that I have \nbeen working on the last few years. Under that plan families would be \ngiven an unlimited savings allowance so that the tax rate on any \namounts saved or invested would be zero until the funds are consumed.\n  The other major provision in this bill provides death tax relief. The \nestate tax is often referred to as the most confiscatory tax of all. \nSome call it a tax on success. A recent Tax Foundation study found that \ntoday's estate tax rates--ranging from 18 to 55 percent--have the same \ndisincentive effect on entrepreneurs as doubling the current income tax \nrates.\n  The unified credit has not been increased since 1987. This bill \nslowly increases it to $1 million by the year 2007.\n  The philosophy behind the estate tax was imported from Europe, for \nexample, that the accumulation of too much wealth in too few families \nis bad. Today, however, that estate tax philosophy is fundamentally \nflawed. When applied to closely held business assets, ironically, the \ntax produces just the opposite result--often forcing family owned \nbusinesses to sell off to larger public corporations. It raises roughly \n1\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\npercent of annual revenues. At that rate, it is hardly worth the \ndevastation it causes to family businesses and farms, and \nentrepreneurship.\n  Starting a small business is part of the American dream that allows \nany American with a good idea to follow it to prosperity and \nindependence. In my State I have seen a number of welfare mothers start \nsuccessful businesses. The ultimate American dream is to be able to \nleave that successful family business to one's children. Too often \ncurrent estate taxes force heirs to liquidate the business or family \nfarm to pay the estate taxes.\n  The death tax takes its toll. Only 13 percent of family businesses \nare passed on to a third generation. The National Federation of \nIndependent Business testified before the Ways and Means Committee that \n``the Federal estate tax represents perhaps the greatest burden today \non our Nation's most successful small businesses.'' This bill helps \nlighten that burden.\n  The death tax changes are timely changes for ranchers. The average \nage of America's cattlemen is 55 years old. Some 80 percent of the beef \ncattle operations have remained in one family for 25 years or more with \n42 percent in the family for over 50 years. Interestingly, 12 percent \nof the ranches have been in the same family for 100 years. This bill \nwill contribute to preserving the great American legacy by helping keep \nranches in the family by providing $25 million in tax relief to New \nMexicans over the next 5 years.\n  The bill also allows people to sell a house tax free. This is a good \nreal estate provision. One provision I am not totally satisfied with is \nthe treatment of investment real estate. The conference report sets the \ncapital gains rate at 25 percent, I truly believe that equity demands \nthat the capital gains rate on investment real estate be the same as \nthe capital gains rate. I hope the Congress will revisit this issue in \nthe near future.\n  I am pleased that the bill makes it easier for small business \nentrepreneurs to claim the home office deduction. I am also glad that \nthis bill accelerates the phase-in of the self-employed health \ninsurance deduction.\n  The biggest winners under this tax bill are middle-income families \nwith children, particularly those families earning between $20,000 and \n$50,000 per year. Families earning between $50,000 and $100,000 are \ngiven tax relief too, provided they have children or kids in college.\n  A married couple with household income of $35,000 and two children \nunder age 17 would see their tax bill fall by $2,000, a 38-percent \ndecline from what they'd owe under current law.\n  The education incentive mean that families with children in college \nare helped even more. A married couple with income of $35,000 and two \nchildren, one in college and one still at home, would see their tax \nbill fall by $2,000, a 76-percent decline from what they'd owe under \ncurrent law.\n  What these families save on taxes represents cash in your pocket; it \nrepresents how much of their own money they get to keep. Think about \nhow much of a raise a taxpayer would have to get from their boss in \norder to be able to increase their take-home pay by that much.\n  Mr. President, today is a banner day. We finished a bill that \nbalanced the budget yesterday, and within that framework, today, we are \npassing a net tax reduction of $96 billion over 5 years. This makes it \nthe largest tax reduction bill since President Reagan's tax reduction \nin 1981, and the first tax relief bill since President Reagan signed \nthe 1986 tax reform.\n  Let me say, for those who are disappointed, I am not the least bit \ndisappointed. We can always look at this as half-full or half-empty. I \nbelieve, when you look at Congress and the Presidency and the different \nphilosophies, to be here today with the second of two major bills of \nthis proportion, moving toward balance and a significant and very well \ntailored tax cut, I believe it is a real achievement, and for those who \nwant more and think we should do more, let me suggest, we have been \ntrying for a long time to do just this much and have been unable to do \nit. So I am very pleased and think the American people will be, too, \nwhen they start to feel its impact in their communities, in what they \npay for taxes and what they keep.\n  I thank the Senate, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, several years ago, there was a \nmagnificent book that came out by a great historian, Barbara Tuchman, \ncalled the ``March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.'' The book cataloged \nhow in moments of history, terrible tragedies, terrible mistakes could \nhave been avoided because there was always some lone voice saying, \n``Don't do that.'' Almost invariably, the politics of the moment \ndictated otherwise.\n  The book ``From Troy to Vietnam,'' starts out with the Trojan horse. \nEvery schoolchild knows the story of how the Greeks went to rescue \nHelen from the Trojans. Finally, after many, many months of not being \nable to break into the Trojan fortress, the Greeks designed this Trojan \nhorse, a wooden horse, a fabric horse, as the Aeneid describes it, and \nthey place this horse outside the Trojan fortress. The Trojans are \nafraid that the gods have placed the horse there, and it would be a \nterrible tragedy for them if they didn't let the horse into the \nfortress. One person, named Laocoon, said, ``Don't let that horse in. \nWhat more than madness has possessed your brains?'' he said. ``What \nhave the Greeks ever done for us?'' But he was the sole voice of \ndissent. So they opened the gates. They let the horse in, and 50 of the \nGreeks' finest soldiers poured out of the belly of the horse and took \nthe fortress.\n  In World War II, when the debate was going on with the German high \ncommand about whether to get involved in the war, whether to antagonize \nthe United States or not, the commander of all the German submarines \nwas consulted. ``If you can sink so much allied shipping,'' they said, \n``the United States won't be a threat.'' And the German U-boat \ncommander said, ``You're silly; you're foolish. We can do a lot of \ndamage, but we can't come close to sinking that much allied shipping.'' \nAnd his voice was drowned out as if he had never spoken.\n  When the warlords of Japan sat around plotting the attack on Pearl \nHarbor, the great Japanese admiral, Yamamoto, stood up and said, ``I've \ngone to school there. I know the Americans, I know their industrial \noutput, I know their tenacity, and I know their love of country. This \nwill not work.'' He went ahead to say, ``I am at the Japanese Emperor's \nbeck and call, and I will do anything I am called on to do.'' The rest \nof that is history. Yamamoto's voice was drowned out.\n\n  Today, we have this reconciliation bill before us. And there were few \nlone souls in the U.S. Senate who voted against the great tax cut of \n1981, Mr. President. Only 11 people stood up in the U.S. Senate and \nsaid, ``I'm not voting for a concept of doubling defense spending and \ncutting taxes and presuming to balance the budget.'' Eleven souls said, \n``No, let's not do this. It is the height of folly.''\n  Our voices were drowned out. At that moment, the national debt was $1 \ntrillion and the interest on that debt in 1981 was $60 billion. Our \nvoices were drowned out. And 16 years later, because our voices were \ndrowned out, today's national debt is $5.3 trillion, and the interest \non that debt has gone from $60 billion a year to $359 billion a year. \nThat is the interest we are paying on the national debt in this year of \nour Lord, 1997. You know how much of that $359 billion is as a result \nof the craziness of this place in 1981? Approximately three-hundred \nbillion dollars.\n  The pages who sit in front of me will not live long enough to see \nthat figure even reduced very much. You want to do something for the \nchildren? You say, let us give the middle-class children of this \ncountry a tax break. How about tomorrow's children and the children in \nthe next generation and the next generation? What are you doing for \nthem? You are saddling them with an incredible debt. When I think about \nwhat we could do if we would not pass this bill. With the economic \ngrowth we have enjoyed for the past six or seven years, and as we \nanticipate it will be for the immediate future, would almost certainly \nbalance the budget in 1998, and we could even run a surplus in 1999. \nBalancing the budget is within our grasp, an eyelash away. And this \nbill thwarts it in the name of a middle-class tax cut.\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\n  About the only distributional analysis that has been done on this \nbill is a study by the Citizens for Tax Justice. And what do they say? \nJust look at this chart.\n  Look at this middle-class tax cut, Mr. President. The bottom 20 \npercent, people who make less than $12,000 a year do not get a tax cut. \nThey get virtually no benefit from the child credit and capital gains \nand the other major tax cuts. So with the increase in cigarette taxes \nand airline ticket taxes, the bill is going to cost them $39 a year. So \nmuch for the poorest of the poor in this country. They not only don't \nget a cut, they pay more.\n  Go to the next 20 percent, the people who make up to $22,000 a year. \nWhat do they get? Why, they get a whopping $8-a-year cut in their \ntaxes--a few cents a week.\n  If you combine these two bottom groups, you will see that the bottom \n40 percent on average will see their taxes go up by $31 a year.\n  Then go to the next 20 percent. The next 20 percent, the people who \nmake $22,000 to $39,000 a year, they are going to wind up with a $171-\na-year tax cut--less than 50 cents a day.\n  So where is all the money going?\n  Look at this chart for just one moment. The next 15 percent that, \nthey get $1,163 a year. What does the next 4 percent get? The people \nwho make $109,000 to $246,000 get $1,772 a year in tax cuts. And the \ntop 1 percent, the people who make $246,000 or more, get $16,227 a \nyear.\n  So seventy-six percent of all the benefits of this bill go to the top \n20 percent of the people in this country. That is a middle-class tax \ncut? That is to help the middle-class families of this country?\n  This bill has had more public relations, more ballyhoo under the name \nof a middle-class tax cut. No wonder 54 percent of the people of the \ncountry say they favor this bill. And you know why? Because the \nquestion is asked, ``Do you favor the balanced budget resolution that \nCongress is considering?'' Well, of course they favor a balanced budget \nresolution. Who doesn't? What a travesty. Mr. President, I have been \ndivinely hoping that negotiations between the President and the \nRepublicans would reach an impasse, breakdown, with gridlock, because \nif we did nothing the budget would be balanced in 1998, 1 year from \nthis moment. If somebody had said in 1993, ``You vote for this omnibus \nbudget reconciliation bill and we'll balance the budget in 1998,'' we \nwould have insisted they take a saliva test.\n\n  When I think of all the good men and women who used to sit in the \nHouse and the Senate, and they are gone only because they had the \ncourage to vote for that bill in 1993, which raised taxes on the top \n1.3 percent of the richest people in America--1.3 percent--because a \nfew courageous people in this body--Jim Sasser, Harris Wofford, two of \nthe finest men ever to serve in the U.S. Senate, who are no longer with \nus. And a lot more people in the House are no longer with us--they had \nthe courage to face up to something that was very unpopular at the \ntime. But even on the outside they can take solace in the fact that \nthey honored what they believed was a nonnegotiable demand by the \npeople of this country for a balanced budget.\n  Do you know what we did as a result of that 1993 vote? I am always \nreluctant to talk about this because I have so many good friends on the \nother side of the aisle, but truth has to be told. Not one single \nRepublican in the U.S. Congress, in the Senate or the House, not one \nvoted for that bill. And the Democratic party suffered at the polls as \na result of that vote.\n  A lot of people stood on the Senate floor and said the 1993 bill is \ngoing to bring about a terrible recession. So what really happened? \nBefore we passed that bill, the deficit for 1993 was estimated to be \n$290 billion. And as a result of passing the deficit reduction bill, it \nturned out to be only $255 billion. In 1994, it dropped to $203 \nbillion. In 1995, it was $154 billion. In 1996, it was $107 billion. \nFor 1997, it is now calculated at around $45 billion, and many \neconomists say it could be less. From almost $300 billion, in 4 short \nyears, to $45 billion because a few people in this body had the spine \nto vote for something that was politically unpopular. Those people who \nlost their seats as a result of that vote are undoubtedly watching \ntheir hard-won victory being sacrificed on the altar of political \nexpedience. The balanced budget of 1998 that is just about to elude us.\n  You know, the economy, if it stays as good as it is right now through \nall of 1998, despite the foolishness of this bill, we still might \nbalance the budget in 1998 if the economy stays good, but only for a \nnanosecond. Under the calculations of the bill, we are going to spend \nalmost $300 billion more in deficit spending over the next 5 years, and \nthe interest on that will be $15 billion--forever. That $300 billion \ngoes right on top of the $5.3 trillion you see here. At the end of 5 \nyears, instead of $5.3 trillion, that will be $5.6 trillion. At the end \nof 5 years, instead of $359 billion in annual interest, it could well \nbe $375 billion.\n  You want to do something for children? Don't saddle them with that \nkind of debt.\n  The Senator from New Mexico pointed out some very cogent points a \nwhile ago with which I do not disagree. I favor the educational \nbenefits in this bill. I favor the child health care provision which we \nare paying for with a cigarette tax. It isn't all bad. But it isn't all \ncritical, not as necessary as a balanced budget.\n  We are today going to grab defeat from the jaws of victory. The only \ngratifying thing to me about this whole exercise is it shows the \nhypocrisy of the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I \nalways knew that was political, but it is a very effective political \ntool. It took a lot of courage because it was portrayed that if you did \nnot vote for the constitutional amendment, you were portrayed as being \nagainst a balanced budget. The fact that we are about to pass a bill \nwhich will supposedly balance the budget by 2002 reveals the hypocrisy \nof those people who said, ``You have to have a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget.''\n  And those of us who voted for the 1993 bill to cut spending by $250 \nbillion and increase taxes by $250 billion have something to be proud \nof because that act instilled so much confidence in Wall Street and the \npeople of this Nation, the economy has been on fire ever since. The \nNation thought the people here in Washington had finally stiffened \ntheir spines to do something that was right.\n\n  I cannot believe we are in the process of postponing balancing the \nbudget for 5 years--the very people who said, you must put it in the \nConstitution and who said they wanted a balanced budget more than \nanything in the world. Here it is within our grasp. And what is their \nsolution? Postpone it for 5 years, spend another $300 billion in \ndeficit spending.\n  Mr. President, the needs in this Nation are truly great. We are the \ngreatest Nation economically on Earth. We certainly are the oldest \nliving democracy. We have the oldest Constitution in the world.\n  Militarily, we are certainly the strongest on Earth, and well we \nshould be the way we spend money on defense. But when I think about the \nneeds of this country, if you absolutely have to spend this money, \nthere are better things to spend it on. We asked the Department of \nEducation what it would cost to provide every child in America with a \ncollege education--every one who would get a college education if it \nwere within their financial means. It is very interesting, this tax cut \nis roughly $135 billion, and it would take $1 billion less--$134 \nbillion--to provide a college education for every youngster in America \nthat would want one.\n  So the next time you talk to the most conservative groups in your \nhometown--the chamber of commerce or the Rotary Club--you ask them, do \nyou think this country would be stronger if we educated with a college \neducation every kid in America, or if we give a $135 billion tax cut to \nthe wealthiest people in America? I can promise you that if you were \ndebating that on national television, it would be 90-10 in favor of \neducating our children.\n  So, Mr. President, I divinely hope that everything I say today turns \nout quite differently from the way I am predicting it. But I don't \nbelieve that is going to happen. If Barbara Tuchman were alive, she \nwould certainly include this vote as one of the top follies in our \nNation's history. Once again, we have managed because of political \nexpediency to finesse the real problem.\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it's time to move beyond the tax and spend \nways that for far too long have marked business-as-usual in Washington. \nThe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, as part of the budget reconciliation \npackage, signals a new beginning for Congress--the beginning of a trend \nthat puts Americans first.\n  To argue that the tax relief contained in this package is too high--\nor that the cuts are too big--is to argue that government simply \ndoesn't tax American families enough. This is absurd. Today, Americans \nare paying higher taxes, as a percentage of our gross national product, \nthan they have since 1960. Today, American families are paying more in \ntaxes than they are for food, clothing, and shelter combined. High \ntaxes are forcing parents who would rather be at home with their \nchildren to work longer, or to hold down a second job.\n  Many, who would rather be homemakers, are forced by high taxes to \nenter the labor market, as Americans are finding it impossible to \nsupport their families and the government on one salary.\n  Despite all of this, we're hearing now that taxes aren't high enough. \nWell my question, Mr. President, is just how high is high enough? How \nmuch more would satisfy my colleagues? I'm afraid that Congress could \ntax 100 percent of all the wealth in America, and it still wouldn't be \nenough for those who refuse to change their tax and spend ways.\n  You see, I come from another school of thought. I believe that the \nmoney Americans earn belongs to them. I believe our families know best \nwhat to do with their checkbooks. I believe that money earned by an \nindividual belongs to the individual--that it does not belong to \ngovernment--and that government is arrogant to assume that it can \ndecide how much a hard-working man or woman can keep.\n  You see, Mr. President, unlike my distinguished colleagues, my \ndisagreement with this bill is exactly the opposite. My disagreement \nwith this bill is that the tax relief contained within it doesn't go \nfar enough. The tax cuts aren't deep enough. That's why I can assure \nthose who are listening that we will be on this floor again, some time \nin the near future. We will be here addressing real tax reform--tax \nreform that is structured from the taxpayer's point of view.\n  But for now, I'm willing to accept this compromise. It was crafted in \na spirit of bipartisanship, with willing and cooperative leaders on \nboth sides of the aisle. I will vote for this tax relief. But again, I \nassure you--I assure the American people--that this relief is only a \nfirst step in an effort that will continue--a bipartisan effort that \nwill deliver the kind of tax reform Americans deserve.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be granted to the following members of my staff \nduring the pendency of this measure: Barry Becton, Catherine Dolan, and \nTom Walls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to express my \ngratitude to the many staff members who helped us draft this historic \ntax relief legislation. These dedicated men and women worked tirelessly \nover the last several months. They worked early mornings, they worked \nlate nights and many times almost all night, as well as weekends, to \nhelp us succeed. I, for one, am deeply appreciative of the staff's \neffort. I know that my colleagues are as well.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the names of the \nstaff printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                       Mr. Roth's Personal Office\n\n       John Duncan.\n       Ashley Miller.\n\n\n                        SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE\n\n       Lindy Paull.\n       Frank Polk.\n       Mark Prater.\n       Rosemary Becchi.\n       Doug Fisher.\n       Brig Gulya.\n       Sam Olchyk.\n       Tom Roesser.\n       Joan Woodward.\n       Myrtle Agent.\n       Mark Patterson.\n       David Podoff.\n       Nick Giordano.\n       Maury Passman.\n       Bill Fant.\n       Ramon Camacho.\n       Ginny Flynn.\n       Christina Pearson.\n\n\n                       Senate Legislative Counsel\n\n       Jim Fransen.\n       Mark Matheson.\n\n\n                       House Legislative Counsel\n\n       Stan Grimm.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I'd also like to thank the staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation for their hard work and effort on this legislation, including \nKen Kies, Bernie Schmitt, Mary Schmitt, Barbara Angus, Steve Arkin, Tom \nBarthold, Pat Driessen, Chris Giosa, Ben Hartley, Rob Harvey, Harold \nHirsch, Melani Houser, Allison Ivory, Ron Jeremias, Kent Killelea, Leon \nKlud, Gary Koenig, Tom Koerner, Roberta Mann, Laurie Matthews, Alysa \nMcDaniel, Joe Mikrut, Pam Moomau, John Navratil, Joe Nega, Judy Owens, \nBarbara Robles, Cecily Rock, Mel Schwarz, Carolyn Smith, Bill Sutton, \nMaxine Terry, Mel Thomas, Mike Udell, Barry Wold, and Judy \nXanthopoulos. In addition, I'd like to recognize particularly the \nassistance of the support staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. \nWithout their efforts, this bill could not have been completed in a \ntimely manner.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if there are additions from our side, I \nknow the Senator wishes them to be added also.\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask what time remains on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 3 hours 4 \nminutes. The Senator from New York has 1 hour 29 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Arkansas has 50 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I don't want to introduce any partisan \nwrangling, but this side of the aisle has done much better in using up \ntime than that side. Perhaps we could think of yielding back some time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Well, I say to my distinguished cochairman that I----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We talk more than you do.\n  Mr. ROTH. It takes you longer to make a point.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I see. I think I will withdraw from this exchange.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be equally divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the chairman and \nranking member for the hours and hours of deliberation and work to \nbring us to this point. You are both to be highly commended, along with \nseveral others of our colleagues. But I think all of us in the Senate \nare indebted to the hours of commitment, not only to this distinguished \nbody, but to our country, and we thank you both.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Tax Relief Act, and I was \nmost pleased to be able to cast a vote earlier today for the Balanced \nBudget Act. I know many have said so, but it is worthy of repeating. We \nhave waited 28 years to finally have the Congress produce a balanced \nbudget act that will be signed by the President. That is a massive \naccomplishment. Now we are on the\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\nverge of passing, I think by even a greater margin, a tax relief act, \nwhich is a significant step. It falls short, in my judgment, of what is \ntruly needed for the American worker and family, but I applaud the \nsignificance of it, the direction of it, and even the amount of it.\n  I do think it is worth remembering that, in 1990, about this same \ntime of the year, American workers and families were given a $250 \nbillion tax increase. At that time, it was the largest increase in \nAmerican history. It was followed by a promise, in 1992, of a \nreduction, which never occurred. In fact, what happened was that \nanother $250 or $260 billion tax increase was given to the American \nworker and family--meaning that from 1990 to 1993, taxes were raised by \nover a half trillion dollars, leaving the American worker and American \nfamily with the largest tax levy in our history.\n  Put in that context, this tax relief is only a 20 percent refund of \nthe tax increases in the early part of this decade. That is why I say \nit falls short of what I think really ought to occur, and I know I am \njoined by many colleagues who feel this is a first step and we must \ncome back and find additional relief for the American worker.\n  Now, I have said many times on the floor, Mr. President, that I think \nit is better to try to bring this down to what it really means to an \naverage family. In my State, that family makes about $40,000 a year. \nWhen that family pays its current tax burden and when that family pays \nits share of the cost of Government and when that family pays its share \nof higher interest rates, they are left with about 47 percent of their \npaycheck. In other words, this year, they worked from January 1 to July \n3 for the Government, which meant that July 4 this year took on a new \nmeaning. It was not only Independence Day; it was the first day they \ngot to keep the first dime of their paycheck. Or, in other terms, it \nmeans, in my judgment, if you could conclude that an American family \nought to keep, at a minimum, two-thirds of their paycheck--it ought to \nbe more--but if you concluded, at a minimum, that American workers \nought to keep two-thirds of their paycheck, that means they are falling \n$8,000 short--this average family I am talking about--every year. Just \nthink of what that kind of resource would do for that average family's \nchecking account and the kinds of things they could do.\n  You know, we are always hearing, and we are told over and over that \nAmerican families have no savings. Why would we be surprised that they \nhave no savings, Mr. President, if the Government has been marching \nthrough their checking account taking over half of what they have? The \ndisposable income that is left can barely deal with the essentials. Why \nare we surprised that consumer debt is at an all-time high or that \nindividual bankruptcies are at an all-time high or why, in the face of \na reasonably good economy, there is still so much anxiety in middle \nAmerica? It is because we have left them with so few resources to do \nthe job we have always asked of the American family.\n  As somebody said the other day on the floor, the best department of \nhealth and human services is our own American family. But they have to \nhave the resources, instead of the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  So, Mr. President, the fact that we are refunding about $100 billion \nof the $500 billion in new taxes is a laudable step and a meaningful \nstep that will help every generation of Americans--children through the \nchild tax credits, students through the savings accounts for education \nand the tax credit, small businesses and owners of stock and people in \nretirement or who are about to go into retirement because of the \ncapital gains tax reduction and the estate tax improvements. We are \ngoing to move a flood of capital to the newest ideas because we are \ngoing to unlock billions of dollars when we lower the tax burden on \ncapital.\n  So, Mr. President, I applaud our leadership. I applaud the members of \nthe Finance and Budget Committees. I applaud the President for finally \nagreeing to sign meaningful tax relief and a balanced budget act. I \nbelieve this is good for America.\n  I have one disappointment. Mr. President, after agreeing to the tax \nproposal, the President sent a late-night letter to our leadership and \nsaid that he would veto all the tax relief for America if we include an \namendment which we passed in the Senate which would have granted a \nsavings account for families to use for elementary education and high \nschool education. That is where the problem with American education \nexists. This amendment would have allowed average families the ability \nto remove from the savings account, without being taxed, money to buy \nequipment, like computers, to hire tutors for special education needs, \nfor special transportation costs, and, yes, for tuition, if they chose \nanother school to go to. I think it is a severe loss that that \namendment had to be removed. I am here to say to the Senate and to the \nHouse and to the President that the millions of Americans who want \nassistance at the elementary and secondary level are not going to go \naway. We will come back. We will author new legislation to achieve \nthese goals focusing on elementary and secondary education. It is going \nto be a requirement if we are going to produce the knowledge in our \nyouth that will be able to lead us into the new century.\n  So, Mr. President, with that, I conclude my remarks and yield back my \ntime to the leader.\n  (Disturbance in the visitors' galleries)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, the former President pro tempore, such time as he may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope that the galleries will be cautious. \nThey are our guests, and they should understand that the Senate rules \ndo not allow demonstrations of approval or disapproval.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Might I just restate that fact, sir?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the visitors in the \ngalleries to refrain from demonstrations.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this reconciliation bill. \nIt hands out tax cuts much like adults dole out candy to pacify rowdy \nchildren. The American people are not children, and I believe that we \nunderestimate both the public's eagerness for these cuts and our \npeople's comprehension of our Nation's fiscal situation.\n  Mr. President, this is no criticism of those Senators who worked for \nthe tax cut. I accord to every Senator the right to express his own \nconvictions and his own beliefs. And I respect every Senator's \nconvictions and beliefs. I happen to differ with many of my colleagues \nin this instance. I just do not think that it is wise to have this tax \ncut. I differ with this administration in that regard. The American \npeople are not children. I have been in politics more than 51 years, \nand the easiest vote for me ever to cast is a vote to cut taxes. That \ndoesn't take courage. It doesn't take a brave man to do that. That is \neasy.\n  Let us first note that the past actions of the Congress in approving \nthe tough deficit reduction measure called OBRA in 1993 is largely \nresponsible for all but erasing the bloated and damaging deficits of \nthe 1980s. That piece of legislation and the steady economic growth we \nhave experienced over the past several years have all but brought us \ninto budget balance. The legislation we passed called OBRA in 1993 and \nthe steady economic growth that we have experienced and are still \nexperiencing are what have brought us into budget balance, almost. \nPassed without a single Republican vote--not one Senator on that side \nof the aisle, not one Republican Member of that body on the other side \nof the Capitol, not one voted for that legislation. Not one. That \npassed, as I say, only by Democratic vote. Without a single Republican \nvote, that politically unpopular measure--OBRA 1993--was the castor oil \nthat has mostly cured this Nation's serious bout with red ink disease, \nand set us on a straight course to budget balance. May I add that this \ncure has been achieved without the arsenic-laced medication of a \nbalanced budget amendment, which so many in this body had prescribed as \nthe only cure for the ailing patient. They were wrong, and we have\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\nturned the corner on our budget woes while at the same time preserving, \nat least for the moment, the checks and balances so vital to our \ncontinued life as a viable republic. But this legislation pending on \nthe Senate floor today threatens to negate our progress and throw the \nbody politic back on the critically ill list.\n  The outyear losses from the tax cuts contained in this bill could \npropel us backward in time to the irresponsible 1980's. May I note that \nwe are voting on this reconciliation bill without the benefit of the \nadministration's economic assessment of the outyear impact of these tax \ncuts. We shouldn't have to do that. We are rushing to approve these tax \ncuts in the misguided belief that the people are clamoring for tax \nrelief, regardless of the consequences for the deficit in future years.\n  Although I applaud the sincerity of those who differ with me, \nrealizing that a tax cut would be part of any deal, who have tried to \nmake those cuts more fair in their distribution, I cannot fathom the \njustification for supporting this whole package based on the meager \nbenefit that might accrue to the nonwealthy. In my view, those of us \ncharged with the responsibility to govern must take a larger view of \nour total fiscal policies and remember the lessons of the past two \ndecades.\n  I am one of the miserable few who retains the miserable memory of \nhaving voted for the tax cut that Mr. Reagan espoused when he first \nwent into office. I voted for that tax cut, and I have been kicking \nmyself in the rear ever since. I was wrong. That and the massive \nbuildup in national defense and the massive growth of entitlements. \nThese are the things that have brought upon us the ills of today, in \nlarge measure.\n\n  We are only now emerging from the crippling restrictions of a massive \ndeficit, debt which hampered our ability to invest in our Nation's \nphysical infrastructure, to repair roads and bridges, maintain the \ntreasures of our national parks, and provide basic amenities to our \npeople like clean, safe water. There are people in West Virginia who \nare lacking in that treasure of safe, clean drinking water. There are \npeople in other rural States all over this Nation who need clean, safe \nwater. They don't have it. That same deficit has also prevented \ninvestment in our people's abilities through education, training, and \nhealth policies. Before we have even paused to experience the sweet \nliberty of freedom from that crushing burden, we are eagerly engaged in \ndigging our way right back into debt through these massive back-loaded \ntax cuts.\n  Back loaded. Ah, how sweet it is, to tell the American people, ``We \nhave cut your taxes!'' Nobody likes to vote for a tax increase. I don't \nlike to do that. And there are times when we really need to cut taxes, \nbut this is not the time.\n  Since the budget has not been balanced since 1969, I guess nobody in \nthis town can bear the thought of being in balance. Without the hot \nbreath of the deficit master on our necks each and every working day, \nwe might actually be able to return to a time when we could address \nsome of our real problems in this country. We might even see a little \ncreativity and common sense come out of this city. We might have to \nlearn to plan and to be proactive about our Nation's problems instead \nof slapping on the green eyeshades every morning and focusing on the \ncomforting familiarity of the deficit devil which has become an all-\npurpose collective excuse for doing nothing much at all.\n  Before we all break out the champagne bottles and congratulate \nourselves on helping the poor, beleaguered population by making the \neasiest, no-brainer vote in all of politics--the easiest, no-brainer \nvote in all of politics, a tax cut; how easy; how easy it is--let us \nsober up for 1 minute and contemplate the obvious fact that one fairly \nsevere recession in the next several years coupled with the impact of \nthese back-loaded tax cuts will throw us right back into the deficit \ncanyon. That is all it will take.\n  Let us further jog our all-too-short memories and recall that the \nnational debt as of July 25 is a whopping $5.28 trillion. Yes. Let's \nreduce the deficit. But let us put that money on that national debt. \nFurther, I am told that the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the interest due on that debt for fiscal year 1997 is $358 \nbillion. That is just the interest due on the debt--$358 billion. That \nis $358 for every minute since the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was \nborn--$358 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. This is not \nsmall change, my colleagues. And it seems to me that even using the \nnew, new, new, new math, and without benefit of a hand-held calculator, \nanyone can see that we cannot prudently afford this tax cut.\n  So I am critical--yes--of the Republican Party for advocating this \ntax cut. I am critical--yes--of this administration and this White \nHouse, of my own political party, for advocating a tax cut at this \ntime. It is pandering to the American people. It is pure political \ndemagoguery. That is what it is, pure and simple.\n  Additionally, any informed observer of our Nation's demographic \ntrends can easily see that a low birth rate in our Nation's large and \naging baby-boom generation are fusing a fiscal time bomb steadily \nticking along on its inevitable course which will detonate in the \nsecond decade of the next century. The second decade of the next \ncentury. But who cares? Many of those of us who vote for this tax cut \ntoday will not be here. We will not be around. Some of us will be in \nour rocking chairs, enjoying retirement.\n\n  Do not count me in that crowd. We will not be to blame. Who will be \naround to blame us?\n  That time bomb could lead to a mushroom cloud, a mushroom cloud that \nspreads over the country, a cloud of returned budget deficits if we do \nnot think of ways to responsibly sap its destructive potential.\n  Mr. President, simply put, our Nation does not need and can ill-\nafford tax cuts at this time--not the tax cuts that are included in \nthis reconciliation bill, not the tax cuts promulgated in recent years \nas a result of the so-called Contract With America.\n  I did not sign on to that contract, the Contract With America. We do \nnot hear much about that contract these days, not much anymore. I never \nsigned on to that contract. Here is my ``Contract with America,'' the \nConstitution of the United States. Hallelujah! No signed contract for \nme. I signed the oath to uphold and defend this Constitution of the \nUnited States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That is my \ncontract.\n  But not any tax cut. Such tax cuts threaten to enlarge the deficit \nright at the time we are close to erasing it. Then we are going to \nbloat it again, going to blow it up again. More importantly, tax cuts \nof the sort being considered today could mushroom the deficit in the \noutyears, precisely at the time when our Nation will be graying.\n  See, I once upon a time had black hair, black as a raven's wing. Not \nanymore. I went through a graying process. And today my hair has turned \nnot to silver but to the 79th wintry snow--I should say 80 in November. \nBut precisely at the time when our Nation will be graying, and slowly \nmoving closer to the detonation of that time bomb, the explosion of \nretiring baby boomers that threatens to implode our Nation's fiscal \nhouse.\n  There can be no argument, as there was in the early 1980's, that \nthese cuts are needed for economic growth. That was the argument they \nused back in the early 1980's. We had a new President. His name was \nRonald Reagan. My people said, ``Give him a chance.'' They wrote me \nletters and postcards and said, ``Give him a chance.'' Well, against my \nown better judgment, I voted for his tax cut. In those days, we could \nargue that the cuts were needed for economic growth. That is one of the \narguments Mr. Reagan so well used.\n  We are currently in our sixth consecutive year of economic growth, \nthe stock market continues to reach record high after record high after \nrecord high. They wonder how much higher it can go. It became 4,000, \nand then it became 5,000, and then it became 6,000, then it became \n7,000, then it became 8,000. How much higher can it go? I could have \nbecome a rich man, perhaps, if I had known how to play the stock \nmarket. But I am one who remembers the stock market crash in 1929, so I \nhave been afraid, afraid of that market ever since. Unemployment \nrecently dipped below 5 percent. Think of it! And inflation has \nremained in check. The stock market has risen into the\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\nstratosphere, beyond the opening in the ozone layer.\n  Does this sound like an economy that needs a jump-start through a tax \ncut? We were on the right track in 1993. That was the right track. We \ndon't need this tax cut now. To provide a tax cut now is like \nencouraging someone who has just paid off a huge credit card debt, \ncomplete with whopping interest payments to go on a wild and \nuncontrollable shopping spree. Where is the learning curve? Where is \nthe learning curve?\n  Mr. President, it appears to this Senator that the justifications for \nthe tax cuts contained in the pending legislation do not extend beyond \nthe realm of pure unadulterated politics, pure unadulterated politics. \nTax cuts are now, as they have been in the past, the easiest vote a \nMember of this body could ever make--easiest vote. Tax cuts sell well \non the campaign trail. They make even rubber chicken taste good. They \nseem to magnetically draw checkbooks out of our coat pockets, but in \nour current fiscal situation they do not represent sound fiscal policy.\n  Tax cuts are not in the best interests of our Nation at this time. I \ncannot state that strongly enough. To fully prepare for the budget \npressures of the next century, we will need fiscal discipline as never \nbefore envisaged. We will need budget surpluses, not a teetering see-\nsaw of a balance weakened by looming, back-loaded tax cuts whose costs \ncontinue to escalate and whose effect will be to tilt the see-saw back \ntoward deficit spending. We will need to make many difficult decisions \nwith regard to Federal entitlement spending.\n  In short, Mr. President, we will need compromise on many fronts of \nour budget debate. However, if we are to be truly faithful to the \nprinciples of fiscal order and balanced budgets, and if we are going to \nbe mindful of the America that we leave to our children--we hear so \nmuch about our children--if we are truly mindful of the America that we \nleave to our children and to our grandchildren, there is no place, no \nplace for tax cuts in any compromise proposal at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my colleague's argument brings to mind a \nletter from a fellow Delawarean who reminded me of the wisdom of \nPresident Abraham Lincoln.\n  Quoting our 16th President, Mr. Robert Hall, of Hockessin, DE, \nreminded me that:\n\n       You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. \n     You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You \n     cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. * \n     * * You cannot establish sound security by spending more than \n     you earn. You cannot build character and courage by taking \n     away man's initiative and independence.\n\n  Only by keeping the economy strong can we balance the budget. And one \ncertain way to strengthen the economy is to keep our burden of taxation \nreasonable, keep it at a level that provides initiative and incentives \nfor risk-taking and thrift. History has proven that tax cuts stimulate \neconomic growth.\n  The Mellon tax cuts at the turn of the century created incredible \nprosperity for America. President Kennedy's cuts stimulated the economy \nin the 1960's, and in the 1980's, Kemp-Roth led to the longest \npeacetime economic expansion in history. Eighteen million new jobs were \ncreated, along with 4 million new businesses. Family income rose and \nhomeownership boomed as interest rates and inflation fell. At the same \ntime, Treasury revenues more than doubled, not because Americans were \npaying a higher percentage of their income to taxes, but because \nAmericans had higher incomes.\n  The truth is, Mr. President, that had Congress held the line on \nspending, the windfall to Treasury created by the Kemp-Roth tax cuts \nwould have put a stake in the heart of the deficit. However, instead of \ncontrolling its appetite to spend--something we're trying earnestly to \ndo, now, Congress shackled America with the 1990 tax increase. Then, 2 \nyears later, President Clinton imposed the largest tax increase in \nhistory on Americans.\n  With this package, we begin to reverse these trends, and history is \non our side. A responsible tax cut will strengthen the power of an \nexpanding economy for our families and Nation.\n  At the moment, the average American family pays 40 percent of its \nincome to taxes, and the current Federal system is counterproductive to \neconomic growth. It double-taxes savings, thwarts investment, hinders \nproductivity, increases prices, stifles wages, and hurts exports. It is \ncomplex and places disincentives on work.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I intend, to see this \nreconciliation package through, and then, in coming months, I intend to \nturn our attention to comprehensive tax reform. We will work for a \nfairer, simpler plan that does away with the negative consequences of \nthe current system--a plan that encourages savings and promotes \nAmerican exports. But first we must keep our promise of the tax cuts \nwe've proposed for the American people.\n  This legislation keeps that promise.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in a different vein than my colleague from \nWest Virginia, I rise to speak in strong support of this historic \nbalanced budget and tax relief agreement. On many occasions I have come \nto the floor of the Senate arguing the importance of curbing Federal \nspending and balancing the Federal budget. It is equally, if not more, \nimportant that we pass on the benefits of a balanced budget in the form \nof tax relief to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I have long been an ardent supporter of tax cuts for \nthe American people. This bill marks a very decided shift, a dramatic \nshift from the tax increases that have been prevalent over the past \ndecade. The bill before us represents the first real tax cut in 16 \nyears. It was not easy to get here. We can all remember the partisan \nbudget debates we have had in the past few years. The difference \nbetween those bills and the one before us today is the bipartisan \ncooperation that went into this year's legislation. It is because of \nunceasing bipartisan effort to end big government and the benefit of a \nstrong and vibrant economy that we can stand here today debating such \nhistoric legislation.\n  I maintain, Mr. President, that this bipartisanship developed because \nthe American people insisted on it. They reelected President Clinton, \nbut they also reelected a Republican majority in the House and Senate. \nAnd I have to say we would not even be debating a balanced budget bill, \nwe would not be debating a tax cut bill if it was not for the \nRepublican majorities in both the House and the Senate. The people who \nwe each have pledged to serve decided that both points of view were \nnecessary to get a balanced Federal budget. Congress and the President \nfinally got the message, and the American people are the beneficiaries.\n  The package before us contains a variety of tax cuts that will bring \nmuch-needed relief. These tax cuts allow the taxpayers in my home State \nof Utah and across the Nation to keep more of their hard-earned \ndollars. This bill provides significant relief through: First, a tax \ncredit for families with children; second, lower capital gains tax \nrates; third, tax incentives for education; fourth, small business \nincentives; fifth, increased savings through enhanced IRA's; and sixth, \nhigher death tax exemptions.\n  The child tax credit is especially important for America's working \nfamilies. Raising children in today's world becomes more expensive each \nyear. This family tax credit will put the tax relief where it is needed \nmost, in the pockets of parents with small children.\n  This bill also contains a number of proposals to ease the burden for \npaying for college. I hear again and again from parents in Utah and \nthroughout the country struggling to keep up with the high costs of \ncollege for their children. Mr. President, having put six children \nthrough college myself, I know exactly what they are going through. \nThis bill will help these families by providing a tax credit for \ntuition expenses, a deduction for student loan interest and a new \neducation IRA to promote saving for education. There aren't many things \nin this world that mean as much to us parents as giving our kids an \nopportunity that perhaps we didn't have or helping them to get along \nwith good education.\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\n  The bill also contains important tax cuts to stimulate economic \ngrowth and create new jobs. In the past two Congresses, I have \nintroduced legislation to cut capital gains rates in half. I am \nextremely pleased that this tax package lowers the capital gains tax \nrate in half to almost 20 percent. This historical and important change \nwill not only ease the current double taxation of capital income, it \nwill encourage more capital investment and help maintain the strong \neconomic growth that this country has experienced over the past number \nof years. In fact, ever since the original recession during the Reagan \nyears, we basically have had a good economy. We had a couple of \ndownturns during the Bush years, but the fact is, we are all still \nbenefiting from having cut the marginal tax rates from 70 percent down \nto 28 percent.\n  I might also add that a great deal of the credit should go to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth. I \nremember in those early days in the late 1970's and early 1980's there \nwere a number of us who banded together under the leadership of Bill \nRoth and Jack Kemp to advance supply-side tax cuts which have proven to \nbe successful. We are still benefiting from the cuts in those marginal \ntax rates from 70 percent down to 28 percent, still benefiting today, \nand this administration is benefiting from that. And to blame all of \nthose deficits on Reagan kind of ignores the Great Society programs, \nkind of ignores the fact that during those years Reagan got his \nmarginal tax cuts but Tip O'Neill got his great spending increases, \nand, of course, we had to increase spending on the military. \nUltimately, because of Reagan and his spending, we actually ended the \ncold war. And we have saved trillions of dollars because of that.\n  I want to pay particular tribute to my colleague from Delaware. \nWithout his leadership, we would not have this bill. We would not have \nthese tax cuts. And I have to say he has been a strong, firm, solid, \nsteady leader in these matters.\n  This capital gains tax rate reduction alone is going to prove to be \nvery beneficial to our economy. There are trillions of dollars locked \nup in capital assets in this economy because people just don't want to \npay a 28-percent top capital gains tax rate and corporations don't want \nto pay a 36-percent rate. Unfortunately, we couldn't do much for the \ncorporations this year because of the limited amount of tax cuts we \nhave negotiated with the President. But we have done a lot for the \nmillions and millions of people, now, many in the middle class--50 \npercent of whom are in the middle class--who now are getting robbed \nbecause of inflated values of their capital assets, which if they sell \nthey are paying taxes on the inflated value rather than the actual \nvalue. It wouldn't have happened but for our distinguished chairman of \nthis committee, the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, Bill Archer, and of course my friend--both friends--Bill \nRoth, as well.\n  This is important. For a long time we have made the case if we cut \ncapital gains tax rates we are actually going to get an increase in tax \nrevenues. I believe over the next 5 years that will prove to be true. \nInstead of losing actual tax revenues we ought to increase tax \nrevenues. But if all we do is break even or even slightly below \nbreaking even, it's worth it because it's the type of thing that will \nbenefit so many millions of Americans, especially those of us in the \nmiddle class who put our hard-earned savings into mutual funds or into \nother areas of the stock market or into capital assets that literally \nwill receive some benefit in the future from what is being done here \ntoday.\n  Some of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have \ncategorized the capital gains tax cut as being for the rich. This is \njust not true. The capital gains tax cuts will help any American \ninvesting in a mutual fund, owning a home, or with an IRA which invests \nin stock. These are not the rich. These are hard-working middle-class \nfamilies saving for their future and struggling to own a piece of the \nAmerican dream.\n  In addition, this bill provides much needed relief from the estate \nand gift tax. This so-called death tax is nothing more than a \npunishment for success. This tax has the damaging effect of forcing \nfamilies to sell a business or a family farm just to pay their tax \nliability. Many farms in my State of Utah have been passed on from \ngeneration to generation. Under the current estate tax, it is \ninevitable that at sometime in the future these families may be forced \nto sell these farms unless this tax is eliminated. This is one area of \nunfinished business. I hope that we can continue the process we have \nbegun here and work together in the future to further reduce this \nonerous tax on American family farms and businesses.\n  This bill also contains a number of proposals that will help small \nbusinesses. Since 1993, I have attempted to clearly define what is a \nprincipal place of business for purposes of the home office deduction. \nThis bill would clarify that definition and allow thousands of small \nbusiness men and women deduct their legitimate home office expenses.\n  In addition, this bill makes important changes to allow self-employed \nindividuals to fully deduct the cost of health insurance. The bill also \nmodifies the employee stock ownership plan rules and other pension \nprovisions that will allow more small businesses to provide employees \nwith savings and retirement benefits.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend the conferees for including \nprovisions contained in the International Tax Simplification for \nAmerican Competitiveness Act which I introduced earlier this year with \nSenator Baucus. This bill will extend the same export benefits to \nsoftware products that are available to films and other recordings. It \nwill also provide relief to U.S. financial services companies, \nincluding banks, security firms, insurance companies and brokers, and \nother finance and credit entities. The simplification and other changes \nto the most complex area of our Tax Code will enhance the global \ncompetitiveness of American products and companies.\n  Mr. President, while this bill does, in some ways, create more \ncomplexity in the Tax Code, there are a few sections that simplify \nvarious areas of our tax system. One such provision is a provision that \nI have worked hard on--exempting State and local government pension \nplans from the cumbersome pension nondiscrimination rules. This \nprovision reinforces the right that State and local governments have to \ndetermine the compensation of their employees without Federal \nGovernment intrusion.\n  Mr. President, the passage of this tax relief bill is truly historic. \nThe taxpayers in my State of Utah and across this country are deserving \nof this tax cut. They are overtaxed and over regulated. This bill \nprovides broad tax relief in many important areas.\n  The budget conference report also contains provisions to restructure \nand preserve the Medicare Program for a decade. These changes are \nnothing less than historic in nature and will help insure that Medicare \nremains solvent well beyond 2001--the date for financial insolvency for \nthe Medicare part A hospital trust fund.\n  Elderly Utahns can rest assured tonight that the Federal Government's \nhealth care commitment to them remains strong and undeterred. And, \nwhile work remains to be done, all future Medicare beneficiaries can \nrest assured that Medicare will be there as they become eligible early \nin the next century.\n  I join my colleagues in the Senate and particularly those Senators on \nthe Finance Committee, on which I serve, where this legislation was \noriginally developed and drafted.\n  We all have worked tirelessly over the past 7 months through numerous \ncommittee hearings and through countless committee meetings. We worked \nin a bipartisan fashion, resolved our differences on policy, and \nultimately developed a consensus approach to Medicare reform.\n  The effort has paid off, and the American people are the recipients \nof this great and historic dividend.\n  Nevertheless, we must also recognize--and the American people must \nrealize--that there still remains considerable work to be done with \nrespect to long-term reforms of the Medicare Program.\n  This is why I am delighted the conference report contains legislation \nI sponsored earlier this year to establish a National Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare.\n  This Commission will be comprised of 17 members who will be charged \nto\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\ndevelop recommendations to ensure the long-term fiscal health of the \nMedicare Program. Those recommendations will be completed and sent to \nCongress by March 1, 1999.\n  I have spent a great deal of time talking with my constituents in \nUtah, and I have found that one thing which matters very much to them \nis the ability to choose the health care which suits them the best.\n  Clearly, one of the most significant and dramatic changes to Medicare \nwill be the new Medicare Choice Program. Under this new program, \nMedicare beneficiaries will have the opportunity to choose from a \nvariety of private health care plan options that best suits their needs \nand preferences.\n  Such plans could include newly created provider sponsored \norganizations operated by health care providers as well as medical \nsavings accounts combined with a qualified high-deductible policy. Utah \nproviders have urged for several years that we change the law to allow \nthem the ability to band together and form provider networks, locally \nbased linkages of physicians and hospitals who will treat Medicare \npatients. That change will finally be made.\n  As a strong supporter of MSA's, I am delighted the bill contains this \nprovision even though it is a demonstration that is capped at 390,000 \nenrollees and sunsets on December 31, 2002. Nevertheless, it is an \nimportant first step that I believe will be a resounding success and \nreauthorized beyond the 2002 deadline.\n  This is an important change in Medicare which, since its inception in \n1965, has traditionally been structured as a fee-for-service plan.\n  The Senate recognizes that beneficiaries want more choice in the \nmanner in which they receive health care. With the introduction of \nmanaged care into the private sector, seniors are increasingly \ninterested in participating in managed care plans which offer greater \nbenefits such as prescription drugs and eye and hearing care.\n  The conference report we are passing today will give seniors that \nchoice. But it will do so without jeopardizing anyone's right or desire \nto remain in the traditional fee-for-service program.\n  Moreover, we have incorporated protections and safeguards to ensure \nthat those seniors who choose to participate in a managed care plan \nwill have the necessary consumer protections such as access to \nemergency services 24 hours a day as well as appropriate appeals and \ngrievance procedures.\n  Another key interest of Utahns is the necessity of providing cost-\neffective, high-quality care for our seniors and disabled who must \navail themselves of either nursing home care or home health services. I \nam particularly delighted the report contains important and necessary \nchanges in the manner in which the Federal Government finances skilled \nnursing home and home health care services.\n  I have long advocated for the establishment of a prospective payment \nsystem, or PPS as it is referred to, for home health and skilled \nnursing care. I have introduced legislation--S. 913, the Home Health \nCare Prospective Payment Act of 1997 and S. 914, the Skilled Nursing \nFacility Prospective Payment Act of 1997--to accomplish this objective. \nThe major components of that legislation are contained in the \nconference agreement we will approve today.\n  The implementation of a PPS will help address the extraordinary \nescalation in program costs associated with home health and nursing \ncare. These two programs are the fastest growing components of Medicare \nand efforts are necessary to address program growth without \njeopardizing quality or access to care.\n  Accordingly, I am delighted the report before us today incorporates \nmany of the provisions in my bills including the implementation of a \nprospective payment system.\n  With respect to the $5 copayment for home health care services \noriginally contained in the Senate bill, I am pleased the final \nconference report does not contain this provision. While I recognize \nthe need to place controls on utilization, I believe the most cost-\neffective approach is through a prospective payment system which we now \nhave in place.\n  The legislation will also provide Medicare beneficiaries with new and \nenhanced health care benefits.\n  I am particularly pleased that annual mammography screening, \nscreening for prostate and colorectal cancer, diabetes self-management, \nand expansion of immunizations will be phased in and available to \nbeneficiaries.\n  In this regard, I am especially pleased that the conference report \ncontains a provision I raised in the Finance Committee to eliminate the \nx-ray requirement as a condition of Medicare coverage for chiropractic \nservices.\n  Affording seniors greater access to chiropractic services will not \nonly result in reduced Medicare expenditures, in the context of total \nprogram costs, but will also reduce needless back surgery for countless \nsenior citizens.\n  Mr. President, I would like to turn now to another provision, the \nneed for which was brought to my attention by Ms. Michelle Newport, a \nChristian Scientist in Salt Lake City, UT.\n  Under several provisions of Medicare and Medicaid law, reimbursement \nhas been authorized for literally decades for nonmedical hospital and \nskilled nursing facility services provided in sanitoria operated by the \nFirst Church of Christ, Scientist.\n  The need for reexamination of these statutory provisions was pointed \nout when the current law was challenged successfully last year in the \ncase of Children's Healthcare Is a Legal Duty (CHILD) versus Vladeck. \nIn this case, a Minnesota district court held that the law and their \naccompanying regulations violate the establishment clause of the \nConstitution as an inpermissible sectarian preference. Pursuant to that \ncourt decision, the Secretary was enjoined from further implementation; \nhowever through the efforts of a number of Members of Congress who \ndisagreed with this ruling, including House Judiciary Committee \nChairman Hyde, Senator Kennedy, and myself, the court's injunction has \nbeen stayed until August 1997.\n  The provision included in the bill we are considering today is \nintended to address our concern over that ruling. It has been drafted \nto be sect neutral. It replaces existing law by providing for \nreimbursement of nursing services to individuals who decline \nconventional coverage due to sincerely held religious beliefs. The \nprovision sets up conditions for coverage of religious nonmedical \nhealth care institutions under the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, with \nnew mechanisms to ensure cost-control of the benefit.\n  I want to thank Senator Roth and Chairman Archer, and especially \ntheir staffs, for their hard work in crafting a provision which meets \nthe twin concerns of cost-control and constitutionality. I would also \nlike to pay special recognition to Gioia Bonmartini of the Finance \nCommittee staff, and Dean Rosen of the Ways and Means Committee staff, \nwho worked so hard to make certain an acceptable provision was included \nin the conference agreement.\n  With respect to the delivery of health care in rural America, I am \npleased the report contains provisions I sponsored in the Senate to \nincrease the level of Medicare managed care payments for rural areas of \nthe country. The report provides a minimum payment amount of $367 in \n1998 that will be updated annually by the growth in Medicare fee-for-\nservice payments.\n  Implementation of this provision, although extremely technical in \nnature, has been a key objective of Utah's managed care community, \nwhich will now have the incentives to develop and offer managed care \nplans in more rural communities.\n  Before I close my discussion of the health care provisions contained \nwithin this legislation, I want to take a few moments to address one of \nthe most important components of the conference agreement, the new \nchild health initiative.\n  As my colleagues are aware, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the \nChild Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act [CHILD] on April 8. Now, \nonly 114 days later, we are giving final approval to a substantial new \nprogram which is very similar to the Hatch/Kennedy bill.\n  The CHILD bills, S. 525 and S. 526, proposed a program which is \nextremely similar to that which is contained in the conference \nagreement we are considering today. The CHILD bills, as with the \nconference agreement, proposed a State-run block grant program to \nprovide health insurance services to\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\nlow-income children. The program was to be financed by a cigarette \nexcise tax. Eligibility is to be determined by the States, cost-sharing \nis limited for the lowest income, and coverage cannot be provided to \nthose who are currently eligible for Medicaid, all provisions contained \nwithin our legislation.\n  It is no secret to Members of this body that the United States has a \ndeplorable record in making certain that our Nation's most vulnerable, \nour children, have access to health care services. By many estimates, \nover 10 million of our children are uninsured. That is a situation \nwhich must be corrected, and I am pleased, indeed thrilled, that the \nconference agreement contains this new program.\n  At this point, I would like to insert a summary of the new provisions \nfor the edification of my colleagues.\n\n       Funding level: Provides $24 billion in the first 5 years, \n     and $24 billion in the next 5 years. Note: the funding levels \n     add up to $39.65 billion over the next 10 years because \n     certain Medicaid costs have been taken off the top.\n       Tobacco tax: Program starts in fiscal year 1998. It is \n     financed in part through a tobacco excise tax increase. There \n     is no increase in the first 2 years. For the next 2 years, \n     there is a 10 cents/pack increase. In the fifth year, fiscal \n     year 2002, and thereafter, the tax is increased by 15 cents/\n     pack.\n       Use of funds: Funds can be used for State block grants, or \n     expanded Medicaid, or both. Funding can be provided for \n     community-based health delivery systems, such as Community \n     Health Centers. The funds cannot be used for any other \n     purpose than those enunciated in the bill.\n       Funding distribution: Funds are distributed by a formula \n     which is initially based on the number of low-income \n     uninsured children in the State and in subsequent years \n     blended with the number of children in the State. There is a \n     geographical adjustment for the costs of providing services. \n     No State will get less than $2 million/year. Funds are made \n     available for 3 years, and unused funds can be redistributed \n     among other States.\n       Medicaid: If a State chooses to insure new children not now \n     eligible for Medicaid under Medicaid, they may receive \n     increased Federal matching equal to 30 percent of the State \n     share, with an 85 percent cap on the Federal contribution.\n       Secretarial approval of plan: A detailed process is laid \n     out for submission of the State plan, or amendments thereto. \n     Secretarial approval is deemed unless she notifies the State \n     within 90 days that it is disapproved.\n       Eligibility: States determine eligibility. Generally, \n     children can be covered up to age 19 and at 200 percent of \n     Federal poverty level. However, States which currently are at \n     that coverage level may expand their programs up to 250 \n     percent of FPL. Covered children cannot be eligible for \n     Medicaid now and cannot be covered now under group health \n     plans.\n       State responsibility: States must show they are: (1) trying \n     to cover Medicaid eligibles first; (2) not substituting the \n     new plan for current group health plan coverage; (3) covering \n     Indian eligibles. States will be required to enunciate \n     strategic objectives and performance goals, submit an annual \n     report, and be subject to regular evaluations as to \n     effectiveness of the plan.\n       Benefits package: States must provide coverage which is \n     either equivalent to a benchmark package or a equivalent to a \n     benchmark-equivalent package, and they can provide even more \n     from a long list of services, which includes transportation \n     costs, mental health, home care and dental. The benchmark \n     package is either: (1) FEHBP-equivalent coverage, which is \n     Blue Cross/Blue Shield standard option for a preferred \n     provider organization; or (2) a plan generally made available \n     to State employees; or (3) the largest commercial, non-\n     Medicaid HMO in the State. The benchmark equivalent package: \n     (1) Is actuarially equivalent to one of the benchmark plans; \n     and (2) covers the following basic services: Inpatient/\n     outpatient; Physicians surgical and medical; Lab and x ray; \n     Well-baby and well-child care; including immunizations. The \n     State may also get approval from the Secretary to offer other \n     coverage. Current non-Medicaid State plans in New York, \n     Florida and Pennsylvania are grandfathered in.\n       Cost-sharing: The amounts must be published in the State \n     plan, and imposed under a public schedule. Variations based \n     on family income should not disadvantage lower income \n     families. No cost-sharing for preventive services. If the \n     child has income below 150 percent of Federal poverty level \n     [FPL], the State may not impose a premium above that which \n     would have been charged under Medicaid, and any deductible or \n     other cost-sharing must be nominal, as in Medicaid.\n       Maintenance of effort: States cannot change their Medicaid \n     eligibility standards in effect as of June 1, 1997.\n       Abortion: Abortion coverage is specifically precluded, \n     except for rape, incest or life of the mother cases.\n\n  Mr. President, I am extremely proud of this legislation. I think that \na number of important modifications have been made to the final \nconference agreement, changes which improve the measure and which will \ngive the States the flexibility they need to operate the program in a \nmost efficient manner.\n  I will say, though, that I am disappointed at the Congressional \nBudget Office's estimates that the bill will only cover 3.4 million \nchildren, 1.38 million of whom were previously insured. It is no secret \nthat I have been critical of the CBO's earlier estimates which I felt \nwere too low in terms of children covered. I still believe this is the \ncase, and am hopeful that with the flexibility provisions added for the \nGovernors we will be able to cover even more children.\n  As many have noted, this will be the most important new program to \nhelp our Nation's children since enactment of the Medicaid Program over \n30 years ago. I am extremely proud to have played a role in its \ndevelopment.\n  For not only will the bill help provide children with the health \ninsurance they need, it will play the dual role of discouraging them \nfrom smoking or using other tobacco products, by increasing the tobacco \nexcise tax.\n  During this debate, which was often contentious, I asked my \ncolleagues, ``Who do you want to help, Joe camel or Joey?'' Sometimes \nit didn't seem clear. But at long last, the Camel is losing, and that \nis a tremendous benefit for public health.\n  I do want to take this opportunity to thank those who united behind \nthis effort, and especially the six Republicans who joined me in \ndrafting the original child health legislation: Senators Jeffords, \nStevens, Snowe, Collins, Campbell, and Smith. I also want to pay \nespecial tribute to two Senators who were extremely supportive along \nthe way, Senators DeWine and D'Amato, who played a crucial role in \nsupporting this legislation when support was sorely needed.\n  It is important to note the tremendous leadership role that Senator \nLott played in making certain this provision was incorporated in the \nfinal agreement. He is a true friend of our Nation's children. Finance \nCommittee Chairman Roth must also be praised for his dedication to \nchildren's health and toward working out a compromise with the House, \nand his capable staff Dennis Smith and Julie James deserve especial \nrecognition, as does Howard Cohen of the House Commerce Committee \nstaff.\n  Of course, no list would be complete without mentioning Senator \nChafee, who did so much to advance this debate by pointing out the need \nto maintain a strong Medicaid Program and make certain it is enhanced \nas we expand children's health funding.\n  Strong partners in this cause are Senator Daschle, who stood up for \nchildren's health when his national leaders would not, and Senator \nMoynihan, who played a crucial role on the Finance Committee. Senator \nRockefeller, again, must be noted for his dedication to this cause, and \nfor assuming a strong voice of reason role when cooler heads did not \nprevail.\n  And finally, I must pay tribute to my partner in this legislation, \nSenator Kennedy. He is the most aggressive and successful legislator I \nknow. And I am proud that when we can unite on a bill, everyone knows \nit will be a very good bill. Because the products of our legislative \nliaison always represent the center.\n  Mr. President, in adopting this legislation today, we are \nrepresenting our constituents, the large majority of which time and \ntime again have signaled they want to do more for children's health. \nThat day is here.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to vote for this \nimportant tax bill.\n  I, again, want to express my appreciation, love, and respect for the \ndistinguished chairman of this committee and the distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, and the concomitant leaders \nin the Ways and Means Committee in the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for the \ngenerous comments the distinguished Senator from Utah had about me. I \nhave enjoyed working with him on this most important matter.\n  At this time I would like to make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might seek recognition before the \nSenator from Delaware makes that point?\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I am looking for my Democratic counterpart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator can yield to himself whatever time he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have reached a historic juncture. Our \nNation has not had a balanced budget since fiscal year 1969, the last \nbudget year of President Lyndon Johnson's tenure. The budget deficit \nbegan to grow under President Nixon, rose to $74 billion during the \nrecession we faced under President Ford, dipped and then steadied under \nPresident Carter, until recession hit again and pushed the deficit to \nnearly $80 billion. Then it ballooned to more than $200 billion after \nthe Reagan tax cuts in the early 1980's. It declined to around $150 \nbillion, then skyrocketed during the recession under President Bush. \nQuite a roller coaster ride; all of it in red ink.\n  Many of us believed we could meet our responsibility to live within \nour means while helping our economy to move forward. What we needed was \nleadership, not only in the White House but on Capitol Hill. When \nPresident Clinton arrived, the deficit stood at an all-time high of \n$290 billion. The economy was in stall. It was not mere luck which has \ngiven us 7 years of economic growth and a declining deficit. Many \ncircumstances are beyond the control of any political leader, but \nleaders can make a difference.\n  President Clinton set a course for economic growth and spending \nreduction and invited the Nation to follow. It was difficult medicine: \nTax increases for those who had benefited most from the tax breaks of \nthe 1980s, spending reductions in programs most Americans support, \ntargeted tax relief for working families, and targeted investments in \nprograms that would strengthen the Nation.\n  Congress took the decisive and difficult step of passing President \nClinton's deficit reduction and economic growth package. It was a \npolitically costly step. It cost many Members their political lives. \nUnfortunately, not a single Republican supported the President's plan \nand it passed in this Chamber only when Vice President Gore cast the \ntie-breaking vote. But it laid the groundwork for the budget package \nbefore us.\n  The difficult votes some of us cast in 1993 helped to produce a \nstrong, growing economy with a Federal budget deficit that has declined \nsteadily. The deficit was $290 billion when the President took office. \nIt is conservatively estimated to be $67 billion this year, and could \nend up below $40 billion. Deficit reduction and targeted investment \nstimulated economic expansion, which created more revenue and produced \nmore deficit reduction, so that now some people really anticipate the \npossibility that we will achieve a balanced budget as early as next \nyear. When we considered President Clinton's plan, it was called a \ndeficit reduction plan. No one dreamed that it would end up being a \nbalanced budget plan. To the surprise of most economists, that \npossibility is within our grasp, even this year.\n  All of this occurred because of President Clinton's leadership and \nthe support of the Democrats in Congress in 1993. We can be proud of \nthese achievements. We can take some satisfaction in knowing that our \nhard work in 1993 made it possible for another exercise of leadership \nin 1997, to produce this balanced budget resolution. We can also take \nsome satisfaction in knowing the economy is strong. Look at the report \ncard. Unemployment and inflation, the combined rate, 8.7 percent, the \nbest since President Lyndon Johnson.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for \njust a moment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wonder, and I apologize again and thank him for \nyielding, I wonder if I might make a unanimous consent--or just note \nthe absence of a quorum in order to consult with the distinguished \nSenator?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I was speaking before the call of the quorum about the economic \nreport card that we can point to with pride that we have 2.8 percent \nannual average inflation, the best since President Kennedy; 12.1 \nmillion new jobs in this period of time, the best ever; 1.1 million new \nconstruction jobs, the best since President Harry Truman; a 14-percent \nincrease in consumer confidence, the best since President Eisenhower. \nThe list goes on and on.\n  This budget agreement that we consider today continues the fiscal \nresponsibility that we have shown since 1993. It includes the spending \ncuts we need to balance the budget by 2002 and sets the stage for \ncontinued balanced budgets beyond 2002.\n  What this budget package shows is that the two parties can work \ntogether to make the necessary choices to balance the budget and \naddress the needs of the American people.\n  Is this the budget that I would have written? No, I would have \nchanged a lot of the provisions. This is probably not the budget that \nany single Member of this body would have written, but it is a credible \neffort, a reasonable compromise. It is worthy of our support. No \ncompromise is perfect, but this package will give many Illinois working \nfamilies much-needed help in paying for the cost of raising kids and \nsending them to college. It addresses today's economic needs and \nrealities, whether it is paying for day care, braces, health insurance, \nfor kids or college tuition.\n  In addition to providing fairness for working families, it provides \nfairness for seniors, extending the Medicare Program with reforms that \nprotect the most vulnerable. It eliminates some provisions adopted on \nthe Senate floor which would have raised, for example, the Medicare \neligibility age from 65 to 67 over a 20-year period of time, and it \naddresses the concern that farmers and small businessowners should be \nable to pass on their business and their farm to their children without \na great estate tax responsibility.\n  The spending bill that we consider preserves the budget and \nstrengthens the Medicare Program. The Republican Contract With America, \nwhich was considered several years ago by Speaker Gingrich and many \nRepublicans Senators supported, would have cut $270 billion out of \nMedicare over 7 years, a massive cutback in Medicare that would have \nimposed excessive new burdens on our Nation's seniors. This budget \npackage cuts $115 billion over 5 years, without excessive new burdens \non seniors.\n  It extends the solvency of Medicare for 10 years, keeping our word to \nseniors to keep this program strong. It limits the increased burdens on \nour elderly seniors who live on limited incomes and are already paying \na large portion of their incomes in medical costs.\n  It allows for increased numbers of Medicare health plan choices for \nour seniors, especially in rural areas. It includes a new package of \npreventive benefits, including annual mammograms, diabetes self-\nmanagement, and prostate colorectal cancer screening.\n  It also includes nearly $1 billion in new spending for rural health \ninitiatives.\n  When it comes to Medicaid, this is also a good agreement. The \nRepublican proposal in 1995 would have cut $163 billion from the \nMedicaid Program over 7 years. That would have risked the health of \nseniors, children, and pregnant women who count on Medicaid for basic \nhealth care and for many seniors' long-term care. This budget cuts only \n$13 billion from Medicaid over 5 years. We have balanced the budget \nwithout jeopardizing the safety net for Americans who lack health \ninsurance.\n  This agreement marks a historic commitment to our Nation's children. \nThe package sets aside $24 billion for children's health insurance. \nOver 10 million of our children are currently uninsured. This bill \ncould help up to 7 million of these children become insured. I am \ncertain that in so doing, it will take a great burden off the minds of \nmany working families who don't earn enough money to be able to pay for \nhealth insurance today or don't have a benefits package at work that \nprovides health insurance for their families.\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\n  The one thing this budget package does, which I think is long \noverdue, is it provides funding to restore the unfair welfare reform \nprovisions that would otherwise cut off SSI legal immigrants who are \nplaying by the rules and paying their taxes but have become disabled or \nmay become disabled in the future. Without this budget agreement, over \n22,000 elderly or disabled legal immigrants in my State of Illinois \nwould face the loss of their SSI in October. For many of them, this is \ntheir only form of support. I supported the welfare reform bill, but I \nagreed with President Clinton that this was one provision that needed \nto be corrected. This agreement, this bill, will correct it.\n  This agreement also commits $3 billion to assist welfare recipients \nto move into work slots. The basic principle of welfare reform was that \nable-bodied adults should be put back to work. This assistance helps \nthe States accomplish that goal. The Republican budget in 1995 would \nhave imposed devastating spending cuts in education, environmental \nprotection and crime prevention, but this budget protects the \nPresident's priorities in those areas, and the agreement on which this \nis based calls for a substantial increase in education funding.\n  The tax-cut bill offers valuable tax relief to millions of working \nfamilies, with a net tax cut of around $95 billion over the next 5 \nyears, tax cuts that are direct dividends of the 1993 budget bill.\n  This package includes a $500-per-child tax credit for children under \nthe age of 17, beginning in 1999, with a $400 credit in 1998. The \ncredit will be calculated before the earned-income tax credit to \nmaintain the valuable work incentives associated with that credit, and \nit would be refundable against the payroll tax for larger families that \nface the great expense of raising the next generation.\n  This credit, which costs $85 billion over 5 years, is the largest tax \ncut in this package and one of its most important investments. An \nestimated 13 million children in families earning less than $30,000 \nwill receive this valuable assistance which they can use to pay for day \ncare, braces, or any other expenses the family faces, or to save for \nthe future. This child credit begins to phase out for individuals \nearning $75,000 and couples making $110,000, higher than the President \nsought. More importantly, some families earning as little as $18,000 \nwho pay payroll taxes but little or no taxes would also qualify, which \nRepublicans have resisted.\n  Education tax credits: This tax cut package also includes the \nPresident's education tax credit proposal, which I strongly supported. \nWith a value of $40 billion over 5 years, it constitutes the largest \nincrease in Federal education assistance since the GI bill after World \nWar II.\n  This package contains everything President Clinton asked for in \neducational tax benefits. If we as a society want to show our youth the \nvalue we place on education, we need to invest in education. This \npackage does that, with tax relief for college tuition costs and \nincreases in spending for scholarship grants, literacy programs, and \nstudent loans.\n  This measure includes $31 billion over 5 years that will allow \nmiddle-income families to receive up to $1,500 in tax credits to offset \nthe cost of the first 2 years of college. Families will be able to take \nthe credit against the first $1,000 of costs, plus half of the next \n$1,000 of costs. Juniors, seniors, and part-time students can take a \ncredit of 20 percent of the first $5,000 of costs, to help families \nafford the continuing costs of higher education.\n  In addition, there are $9 billion of other education tax incentives, \nincluding an extension of the exemption for employer-paid undergraduate \ntuition, which allows companies to help their employees improve their \nskills and knowledge.\n  Estate tax: The estate tax exemption for farmers and small businesses \nwill be increased to $1.3 billion next year. This would allow family \nfarmers and family-owned businesses to pass down the fruits of their \nhard work to their children and grandchildren. The estate tax will also \nbe raised gradually for all other Americans, to $1 million over the \nnext 10 years, which recognizes the effects of inflation on the \nexisting exemption.\n  Capital gains from home sales: For many families without children or \nwhose children have grown, the most important tax break in this bill \nmay be the capital gains exclusion for up to $500,000 in profits on the \nsale of a home. This will help retirees who want to move to a smaller \nhome without adverse tax consequences.\n  Improvements: There are a number of improvements in this bill over \nthe original Republican plans: The extension of the airline ticket tax \nhas been improved. Capital gains will not be indexed for inflation, a \nGOP proposal that would have mainly benefited the most wealthy of \nAmericans and would have created enormous pressure on the budget in \nfuture years. Also gone is a GOP demand to pay less than the minimum \nwage to people who move from welfare to subsidized public and nonprofit \njobs, and to deny coverage under worker-protection laws.\n  Flaws: Unfortunately, the tax cut bill has a number of flaws.\n  The bill waits far too long to increase the tax deduction for health \ninsurance for self-employed people to 100 percent. I have worked to \ngive farmers and small businessowners parity with the corporations they \ncompete with. Corporations can take a 100-percent deduction for health \ninsurance premiums. The self-employed should be able to do the same. \nThis bill does not move the deduction to 50 percent until the year 2000 \nand waits until 2007 to provide a 100-percent deduction. We can do \nbetter than that.\n  The conferees also dropped the extension of the ethanol excise tax \nincentive. I will continue to work for this important measure as part \nof the highway reauthorization bill.\n  The cigarette tax increase--which would discourage our young people \nfrom beginning a lifelong tobacco addiction--was reduced and delayed to \nthe year 2000.\n  And we must be vigilant in monitoring the impact of some of the tax \ncuts in future years beyond 2002, because some of the provisions that \nprimarily benefit investors and the wealthy could explode in costs in \nthe coming decade. We could have better used that money for provisions \nlike the self-employed health insurance deduction and the ethanol \nincentive.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  On balance, both the spending cut package and the tax cut package are \nworthy of support. They will balance the budget without putting an \nundue burden on our most vulnerable people, take some important steps \nto address problems such as the lack of health insurance among our \nchildren, and give tax relief to working families who need it most. I \nam pleased to support this package.\n\n\n                             POINT OF ORDER\n\n  Mr. President, at this point, I raise a point of order that section \n1604(f)(3) of the bill, H.R. 2014, contains provisions that produce no \nchange in outlays or revenues during the required period of time and, \ntherefore, violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974.\n  The provision which I make reference to would automatically assume \nthat the tobacco tax increase, which is part of this bill, would be \ncredited on behalf of the tobacco companies as part of any settlement \nthat might be reached by Congress at a later date. This is a $50 \nbillion windfall for the tobacco companies, which would absolve them \nfrom responsibilities which they have publicly said that they will \nassume.\n  This $50 billion would be taken out of programs that we think are \nnecessary for public health, including enforcement of the agreement, \npublic information campaign, smoking cessation clinics and the like.\n  So, Mr. President, I raise my point of order at this time.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to waive all points of order against \nthe bill that lie under section 313 of the Budget Act. I do so because \nI rise in opposition to this point of order. The provision in question \nwas agreed to at the leadership level in the context of the budget \nnegotiations, and I have to point out that if this point of order \nsucceeds, it will delay the bill and, once again, Congress and the \nSenate, in particular, would send the wrong message to the American \npeople.\n  By delaying the action, if this point of order were to succeed, it \nwould mean\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\nthe legislation would have to be returned to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, acted upon there, before it could return here. I think \nthat is a delay that the Senate does not seek to choose.\n  I do not believe that we should delay this historic opportunity that \nis within our grasp and, for procedural reasons, I intend to vote \nagainst this point of order and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I say that in the judgment of this \nSenator, the section that the distinguished Senator from Illinois \nwishes to remove is a meaningless provision, with no binding effect. I \npoint out that the administration has agreed to it, and I offer the \ncounsel, unsolicited but certainly well meaning, to my friend from \nIllinois, that if he feels he has an important issue here, may I \nsuggest to him the issue would be a lot more salient in the months and \nyears to come if it is in a statute. It can emerge and we can discuss \nit at that time. So I join the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator Durbin's point of order \nunder the Byrd Rule, which would strike from the tax legislation what \nshould be called the ``Joe Camel Tobacco Loophole.''\n  This loophole will allow the tobacco industry to credit the new 15-\ncent cigarette tax against the $368 billion it must pay in injury \nclaims and other health expenses under the so-called ``global \nsettlement.''\n  Over the next ten years, the loophole would add a $16 billion tax \nbreak for the tobacco industry, which peddles in deadly products that \nalready addict 50 million Americans, and cost society $100 billion \nannually in medical expenses and lost productivity.\n  The tobacco industry was also able to water down the 20-cent increase \nin the cigarette tax to fund children's health, despite the fact that \nit had overwhelming public support and passed the Senate last month by \na vote of 80 to 19.\n  The lesson is clear. Joe Camel still prowls the halls of Congress. \nWhen tobacco issues are discussed in the light of day, the American \npeople win. When the debate moves into the back rooms, the tobacco \nindustry's interests come first, and the public interest comes last.\n  It's time that Congress stood up to the tobacco industry and said \n``no'' to Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. This tobacco loophole has no \nplace in this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin \npoint of order.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \nmotion to waive the Byrd rule.\n  Mr. President, this has been a long budget process and we are near \ncompletion of these important bills. However we are still in the midst \nof a battle to save our kids from the health hazards and addiction of \ntobacco. This battle has just started. However, there are some in \nCongress who are hijacking this budget reconciliation process in an \nattempt to give the tobacco industry the upper hand in legislation \nimplementing a global settlement of claims against the tobacco \nindustry.\n  We cannot allow this to happen. That is why I am opposing this motion \nto waive the Byrd rule. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois has raised a point of order to a provision in the tax bill \nconference report that would credit the tobacco industry toward \npayments due on any legislative settlement with the revenue raised by \nthe tobacco tax. This is ridiculous. This revenue is targeted toward \nchildren's health in this package. You can't have two uses for one \nrevenue source.\n  This is simply a nonsensical device designed to give yet another \nbreak to the tobacco lobby. Well, I will do everything I can to prevent \nthis from happening in a global settlement.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH.

It was debatable, but time has been yielded \nback.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was seeking recognition during the \ncourse of debate. Does that give me----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois does not control the \ntime. The time is under the control of the two bill managers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

On this vote the yeas are 78, \nthe nays are 22. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to, and the point \nof order falls.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I applaud the Republican leadership as \nwell as the administration for putting together this tax bill, which is \nan integral component of the overall plan to balance the Federal \nbudget. While I have not been an enthusiastic supporter of tax cuts at \nthis time, there are provisions in this bill that I have vigorously \nsought to have enacted, and which will significantly help the people in \nmy home State of Rhode Island, as well as the entire country.\n  The centerpiece of the tax bill is the $500 per child tax credit. For \na married couple with two children that's an extra $1,000 for them to \nspend as they see fit.\n  The bill also includes several provisions that help families meet the \ncost of sending their children to college. Under the bill, low- and \nmiddle-income families can qualify for income tax credits of up to \n$1,500 to offset the cost of college tuition. To help families save for \neducation expenses, the bill establishes education savings accounts. \nContributions to these accounts are not tax deductible, but \ndistributions are tax-free if used for tuition, room and board \nexpenses.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees chose to include an extension of \nthe tax break afforded to employer-provided education. Under current \nlaw, an\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nemployee is not taxed on amounts paid by an employer for educational \nassistance. The exclusion is limited to $5,250 annually. The anecdotal \nevidence indicates that this fringe benefit is most often utilized by \nlower income workers as a way to develop the skills necessary to land \nbetter paying jobs.\n  This budget agreement includes several provisions that will encourage \nsavings and investment. The most important of those provisions is the \nreduction in the tax rate on capital gains. The bill lowers the top \nrate on capital gains from 28 to 20 percent. For lower income \nindividuals the rate on capital gains is reduced to 10 percent. At the \nturn of the century, the capital gains tax rate will be reduced further \nto 18 and 8 percent, respectively, for investors willing to hold their \ninvestments for at least 5 years.\n  Last year, Congress created the work opportunity tax credit [WOTC] as \na way to encourage employers to hire economically disadvantaged \nindividuals. These are individuals who have little or no job skills and \nas a result are not attractive candidates for employment. The WOTC \nProgram provides employers an income tax credit for a portion of the \nfirst year's wages paid to these individuals. The bill before us \nextends this program through June of next year.\n  More importantly, this bill makes two improvements to the WOTC \nProgram. First, the bill creates a two-tiered credit to make it easier \nfor employers to utilize the program. This is necessary because many \nemployers were finding it difficult to retain these employees for the \nfull work requirement period, namely 400 hours, and as a result were \nlosing the benefits of the tax credit. In many cases the employers were \nspending the money to train the employees only to have them leave \nshortly thereafter for higher paying jobs. Without some reward for \ntheir efforts, employers were simply dropping their programs.\n  Under the new structure, employers would be eligible for a reduced \ncredit if the employee works for at least 120 hours, even if the \nemployee fails to meet the full 400 work hour requirement.\n  The second change makes the work opportunity tax credit available to \ndisabled individuals receiving SSI payments. These individuals were \ninexplicably excluded from participation when the WOTC Program was \ncreated last year, and I am glad this bill corrects that error.\n  The agreement also includes two important provisions for small \nbusiness men and women. It delays the implementation of the electronic \nfunds tax payment system for 6 months to give businesses more time to \nget used to this new manner of paying their tax bills.\n  The legislation also makes it easier for self-employed individuals \nwho work at home to take an income tax deduction for that portion of \nthe home used exclusively for business purposes.\n  The bill also includes the repeal of the excise tax imposed upon boat \ndiesel fuel. This tax, and the dyeing regime imposed by Treasury, has \nwreaked havoc with boaters across the country. It caused many retailers \nto choose between selling to recreational or selling to commercial boat \nowners, with the recreational boaters usually being left without \nservice. This led to shortages in many parts of the country and \nnumerous cases wee reported in which recreational boaters had to go far \nout of their way or travel many additional hours to obtain fuel \nlegally.\n  Finally, I am very pleased that this bill includes a version of \nlegislation I authored that creates a powerful new tax incentive to \nencourage individuals to preserve open space. A serious environmental \nproblem facing the country today is the loss of open space to \ndevelopment. All across the country, farms, ranches, forests, and \nwetlands are forced to give way to the pressures for new office \nbuildings, shopping malls and housing developments.\n  America is losing over 4 square miles of land to development every \nday. In Rhode Island, over 11,000 acres of farmland have been lost to \ndevelopment since 1974. These open spaces improve the quality of life \nfor Americans throughout this great Nation and provide important \nhabitat for fish and wildlife.\n  In many instances, the loss of open space is simply the natural \noutgrowth of urbanization of our society. Other times it is the direct \nresult of improper planning at the State and local levels.\n  But frequently, the problem is created by the Federal estate tax. For \nthose families where undeveloped land represents a significant portion \nof the estate's total value, the need to pay the tax creates powerful \npressure to develop or sell off part or all of the land or to liquidate \nthe timber resources on the land. Because land is appraised by the \nInternal Revenue Service according to its highest and best use, and \nsuch use is often its development value, the effect of the tax is to \nmake retention of undeveloped land nearly impossible.\n  The bill begins to address the problem caused by the estate tax. The \nbill includes a proposal that is modeled after legislation I introduced \nearlier this year along with Senators Baucus and Gregg. It excludes 40 \npercent of the value of land subject to a conservation easement from \nthe estate and gift taxes.\n\n  In order to target the incentives under this bill to those areas that \nare truly at risk for development, the bill is limited to land that \nfalls within a 25-mile radius of a metropolitan area, a national park \nor a national wilderness area, or within 10 miles of an urban national \nforest.\n  Of course, as is the case with all major bills, there are a few \nprovisions in this agreement that I do not support. One such provision \nis the restructured aviation trust fund taxes.\n  As my colleagues know, currently the aviation trust fund is \nprincipally financed by a 10 percent ticket tax. High-cost airlines--\nthe so-called big seven--have been lobbying Congress for the past 2 \nyears to restructure the aviation trust fund revenues. The big seven \nargue that they want to restructure the fees so that the burdens of \nfunding the Federal Aviation Administration are more fairly allocated. \nBut this proposal does not do that. In reality, it is a thinly veiled \nattempt to shift a portion of their costs to other airlines--\nprincipally low-fare airlines.\n  Let me expose the folly of this new system. The big seven would have \nus believe that their system--which is more or less the proposal \nadopted by the conferees--is grounded in fairness. Yet, this new system \ndoes nothing to address the huge loophole under which they avoid paying \nthe tax on their international flights.\n  Let me explain. If Continental Airlines flies from Los Angeles to New \nYork, stops for less than 12 hours, and then continues on to London, \nthe new fee structure does not apply to that flight. In other words, \nthe passengers on that flight do not pay the 7.5 percent ticket tax, \nnor do they pay the new head tax, notwithstanding the fact that this \nflight clearly utilizes the services of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration as it flies completely across the country.\n  It is particularly regrettable that the conferees have chosen to \nimplement this new fee structure prior to the issuance of the report \nfrom the commission Congress established to study this matter. In \nOctober 1996 Congress directed that a commission be formed to assess \nthe FAA's funding needs and the costs imposed on the system by each \nsegment of the aviation industry. This report was originally scheduled \nfor completion in April 1997, but its issuance was delayed until \nSeptember. It is incomprehensible to me that the conferees would agree \nto take the unusual step of changing the makeup of the ticket tax \nbefore the commission's report was received.\n  Mr. President, this is one aspect of this budget agreement that I \nhope we will revisit once the commission's report is received and can \nbe reviewed.\n  I also oppose the agreement's provision extending the diesel dyeing \nrequirements to kerosene. Since 1995, there has been substantial debate \nabout the proper tax treatment for kerosene. More than 90 percent of \nkerosene consumed in the United States is used for aviation purpose; \naccordingly, the fuel is currently classified and taxed as an aviation \nfuel.\n  Kerosene is also blended during cold weather with diesel fuel and \nhome heating oil to prevent those fuels from congealing; and it is \ntreated, for tax purposes, as the fuel into which it is blended. Thus, \nif kerosene is blended with undyed diesel fuel, it is taxed as diesel \nfuel; if it is blended with dyed home heating oil, it is exempt from \ntax.\n  This bill imposes a 24.3 cents-per-gallon excise tax on kerosene when \nit is\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\nremoved from the terminal, classifying it as diesel and subjecting it \nto the same tax and dye program.\n  Because tankage in the Northeast is limited, terminals are likely to \nhave space only for undyed kerosene. Such fuel is subject to tax when \nit is pulled from the rack; and, dealers who sell it directly as a \nheating fuel or as a blandstock for distillate, and farmers blending it \nas an off-highway fuel will be forced to apply for refunds of taxes \npaid.\n  This proposal also raises safety concerns. The New England \nAssociation of Fire Marshals and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nhave raised health and safety concerns about the use of dyed fuels in \nunvented heaters. Most kerosene heaters have been certified by the \nUnited Laboratories and similar organizations as safe only if they burn \nclear, undyed fuel. Accordingly, there is little information available \nabout the effects of dyed fuel on these heaters, and it would take \nseveral years to have them retested and recertified to burn dyed fuel.\n  In closing, I would like to express my appreciation and admiration to \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, who did a \nwonderful job of guiding this legislation to this point. Without his \nwillingness to work with all members of the committee, and indeed the \nentire Senate, this bill would have had little chance of success.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I support this tax bill as a way to give \nworking families tax relief and continue our economic growth.\n  I'm delighted that the tax cuts for working families in this \nagreement were made more progressive by Democrats.\n  I support estate tax relief targeted at family farms and small \nbusinesses as well as a phase-up in the self-employed health deduction \nto 100 percent.\n  And I am pleased this agreement left out attempts by the other body \nto raise taxes on ethanol and make it too easy for employers to \nreclassify their employees as independent contractors. I would have \nbeen hard-pressed to support this agreement had the language on \nindependent contractors survived knowing that having this provision in \nlaw would have had significant and harmful effects on the health and \nfinancial well-being of American workers. Consider that under current \nlaw, only 2 percent of independent contractors have health and \nretirement benefits, while 50 percent of private employees have those \nbenefits--adopting the language proposed by the other body would surely \nhave had harmful health and financial consequences for the American \nworker.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that a number of savings and investment \nincentives like expanded IRA's and education IRA's are included in this \nagreement. These provisions are good for what they are. However, I fear \nthat the people who most need to generate wealth for their families--\nmiddle- and lower-income people--will have the toughest time taking \nadvantage of these provisions. That is why I am so sorely disappointed \nthat the conferees chose not to include a robust form of KidSave in \ntheir final agreement. Indeed, given the option I would go further than \nKidSave by allowing taxpayers to keep a portion of their payroll taxes \nin personal savings.\n  And I support the emphasis on education contained in this bill \nalthough I am not convinced the money we will spend on some of these \ninitiatives is the most efficient or effective way to make sure more \nkids have access to higher education.\n  Mr. President, in many ways voting for this bill is a close call for \nme. Much of what was good in the Senate Finance bill has been thrown \noverboard. And that bill, while complex, pales in comparison to the \ncomplexity of this bill.\n  Still, I believe this bill will provide tax relief that working \nfamilies need. I am especially pleased with the improvements Democrats \nsecured to make this bill more progressive and in making this bill \nreach more working families. I'm also pleased by the emphasis on \neducation in this agreement, if not by the details of that emphasis.\n  So, Mr. President, while I intend to vote for this tax package, I am \ndecidedly unenthusiastic about what we have not done in this tax \npackage and in this balanced budget package overall: we have not taken \nthe first steps toward long-term entitlement reform that recognizes the \nseismic impact the retirement of the Baby Boom generation will have on \nthe budget, both in terms of its fiscal balance, the solvency of the \nprograms that comprise our retirement safety net and the balance \nbetween mandatory and discretionary spending.\n  Specifically, I am disappointed in two aspects of the tax bill.\n  First, I am disappointed that the bill does not address what I \nbelieve is the most pressing challenge families face in a global \neconomy: the need to build wealth.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take a step back from the \nrhetoric on this issue and consider the fact that increased income--\nwhich is the object of these tax cuts--and increased wealth are very \ndifferent things, and they are particularly different today because, in \nmy analysis, the global economy is devaluing one--income--while \nenhancing the value of the other: wealth.\n  Let me start with a set of definitions: Income is the regular inflow \nof resources on which we depend to pay our bills and live our lives. \nWealth is the ownership of assets that gain in value.\n  Anyone who's played the old board game Monopoly knows this \ndifference. Most 10-year-old children who have played this game will \ntell you that you don't win by going around and around the board, \ncollecting $200 every time you pass Go.'' You win by carving out some \nof that income to buy properties that grow in value. It seems to me, \nMr. President, that focusing on working families' income--which is \ncertainly important--while ignoring whether they have wealth is like \ntrapping them in a game of Monopoly in which all we care about is \nsending them around and around the board, passing Go'' and collecting \n$200, while ignoring the fact that they don't have enough income left \nover to build a stake of ownership and get ahead.\n  The difference may be best illustrated by the recent stock market \nboom and, just as important, who has benefited from it. Let me open \nwith the simple proposition that those who own wealth in the stock \nmarket own more than a few shares in a mutual fund--they own a piece of \nour economy. They own a stake in it. When the economy succeeds, they \nsucceed. And what they own--capital, and a stake of ownership in the \nmeans of production--is the asset that this economy is rewarding.\n  Families need a stake of ownership, Mr. President, because I believe \nit is the principal factor that will determine whether the global \neconomy works for them--because it rewards ownership of capital, the \nscarce factor of production that is in wide demand all over the globe--\nor against them, because the expanding global labor pool means those \nwho earn their income exclusively from work are facing more and more \ncompetition that is bidding the value of their services down.\n  Wealth is also important in a global economy because it provides the \nsecurity--for rainy days, for retirement--that a global economy \nrequires. I do not believe that ownership of the means of production \nand ownership of a stake in our economy should be limited to the \nprivileged few. I want every American to have access to it.\n  I must say that therein lies my ambivalence toward the capital gains \nand estate tax provisions of this bill. I supported both, but I note \nfor my colleagues' consideration that the estate tax only impacts 2 \npercent of Americans who die each year. The other 98 percent do not \nhave estates worth $600,000. I'd be willing to bet that a lot people in \nthis country have only a fuzzy notion of what a capital gain is because \nthey do not own capital. And I fear that we may have gone too far in \nrewarding people who generate income from capital to the detriment of \nthose who generate income from getting up at 6 every morning and \nputting in an 8 or 10 hour day.\n  And while I supported both of these provisions, I deeply regret that \nthis budget does not address the ability of the other 98 percent of \nAmericans to build estates and ownership of capital.\n\n  Even as the importance of wealth is growing, the gap in who owns it \nand who does not is growing too.\n  The question, Mr. President, is: Where does wealth come from and why \ndo working families not have it? The answer is that wealth is built by \nsaving and investing over a long period of\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\ntime, which requires disposable income that many families lack.\n  I had hoped we would target tax relief toward freeing the disposable \nincome that working families need. I have proposed doing so by cutting \nthe biggest tax working families face: the payroll tax. I call this tax \n``The Forgotten Tax.'' I had lobbyists knocking on my door to discuss \nevery arcana of tax law, but not once did someone knock on my door to \ntalk about this tax. I hope we'll take a close look at it and talk \nabout how this tax can be cut to give the working families on whom it \nimposes its greatest burden a way to generate wealth through personal \nsavings.\n  We missed another important opportunity to help families build \nwealth. KidSave, a term that is being bandied about to describe \npolicies that are foreign to its purpose, would have converted the \n$500-per-child tax credit from one that increases consumption by $10 a \nweek to one that allowed families to build a stake of ownership in the \neconomy, which, as I have said, I believe is more important than \nincreasing their income, as much as I support that goal. I believe this \none provision, which was dropped, could have laid down the savings \ninfrastructure that our children will need in the 21st century to build \na stake of ownership in the economy.\n  I am pleased that this bill would expand IRA's and allow parents to \nopen higher education IRA for their children which would become IRAs in \nthe child's name at age 30 if the child did not use them for higher \neducation. However, the savings initiatives contained in this bill are \nvoluntary and for most people they will probably not be ``sweet'' \nenough get the people who most need to build wealth, to do so.\n  Second, I also fear this bill will come to be known as the Tax \nComplication Act of 1997. This tax bill is going to be a bear to \nadminister and a bear for taxpayers to understand. As the Washington \nPost noted earlier this week, Conceivably an individual reaching \nretirement age could have an IRA with deductible contributions, \nnondeductible contributions, one rolled over from an employer plan and \none of the new backloaded ones. As the Post dryly notes, calculating \nthe required withdrawals and taxes would be ``an adventure.''\n  As I am sure everyone in this chamber knows, not only are there \ndifferent income phaseouts for the front and back-loaded IRA's in this \nbill, there is still yet another phaseout for rollovers from front to \nback loaded IRAs.\n  I don't mean to single out any one provision for its complexity \nfactor. Here is yet another: Your capital gains rate. Just what is the \nrate under this bill you might ask? That seems like a pretty \nstraightforward question but not so fast.\n  Assets held for zero to twelve months will be taxed under this bill \nat ordinary income rates--a top rate of 39.6 in other words. Assets \nheld for 12-18 months and sold will be taxed at the current maximum \ncapital gains rate of 28 percent. Assets held for eighteen months or \nmore will get either a 20 percent, or ten percent rate. Assets disposed \nof between May 7 and July 29 and held for 12 months will get a 20 \npercent rate.\n  But wait, there is more. We have a new 5 year holding period rate. \nPeople paying taxes at the 15 percent rate would get an 8 percent \ncapital gains rate on assets held for 5 years beginning now. People \nabove the 15 percent rate would have to wait until the year 2001 to get \nthe 5 year holding period going, could even take old assets and bring \nthem up to current value without disposing of them, hold them for 5 \nyears, and get an 18 percent rate in the year 2006.\n  Oh, and if you own commercial real estate, the rules are different as \nwell. Under this bill, the depreciated portion of your real estate is \ntaxed at 25 percent, the amount above that amount is at 20.\n  If you are working, but not wealthy, and you have more than two \nchildren, you'll probably need to spend some of your child credit \nhiring someone to figure out your child credit. Under this bill, \nsomeone with one or two kids would get the child credit before their \nearned income tax credit. But if you have three or more kids, you would \nhave the option of figuring your tax two ways: either take the credit \nbefore the EITC or take the credit up to your employee FICA and income \ntaxes minus your EITC. At this point, as I understand it, you are no \nlonger even receiving a child credit. If you get the child credit this \nway, you are getting a supplemental child credit, not, presumably and \nactual child credit.\n  Just one more example. The education initiatives. Believe me, in \norder to figure them out, you are going to need a degree in accounting \nbefore you are able to do your own taxes. Under this agreement, the \nHOPE credit gives you a 100 percent credit up to $1,000 the first 2 \nyears, and 50 percent of $1,000 the second 2 years for ``eligible \nexpenses.'' That is on a per student basis and it begins in January of \n1998. In addition, this agreement has a lifetime learning component \nwhich provides a 20 percent credit for up to $5,000 in expenses on a \nper family basis which in 2002 becomes a 20 percent credit against \n$10,000. That provision begins on July 1, 1998. The HOPE credit is \nindexed in 2001, the lifetime learning piece is not. Income limits for \nboth are indexed in 2001.\n  Having expressed those concerns, I do not want to underestimate the \nmagnitude of the achievement. Continuing the job of balancing the \nbudget will advance the goal of economic growth. The expanded reach of \nthe $500-per-child tax credit means real relief for real families. The \ngreat American institution called the family farm will have a greater \nopportunity to stay in families. I repeat: I vote yes for what we have \ndone here, for what we achieved, but with regret for the challenges we \nchose not to tackle. We have thrown a first down pass, and the cheers \nfrom the crowd are deserved. But a long distance remains to the goal \nline: a federal budget that can cope with the demographic challenges we \nface while still preserving our priorities as Americans.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to support--and reflect--on \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act, which will be passed by the Senate tomorrow. I \nam pleased that at long last we are providing tax relief to our \nNation's family farms and businesses and to many individual Americans. \nMy philosophy long has been that if we can allow any American to keep \none extra dollar of his or her hard-earned income, we have achieved a \nmeasure of victory.\n  At the same time, I have serious concerns about major parts of this \nlegislation.\n  First, let me review some victories. As former Chairman of the House \nCommittee on Agriculture, I helped steer Freedom to Farm legislation \nthrough Congress. It was an important step in returning agriculture to \nthe free-market and removing the Government from the operation of \nfamily farms. However, that historic farm legislation will be \nsuccessful only if we take steps on the other side of the ledger that \ngive farmers the tools they need to compete. High on that list are \ncapital gains and estate tax relief, which are included in this tax \nbill.\n  I have received numerous letters and phone calls from constituents \nwho purchased their farms and businesses 40, 50, or 60 years ago. These \npeople want to pass their family farms and businesses to their \nchildren, but cannot because of burdensome capital gains and estate \ntaxes. I have long argued that it is unfair to tax a family's income \nthree times--once as income, once as capital gains, and once as an \ninheritance. Although this bill does not eliminate capital gains and \nestate taxes, the increased exemption for estate taxes and reduced \ncapital gains rate will make it possible for numerous parents to pass \ntheir farms and businesses on to their children.\n  I am also pleased we have achieved repeal of the AMT for deferred \npayment commodity contracts and income averaging. A farmer must deal \nwith drought, floods, freezes, and insects, any of which can destroy or \nseverely harm their crops. Thus, farmers often experience large \nfluctuations in income from year to year. These provisions provide \nimportant tools for managing these income fluctuations. While something \nis always better than nothing, I am disappointed that income averaging \nwill only apply to the 1998 and 1999 crop years and not the full \nremaining 6 years of the farm bill.\n  I am also pleased that the bill does not include the onerous House \nprovisions that would have taxed the tuition\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\nwaivers received by graduate teaching and research assistants at \nuniversities throughout the country. Acceptance of these provisions \nwould have sharply cut access to graduate school for many students, \ncreated teaching shortages, and greatly increased the cost of \ncontinuing important research projects.\n  Mr. President, while I am happy to see these provisions included in \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act, I also have serious concerns with several \nprovisions of this bill.\n  First, at a time when Americans have asked us to lower their tax \nburden and make the tax code less complex, this bill actually increases \nthe complexity of the tax code. We have obtained a reduction in the \ncapital gains rate. At the same time we have set up six different \ncapital gains rates: 28 percent for collectibles; 25 percent for \nrecaptured depreciation on investment real estate; 20 percent for all \nother capital gains, falling to 18 percent beginning in 2001 for assets \nheld longer than 5 years; A 10 percent rate for those earning less than \n$41,200/year, falling to a rate of 8 percent in 2001 on assets held \nlonger than 5 years.\n  If you include the corporate capital gains rate, we now have seven \ncapital gains tax rates. Only in Washington is an expansion from 3 to 7 \ntax brackets called simplification.\n  There are numerous examples where this bill will make the tax code \nmore complex.\n  High on that list is the incomprehensible maze of individual \nretirement accounts set up by the bill. There is no escaping the fact \nAmerican families may need a tax lawyer to establish an IRA--but they \nmost certainly will need a lawyer to sort through withdrawal of money \nfrom their IRA's.\n  Additionally, this bill tells Americans: ``The Federal Government \nwill reward you for having children. The Federal Government will reward \nyou for limiting your income.''\n  Have a child, get a $500 credit on your taxes. But if you are a \nfamily making over $110,000 per year you get none of the benefits. \nNearly all of the bill's rewards, in fact, are subject to income \nlimits.\n  That is a clear message.\n  That is more social engineering than tax policy.\n  Could we achieve the same goal of tax reduction by spreading the cuts \nacross the board to help every American taxpayer? You bet we could.\n  Mr. President, we all agree with the goal of assisting families send \ntheir children to college. This bill provides several tax incentives to \ndo that. But I must ask: ``Have we looked hard at these provisions to \nensure they will not quickly inflate the cost of higher education so \nthat any benefits to students and families are lost?''\n  Finally Mr. President, I ask what is in this tax bill for those \nindividuals who are not rich, who do not have large investments and \nsavings, and who do not have children?\n  I received a call this week from a constituent who works on the \nassembly line at Boeing Military Aircraft Co. in Wichita, KS. He labors \nside-by-side with another worker who earns a salary identical to his. \nHowever, his coworker is married, has two children, and paid $4,200 \nless in taxes this past year than the single worker. This constituent \ncommented that his coworker is now getting an additional tax break, \nwhile his taxes will not be lowered one penny by this tax bill. He was \nangry, upset, and wanted to know why his Government penalizes him for \nbeing single. Mr. President, I am not sure I have an answer.\n  I received another call from a father of three college graduates. \nThis man and his wife used most of their savings to put their children \nthrough college. He has heard about the $500 per-child-credit, tuition \ncredits, and capital gains reductions. Yet, he had one very important \nquestion. How was this tax bill going to benefit him and his wife, \nsince none of these benefits apply to them? These constituents are not \nunique. They speak for a large segment of decent, hard-working \nAmericans who have been forgotten in this tax bill.\n  These constituents have a particularly difficult time understanding \nwhy they are receiving no tax breaks under this bill, but someone who \npays no income taxes can still receive the $500 per child credit as a \nrefund towards their payroll taxes. My constituents want to know why \nthese people are receiving a refund on their Medicare and Social \nSecurity taxes, but will still receive the same benefits when they \nretire, as those Americans who are working hard to make a living but \nwho receive few benefits under this bill. Why are we failing to give \ntax breaks to people who pay taxes, while giving refunds to those who \npay nothing? Why are we using a tax cut bill to develop and expand a \nnew form of welfare?\n  I do not argue that families with children do not deserve tax breaks. \nEveryone in America deserves a break from their onerous tax burden. \nUnfortunately, in our hurry to give tax breaks to families and people \nwho do not even pay income taxes, we forgot about those middle-income \nAmericans who are single, or married with no children, and who work \njust as hard to make ends meet as their counterparts with children.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for the Taxpayer Relief Act because it \ncontains many tax relief provisions long needed by American taxpayers.\n  However, I would urge my colleagues to begin thinking seriously about \nthe need to return to these issues as soon as next year and make new \nattempts to simplify our tax laws and make them fair to all classes of \ntaxpayers.\n  This tax bill is far from the best we can do.\n  A good tax bill should not promote disparity between economic \nclasses, it should not promote social policies, it should not expand \nwelfare, and it should not create additional employment for CPA's and \ntax lawyers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support this bipartisan tax \nreduction bill. This package has the right priorities, emphasizing \neducation for young people, health coverage for children, and tax \nrelief for working families. It represents a significant improvement \nover the bill originally passed by the Senate, which I opposed.\n  The improvements in the bill over the Senate bill are numerous. For \ninstance, the $500-per-child tax credit has been greatly expanded to \ninclude more working families with children. Last week, I highlighted \nseveral Michigan families that would receive significant benefits under \nthe $500 per child tax credit in the President's plan but would receive \nno benefit under the House or the Senate bills. The compromise \nagreement grants those Michigan families substantially the same \nbenefits that the President's plan would. One of those working families \nis the Ginn family from Saginaw, Michigan, with an income of $25,000 \nper year, who would receive no benefit under the $500-per-child credit \nin the Senate bill but would receive more than $1,200 in tax credits \nunder the compromise version. Another family is the Shannon family, \nfrom Livonia, MI, with an income of $18,460 a year, that has a 1\\1/2\\-\nyear-old son. They too would receive nothing under the child credit in \nthe Senate bill but would receive the full $500 under the compromise \nversion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the tax \nbenefits for six families from Michigan illustrating the improvements \nin this bill be included in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. The education tax cuts that will make college more \naffordable for millions of families have been increased by nearly $7 \nbillion over the Senate bill under the compromise agreement. The \nlegislation includes the $1,500 HOPE Scholarship tax credit which is \navailable for students in their first 2 years of college. It also \nincludes a provision that was not included in the Senate bill to give a \n20-percent tuition deduction for a student's junior, senior, and \ngraduate educations. There is an extension of the tax exclusion for \nemployer-provided education assistance for 3 years and a welcome \nreinstatement of the student loan interest deduction which allows those \npaying back their loans to deduct up to $2,500 per year.\n  I am also pleased that the President insisted that the Empowerment \nZone concept that has helped revitalize Detroit and other Michigan \ncommunities be added to the bill.\n  While there is much to applaud about this legislation, it's not the \ntax bill I would have written. While the Treasury Department and the \nJoint Tax\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\nCommittee have been unable to supply an analysis of the distribution of \nthe benefits of these tax cuts in time for this vote, I believe that \nmore of the benefit of this bill is directed to those who need it \nleast. I would have preferred a tax bill which targeted even more of \nits benefits to working families.\n  The Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax [AMT] has been significantly \nweakened in this bill and a significant number of profitable companies \nwill pay no tax as a result of this change. The AMT was added to the \nTax Code to ensure that profitable companies pay some tax. While the \ncapital gains holding period was lengthened by 6 months, I would have \npreferred a tax bill which more narrowly targeted the capital gains tax \ncut.\n  There is one more area of this bill which could use some improvement. \nWhile many of the tax provisions that I have already mentioned I fully \nsupport, this bill as a whole does not do anything to simplify the Tax \nCode. In fact, it is likely to add a significant number of pages to the \ncode and add a significant amount of time to the time it takes for \ntaxpayers to prepare their return. I hope that in the near future we \ncan improve the Tax Code and make it and the IRS easier to deal with.\n  However, Mr. President, even with its imperfections, this bill is an \nimprovement over both the House and Senate passed bills, includes more \nof the President's and Democrats' priorities emphasizing education for \nyoung people, health coverage for children, and tax relief for working \nfamilies. For those reasons, I will support it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Michigan Families Gain Child Tax Credit Under Budget Agreement\n\n                 (Source: Office of Senator Carl Levin)\n\n\n                      Melissa Shannon, Livonia, MI\n\n       Melissa Shannon is a full-time flight attendant for \n     American Trans Air at Detroit Metro Airport, currently \n     earning $18,460.

Mr. President, I am privileged to be in the Senate \ntoday to support passage of this historic legislation. In my career as \na Senator, a Congressman, and a State legislator, I have participated \nin thousands of bills. Posterity will probably remember only a select \nfew of them. Of all, I expect, and hope, those who keep apprised of \nCongress will remember this tax freedom reconciliation bill among those \nremembered most fondly and most often.\n  This bill is not only about the Government living within the Nation's \nmeans, but about the Constitution itself. Two years ago, the Congress \nproved that it could pass a balanced budget. It also learned that the \nConstitution anticipates a third participant in the legislative \nprocess, the executive branch. So, we arrive here today not only having \nanticipated the needs of the President, we have included the executive \nbranch as an active participant throughout the legislative process.\n  The words of the Constitution do not proscribe that Congress and the \nPresident should enter into an agreement defining legislation before it \nis actually written. Furthermore, the Constitution does not proscribe \nthat the Congress should advance legislation with the continued advice \nof the Office of the President, the Treasury Department, and the Office \nof Management and Budget. The words themselves simply allow the \nPresident the express authority to either enact or veto the bills that \nwe in the Congress produce.\n  However, the partnership forged between the President and Congress \nprove that the President can, and should, make his intentions known \nthroughout the legislative process. Since the President can veto any \nbill that is sent to him, the process should allow that their contents \nof bills should not come as a surprise. But, it is not the President's \nreaction that should be avoided. It is the surprise of taxpayers. As \nthe legislative process has evolved, too much progress occurs behind \nthe closed doors of committees and caucuses. The people of the Nation \nhave come to think of the legislative process as a black box. The good \nintentions go in one side, but something wholly unknown can come out \nthe other. The President has always had the authority to veto and the \nCongress the power to reconsider.\n  But, in modern times, our legislative processes have become so \ncumbersome that Congress leaves itself without the days necessary to \nreconsider huge reconciliation bills. Therefore, we have effectively \nrevamped the legislative process by allowing the President to play an \nearlier role.\n  Some might say that this is a significant change. Since the \nConstitution does not direct such a partnership, it must be implied \ntherein. Our Constitution intends that we pass laws, not only bills.\n  Therefore, I turn to the product of this new process: The tax freedom \nreconciliation bill of 1997. Earlier today, we passed the balanced \nbudget reconciliation bill. The latter is the first spending bill that \nanticipates a balance in almost 30 years of gridlock. The former is the \nfirst tax bill in 16 years that actually cuts taxes. Together, they are \nthe first omnibus reconciliation legislation in 4 years that will \nbecome law.\n  Presently we are considering the tax freedom reconciliation bill. I \nam particularly proud of several provisions contained in this bill. \nSome of these sections have national perspectives like both the renewed \nincome tax deduction for interest on student loans and estate tax \nrelief. Others have a more regional effect such as the law turning back \nthe unauthorized IRS expansion of the alternative minimum tax against \nfarmers. All, however, provide relief to hard-working families in the \nareas of education and income security.\n  For education, this tax-relief bill renews the deductibility of \ninterest incurred on student loans. I have introduced that particular \nbill in every Congress since it was repealed in 1986. In the last two \nCongresses I was accompanied by my friend from Illinois, Senator \nMoseley-Braun. Today, I am happy to announce our success.\n  When Americans think of investing money, we think of investing in \nthings--machines, natural resources or businesses. This student loan \nprovision is an investment in human capabilities and talents. I would \nlike to do even more than what is offered in this provision. But \nrestoring the deductibility on the interest paid on student loans sends \na message to college students across the country. Their talents are \nworth the investment of dollars.\n  Students need to know the Federal Government and the Nation value \ntheir contributions. Understanding this, I believe they will have a \ngreater appreciation of the effort necessary to successfully complete a \nhigher education. We are clearly sending the message that the Congress \nrecognizes the financial responsibility students undertake, and we are \nwilling to do what we can to ease that burden.\n  For farmers, I am pleased to announce that another of these new laws \nwill forever repeal the unauthorized IRS advancement of the alternative \nminimum tax against traditional farmer deferred commodity contracts. \nThe President may offer his views on legislation, but the IRS does not \nhave unilateral power to legislate on its own.\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\n This is good news for family farmers and rural America. It reaffirms \nthe intent of Congress that family farmers should be able to continue \nreceiving the use of the cash method of accounting not limited by the \nAMT. The IRS decision last fall to unilaterally change a 16-year-old \ntax policy for these deferred payments. The IRS was dead-wrong. Sixty-\nthree of my colleagues joined my legislation with Senator Dorgan as \nsolid proof.\n  In addition to setting the record straight, turning back the AMT for \nfarmers highlights the larger problem we face when the IRS disregards \nthe intent and the will of Congress. Here, we had a tax policy in place \nfor 16 years, and suddenly, the IRS decides to make a 180 degree turn, \nwhich caused a great deal of havoc and concern for thousands of \ntaxpayers. But, in order to return the law to its original intent, we \nhad to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars as an offset, \nbecause of the upside-down way we do revenue estimates around here. So, \nI hope the Joint Committee on Taxation will be addressing the revenue \nestimation problem in the near future.\n  I am also proud of the future for estate tax relief for families. \nWhen thinking about estate taxes, you have to always keep your eye on \nthe ball. Estates do not pay estate taxes, surviving families pay \nestate taxes. In this bill we do a number of things for death tax \nreform. All of these new laws are based on legislation that I \nintroduced with my friend from Montana, Senator Baucus. Twenty \ncosponsors joined in our bill S. 479, the Estate Tax Relief for the \nAmerican Family Act. It became the estate tax relief legislation \nembodied in this reconciliation bill providing over $675,000 of new \nrelief.\n  In current law, the general estate tax exemption is $600,000, but \nthat number is more than $200,000 behind the rate of inflation. In \nnearly every area of my State and the Nation, we saw in the past decade \nestate tax ultimately confiscate many family farms. Estate tax reform \nis simply about fairness and equity for families.\n  We've heard some make the faulty argument that the estate tax only \naffects a small percentage of taxpayers. Well, the point they leave out \nis that many other thousands of taxpayers have to waste a great deal of \nmoney in order to plan their estate so it will remain operational and \nin the family.\n  In addition, without the relief under this bill, the number of those \naffected by the estate tax would increase substantially in the next 5 \nto 10 years.\n  Let me also add that I strongly support estate tax relief because it \ndirectly helps preserve our natural land. Our estate tax relief is very \npro-environment simply because it helps keep family farms operational \nand defers the danger of over-development by urban activities.\n  In this bill, capital gains tax relief is the partner of estate tax \nreform. Capital gains tax relief is similarly vital to my State of \nIowa. A disproportionate amount of farmland is held by older \nlandowners. To illustrate, studies in my state of Iowa show that 42 \npercent of farmland is held by taxpayers over the age of 65. Last year, \nIowa State University conducted its annual farm life survey. It found \nthat in the next 5 years, 21 percent of Iowa farmers are planning to \nretire. This high rate of those leaving farming raises important \nquestions about who will be the next generation of Iowa farmers.\n  Some of those farmers who retire will want to hold onto the land and \nmaybe rent it out. Many others want to sell the land, move to town, and \nbe fully retired. Unfortunately, the capital gains tax has locked them \non the farm. I support an even larger reduction in the capital gains \nrate. But, the reduction in the bill is certainly a very positive step \nin the right direction.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the expanded availability of tax \nsupported individual retirement accounts. With the constraints of the \nTax Code reduced, we will have more people saving for their \nretirements. Homemakers will be able to save $2000 per year tax-free \nregardless of the tax free retirement program offered to the working \nspouse. These new pro-saving laws will reduce the strain on the Social \nSecurity system.\n  This Congress produced all of this relief for families by using \nbipartisanship and cooperation with the executive branch. This \ncooperation was not expressed in so many words of the Constitution, but \nit must certainly have been implied.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, before casting my vote for this tax \nportion of the budget plan, I want to comment on the aspects that are \nof most concern to me.\n  The basic point I want to emphasize is that my vote for both the \nspending bill and this tax bill that make up the balanced budget and \ntax plan is the result of weighing its merits against its flaws. The \nfundamental job for Congress this year has been to agree on a plan to \nbalance the budget, which is the main objective of the bills we are \napproving this week. Unlike the Republican budgets that I opposed over \nthe last 2 years, this plan is the result of bipartisan negotiations \nand contains real benefits and important compromises in the interest of \nWest Virginians and all Americans.\n  At the same time, it has been clear that the only way we could finish \nthe job some of us started in 1993, to balance the budget and start \ndealing with future priorities, was to find middle ground. I recognize \nthat I cannot write or cause the passage of the budget plan that \nreflects exactly how I would chart Medicare's course, design the \nchildrens' health insurance program, target tax relief, or address \nother priorities for West Virginians. Instead, I have worked hard in \nthe recent months to influence these parts of the budget and make the \nbest possible case for the approach I think is fair and balanced.\n  The spending plan approved this morning and the tax bill before us \ntoday are improvements over the extreme Republican budgets that were \nrejected in the past 2 years and over the earlier versions of these \nvery bills. With the many aspects that will benefit West Virginians and \naddress national priorities, I made the decision to vote for both \nbills.\n  The crucial part of the bill before us is the fact that it will \nprovide tax relief to 27 million hardworking American families who are \nresponsible for raising over 45 million children under the age of 17. \nToday, Congress joins the President to give those families a per-child \ntax credit much like the one that the bipartisan Children's Commission \nunanimously recommended when I chaired that commission 7 years ago. We \nare delivering real tax relief to American families so that they can \nshare in the benefits of our sharply declined, and soon to be \ncompletely eliminated, deficit. That is an achievement I think we can \nbe proud of, particularly because this tax conference report will \nbenefit 5.9 million lower income families who were left out of the \nSenate-passed tax bill. The fight to make the child tax credit fairer \nwas won by the President and Democrats who refused to ignore the \nmillions of families struggling the hardest to provide for their \nfamilies. Winning, improving the child credit so it is extended to more \nAmerican families is important because it means we will more fairly \ndistribute the benefits of the tax cuts in this bill than under the \ninitial tax plans passed in Congress.\n  I am pleased that I can report that 25,000 more West Virginia \nfamilies will benefit from the child tax credit as a result of the \nchanges in the conference report--changing the stacking order of the \nchild credit, now placed before the EITC, and its partial refundability \nfor families with three or more children. It is predominantly for that \nreason that I will cast my vote in favor of this tax package. Improving \nthe child credit so it reaches more families, the families who need the \nmost help to buy their children shoes, pay the mortgage, or deal with \nan unexpected medical expense, is a major victory in this tax bill. \nWith this important improvement, I can support this tax package. The \nsubstantial dedication of funds to provide health insurance to about \n3.4 million of the 10 million uninsured children in our country--\ntotaling $24 billion in new dollars for kids' health--is another major \nreason to vote for this bill. The additional financing for kids' health \ncomes from a hike in the tobacco tax. I think that is a smart way to \npay for this new spending on children's health. I am deeply \ndisappointed that we did not insist on a meaningful benefit package for \nthose children, but I will be back another day to fight to improve that \nprovision.\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\n  But I don't want to cast my vote in favor of this 5-year budget bill \nwithout making it perfectly plain that I have serious worries about the \nlong-term costs of some of the tax cuts in this bill. Certain \nprovisions could be a potential tax timebomb because of how their costs \nexplode in the 5 years following the 5 years in this budget, sometime \nafter 2002. The explosion of costs in what we refer to as the \noutyears--years after the first 5 years of the budget--of the \nprovisions that benefit the wealthiest Americans are very worrisome to \nme. I have to honestly wonder whether or not we will realistically be \nable to retain them. The long-term costs of providing such generous \nreductions in tax rates for estates and gifts, capital gains, and the \nexpansion of individual retirement accounts [IRA's] may prove too \nexpensive to sustain. I cite these particular provisions because they \nare the ones that score as relatively small costs in the first 5 years \nof this budget, but are projected to multiply 10 and 20-fold in the \nsecond 5 years, according to the scoring of both the Joint Committee on \nTaxation and the Treasury Department.\n  Consider these numbers--estate tax relief costs $5.9 billion in the \nfirst 5 years and jumps to $33 billion in the second 5 years; capital \ngains relief scores as if it saves $123 million in the first 5 years \nbut the cost of that relief increases to $20.2 billion in the second 5 \nyears; and the IRA expansions cost $1.8 billion in the beginning of \nthis agreement, but rise precipitously to $21.1 billion in the next 5 \nyears. Those are enormous increases, and I worry that we cannot afford \nto include such narrowly targeted tax relief over the long term when we \ndon't know how healthy our economy will be in the year 2002. We may \nwell have to revisit these benefits and reconsider whether they are \nworth retaining. I would be thrilled if our economic growth and \nexpansion continued at such a pace that we do not have to revisit this \nwork, but I want my colleagues to know that this is one of my worries \nabout enacting this tax bill.\n  I remain very confident that over the next few years we have a unique \nopportunity to provide some tax relief to many Americans --and well \nunderstand the promise of that relief helps us deliver an agreement to \nbalance the budget. At the same time, we are plowing $40 billion into \neducation tax credits to help 5 million students with a $1,500 HOPE \nscholarship to make the first 2 years of college universally available \nand a 20 percent tuition tax credit for college juniors, seniors, and \ngraduate students, along with working Americans to pursue lifetime \nlearning and get the skill upgrades they need to compete in a changing \neconomy. This level of tax support for education will help us prepare \nour children and our workforce for the new century. I congratulate the \nPresident for holding firm to his commitment.\n  I am hopeful that both budget bills headed for the President's \nsignature will make the steps forward that are being promised and \ncelebrated today. I know that many provisions will directly benefit \nWest Virginians in key areas. But I also urge everyone in Congress to \nkeep a careful watch on the results of both bills, and maintain a \ncommitment to correcting anything that may go wrong and budgetary \neffects that may go awry. Let's do our best to achieve the good \npromised in these bills, and work to make sure that the legacy of this \nlegislation will be something we can continue to praise in future \nyears.\n\n\n                       air passenger tax formula\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there are many elements of the tax \npackage that I strongly support including the children's tax credit, \nthe reduction in capital gains, and the first step in estate tax \nrelief. For those reasons, I will vote for the tax package.\n  However, I want to take a moment to discuss with my colleagues what I \nbelieve is a fundamental inequity in the structure of the package. What \nI am referring to is the new air passenger tax formula. The conferees \nrejected the Senate's approach, which would have maintained the current \nflat 10-percent tax and instead adopted a dual tax structure that \nimposes both a flat tax and per-segment, per-passenger tax.\n  This new formula fundamentally discriminates against low-fare \ncarriers, especially those who fly smaller aircraft that make multiple \nintermediate stops. The new formula will have an especially detrimental \neffect on flights to and from the lower 48 from Alaska and Hawaii.\n  For several years, Congress has recognized the unique travel \ncircumstances faced by citizens of these two noncontiguous States. In \nreality, the only way to get to Alaska and Hawaii is by air. And once \nyou arrive in Alaska or Hawaii, air travel is often the only suitable \nway to get around.\n  Unfortunately, the new passenger tax formula fails to recognize our \nStates' strong reliance on the airplane. Passengers in small \ncommunities like Ketchikan could see their air tax bill jump by 30 to \n40 percent when the new formula is fully phased in. That is simply \nunfair to Alaskans, who already must endure close to the highest cost \nof living of any State.\n  Moreover, the new structure has a hidden timebomb that would explode \nif we see a spike in inflation. Not only is the head tax indexed for \ninflation, but the special $6 departure fee that is only imposed on \nflights to and from Alaska and Hawaii is also indexed. What this means \nis that every year, flights to Alaska and Hawaii are guaranteed to see \na double tax hike, whereas flights within the lower 48 will only see a \ntax rise on the per-passenger fee.\n  I think that is fundamentally unfair and it is my intention to \nintroduce legislation that will reinstate the current air tax structure \nfor flights to Alaska and Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I echo the sentiments of my colleague from \nAlaska. The aviation provisions in this tax bill are unfair to \nresidents of and visitors to Hawaii and Alaska and will have a \ndisproportionate impact on carriers that serve our States.\n  The bill fails to recognize that the 49th and 50th States are \nfundamentally different from the rest of the Union in our heavy \nreliance on air transportation. As the only noncontiguous States, \nHawaii and Alaska are, for all practicable purposes, accessible from \nthe continental United States only by air. Furthermore, for different \nreasons, travel within Hawaii and Alaska is feasible only by commuter \nairline. In effect, Alaska's and Hawaii's air routes serve the same \npurpose as other States' highway systems.\n  The pending measure would abrogate a long history of congressional \nsupport for our States' special aviation needs--needs which are \nembodied in current law--by imposing a per segment charge on flights \nto, from, and within Hawaii and Alaska. This new tax discriminates \nagainst the low-fare, short-haul carriers that serve the people of our \nStates as well as the larger carriers that maintain our communications \nlinks with other States.\n  Carriers that serve Hawaii can ill afford this additional tax burden; \nthe impact is especially heavy on our local commuter airlines. The \ntaxes of Hawaiian Airlines and Aloha Airlines alone will rise by as \nmuch as $7.5 million and $6 million, respectively, in the next year as \na result of the new segment fee.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the conferees' desire to make excise \ntaxes reflect usage of the air traffic system. But I do not believe \nthat the conferees fully understood the implications of the segment tax \nwith respect to states whose residents and visitors are wholly reliant \non air service for intrastate and interstate travel.\n  This is clearly an issue that deserves further study. Certainly this \nis an appropriate topic of review for the Mineta Airline Commission. \nShould the tax bill pass, I hope that Members of this body would agree \nto revisit this issue at the earliest opportunity. In any case, I will \njoin Senator Murkowski and my other colleagues from Hawaii and Alaska \nin supporting legislation to restore the current tax treatment of our \ntwo States.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I also share the concern expressed by my colleagues \nabout the new air travel segment fee in this bill. I regret that the \nSenate was not able to sustain its position of a simple extension of \nthe 10 percent ticket tax in the conference committee.\n  We had a vigorous debate last year over financing the Federal \nAviation Administration in the Senate Commerce Committee on another \ncongressional committees. We decided to establish the National Civil \nAviation Review Commission to examine FAA's true funding needs and \nvarious mechanisms for raising the revenues to meet those needs.\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\n  The Senate and the administration proposed extending the ticket tax \nduring this budget debate to allow the commission to do its work.\n  The new fee undercuts the work of the commission by prejudging their \ndecision. This is not the way public policy should be made, especially \non a matter of such direct importance to the pocketbooks and the safety \nof the American public.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I share the concerns of my colleagues from \nAlaska and Hawaii regarding the new airline ticket tax formula. I, like \nSenators Murkowski, Stevens, and Akaka, am distressed that a bill that \nhas so many important provisions that will benefit the Nation and \ncitizens of Hawaii, badly misjudges the need for and importance of air \ntransportation in both Alaska and Hawaii.\n  Hawaii, unlike any other State in the Union, is completely isolated \nfrom any other landmass. In terms of interisland/intrastate travel, my \nState is totally dependent on air transportation. Maintaining the \nstable, low-fare air transportation system we currently have is \nessential to the State of Hawaii. Similarly, we must also maintain a \nlow-fare environment to stimulate the influx of tourists. Tourism is \nHawaii's No. 1 industry. Given this utterly unique feature of our \nState, I am most disappointed that this bill imposes not only a segment \ntax on our citizens who must travel between the islands to conduct \ndaily business and to visit family members, but also imposes the \nsegment tax, an excise tax and a departure tax on passengers coming \nfrom any other State in the Union to Hawaii. According to the local \ncarriers in the State of Hawaii, in 1998, interisland customers would \npay an additional 16 percent in taxes, increasing to 54 percent in \n2003. No other State, other than Alaska, will face fare increases as \nsignificant as those which the new legislation will impose on the \nresidents and tourists of Hawaii. We must recognize that Alaska and \nHawaii are unique and must accommodate these States' dependence on air \ntravel in legislation that impacts the primary means of commerce on our \nStates.\n  I am pleased that Senator Murkowski plans to introduce legislation to \nrectify this situation and I will strongly support him in those \nefforts.\n\n\n                               tiaa/cref\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, under the Taxpayer's Relief Act of 1997, \nthe Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association [TIAA] and the College \nRetirement Equities Fund [CREF] are taxed under the same regime as life \ninsurance companies. However, TIAA and CREF are separate companies with \ndifferent structures and operations.\n  TIAA is a nonprofit, legal reserve life insurance and annuity \ncompany. CREF, on the other hand, is a management investment company \nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 act. CREF was organized in 1952 \nunder a special act of the New York Legislature. CREF predates the \nexistence of separate accounts and in fact served as the model for the \nvariable annuity products offered today by life insurance companies \nthrough separate accounts. No portion of a participant's pension \ncontribution to CREF pays for guarantees or the maintenance of \nreserves.\n  In light of the differences between TIAA and CREF, I would like to \nask Chairman Roth, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee \nif he would be so kind as to comment on the intent of the bill as it \napplies to the taxation of CREF.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, 2 million college faculty participants--\n260,000 in my State of New York--rely on TIAA and CREF pensions to \nprovide retirement security. Participants know when they choose CREF, \nevery contribution dollar goes to the retirement annuity accumulations, \nor payout company, CREF offers no guarantees nor does it maintain \ncontingency reserves. Yet CREF performs functions similar to a separate \naccount of a life insurance company by allowing retirees to receive \nvariable annuity payouts.\n  I would like to join Senator Moynihan and ask Senator Roth, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, to comment on the \nintent of the bill concerning the taxation of CREF?\n  Mr. ROTH. First, I would like to say that I joined my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Moynihan and D'Amato in opposing the repeal of the \ntax exemption for TIAA and CREF in conference. However, the Senate did \nnot prevail.\n  In light of this unfortunate result, I believe the intent of the bill \nis that CREF should be taxed consistent with its unique structure and \napart from TIAA.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non the tax relief package. I believe the conference report represents \nsignificant progress from previous efforts to provide tax relief for \nhard-working American families that are struggling to pay their bills, \neducate their children, and save for retirement. As one who voted \nagainst the previous Senate version of the tax cut bill, I commend the \nconferees and the administration negotiators who worked to address some \nof the concerns that I and others expressed with the previous \nlegislation to develop this compromise.\n  However, I must also express strong concern with several provisions \nthat remain in the bill. I believe that the provisions related to \ncapital gains taxes, IRA's, and estate taxes unfairly benefit the \nwealthiest Americans, and threaten to upset the fiscally responsible \ndecisions, such as passage of the 1993 deficit reduction package, that \nenabled us to reduce the deficit to its lowest point as a percentage of \nGDP since 1974. However, when considered in the context of the larger \neffort at bipartisan compromise and the willingness to expand \nhealthcare coverage to millions of children, I believe this legislation \npresents a good deal for many working American families.\n  In particular, the tax cuts contained in the conference report \nprovide a greater amount of tax relief to middle income Americans than \nprevious versions of this bill. For example, under the bill passed by \nthe Finance Committee, the second lowest 20 percent of income earners \nwould have experienced a tax increase, whereas under the conference \nreport, these Americans would enjoy a tax cut. Although I still have \nconcerns that a substantial share of the tax cuts will go to the \nhighest income Americans, these concerns are counterbalanced by the \nfact that middle-income Americans will enjoy significant tax reductions \nand expanded educational incentives which were not as prominent in \nprior versions of this bill.\n  As I have stated throughout the debate on this bill, I have \nreservations about provisions in the bill related to the capital gains \ntax, new backloaded IRA's, and the estate tax. Particularly disturbing \nis the fact that these tax reductions, which come at a significant cost \nafter 2002, will almost exclusively benefit the wealthiest Americans. \nFor example, the Joint Tax Committee has estimated that three-quarters \nof Americans receiving capital gains income are households that earn \nover $100,000 annually. Similarly, only 1.6 percent of estates are \nvalued high enough to qualify for capital gains increases. Meanwhile, \nthese tax cuts will cost $75 billion over 10 years.\n  Beyond favoring the wealthy, I am concerned that the cost of these \ntax cuts, many of which are backloaded, will explode in the years after \n2002 and ultimately upset the progress we have made on deficit \nreduction. These concerns are supported by the 10-year revenue \nestimates recently released by the Joint Tax Committee which suggests \nthat the cost of this tax bill will be $275 billion over 10 years. This \nlevel of revenue loss may prove difficult to sustain, and I would hope \nmy colleagues will protect vital investments like education and \ninfrastructure if difficult economic times arise.\n  At the same time, I believe that the conferees have made significant \nprogress on the education tax provisions included in the bill. Of \nparticular note is the decision to extend education tax reductions for \nthe third and fourth years of a college education. The Finance \nCommittee-passed tax bill did not extend benefits to years three and \nfour, and I believed this was a major shortcoming of that legislation. \nBy providing benefits for the duration of the average college \neducation, I believe the provisions included in the conference report \nbetter reflect the realities facing many individuals desiring to get a \ncollege education. Indeed, this compromise before us today provides $41 \nbillion in education tax incentives for those looking to invest in \ntheir education.\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\n  I also support the changes that have been made to the child tax \ncredit that will enable a greater number of middle- and lower-income \nAmericans to utilize the credit. By making the credit partially \nrefundable against payroll taxes, the legislation reflects the reality \nthat the most significant tax burden of many low-income Americans is \nthat of the payroll tax. The Senate bill provided no tax credit to many \nfamilies making under $30,000. This compromise does.\n  I would also like to express my support for the decision to keep \nprovisions in the bill that will expand the use of IRA's to allow \nwithdrawals for first-time home buyers. Perhaps the greatest hurdle \nfaced by many first-time home buyers is the inability to get the \nnecessary funds for a downpayment on a home. Provisions in the tax bill \nwill lower this hurdle and enable us to continue to increase home \nownership, which is currently at a 17-year high.\n  In conclusion, I believe the tax bill will provide tax relief to \nhard-working American families who have faced stagnating wages and \ntough employment prospects. I am pleased that we in Congress have made \nthe difficult budget decisions which laid the foundation for the tax \ncuts we are able to provide today. I would caution, however, that we \nmust be ever-vigilant in ensuring that the tax cuts will not overheat \nthe economy or lead to an explosion of the deficit. Indeed, we must be \nprepared to make the tough decisions that we will be called upon to \nmake in the event that the revenue projections in this agreement do not \ncome to fruition. As we prepare to vote on this legislation, I would \nencourage my colleagues to celebrate our success, but to consider the \nconcerns that I have set forth.\n  Mr. President, I will support this bill with reservations, but I also \nrecognize as should we all, that this agreement is a compromise between \na President and a Congressional majority of different political \nparties. As such, it embodies the often conflicting demands and ideals \nof each group. It is in this spirit that I will vote for the package.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report on H.R. 2014, The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. \nThis legislation represents the second part of the historic balanced \nbudget agreement.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I was originally concerned about \nenacting major tax changes which would jeopardize our deficit reduction \nprogress. I did not want to repeat the mistakes of the 1980's. Back \nthen, Congress did the easy thing in dramatically cutting taxes, but \nput off the tough decisions on spending cuts. As a result, the National \ndebt increased from $1 to $4 trillion, and we've been digging the \ncountry out of that hole ever since.\n  I also had to be sure that, if we did any kind of tax cut, it would \nbe targeted, to working families who desperately need relief and that \nit was responsible. I had to be sure that it did not add to the deficit \nand would truly serve as an investment in our economic productivity.\n  After months of working with the White House and Republicans, we have \nproduced a tax relief package that is responsible, targeted, and will \nprovide significant investment in our economy. It does not add to the \ndeficit--we borrow nothing to offset these cuts.\n  The tax relief package includes a $500-per-child tax credit that will \ngo to every family earning less than $110,000 per year. This tax credit \nalone will be available for approximately 27 million families with 45 \nmillion children, with 13 million of these children coming from \nfamilies with incomes below $30,000 a year. This includes children \nwho's parents are teachers, farmers, factory workers, police officers, \nand nurses--the real working families of this country.\n  When I first came to the U.S. Senate, I made a commitment to the many \nsmall, familyowned businesses and farms in the State, that I would work \nto reduce the estate tax. I had talked to many people with concerns \nthat their business or farm would have to be sold if they died, rather \nthan being passed on to their children. Because the estate tax is so \nhigh, younger generations cannot afford to keep the business or farm in \nthe family.\n  I introduced legislation to reform the inheritance tax last Congress \nfor two simple reasons. First, the current tax code hits my home State \nof Washington very hard, because we have a very high percentage of \nfamily farms, and tree farms in particular, as well as many \nentrepreneurial small, high tech businesses. Second, the impact of the \ncurrent structure of the estate tax had to be changed in order to allow \nfamily owned businesses to stay family owned. I am pleased the bill \nincluded estate tax relief that is similar to my legislation.\n  I am also pleased that included within this tax relief package is the \naccelerated phase-in of self-employed health insurance deduction from \n40 per cent up to 80 percent. This is a major victory for small \nbusiness, farms, and their families. It will also allow more small \nbusiness owners to purchase quality health care for their children. I \nhave long argued that small businesses should be given the same tax \nallowance for health insurance as afforded large corporations. This \naccelerated phase-in will provide this equity and expand access to \nhealth insurance coverage for many children who's parents are self-\nemployed.\n  Perhaps the greatest expense facing many families is that of a \ncollege education. I know many middle-class families in Washington \nState who are struggling to pay for their children's college education. \nI have also heard from many hard-working adults who cannot afford to \nupgrade their skills or further their education. We all know the value \nof investing in the education of our children and investing in our own \nskills and education. Yet, for many families a college education was \nbecoming unreachable. The tax relief package before us today will give \nmiddle-class families that extra help to meet the ever escalating cost \nof a post secondary education.\n  The legislation calls for a total of $35 billion in education tax \ncredits and incentives. This represents the biggest single investment \nin the education of our children since 1965. It will give those \nfamilies who are struggling to pay for a college education the help \nthat they need. As we move in to the next century, it means our \nchildren have the skills and education to meet the challenges of \ntomorrow. Our work force will need to be one of the most \ntechnologically advanced in the world in order to maintain our \ncompetitive edge and our high standard of living. Investing in today's \nchildren is not just an investment in their future, but it is an \ninvestment that will maintain our position as a global, economic power.\n  This bill also contains reductions in the capital gains tax. I am \npleased that we have been able to craft this part of the bill so that \nit targets regular, middle-class families. Many middle-class families \nhave been burdened with heavy capital gains when they sold a home or \neven sold stocks for retirement savings. In addition, the legislation \ndrops the capital gains tax from the 20 percent called for in the bill \nto 10 percent for joint filers with incomes less than $41,200 who sell \nor transfer an asset held for at least 18 months. For higher income \nearners the top rate will be 20 percent for investments held for at \nleast 18 months. Carefully crafted and targeted, a capital gains tax \ncut will encourage economic expansion and will provide equal relief to \nthe middle class. This legislation meets this test.\n  In 1993 our deficit was close to $300 billion annually. New estimates \nfor 1997 by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that the deficit \nfor this year could be as low as $67 billion. We have far exceeded even \nmy expectations for deficit reduction. The spending plan just adopted \nby this body will eliminate this deficit by 2002. Now is the time to \ngive working families their share of the deficit reduction dividend. \nThis legislation will guarantee that middle class, working families \nbenefit equally from the economic gains we have seen as a result of the \nDemocratic deficit reduction plan of 1993.\n  I know that this tax relief package and the balanced budget spending \nplan would not have been possible without a honest, bipartisan \napproach. While I know that many on the other side do not think that \nthis tax relief package is big enough, any further attempt to cut taxes \nwould have all but wiped out the $223 billion in deficit reduction that \nwe witnessed since 1993. This legislation is fair and equitable, but \nfiscally responsible as well. For the sake\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\nof our grandchildren and continued economic growth, we cannot enact \ndeep tax cuts that force us to only borrow more to pay for these cuts. \nBalancing the budget must remain our No. 1 goal and priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8415-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1997\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Unfortunately, I understand the conference agreement on \nH.R. 2014 takes no action to equalize the rate of deficit reduction \nfuel taxes paid by the various modes of transportation. As the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and I have discussed, \nan obvious inequity currently exists which requires that railroads pay \na 5.55 cents-per-gallon fuel excise tax, while all other modes of \ntransportation pay no more than 4.3 cents-per-gallon for this purpose. \nIn fact, by transferring deficit reduction taxes paid by other \ntransportation users, including truckers which compete with the \nrailroads, into trust funds for infrastructure improvements, we \nexacerbate the current inequity. Railroads continue to contribute to \ndeficit reduction, while their competitors instead contribute to their \nown infrastructure.\n  If transportation is to be singled out for deficit reduction, the \nburden of contributing to a balanced budget should be shared equally \namong all modes. While I regret that no solution to this problem was \npossible in this legislation, I hope you share my belief that the fuel \ntax inequity imposed on the Nation's railroads must be remedied at the \nearliest opportunity.\n  Mr. ROTH. As the Senator from Rhode Island knows, I am deeply \nconcerned about the unfair situation faced by railroads. While we were \nunable to include a solution to this problem in H.R. 2014, it is my \nhope that we will have the opportunity to pursue such a remedy as \nquickly as possible, perhaps in the upcoming ISTEA reauthorization \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me express my appreciation to the Chairman, Senator \nRoth, for his interest in this important issue. I look forward to \nworking with him on this matter during the upcoming ISTEA legislation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the tax \nbill, H.R. 2014.\n  Mr. President, this is a major tax cut for the American people--more \nthan $90 billion in tax relief.\n  This is the largest tax cut for the American people since 1981.\n  In terms of education, the provisions are very significant. My \nlegislative priority for this year has been a tax credit for community \ncollege students of any age to improve their job skills. On the first \nday of this Congress, I introduced S. 50, a bill to provide a $1,500 \ntax credit for community college students. Technology has brought about \nrapid change in the workplace, and the need to update one's skills on a \ndaily basis is critical. I think the community college system is the \nbest job training program we have in this country. North Carolina has \nbeen a leader in education and in job growth. There is a strong link \nbetween the two. The tax bill will provide a 100-percent tax credit for \nthe first $1,000 of expenses for attending a community college or the \nfirst 2 years of college. It will provide a 50-percent credit for of \nthe next $1,000. In sum, it's a $1,500 tax credit for all of America's \ncommunity college students. I was a strong supporter of this provision, \nand I am pleased it has been retained and improved.\n  The legislation also provides an interest deduction for student \nloans. Under the bill, State prepaid tuition plans will receive tax-\nfree treatment. And, the bill permits penalty free withdrawals from \nIRA's for education expenses. All of these provisions will improve our \neducation system without spending more money on bureaucrats or \nGovernment programs.\n  For families, the bill has significant tax relief. We have provided a \n$500 tax credit for children under the age of 17. For a family of four \nmaking $30,000--this is a 50-percent tax cut. For a family of four \nmaking $50,000, this is a 21-percent tax cut.\n  Mr. President, this is major tax relief for America's working \nfamilies. For too many years, these families, working men and women \nhave been the backbone of America, going to work every day, paying the \nmortgage, raising families, and paying their taxes and their debts. The \nGovernment has put a greater and greater tax burden on them every year. \nThis tax relief is long overdue. In fact, it's 16 years overdue. Their \nlast tax cut was 1981. There have been plenty of tax increases in the \nintervening years.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of other positive items in this tax \nbill. For example, the bill: Cuts capital gains taxes; cuts the capital \ngains on the sale of one's home; provides greater estate tax relief, \nparticularly for small family-owned businesses and farms; accelerates \nthe phasein of self-employed health insurance tax deduction; and \nprovides a more generous IRA for at-home spouses.\n  Mr. President, we should not lose sight of the fact that the \nRepublicans have now controlled Congress for 3 years. We have finally \novercome the President's opposition and cut taxes. In 1993, President \nClinton passed the largest tax increase in American history. To me, \nthis is a stark contrast in philosophy. If the Senate was not in \nRepublican hands, we would be debating the size of the tax hike, not \nthe tax cut. Although the White House has at times tried to blur the \ndifferences, it should not be lost on the American public that wasteful \nGovernment spending is going down, and taxes are being cut for the \nfirst time in years.\n  The battle for greater tax relief does not end here. The Tax Code has \nto be simplified dramatically. Overall tax rates are too high. \nAmericans are working until May just to pay taxes. We need to set a \nprotection into law that not more than 25 percent of one's wages can be \ntaken in taxes.\n  I can assure the Senate and my constituents in North Carolina that I \nwill\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\ncontinue my work for greater tax relief.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I am pleased to support this bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on the tax reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, before I begin to discuss this legislation, let me \ntake a moment to again congratulate the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, for their \nleadership on this legislation. Both these distinguished Senators \nreached out to Members on the other side of the aisle to make this \nhappen, and they deserve enormous credit for their leadership.\n  Mr. President, I am supporting this legislation for four primary \nreasons. First, it will help ordinary, middle-class families and \nespecially their children. Second, it will promote education. Third, it \nwill help clean up our environment and promote economic development. \nAnd, fourth, it's part of a broader bipartisan agreement that will \nbalance the budget and prepare our Nation for the 21st century.\n  First, Mr. President, this legislation would provide valuable \nassistance to middle-class families in the form of a $500 tax credit \nfor children under the age of 17. This credit will help millions of \nordinary people who are raising their children, working hard, and \nstruggling to pay their bills. For these Americans, an extra $500 or \n$1,000 per year can go a long way. And, so long as our Nation can \nafford to provide this relief in the context of a balanced budget, I \nthink it's the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the child tax credit \nincluded in this legislation will be available to lower income families \nwho also qualify for the earned income tax credit, or EITC. This proved \nto be one of the most contentious issues in the conference, much to my \nsurprise. Yet some around here argued that providing direct tax relief \nto police officers, nurses, and teachers somehow amounted to welfare. I \nnever understood the logic of that. But, fortunately, Democrats made \nthis a top priority. And, in the end, these hard-working Americans will \nbe able to benefit from the child tax credit.\n  Mr. President, the second major element of this legislation is the \nsection that promotes education. The bill includes a $1,500 tax credit \nto help students afford the first 2 years of college. In addition, \nthere's a tax credit worth up to $1,000 for those who want to pursue \nadditional education beyond that.\n  This latter benefit will be available to adults of all ages. And it's \nespecially important. In an increasingly technological age, education \nmust be a life-long process. And it's something that we should \nencourage and support.\n  Mr. President, the third major reason why I'm supporting this \nlegislation is that it includes new incentives to clean up thousands of \ncontaminated, abandoned sites in economically distressed areas. That \nnot only will improve the environment, but it will help encourage \nredevelopment of these areas, known as brownfields. It's a win-win \napproach that will make a real difference for communities around our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, the final reason I am supporting this legislation is \nthat it's part of the broad bipartisan budget agreement that I helped \nnegotiate with leaders from both parties and the President. That \nagreement will provide several benefits outside the tax area that we \nnever could have achieved without this broader compromise.\n  We're getting $24 billion to provide health care coverage for \nuninsured children. We're restoring disability benefits for legal \nimmigrants. We're ensuring that 30,000 disabled children don't lose \ntheir Medicaid coverage. We're investing $3 billion to move people from \nwelfare to work. And the list goes on.\n  None of these important advances would have been possible without a \nbroad bipartisan agreement. And to get that agreement, Democrats had to \naccept some significant new tax breaks that we otherwise would have \nresisted.\n  Mr. President, I, for one, do not share the faith of my Republican \nfriends that cutting taxes for rich Americans is the ticket to economic \ngrowth. We've tried trickle-down economics in the past. And it's proved \nnot only unfair, but ineffective in promoting the economy.\n  Most Democrats have a different approach, Mr. President. We like to \nfocus on tax cuts for ordinary Americans. The people who work hard, \nraise their kids, and who often have a hard time keeping their heads \nabove water.\n  In other words, Mr. President, rather than showering tax breaks on \nthe rich and having that money trickle down, we'd rather provide relief \nto ordinary Americans, and allow those funds to flow back up.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, while this bill does contain some new tax \nbreaks for the very wealthy, the bulk of its benefits are focused on \nthe middle class. The most expensive element in the package is the \nchild tax credit. The next most expensive area is education. Both of \nthese types of tax relief are targeted on people who really could use \nthe help.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, there clearly are other provisions, \nsuch as the capital gains rate cut and the backloaded IRA, I'm \nconcerned about the costs of these new tax breaks, especially in the \nfuture. If it were up to me, I would have done much more to constrain \nthose costs.\n  But, Mr. President, these provisions were necessary to reach the \nbroader agreement. There simply would not have been a deal without \nthem. And so, on the whole, many on this side of the aisle felt that \nthis was the price we had to pay to get the other benefits in the \nbudget agreement.\n  At least, Mr. President, the legislation before us does not include \nsome of the more egregious proposals that would have exploded the \ndeficit in the future.\n  But the bottom line, Mr. President, is that, though it has real \nflaws, I am going to support this legislation. And I would encourage my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  No, it's not perfect legislation. But it's part of a compromise that \nwill do a lot of good. It provides significant tax relief to middle-\nclass families. It will help millions of Americans afford college. It \nwill encourage millions of others to pursue their educations throughout \ntheir lives. It will lead to the cleanup and redevelopment of many \nabandoned sites around our nation. And it's part of a bipartisan plan \nthat will balance the budget and prepare our Nation for the next \ncentury.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to vote in favor of the \nTaxpayer Relief Act, which will provide the first significant tax cut \nto working Americans in 16 years.\n  Although I still believe that we ought to move to a system of a \nfairer, flatter tax without myriad exemptions and deductions, this bill \nrepresents an important first step toward relieving the tax burden on \nworking Americans and families. This tax bill provides a net tax \nreduction of $96 billion over 5 years while remaining on a glide path \ntoward a balanced budget.\n  Specifically, I am pleased that the final package includes a $500 per \nchild tax credit, tax incentives for education, including education \nIRA's, a modified Hope Scholarship and tax free treatment of State \nprepaid tuition plans. It also takes important steps toward expanding \nparticipation in IRA's, a reduction in the capital gains tax and AMT, \nand incentives for small business by reinstatement of the home office \nbusiness deduction and an acceleration in the phase in of the self-\nemployed health insurance deduction.\n  On estate taxes, an area where I have long believed that we must have \nrelief, this bill would help family farmers and small businesses by \nincreasing the exclusion to $1.3 million. It would also increase the \nexclusion for families to $1 million over 10 years.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President when combined with the budget savings \nbill passed earlier today, we have made real progress on putting our \nfinancial house in order and providing necessary tax relief to millions \nof Americans.\n\n\n                repeal of limit on sec. 501(c)(3) bonds\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, one provision of H.R. 2014 would repeal \nthe $150 million limit on section 501(C)(3) bonds. This is a change I \nhave long sought, and I am grateful for my chairman's support for this \nchange. It is my understanding that the intention of the provision is \nthat bonds that meet the requirements of the bill will be eligible for \ntax-exempt treatment without being subject to the $150 million \nlimitation. Furthermore, these bonds will not be taken into account \nwith respect to other qualified section 501(C)(3)\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\nbonds that are subject to the $150 million limitation, which bonds may \ncontinue to be issued on a tax-exempt basis to finance and refinance \nexpenditures as permitted under existing law.\n  Mr. ROTH. I agree with the Senator's interpretation of this provision \nof the bill.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I must admit that I was less than pleased \nwith the spending portion of the budget reconciliation package. I \nregret that I was unable to give that section my support. \nUnfortunately, we failed to address the problem of growth in \nentitlement spending. We passed on making some needed reforms to the \nMedicare system. We owe our children and grandchildren much more, Mr. \nPresident. I am much more pleased with the tax portion of the budget \nreconciliation package. One of my primary goals has always been to \nreduce the tax burden on hard-working Americans. I am proud to say that \nwe will take a step toward this goal today. For the first time in 16 \nyears, we give the American people a measure of tax relief. I am \nespecially pleased that we are taking steps to reduce two of the most \nonerous and economically harmful taxes--the capital gains tax and the \ndeath tax.\n  Mr. President, with this act today, we will move in the direction of \nprotecting family farms and businesses from Uncle Sam's grasping arms. \nUnder current law, many family farms and small businesses have to be \nsold off just to pay the taxes on the founder's estate. This is tragic \nand irresponsible. But today, we will change that law to allow estates \ncontaining small businesses and family farms to deduct the first $1.3 \nmillion of the value of the estate. This change in death tax law is a \ngood step in the right direction, although I must emphasize that it is \nonly a first step. No family owned business or farm should have to be \nsold to pay death taxes. I will continue to fight to see that no family \nowned business is ever again the victim of the Federal Government's \ninsatiable appetite for more money.\n  We also make some good progress in the area of capital gains tax \nrelief in this bill. Under current law, the U.S. has one of the highest \ncapital gains tax rates in the world. These high rates have the \nperverse effect of punishing those who help our economy to grow by \nsaving and investing and they raise the cost of capital, thereby \nlowering growth in productivity. With this bill today, we will reduce \nthis economically harmful tax.\n  Although we did not get the indexing provisions that I championed, \nmost investors will get a reduced rate of 18 percent if they hold an \nasset purchased after 2000 for more than 5 years. Low-income investors \nwill be charged an even lower rate of 8 percent for long-term \ninvestments. In addition, we are reducing the rate on all capital. Most \ntaxpayers will now be charged a 20 percent rate and those in the lowest \nincome bracket will only have to pay 10 percent. The 43 percent of \nAmericans that now invest in stocks in one form or another will benefit \nfrom these provisions.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased with these steps that we are taking today \nto reduce these economically harmful and unfair taxes, and I am proud \nto say that I will support this portion of the budget reconciliation \npackage. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to \nenact further tax reduction measures that will help our family farms \nand small businesses.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the United Kingdom deregulated its \nelectric utilities in 1990. There is now a central power pool. Power \nstations with capacities of over 10 megawatts are ordinarily required \nto sell all electricity generated into the pool. Consumers buy from the \npool or from regional electric companies that buy from the pool\n  Thus, for example, if an independent generator wanted to build a \npower station to supply electricity to an oil refinery in England, it \nmight lease land from the refinery and build the power station. \nHowever, a direct sale of electricity to the refinery would not be \npermitted. The generator would sell electricity to the pool, and the \nrefinery would buy from that pool. The pool prices change each half \nhour based on demand and supply and, therefore, fluctuate frequently.\n  The refinery will want protection against price fluctuations. \nConsequently, it will enter into a contract for differences with the \ngenerator. The parties will agree on a schedule of fixed prices that \nthe generator would have charged had the generator been free to make a \ndirect sale. When the pool price exceeds the agreed price in the \nschedule, the generator will pay the refinery the difference. The \nrefinery will pay the generator the difference when the pool price is \nless. Thus, the differences contract is a way for both parties to buy \ncertainty. The generator is certain of his revenue stream. The refinery \nis certain of how much electricity will cost over an extended period. \nIt is a hedging agreement.\n  It my understanding that the relevant provision in the bill does not \nturn payments under such differences contracts into subpart F income. \nWould the Chairman clarify this understanding?\n  Mr. ROTH. The legislation is not intended to affect arrangements \nwhich do not constitute notional principal contracts under present law. \nIn addition, the legislation is not intended to change the treatment of \nnotional principal contracts entered into as part of a hedging \narrangement referred to elsewhere in section 954.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                                 amtrak\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the conference agreement to H.R. 2014 \nincludes a provision to provide Amtrak up to $2.3 billion during the \nnext 2 years. This funding provision would be provided in the form of \ntax credits. While I have already made my concerns known regarding this \nprovision, I note that it would require enactment of reform legislation \nprior to the Treasury providing these credits to Amtrak.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, which has jurisdiction over Amtrak, I would like to \nascertain for the record what the authors of this tax credit provision \nenvision would constitute reforms. Since I was not a conferee, I would \nappreciate the majority leader clarifying this matter and explaining \nthe conferees intent.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be happy to offer clarification to the Chairman of \nthe Amtrak authorizing Committee. As members know, we have spent \nsignificant congressional time working to develop comprehensive Amtrak \nreform and reauthorization legislation. As Members further know, I \nworked for 2 years on a bipartisan reform package in the 104th \nCongress. Senator Hutchison has picked up this legislation effort and \nhas worked diligently to advance the process. However, we cannot \njustify new Federal subsidies for Amtrak unless we also fix the many \nimpediments imposed by statute which prevent Amtrak from operating like \na business. Comprehensive reforms in the areas of Amtrak operations, \nlabor, and liability must be enacted if we are serious about addressing \nAmtrak's financial crisis. Amtrak cannot survive without these \nfundamental changes. Money alone will not address Amtrak's systemic \nproblems.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader for his comments. From your \ndescription, the reforms you envision to release this new funding for \nAmtrak are the type of reforms included for in S. 738, the Amtrak \nReform and Accountability Act of 1997. That bill, sponsored by the \nChairwoman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee, Senator Hutchison, was approved by the Commerce Committee \non June 26, 1997. I note that the sponsor of S. 738 is on the floor. I \nwould like to ask what her intentions are for moving that bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you. I had hoped we would be able to accomplish \nthe necessary Amtrak reforms within the context of this tax bill. I \nbelieve that Members of the Senate from both parties were prepared to \ndo that. Given that Amtrak has warned us it could reach bankruptcy by \nthe spring of 1998, the reforms embodied in S. 738, which include labor \nreforms and limits on liability, are simply critical. I am committed to \nmoving S. 738 as soon as possible after the August recess. The Chairman \nof the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee shares my \ncommitment to provide honest legislative reforms in order to release \nthe tax credits to Amtrak. I hope the majority leader will work with me \nto assure timely floor action.\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I look forward to having the full Senate consider the \nauthorization legislation reported by the Senate Commerce Committee and \nwill be happy to work with the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader and Senator Hutchison for \nclarifying this issue. The reform language in this tax bill linked to \nthe release of tax credits clearly means comprehensive, substantive, \nmeaningful reforms to ensure Amtrak operates more efficiently and to \nset up a process that will protect taxpayers if Amtrak does not meet \nits financial goals. Let there be no misunderstanding. There will be no \nnew funding provided to Amtrak until we first enact legislation \nproviding operational, labor and liability reforms. The hard working \nmen and women whose tax dollars are subsidizing Amtrak deserve to have \ntheir contributions invested as responsibly as possible. I stand ready \nto work with the majority leader and the subcommittee chairman to bring \nthis reform measure before the full Senate.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the Tax Relief Act of \n1997. I commend the Finance Committee and the leadership, along with \nthe Budget Committee, for their hard work.\n  This bill, along with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, fulfills our \npromise to the American people--to restrain Government spending, and to \nbring Tax Relief to the American people.\n  This tax reduction act has some tax relief for all Americans, at all \nstages of life. The child tax credit will boost the family budget for \nparents with children.\n  Homeowners, and others with capital assets will benefit from the \ncapital gains tax reduction. The education provisions will encourage \nsavings and assist all students. The bill has provisions for savings \nand investment, and for businesses. This will encourage economic growth \nand promote employment. Finally, there are estate tax reforms which \nwill help preserve family businesses and farms.\n  Mr. President, this Nation has waited too long for a balanced \nbudget--nearly 30 years; and it has been 16 years since we have \ndelivered any significant tax relief. These measures passed today keep \nus on the track of smaller government and a strong economy.\n  I am proud to support this measure, because it is good for the people \nof South Carolina and good for the Nation. It is a good down payment \ntoward a simpler, fairer, and less burdensome tax system.\n  Finally, Mr. President, these two bills put us on course to fiscal \nresponsibility. We must continue to keep spending within the limits of \nour resources, and begin to reduce the national debt. We owe no less to \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2014, the \nconference report on tax relief. Through this tax package, we can give \nthe American people the first serious tax reduction package in 16 \nyears. This legislation provides tax relief to families with children, \nit offers greatly needed relief for small business, and it encourages \neducation and investment. Finally this legislation gives some relief to \nindividuals and small businesses from the punitive Federal death tax. I \ncommend the Chairmen of the Finance and Budget Committees and the other \nconferees for their hard work on this package. We must realize that we \nstill have a long journey ahead in relieving the tax burden on American \ntaxpayers and in simplifying the cumbersome tax code.\n  Mr. President, our tax burden in this country is overwhelming. We tax \nincome, we tax investment, and we tax savings. In fact, we have pretty \nwell figured out a way of taxing a person from the time he gets up in \nthe morning to the time he goes to bed. From the time you wake up in \nthe morning and have your first cup of coffee, you are paying sales \ntax. When you get in your car and drive to work, you are paying \ngasoline tax. As you work all day to support your family, you are also \nsupporting the Government by paying income tax. When you go home and \nspend time with your family and finally go to bed, you are paying \nproperty tax. If you decide to make a telephone call or turn on the \nlight switch, you get taxed for that too. This taxation on almost all \nyour daily activities goes on your entire life and to add insult to \ninjury, we even tax you when you die. It is a tragic situation in this \ncountry when most people spend more money on taxes than they spend on \nfood, clothing, and shelter combined. It is time that we relieve this \ntax burden on our Americans.\n  Just as our tax burden is too high, our Tax Code is frustratingly \ncomplex. Like a critically-ill patient, the Internal Revenue Code is in \ndesperate need of surgery. We have continued to operate our Tax Code \nwith layer after layer of bandages while ignoring the gasps of the \ndying patient beneath. This complexity has often left even the \nprofessional tax preparers in a quandary about the meaning of the \nmyriad of code provisions and revenue regulations. When even the \nexperts cannot understand our Tax Code, it is time for meaningful \nreform.\n  I had the pleasure of conducting a small business committee field \nhearing in Casper, WY, this past April in order to find out the \nconcerns facing many of our small businesses. One of the consistent \nmessages I received from the hearing was that the complexity of our Tax \nCode is strangling small businesses. Even the representatives from the \naccounting profession testified that our Tax Code is in desperate need \nof simplification. They are concerned about their own liability because \nthey cannot even count on representatives of the Internal Revenue \nService to understand the Tax Code they attempt to enforce. I have \nfound that many of these accountants are reluctant to simplify the \ncode, however, because every time we've attempted to simplify the Tax \nCode, we have ended up raising taxes. We in Congress must begin by \nreevaluating our tax policy. We will be able to accurately chart our \ncourse only if we know where we are going.\n  This conference report takes an important step in lessening the tax \nburden on individuals and small businesses alike. This tax package \nprovides broad-based tax relief for America's families. The $500-per-\nchild tax credit would provide over $70 billion in tax relief for \nfamilies over the next 5 years. The child credit has long been \nchampioned by the Republican Party as a means of helping in the \nevergrowing cost of raising families. Our Tax Code has failed miserably \nto keep up with the ever-growing demands of raising children. The \ncurrent exemption for dependent children is less than one-half what it \nshould be to keep pace with inflation. Many of America's families have \ntwo parents working with one working to pay the bills and the other \nworking to pay the taxes. We should be working to strengthen our \nfamilies in any way we can, and this credit will help in that effort.\n  Mr. President, this package moves us a step closer to the eventual \nrepeal of the punitive death tax. This is an area I have taken a \nspecial interest in since the Federal death tax adversely impacts a \nlarge number of small businesses and farms in Wyoming. The death tax \npunishes people who work hard their entire lives in order to pass \nsomething on to their children. This bill increase the exemption for \nindividuals and provides for a $700,000 exclusion for family owned \nbusinesses. This exclusion was an important priority for me. I joined \nseveral of my colleagues in urging the conferees to include a provision \nwhich excludes the death tax for family businesses and farms. We need \nto build on this foundation and work toward an eventual repeal of the \nFederal death tax.\n  Mr. President, this bill gets us closer to leveling the playing field \nbetween small businesses and their larger competitors. Most notably, it \naccelerates the phase in for the deduction of health insurance for the \nself-employed and it reinstates the home office business deduction. As \na small businessman myself, I was pleased to see some tax relief going \nto those who form the backbone of our economy.\n  This legislation also encourages education by providing tax credits \nfor tuition and expenses for college and technical school training as \nwell as tax deductions for the interest on student loans. These tuition \ntax credits will provide the means for many students to pursue a \ncollege education or receive technical training. The tax deduction for \nindividuals who have already invested in college or graduate education \nprovide tax relief for one of the largest investments many people will \nmake in their lifetime.\n  Mr. President, this package makes important strides toward \nencouraging\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\nAmericans to save and to invest for their future. We currently have a \ndangerously low savings rate in this country, and this is due in large \npart to our current tax structure which not only taxes income but it \ntaxes savings. This bill expands the availability of tax-free \nIndividual Retirement Accounts to include nonworking spouses and it \ncreates a new ``super IRA'' the proceeds of which can be withdrawn tax-\nfree for purposes such as first time home purchases.\n  We also provide relief for investment by providing for long-overdue \ncapital gains relief. This bill cuts the top capital gains rate from 28 \npercent to 20 percent and reduces the 15 percent rate to 10 percent for \nassets held longer than 18 months. This reduction of the capital gains \nrate will benefit millions of Americans. A news report just this week \nshowed that nearly one-half of Americans have some current investment \nin the stock market. Many companies have allowed their employees to \ninvest in their future by buying stock in the company. Many of these \nemployees have counted on this investment for retirement. This package \nprovides relief for people who have planned wisely for their future.\n  Mr. President, I support his tax relief proposal because I believe we \nneed to return some of the Americans' money back to them this year. \nThis legislation will return over $90 million to those who have paid \nthe taxes. It has been far too long since Congress has passed a tax \nrelief package for the American families and small business, and I \napplaud this effort. We must not, however, believe that our work is \ndone. Rather, it has just begun. We must now focus our attention and \neffort on the reducing the enormous complexity of the Internal Revenue \nCode. We need to set our sights on the clearly defining our Nation's \ntax policy, and then muster the reserve to implement our goals with \nsimplicity and fairness. As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I \nfully realize the need of reforming a tax code so that it strengthens \nfamilies, encourages enterprise and thrift, and rewards savings. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in this most important endeavor.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n          tax incentives that promote forestland conservation\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senator from \nDelaware [Mr. Roth], included language in this tax bill, H.R. 2014, the \nRevenue Reconciliation Act, which promotes land conservation through \nthe use of conservation easements and allowing the postmortem election \nof these easements. Still, I believe that more must be done in the \nfuture to ensure that forestland, especially in the Northeast, is \npreserved. This issue is of particular importance in the Northeast, \nwhere 85 percent of our forestland is in private ownership.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from New \nHampshire, and I intend to work with him in a bipartisan manner to \npromote land conservation by pushing forward the recommendations made \nby the Northern Forest Lands Council in 1994. As highlighted in S. 552, \nthe Forestland Preservation Tax Act, certain tax polices work against \nthe long-term ownership and management of forestland and instead force \nlandowners to sell or change the use of their land. H.R. 2014 begins to \naddress this program with the provisions for conservation easements and \nestate tax relief for small businesses and family farms. In the \nNortheast, the timber production is part of our agriculture and faces \nmany of the same challenges as family farms.\n  Mr. ROTH. I agree with both Senators and look forward to working with \nboth of you on these issues in the future.\n\n\n                        Child Health Provisions\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith Chairman Roth to clarify the conference agreement as it relates to \nthe children's health initiative. First, the issue of what benefits \nmust be provided to children has been very important to us in this \nChamber, on both sides of the aisle. Under the conference report, a \nState covering children under the new title XXI must offer at least the \ncoverage listed under the options specified in section 2103(a). Do \nthese options establish floors or ceilings?\n  Mr. ROTH. These four options are floors. States are given flexibility \nto design their programs, while meeting the standards of section \n2103(a). States may also build upon the benchmark packages. With grant \nfunds, States, if they wish, may provide additional benefit coverage, \nbut they must provide at least the coverage described in section \n2103(a). For example, a State may supplement the benchmark-equivalent \npackage of the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan for Federal \nemployees by expanding vision, dental, and hearing services benefits.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Another benchmark is the coverage for State employees. \nIt is my understanding that this benchmark coverage is equivalent to \nthe health benefit plans in which State employees are enrolled. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, this benchmark allows States to provide children with \ncoverage benefits equivalent to the health benefit plans that enroll \nState employees.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Another clarification. Is it intended that children, \nincluding those with special needs, receive quality care?\n  Mr. ROTH. The conferees expect State programs to provide access to \nappropriate treatment for special needs children. In addition, the new \nlegislation is clear that children who are eligible for Medicaid under \ncurrent law may not be shifted to the new program under title XXI. \nMedicaid coverage may not be rolled back and replaced by new insurance \nprograms. For example, the new program cannot replace an existing \nmedically needy program for children or existing Medicaid eligibility \nthrough waivers for children receiving home and community based care.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for his helpful remarks. I would also emphasize that, in the \nFinance Committee, members on both sides of the aisle strongly agreed \nthat these child health grants should not supplant current State \nspending, and instead would supplement and enhance current State child \nhealth insurance programs. The conference report included such \nmaintenance of effort provisions. To ensure a cost-effective grant \nprogram, Federal funds should not replace existing State spending.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee has worked closely with me on a provision in this bill to \nclarify the application of section 168(j) of the Internal Revenue Code \nto Indian lands in Oklahoma.\n  Section 168(j) was enacted in 1993 to provide accelerated \ndepreciation for property placed in service on Indian reservations. \nSince Oklahoma has no formal reservations, the House of Representatives \nincluded a provision in their tax bill to clarify that lands in \nOklahoma within the jurisdictional area of an Oklahoma Indian tribe and \neligible for trust-land status would qualify for section 168(j).\n  As the chairman knows, the Senate receded to the House provision in \nconference. However, since the House leaves the interpretation of the \nprovisions to the U.S. Department of the Interior, I believe it is \nessential that we clarify congressional intent.\n  There needs to be a ``bright-line'' test for determining which \nOklahoma lands qualify for section 168(j) in order to treat Oklahoma \nfairly compared to other States and to avoid costly litigation. The \nDepartment of the Interior has indicated that ``lands in Oklahoma \nwithin the jurisdictional area of an Oklahoma Indian tribe'' would be \ndefined as lands within boundaries of the last treaties with the \nOklahoma tribes. This definition narrows the land area compared with \ncurrent law by eliminating the unassigned lands.\n  Because I believe it is important that we clarify this matter, does \nthe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee concur with my \nexplanation?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct. I thank the Senator \nfor his cooperation on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(c) of the Budget \nAct I submit the following list of extraneous material for H.R. 2014, \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\n\n\n EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS--CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2014--TAXPAYER RELIEF \n                               ACT OF 1997                              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Provision                        Comments/Violation      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSec. 901...............................

Unfortunately, I understand the Conference Agreement on \nH.R. 2014 takes no action to equalize the rate of deficit reduction \nfuel taxes paid by the various modes of transportation. As the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee and I have discussed, \nan obvious inequity currently exists which requires that railroads pay \na 5.55 cents-per-gallon fuel excise tax, while all other modes of \ntransportation pay no more than 4.3 cents-per-gallon for this purpose. \nIn fact, by transferring deficit reduction taxes paid by other \ntransportation users, including truckers which compete with the \nrailroads, into trust funds for infrastructure improvements, we \nexacerbate the current inequity. Railroads continue to contribute to \ndeficit reduction, while their competitors instead contribute to their \nown infrastructure.\n  If transportation is to be singled out for deficit reduction, the \nburden of contributing to a balanced budget should be shared equally \namong all modes. While I regret that no solution to this problem was \npossible in this legislation, I hope you share my belief that the fuel \ntax inequity imposed on the Nation's railroads must be remedied at the \nearliest opportunity.\n  Mr. ROTH. As the Senator from Rhode Island knows, I am deeply \nconcerned about the unfair situation faced by railroads. While we were \nunable to include a solution to this problem in H.R. 2014, it is my \nhope that we will have the opportunity to pursue such a remedy as \nquickly as possible, perhaps in the upcoming ISTEA reauthorization \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me express my appreciation to the Chairman, Senator \nRoth, for his interest in this important issue. I look forward to \nworking with him on this matter during the upcoming ISTEA legislation.\n\n\n                       puerto rico tax incentives\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I joined with Senators Moynihan, Chafee, \nHatch, Graham, and Breaux recently in introducing S. 906, which would \nprovide job creation incentives for our fellow 3.8 million American \ncitizens in Puerto Rico. I am disappointed that these incentives were \nnot included in the bill before us today, H.R. 2014, the Taxpayers \nRelief Act.\n  S. 906 had the unified support of the public and private sectors in \nPuerto Rico, was endorsed by the President, and has received bipartisan \nsupport in Congress. It was my goal to include this job creation \nincentive in today's legislation. But because of extreme economic \nconstraints on available resources, this was not possible.\n  As a result of the changes made to tax incentives affecting Puerto \nRico in 1993 and 1996, Puerto Rico has no Federal economic incentives \nto attract new businesses or jobs. Further, existing U.S. companies \noperating on the island have little incentive to make new investments \nor replace depreciating plant and equipment. This is inequitable and \nshould be changed. Our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, where there is \nan unemployment rate more than twice the national average, and well \nover 50 percent of its population living below the poverty line, can \nleast afford to suffer economic setbacks.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to consider S. 906, or other \nincentives for economic growth in Puerto Rico at the first available \nopportunity. This legislation provides a wage-based tax credit that \nencourages U.S. companies to stay and expand on the island.\n  We cannot wait until the damage is done. Puerto Rican Americans, no \nless than Americans living in the States, should be receiving the \nbenefits of economic growth and job creation that the Taxpayer Relief \nAct provides to so many others.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the tax \ncut package being considered before us today.\n  Not since 1981 have we been able to offer the American people as \ncomprehensive a tax relief package as we are offering in this tax bill. \nThrough this historic tax bill we will offer American families much \nneeded tax relief in the form of $500 per child tax credit, capital \ngains tax rate cuts, as well as an increase in the unified credit \nexemption for death taxes. Families will also be able to save through \ntax relief for education expenses.\n  But this is just the beginning.\n  Cutting taxes and shrinking government spending are two things that \nwill help to remove the obstacles that impede the progress of our \neconomy. We must continue to cut taxes even more.\n  Current estimates by the Congressional Budget Office place our \ndeficit this year around $45 billion. With a robust economy and \ncontinually declining deficits we could easily reach a balanced budget \nnext year--we might even go into surplus for the first time in well \nover a generation--something that would truly make this budget deal \nhistoric.\n  In the spending portion of the budget deal the Administration has \nstated that the amounts agreed to are enough for the operation of the \nfederal government. Although I believe that we need to reduce the size \nof the federal government even further.\n  We have a deal that limits government, we cannot and should not let \ngovernment grow beyond what we have agreed to here today when revenues \nexceed the costs of the operation of the federal government.\n  The question is now upon us as to what we should do next--what we \nshould do after having achieved the goals so boldly outlined just three \nshort years ago. The debate is no longer about whether we should \nbalance the budget or not--it's not about whether we should cut taxes \nor not--we have done those things. The debate before us is now in terms \nof a more limited government with lower taxes. The next question is now \nthat we have agreed on the acceptable size of government what should we \ndo next.\n  The short answer is we must continue to cut taxes.\n  Surpluses that are generalized either next year or five years from \nnow must be used for further tax reduction. We must make it clear that \nour priority is to provide Americans with as much tax relief as \npossible--and using surpluses to provide additional tax relief makes \nthat priority clear. Cutting taxes will continue to fuel the economy \nand will further unleash the potential of our economy to perform at \nfull speed. For too long the Congress has worked to hinder the \nfunctioning of our economy by imposing a multilayered tax system that \npunishes success more than it rewards it.\n\n  We must continue to cut taxes and to make that our priority as we \nmove into the next century.\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\n  Currently, whenever revenues come into the Treasury higher than \nestimated the revenues automatically go to deficit reduction and will \neventually contribute to paying down the Federal debt once we are \nrunning a surplus.\n  I believe that it is critical that we continue to eliminate the \ndeficit and pay down the debt--but we must do that in the context of \nlower taxes for the American people. We can do both--we can provide the \nAmerican taxpayers with much needed tax relief and pay down the debt by \nallocating excess revenues to both tax reduction and debt reduction. \nBut we must be vigilant in ensuring that excess revenues do not go to \nmore Government spending; they must go to tax cuts and debt reduction \nalone.\n  We must continue to limit the size, scope, and intrusiveness of the \nFederal Government. We must further limit Government and force its \nshrinkage through a continuing effort to cut taxes.\n  And when we cut the size of Government further we must return the \nmoney to the taxpayers who have been forced to subsidize its woefully \ninefficient operations for much of this century. The taxpayers deserve \na break.\n  Now, however, we must reject any notions of relaxing at having \ncompleted this historic budget deal. Rather, we must pick up again, and \nbegin again, fighting for more tax relief, more tax cuts, and a \nsmaller, less intrusive Federal Government.\n  The American people have said they want these things--now we must \nbind ourselves to provide those things--it would be irresponsible to do \notherwise.\n  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 2014, the \nRevenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. This conference report is the \nproduct of months of effort by Members of the Senate as well as our \ncolleagues in the other body and representatives of the administration. \nThis legislation also represents the first real tax cut for the \nAmerican people in over a decade. Today, Americans are bearing an \nenormous burden when it comes to income taxes. According to a recent \nstudy by the Tax Foundation, the per capita Federal tax burden has \nincreased 36.5 percent since 1992 and 57.5 percent since 1988, largely \nbecause of the severity of the administration's 1993 tax increase.\n  In simple terms, the tax burden on Americans today is too high. Many \nAmericans now pay more in taxes than they do for food, clothing, and \nhousing combined. This bill takes a positive step toward easing that \nburden in an effort to let the hard-working men and women in this \ncountry keep more of the money they earn.\n  While the provisions of this bill reduces taxes in a variety of ways, \nI want to focus on two important groups who will benefit the most from \nthis legislation--our American families and the millions of small \nbusinesses across the Nation.\n\n\n                           family tax relief\n\n  Family tax relief is a critical part of the conference report that we \nconsider today. The child tax credit has long been a Republican \npriority, and as a result of this bill, it is now a reality. Beginning \nin 1998, families will be able to claim a $400 credit per child, which \nwill increase to $500 beginning in 1999. In addition, by making the \ncredit available for children under age 17, we help many families when \nthey need it the most. As a parent, I can attest to the fact that the \ncosts of raising a child explode during the teenage years, and through \nthis bill millions of parents will not have to struggle so much to meet \nthose higher expenses.\n  The availability of this credit will benefit more than 43 million \nchildren and their families. In fact, the Joint Economic Committee \nestimates that a married couple in my State of Missouri who earn \n$30,000 a year and have two children will see their Federal tax burden \ncut in half. That means that those families will be able to keep \nsignificantly more of their hard-earned income and use it to put food \non the table rather than subsidizing the huge Federal bureaucracy.\n  On the education front, the Revenue Reconciliation Act provides \nrelief for millions of students seeking to better themselves and learn \na trade or other profession. The bill establishes the Hope Scholarship \nand the Lifetime Learning tax credits, which will offset some of the \nhigh costs that families must bear to continue their children's \neducation after high school.\n  In addition, this legislation will benefit nearly 5 million students \nthrough tuition tax relief in the form of State-sponsored prepaid \ntuition programs and new educational IRA's. These programs will allow \nparents to contribute to education savings accounts for a child \nbeginning at an early age. As those contributions grow tax-free, a fund \nwill be created to pay for tuition, room and board, and related \nexpenses when the child goes to a qualifying college or vocational \nschool.\n  For many students, however, higher education is only possible if they \nfinance all or part of the expense through student loans. \nUnfortunately, after accumulating 4 years of such loans, these students \noften graduate into starting positions and large monthly loan payments. \nI am very pleased that this bill will assist over 7 million students in \nthis situation by restoring a tax deduction for interest paid on \nstudent loans. This provision will help today's student who will not \nhave had the benefit of the long-term educational savings accounts \ncreated under the bill, and it will recognize the responsibility and \ncommitment that they undertook to achieve their higher education goals.\n  While this bill provides important tax relief for families with \nchildren and for young adults expanding their education, it also helps \nthose planning for their retirement years. The bill reduces the \nlimitations on individual retirement accounts and will enable more \nAmericans to use IRA's to save for their retirement. The legislation \nwill also encourage both spouses to save for retirement by permitting a \nnonworking spouse to contribute to an IRA regardless of whether the \nworking spouse participates in a pension plan. These changes will not \nonly ensure greater retirement security, but will also bolster our \nnational savings rate, which is now one of the lowest among \nindustrialized nations.\n\n\n                       small business tax relief\n\n  Mr. President, as the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I \nam very pleased that this legislation makes great strides for reducing \nthe enormous tax burdens on the small businesses in this country. \nAccording to the Small Business Administration, small firms in this \ncountry employ 53 percent of the private work force, contribute 47 \npercent of all sales in the country, and are responsible for 50 percent \nof the private gross domestic product. In addition, industries \ndominated by small businesses produced an estimated 75 percent of the \n2.5 million new jobs created in 1995.\n  In recognition of the important role that small entrepreneurs play in \nthis country today, the Revenue Reconciliation Act contains several \nprovisions that will help level the playing field for small businesses \nand encourage their continued growth and development. First and most \nimportant, the bill increases the deductibility of health insurance for \nthe self-employed to 100 percent. This is truly a landmark victory for \nsmall entrepreneurs. For the first time, this legislation recognizes \nthat self-employed business owners are entitled to the same tax \ntreatment with respect to the deductibility of their health insurance \ncosts as their large competitors have received for many years.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation that would provide full \ndeductibility of health insurance for the self-employed beginning this \nyear. While I am disappointed that it will take 10 years under this \nbill to reach full deductibility, we are finally on the right path. Now \nwe can turn our attention to realizing that 100 percent level at the \nearliest possible date. Greater deductibility will help the 5.1 million \nuninsured self-employed individuals and their 1.4 million children to \nhave greater access to health insurance. It will also help the self-\nemployed who are already insured to maintain the cost of a single \nperson health-insurance policy, which in most cases is substantially \nmore expensive than a group insurance policy.\n  A second major victory for home-based businesses is the restoration \nof the home-office deduction, which is a major goal of the Home-Based \nBusiness Act that I introduced earlier this year. For too long home-\nbased businesses\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\nhave borne the inequality created by the Soliman decision, which \nradically limited the home-based businesses that could claim the \ndeduction. Even more troubling is the fact that many home-based \nbusinesses that would arguably meet the current criteria for the \ndeduction never claim it for fear of triggering an IRS audit. This bill \nputs home-based businesses on an equal footing with their larger \ncompetitors and clears the way for the continued success of these \nimportant entrepreneurs.\n  I am also pleased that we are able to provide a significant reduction \nin the estate tax for family owned businesses and farms. With less than \none-third of family owned businesses currently being passed on to a \nsecond generation, and only about one-eighth passed to a third \ngeneration, estate tax reform for family owned businesses and farms is \nurgently needed. This legislation will provide a $1.3 million exclusion \nfrom estate tax for these family owned enterprises. In addition, the \nbill will increase the individual estate tax credit to $1 million by \n2006. The result will not only be the preservation of many successful \nfamily owned businesses and farms that would otherwise have to be sold \nin order to pay the Federal Government, but it will also preserve the \nmillions of jobs that these enterprises contribute to our local \ncommunities.\n  Small businesses will also benefit from the capital gains provisions \nin the bill. My committee has heard on many occasions that small \nbusinesses need greater access to capital. I can think of no better way \nto address that need than by opening up the billions of dollars of \nbuilt-in gains that currently exists in our economy, which the capital \ngains tax reduction is expected to unleash. Small companies will also \nhave greater capital access through the provisions in the bill that \nwill allow tax-free rollover of gains from an investment in qualified \nsmall business stock into an investment in another qualified small \nbusiness. This provision will foster investments in small businesses \nand encourage existing investors to repeat their success stories by \nrolling over their gains into new start-up companies.\n  Additionally, millions of limited partners, many of whom work in \nsmall limited partnerships and limited liability companies, can rest \neasy as a result of the moratorium included in the bill that will \nprevent the IRS from finalizing its proposed stealth tax regulation \nbefore July 1, 1998. This proposed regulation purports merely to define \nwho is a limited partner. But in reality, the rule will raise taxes on \nmillions of limited partners by regulatory fiat. The Constitution vests \nthe power to impose taxes in Congress, and Congress alone. The \nmoratorium included in this bill will stop the IRS from usurping that \npower and give Congress an opportunity to exercise its authority to \nfind a statutory solution.\n  Finally, small business will have extended protection from IRS \npenalties under this legislation as a result of the 6-month extension \nof the penalty-free period for small businesses subject to the \nElectronic Federal Tax Payment System [EFTPS]. This past June, the IRS \nagreed to waive penalties through December 31, 1997, on small \nbusinesses who are required to pay their taxes electronically starting \non July 1, 1997. The bill extends the penalty-free period through June \n30, 1998, and will ensure that small firms will not be penalized if \nerrors or problems occur. In addition, it will give Congress time to \nenact the legislation, which Senator Nickles introduced and I have \ncosponsored, that would make EFTPS voluntary for most small businesses.\n  Mr. President, despite the many positive provisions in this bill for \nsmall business, there is one glaring omission--a safe harbor for \nindependent contractors. The need for such a provisions was made clear \nby the 2,000 delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small \nBusiness who named it the most important issue for the President and \nthe Congress to address. For too long millions of entrepreneurs and \nbusinesses that hire them have lived in constant fear that the IRS will \nuse its now infamous 20-factor test to find that a worker was \nmisclassified to the tune of thousands of dollars in back taxes, \ninterest, and penalties, not to mention the enormous costs of \naccountants and attorneys necessary to fight the IRS.\n  No one disputes that the IRS has a duty to collect Federal revenues \nand to enforce the tax laws. The problem in this case is that the IRS \nis using a procedure that is patently unfair and is doing so on an \nincreasingly frequent basis. It is time for companies, workers, and \nmost especially the IRS, to have clear rules for determining the status \nof workers.\n  The legislation that I introduced earlier this year reaches that goal \nthrough a general safe harbor based on clear, objective criteria and a \nbar against retroactive reclassification of workers by the IRS. I \nremain committed to working with those on all sides of this issue to \nfind an answer to this critical problem, and I call on my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join with me in that endeavor. Let's end the \nenvironment of fear in which small businesses and self-employed \nindividuals now must live. They should be able to spend less time \nlooking over their shoulder for an IRS audit, and more time doing what \nthey do best--contributing to the growth and strength of our economy \nand creating much-needed jobs.\n  Mr. President, the Revenue Reconciliation Act that we consider today \nwill help Americans in so many ways, from raising children and \neducating them to helping small businesses continue to be the economic \nengine of this country. In addition, it is the culmination of so many \nof the efforts that we began more than 2 years ago to bring meaningful \ntax relief to hard-working Americans across this country. I urge all of \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. ROTH.

He \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request that \nI think would be of great interest to all Senators?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am happy to do that.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe that everybody knows what is in \nthis bill now and Senators have had many opportunities to express their \nenthusiastic support for the bill. It seems to me that Senators are \nready to vote. If we can get this unanimous-consent agreement that I \nhave discussed with the Democratic leader, we would have this vote this \nafternoon and we would be through with our work and we would not have \nanother vote until Wednesday, September 3.\n  I ask unanimous-consent that the vote occur on adoption of the \npending tax fairness conference report at 6 p.m. this evening, and that \nno further action occur prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I reserve the \nright to object not for the purpose of objecting, but for the purpose \nof making a brief statement with respect to my vote on the last \nrollcall vote. I think the Senate made a mistake, and I had hoped to be \nhere in time to express my opposition to the motion to waive all points \nof order.\n  I think that was a mistake. These are the reasons why it is a \nmistake. I was not--along with most of the other Members of this body--\na conferee on this resolution. I know very little about what's in the \nbill--only by asking questions of staff and listening to other Members. \nBut I had nothing to do with the conference report that was brought \nback. Many of the Senators in here are in the same boat.\n  What goes into that conference report depends a lot on the actions of \nthe House of Representatives. They are a part of the conference report \nthat comes back here for us to vote on. Our only recourse--inasmuch as \nwe cannot amend the conference report, our only recourse, if indeed we \nwant to get a vote on something in that conference report, is to make a \npoint of order if the point of order is available.\n  The Byrd rule was devised for the purpose of keeping extraneous \nmatter off reconciliation measures because there was very little time \non a reconciliation bill for debate, and on a conference report, there \nis no opportunity to amend it. And so we devised the Byrd rule to keep \noff these pieces of extemporaneous legislation that were often complex, \ncostly, and needed to be aired and debated by the representatives of \nthe people. That was the purpose of the Byrd rule.\n  I looked over the Byrd rule violations that were involved here. I saw \nnone that I would question. Some of the Byrd rule violations are good, \nin my view. But at least I had the opportunity, I had the right to \nraise a point of order and get a vote. I could not amend the conference \nreport, so a point of order would be my only way to delete from the \nbill an extemporaneous matter and get a vote on it. And now the Senate \nhas adopted a motion that waived all points of order. It took away your \nrights, your rights, your rights, and my rights, if we had wanted to \nmake a point of order under the Byrd rule.\n  It was a bad precedent. What are we going to do the next time--the \nnext time we bring in a reconciliation bill? The first thing, if the \nmajority so wishes, could be to move to waive all points of order? They \nhave the votes. They have the votes. We might be in the majority the \nnext time, or we may not be.\n  Another thing that happens in these conferences is, the \nadministration, which is a separate branch of Government--and I still \nhold that there are three equal, coordinate branches of this \nGovernment. I don't salute the executive branch. I don't serve under \nany President. I serve with the President. But the administration goes \ninto these conferences, whether it is a Republican administration or a \nDemocratic administration, and tries to dominate those conferences, \ntries to get matters included in the conference report right at the \nlast minute so we won't have time to air them under the limited time \nfor debate. But there is still a point of order that a Senator has a \nright to make, and especially under the Byrd rule, because usually if \nthe administration wants to put in something, it may be an authorizing \nmeasure, it is something which ought to be debated. But because they \ncan get it in the reconciliation bill, if they can get by the Byrd rule \npoints of order, then they are home scot-free. I am opposed to that. I \nthink we made a mistake. It is a bad precedent. And I only wish I had \nhad time to express my viewpoint before we voted. Maybe it would not \nhave changed any votes, but still I would have had an opportunity. I \nthank all Senators for listening. I apologize for imposing on your \ntime.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, just 4 years ago, in 1993, in order to \nreduce the deficit, the Congress, by a narrow margin, enacted a budget \nresolution that curtailed programs and increased taxes--taxes that fell \nprimarily on those at the upper end of the income scale. This \ncombination of spending restraint and revenue increases represents a \nlogical way of dealing with the deficit issue.\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\n  This approach has worked in a most impressive way. The flourishing \neconomy has brought unemployment below 5 percent for the first time in \na quarter of a century. While unemployment is at a quarter-century low, \ninflation is at a 31-year low. I don't know what better proof you can \noffer of a strong economy than the low unemployment rate and low \ninflation rate we are now experiencing. As a consequence of this \nflourishing economy, the deficit has declined on a steady basis since \nfiscal year 1992. It has come straight down in each succeeding fiscal \nyear from $290 billion to $255 billion, to $203 billion, to $164 \nbillion, to $107 billion in the fiscal year that ended last September \n30, and it is now expected to be below $50 billion for the current \nfiscal year come this September 30.\n  As a percentage of gross domestic product, the deficit has gone from \n4.9 percent--a very worrisome figure--in 1992 to well under 1 percent \nfor the current fiscal year, the best performance since 1974. So you \nhave the best unemployment rate in 25 years, the lowest inflation in 31 \nyears, the lowest deficit as a percent of GDP in 23 years. We are doing \nfar better than any of the other major industrial countries. So it is a \nvery impressive economic and deficit-reduction performance indeed that \nwe are now witnessing.\n  Given this performance, one would think that the wise policy would be \nto stay the course and finish the job, that we would choose to continue \nfollowing the path on which we find ourselves. Today we have already \nenacted budget cuts and spending restraints, legislation which \nobviously works in the direction of deficit reduction. But now we are \npassing a tax cut when the objective, or so everyone states, is deficit \nreduction.\n  Tax cuts obviously work against deficit reduction. And the tax cuts \ncontained in this legislation are particularly destructive of deficit \nreduction in that they will grow over time in a way that may well \njeopardize the goal of reaching and staying in budget balance \naltogether.\n  The capital gains, inheritance, and IRA tax cuts all carry with them \nthe potential for substantial increases in future years. In fact, the \ntables put out by the Joint Tax Committee itself with respect to the \ntax cuts contained in this conference report tell this very tale. For \nthe first 5 years covered by this legislation--1998-2002--estate tax \ncuts will cost $6 billion in revenues. For the next 5 years, from 2003 \nto 2007, they will cost $28 billion in revenue. That is the upward \ntrendline from the first 5 years to the second 5 years. We don't have \nthe figures for beyond the initial 10-year period. They have not been \nprovided to us. So we are in a sense being asked to make this decision \nin the dark. But it is reasonable to assume that these estate tax cuts \nwill continue on that upward trajectory.\n  Capital gains cuts in this conference report are listed as producing \n$123 billion in revenues over the first 5-year period, 1998 to 2002, \nand then to cost $21 billion from 2003 to 2007 with no projection \nbeyond that point.\n  IRA's will cost $1.8 billion in the first 5 years, $18 billion in the \nnext 5 years. And the alternative minimum tax costs $8 billion in the \nfirst 5 years and $12 billion in the 5 years thereafter.\n  So, as everyone can see, we are on an upward trajectory that makes it \nreasonable to assume that the loss in revenues over the second 10-year \nperiod will be well in excess of $0.5 trillion.\n  This rising trend will, in effect, undercut--if not derail--the \ndeficit reduction effort.\n  Is it not imprudent--indeed, irresponsible--to commit to such tax \ncuts before we have actually achieved budget balance and before we have \na more accurate and realistic view of whether it can be sustained?\n  As the Baltimore Sun said in an editorial only yesterday, and I \nquote:\n\n       The question remains: Will the generous tax cuts come back \n     to haunt the country in the form of widening deficits as the \n     tax cuts take full effect several years down the road?'' The \n     answer, judging from the figures I have just cited, appears \n     to be yes.\n\n  Furthermore, let me note that all of this is premised on the economy \ncontinuing to function as strongly as it is functioning right now. In \neffect, with this tax cut, we are giving away our margin to engage in a \ncountercyclical fiscal policy, if we have an economic downturn. What \nwould we do in a downturn when, in fact, you might want to do a tax cut \nin order to stimulate the economy to help move us out of the recession \nwhen, in fact, you have proceeded to use up the margin for taking such \npolicy action with the legislation that is here before us.\n  Second, these tax provisions before us in this conference report are \nstrikingly inequitable, and result in a disproportionate share of the \nburdens of deficit reduction being placed on lower income individuals \nand families. The impact of the reduction in programs contained in the \nspending bill passed earlier today will be felt by ordinary working \npeople, primarily. The tax reductions contained in this legislation, \nfar from burdening upper income individuals, will primarily benefit \nthose at the top end of the income scale.\n  In fact, it has been reliably estimated that the top 1 percent of the \nincome scale will receive 30 percent of the tax benefits contained in \nthis conference report. The top 5 percent will receive 44 percent of \nthe benefits. And the top 20 percent, the upper quintile, will receive \n77 percent of the tax benefits contained in this conference report. I \nrepeat, the top quintile will receive 77 percent of the benefits.\n  By contrast, the bottom 60 percent, the lowest three quintiles, will \nreceive less than 7 percent of the benefits. So the top fifth of the \nincome pyramid is going to get 11 times the benefit that the bottom \nthree-fifths of the income pyramid will receive under this proposal.\n  There is no way that can be regarded as an equitable arrangement. \nAnd, in fact, what is happening here is, in order to move toward \ndeficit reduction, additional burdens are being put on working people. \nIn fact, under this conference report, the people at the top end of the \nscale, instead of making a contribution to deficit reduction, are \ngetting out from some of the burden which they now bear, a burden which \nhas helped to bring the deficit down to the point at which we find \nourselves today.\n  A budget agreement and the tax measure to implement it should \nundertake equitable deficit reduction apportioning the burdens in a way \nthat it is reasonably spread across the entire society, as was done in \n1993 when ordinary working people made their contribution through \nprogram reductions, and those at the top end of the income scale made \ntheir contribution through tax increases. Here again we have working \npeople bearing their share of the burden of program reduction. But the \ntax breaks contained in this resolution go very much to those at the \nupper end of the income scale, leaving working Americans bearing a far \nlarger percentage of the load.\n  So one must conclude this budget fails the equity test. A budget \nagreement and the tax program to implement it should also lead to \nlasting long-term deficit reduction. I don't think this legislation \nwill do that. In fact, as I have already discussed at length, I have \nvery deep concern that in the long term, as the Sun editorial \nindicated--in posing the basic question, ``Will the generous tax cuts \ncome back to haunt the country in the form of widening deficits as the \ntax cuts take full effect several years down the road?''--this \nconference report will do serious damage to our long-term deficit \nreduction efforts.\n  These tax cuts will explode in the outyears. They start exploding \neven within the 10-year period. Let me repeat the figures: The estate \ntax cuts go from a loss of revenue of $6 billion in the first 5 years \nto a loss of $28 billion in the next 5 years, and presumably more in \nthe outyears. Capital gains are scored under this conference report to \nearn revenues--earn revenues--of $123 billion in the first 5 years, and \nto cost $21 billion in the next 5 years, and presumably more in the \noutyears.\n  IRA's are scored here to cost $1.8 billion--less than $2 billion--in \nthe first 5 years, $18 billion in the next 5 years, again with no \nprojection beyond that, although everyone assumes it is on an upward \ntrajectory.\n  So, Mr. President, this measure before us also fails the long-term \ndeficit reduction test, just as it fails the equity test. In effect, it \ndoes not have either of two essential attributes--equitable deficit \nreduction and lasting long-term deficit reduction--that should inform a \ntax bill.\n  For those reasons, I must oppose the measure before us.\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to yield 10 minutes, or such \ntime as he may use, to the distinguished Senator from Virginia [Mr. \nRobb].\n  Are we going back and forth?\n  I apologize for that, and withhold the request.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Delaware.\n  I rise today in support of this package. I guess every now and again \nwe get into a situation where we have a big bill in front of us. I know \nthat there is a good friend of mine on the floor now. I call him one of \nthe greatest American slaves to his labor than anybody, and that is \nSenator Domenici from New Mexico on Budget, now with Senator Roth at \nthe helm on Finance.\n  A lot of things that we have tried to do in the last 6 or 7 or 10 \nyears we get in this bill.\n  We had a problem one time in the caucus. I can remember my good \nfriend from Wyoming. It got kind of quiet. Nobody was coming up with \nany answers. He said, ``Our biggest problem is we are overthinking this \nthing.'' And we could be doing just that.\n  But I want to remind America what it is all about. And that is middle \nAmerica and what it means to young men and women who are starting out \nin agriculture on their farms. This is income averaging, because we are \ngoing to phase out subsidies, folks. We have to allow those who are \nstarting off in the farming business, and those who want to sell a \nfarm, to have capital gains relief--those who inherit farms. We are \ngiving them some way that we can pass our farms and ranches on to the \nnext generation. In other words, we don't have to sell the farm to save \nthe farm, and income averaging, allowing a young man and a young woman \non a farm to accumulate cash and save it in the good years so that they \ncan make it through the bad years. That is basically what we want to \ndo. And I call them farm friendly provisions of this budget deal.\n  In small business, the ability and just a short time to write off 100 \npercent of your premiums for a tax credit on your health care \ninsurance; you get your home office tax credit back; the alternative \nminimum tax for small businesses and farming operations. Yes, on that \nsame farm or ranch they have children; and the $500-per-child tax \ncredit, which, in my State, means that $200 million a year stays in \nthat State. And the decision on who spends that money is left to the \nparents. That decision will be made around a breakfast table rather \nthan around a conference table here in Washington, DC.\n  So let us take a look at the big picture. Let us take a look at the \npeople who really pull the wagon. They have been looking for relief a \nlong time. It is in this package.\n  I congratulate my good friend from New York and my good friend from \nDelaware because they have worked a long, long time. And, yes, you can \nfind something in here that you do not like. But let us not let \nperfection stand in the way of progress. Let us at least take that one \ngiant step in the right direction and let people control those dollars \nthat they have worked so hard to earn.\n  Across my State of Montana, we are agriculture and we are small \nbusiness. So this package is just like a rifle shot; it is pointed \nright at those people who really are the heart and soul of any \ncommunity, and, yes, the working men and women of this country. I am \ngoing to support it. I hope that all of my colleagues will support it. \nAnd then if there is something wrong, this body is not encased in \nstone. There is plenty of time to put some fixes in that maybe should \nbe put in. But nonetheless, right now let us take that one giant step \nin the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia would like 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from New York.\n  I had planned to make a longer formal statement today, but I will be \nvery brief given the lateness of the hour. Most of the things that I \nwanted to say have already been said, and in most cases said more \neloquently than I suspect I could say them. I really do not enjoy being \nthe burr under the saddle when there is so much euphoria. Many good \npeople have worked long and hard to achieve this compromise which I \nthink is ultimately the only way that the system works in terms of the \nmajor proposals that we deal with in this institution.\n  I applaud the President and the Republican leadership for working \ntogether. I applaud the ranking members and the chairs of the Finance \nCommittee and the Budget Committee. I have had the privilege of working \nwith the chairman of the Budget Committee for almost 20 years. In my \nprior incarnation as a Governor, Senator Domenici was always one of the \nmost respected Members of either party from Congress on matters that \nrelated to fiscal policy. I know for him this budget agreement \nrepresents a major milestone. I know how hard he has worked and I know \nof his personal commitment to fiscal responsibility and to bringing \ndown the deficit. It is real. I have seen him make tough decisions and \nwithout compromising his view of the deal that was finally struck \nbetween the President and the leadership in Congress. My guess is that \nhe is at least as enthusiastic, if not more so, about the deficit \nreduction portion than perhaps some of the timing on the tax cuts.\n  I would say that there are very few people that I know, Mr. \nPresident, who wouldn't like to have their taxes reduced. My problem is \nwith the timing of the tax cuts. We have been making real progress on \nthe deficit in the last few years. We are on the right course. We have, \nas the Senator from Maryland indicated just a minute ago, some of the \nmost favorable economic statistics and optimistic projections we have \never had. If ever we were going to make real long-term progress, not \nonly in reducing the deficit but in actually beginning to reduce the \ndebt, so that we would not be passing on to our children and \ngrandchildren the kinds of burdens that we continue to accumulate, now \nis the time to address that challenge. And yet we fail to do so at this \nparticular time.\n  We are providing tax cuts that will be gratefully received by many. \nWe are providing incentives for many good programs. And again I applaud \nthe President and the leadership of Congress and all of those who have \nbeen involved in this effort. But we are missing an opportunity that \nmay not come again to make a substantial effort toward long-term fiscal \nresponsibility. I am even more concerned that some of the proposals \nthat we are going to pass today will have some very unfortunate \nconsequences in the outyears.\n  I think we will have to look back upon our time on watch and answer \nto future generations as to why, when we had this opportunity, this \nwindow of opportunity in our history, when so many of the economic \nindicators are so good, we were not willing to make the tough choices.\n  I voted for the package this morning with a tinge of regret. As I \nhave been committed to deficit reduction for my entire public career, I \nwas disappointed that we failed to include in that particular package \nsome rather modest, but important, restraints on entitlement growth, \nrestraints that made sense for our long-term future. They were among \nthe very first parts of the proposal that we moved away from. Just as \nwe failed to show the political courage to take the kind of steps that \nwe could have taken when respected economists told us what the Consumer \nPrice Index was doing to all of the programs that were related to it \nand the impact a revision would have on the long term. What we are \ndoing here today is providing the kind of good news in the short term \nthat many of our citizens will respond favorably to, but in the long \nterm all of us are going to have to answer for the consequences of our \nactions.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I applaud those who have \nworked hard to reach this particular agreement, but I respectfully \ndissent.\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Roth, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Moynihan, and especially our leader for this landmark \nagreement.\n  However, I wish to remark on the conference agreement provision that \ngives $2.3 billion to Amtrak under the guise of so-called tax relief. \nMr. President, this has got to be called the great train robbery. It \nused to be in the Old West that the outlaws took money from the trains. \nNow the trains are taking money from the taxpayers--$2.3 billion. The \nJames boys, Jesse and Frank, did not have the imagination that this \nincredible scheme does. It is not to be believed.\n  Do you know how they are going to get that $2.3 billion, Mr. \nPresident? They are going to get it with a $2.3 billion tax break in \ntaxes they never paid. Amtrak has never paid any taxes. In fact, they \nhave lost $20 billion since they came into being. They have lost $20 \nbillion. Now we are going to take tax relief from the freight trains \nthat used to run prior to Amtrak ever coming into existence.\n  Mr. President, this is most bizarre. I have only been here 10 years, \nand I am sure some bizarre and Orwellian things have happened, but this \nis the most bizarre thing I have ever seen. The only thing, the only \nthing I think that saves this is that Congress, the leader and others \nhave demanded that reform be part of the package. And our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, rather than grabbing ahold of this \ngreatest sweetheart deal in history, won't even agree to reforms. Right \nnow, if you are laid off from Amtrak, you stay for 6 years on the \npayroll, and our friends will not even agree to doing away with that \nincredible, incredible, unbelievable break.\n  Now, I guess this provision that unless reform is agreed to this \nbailout--bailout is not the word. My vocabulary does not encompass the \nability to describe what we are doing here with this $2.3 billion to \nAmtrak--$2.3 billion. Not a single reform. And I thank Senator \nHutchison of Texas who has worked hard on this issue and many others, \nbut I well tell you, Mr. President, I am going to vote for this bill, \nbut I hope and pray we never see anything like this great train robbery \never again.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns expressed by my \ndistinguished colleague, but I feel that a little history will readily \nhelp us understand exactly why we have done what we have done with \nAmtrak.\n  We are in complete agreement that Amtrak is in a serious financial \ncrisis.\n  It may not survive through next year, and according to the GAO, the \nmost important measure Congress can take to help Amtrak through this \ncrisis is to provide a stable capital funding source.\n  In an effort to provide this funding, I introduced legislation that \nwould have created a dedicated trust fund for Amtrak.\n  This fund would have been financed by transferring one half-cent-per-\ngallon of the excise taxes imposed on all motor fuels currently going \nto the general fund to a new rail fund for Amtrak. This would have \nprovided $2.3 billion in capital funding over the next 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  By a vote of 77 to 21, the Senate overwhelmingly approved this \nfunding source.\n  However, during the conference on the tax bill, the House conferees \ndemanded that the secure funding source for Amtrak be contingent on a \nreform bill being enacted. And the House conferees demanded that the \nfunding must be provided through the Tax Code in place of the reserve \nfund mechanism contained in the Senate-passed version of the tax bill.\n  This is why the conference agreement now includes a tax refund for \nAmtrak. And while this is not my first preference in providing capital \nfunding for Amtrak, it provides the necessary capital to keep Amtrak \nalive. The conference agreement gives Amtrak the benefit of electing no \nmore than $2.3 billion in net operating losses over 2 years.\n  Amtrak must use the benefit for capital expenses and provide a \nportion of this benefit for non-Amtrak States for their transportation \nrelated expenditures.\n  This relief is based on the fact that Amtrak has incurred billions of \ndollars of losses as a result of inheriting revenue losing passenger \nrail service since its formation in 1971.\n  The tax provision contained in the conference report merely provides \nthe same type of tax relief that would have been available to its \npredecessor railroads had Amtrak not been formed in that year.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that Amtrak desperately needs this \nrelief.\n  The current path Washington is taking to address our transportation \nneeds is to spend more money on highways and airports. In doing this, \nwe must not overlook the vital importance of passenger rail. Last year \nWashington spent $20 billion for highways, while capital investment for \nAmtrak was less than $450 million.\n  In relative terms, between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1994, \ntransportation outlays for highways increased 73 percent, aviation \nincreased 170 percent, and transportation outlays for rail went down by \n62 percent. In terms of growth, between 1982 and 1992 highway spending \ngrew by 5 percent, aviation by 10 percent, while rail decreased by 9 \npercent.\n  The time has come to invest in our rail system. The money Amtrak \nneeds to survive is in this tax bill, but it can't be spent until a \nreform bill is enacted. The bottom line is without a reform bill none \nof this money will be available to Amtrak. I have done my part, it is \nnow time for all the parties to work together on a reform package. \nWithout reforms, Amtrak won't have the resources it needs to survive.\n  I just want to make it clear that we are about to have the last clear \nchance to save the American railroad passenger system. I point out that \nin the legislation there is a requirement that there must be reform. \nMake no mistake about that. But the fact is I think it would be a \nserious mistake that the greatest, sole superpower in the world does \nnot have a passenger system. It is bad from the standpoint of \ntransportation, it is bad from the standpoint of environment, and I \nhope that we are able to get the job done so that we have this modern, \nclean transportation.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment and \ncongratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and \nhis counterpart, Senator Moynihan, for the bipartisan way in which they \nhave worked to put this bill together. Also, I wish to compliment the \nmajority leader of the Senate, Senator Lott, and Speaker of the House, \nSpeaker Gingrich, because, frankly, they set up the design to make this \nhappen. They said let's get something passed. Let's pass a law. Let's \nreach out. Let's have Democrat support. Let's not jut pass a Republican \npackage.\n  I will tell you, I think the bill we passed 2 years ago was a lot \nbetter. It had a net tax cut of $245 billion. This bill has a tax cut \nof $95 billion. The difference is this is going to become law. That is \nimportant. The tax bill we passed a couple of years ago had a tax \ncredit of $500 per child. We have it in this bill. And so if a family \nof median income has three kids, that's $1,500 that they get to spend, \nnot Washington, DC. It is their money. They earned it. They should be \nable to keep it. That is the whole premise of this package.\n  We have education relief. I hear some of my colleagues who are \nopposing this say, well, it does too much for the wealthy. It's really \nslanted toward the upper income. That is totally false; 82 percent of \nthe package goes to education and the family tax credit. Those are \nlimited to middle income. Families with over $100,000 or over $110,000 \ndo not qualify. So this is targeted towards families, middle-income \nfamilies.\n  I think it is a good package. It also has IRA's, and I compliment \nChairman Roth because he has been so steadfast\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\nin pushing for individual retirement accounts for spouses. Now we have \nmillions of nonworking spouses that will be able to invest in an IRA \nbefore taxes. I think that is a very positive provision. We have \neducational IRA's, again because of Chairman Roth. We have relief from \nthe so-called death tax. We will increase the exemption from $600,000 \nto $1 million. It takes 10 years. So I encourage people not to pass \naway if they are in that range. They need to wait a few years. But we \nalso increased the exemption for family businesses, farms and ranches. \nAnd I will tell my colleagues, it is extremely popular, very much \nneeded. If you have a family farm, business or ranch and you happen to \npass away and you have a taxable estate of $1 million. You are in a \ntaxable rate of 39 percent. And I don't think Government is entitled to \ntake 39 percent of that property. And so again I think this is long \noverdue.\n  We have other relief in this bill to encourage savings, to encourage \ninvestment. We reduced the capital gains tax 20 percent. Every time we \nreduced capital gains we have had more savings.\n  And so again, I think this is a positive bill. It will encourage \njobs; it will encourage savings. It will leave families to keep more of \ntheir own money in their pocketbooks.\n  I compliment again the Speaker and I compliment the leader, Senator \nRoth, and Senator Moynihan, those who worked so tirelessly to make this \nhappen. The good news is this will become law. We will do what we said \nwe were going to do. We said we were going to give American families \ntax relief. We said we were going to pass incentives to create more \njobs. We have done that in this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nit. I am glad to see this will become law soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have already spoken on the subject \ntoday. There are a couple of other things I would like to add.\n  First of all, there is always a big constituency for tax cuts and I \nhave never known a Member of Congress to lose a vote by voting for a \ntax cut. We lost a lot of good men and women in 1993 because they voted \nfor a tax increase, which has reduced the deficit from $300 billion to \nan anticipated $40 billion this year. But they are not here. They \nhonored what they thought was a demand by the American people for a \nbalanced budget, clearly within our grasp. But, you see, there is a big \nconstituency for tax cuts. There is always a big constituency for \nspending. There is no constituency for a balanced budget. There are \nthose who have looked forward to that, as I have, for 22\\1/2\\ years. \nWhen I was deciding whether I wanted to run again, that was one of the \nmajor considerations with me.\n  There are two things that I think would reinstill confidence in the \nAmerican people in the congressional system and in our democratic \nsystem, in our very political system. The two things that would do more \nthan anything to build confidence in America would be to balance the \nbudget, and, No. 2, to change the way we finance campaigns. I concluded \nthat neither were going to happen in the next 18 months and probably \nwouldn't happen during the next 6 years if I ran and were reelected. \nThat wasn't the only consideration.\n  But here we are. In 1998--every economist in the country now believes \nwe will probably balance the budget in 1998. So what are we going to \ndo? No. No. We screamed about balanced budgets around here for 22\\1/2\\ \nyears that I have been around here. Now it is within our grasp and how \ndo we treat it? Postpone it for 5 years. Don't do it in 1998, give away \nsome goodies.\n  And there are some goodies in here that I love. The educational part \nof it intrigues me. I love it. But here is something the American \npeople have been clamoring for all of these years. We could postpone \nthis for at least a year and provide some comfort to the American \npeople in letting them know that we are really concerned about deficit \nspending.\n  Let me ask you this. What in the name of goodness are we always \ntalking about Greenspan raising interest rates for, depending on the \ninflation rate? Everybody is scared to death the inflation rate is \ngoing to go up a couple of tenths of a point, Greenspan will raise \ninterest rates, and this glowing economy, almost unprecedented in the \nannals of the history of this country, will come to a screeching halt. \nThere will be no balanced budget once this economy goes into decline.\n  I yield myself 2 additional minutes, Mr. President.\n  So, what are we doing? This is not a tax cut of the magnitude of \n1981. Certainly in the scheme of things it doesn't even begin to match \nthe tax cuts of Jack Kennedy in 1961-1963. But I tell you what it is, \nit is $135 billion infused into the American economy which could, which \njust could fuel the economy to the extent of a couple of tenths of a \npoint in inflation. And if that happens, you can bet that the Fed will \nraise interest rates. And if that happens you can bet that this economy \nis going to start slowing and you will not see a balanced budget.\n  The idea, I don't mind saying, Mr. President, I don't know how to say \nit any stronger--the idea of doing what we are doing today and \npostponing something that is so near at hand, a balanced budget--\npostponing it for 5 years is the height of irresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I just wanted to take a minute here at \nthe finish of this debate, to compliment a number of people whose \ncommitments have been so vital to the success of this bill. From the \nvery beginning of the 104th Congress until today, the Presiding Officer \nhimself has been in the lead as the chairman of our Budget Committee. \nWithout his leadership, we never would have reached this point. Without \nthe leadership of the chairman of the Finance Committee we would not \nhave reached this point. Without the able work of the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee we would not have reached this point. Certainly, \nwithout the assistance and the leadership of our majority leader, we \nwould not have reached this point.\n  Today we do something that has not occurred in 16 years, we give the \ntaxpayers of our country a chance to keep more of what they earn. In my \nState of Michigan this means a great deal. We are not a rich State, in \nthe sense that everybody makes a lot of money. We are a rich State in \nterms of values and natural resources, but the hard-working people in \nMichigan have waited an awful long time for the tax cut which we will \nbe delivering. Whether it is the working family who will receive a $500 \nper child tax credit or the family trying to finance the education of \nchildren--who do not want to go bankrupt, but want their kids to go to \ncollege--or the small family farmers and small business people who have \nfeared the prospect of having to sell the family business or farm in \norder to pay death taxes, or the people in our inner cities who are \ngoing to benefit from the brownfields provisions that will allow us to \nclean up environmentally contaminated brownfields and create job \nopportunities in deserted factory sites, or the people who are hopeful \nthat we can have more dollars for road repair and, because of having \nshifted the 4.3 cent gas tax to the highway trust fund in this bill we \nwill now have the opportunity to restore more dollars for roads and \ntransportation--all of those people in Michigan will benefit when this \naction is taken today and the President signs this tax cut into law.\n  The fact is, today taxes as a percentage of our national income are \nas high as they have ever been, higher than during the Depression, \nhigher than World War II, higher than during the Vietnam war and other \ncrises. The time has come to restore some balance to the equation, to \ngive the American hard-working families the break they deserve.\n  So I compliment everybody who has played this role. I think we are \nmoving in the right direction. Many of us would like to do more, and I \nhope we will have the chance next year, in a later Congress, to do \nmore. But for what we are achieving today, I think great credit is owed \nto the leadership we have had. So I rise to compliment that leadership \nand say, as a new Member of this body, I am delighted to be\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\npart of a day today in which we celebrate both the passage of a bill \nthat will bring us to a balanced budget for the first time in a quarter \nof a century and the passage of a bill that will mean tax relief for \nhard-working people in Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the chairman of the \nFinance Committee for this time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I need some additional time, I yield \nmyself time off my leader time, although I hope--I will stay as close \nto the appointed hour for a vote as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, for yielding me this time and thank him for \nhis great work. I talked about that this morning in relation to the \nbalanced Budget Act, but I think it is even more appropriate that I \ncommend him for his diligence, patience, persistence, leadership, his \nbipartisan effort. He did a great job on this legislation. I am \nextremely proud of him and I think he should feel proud. Also Senator \nMoynihan, for his cooperation and for the way he approaches his \nlegislative responsibilities, we thank him. Without his being willing \nto support this we would not have had the 80 votes that we had when the \nbill passed the Senate a month ago. To the Senator in the Chair, the \nSenator from New Mexico, his imprint is over both these bills; all over \nthem. I thank him for that.\n  This morning I was satisfied with our action on the balanced budget. \nI was pleased we got it done. I thought it was an important thing to do \nand that we should get it done and move forward and reach a balanced \nbudget with honest numbers.\n  But, with this bill I am enthusiastic, I am really excited about what \nthis legislation does. It is going to help our children with the tax \ncredits and education provisions. I feel good about the education \nprovisions. Some people say, ``Well I don't like that part or the other \npart.'' Education is about the future of America, and we put some of \nthe President's provisions in there but we put some others in there \nthat will help our children have a better access to community colleges \nand universities and colleges. It is worthwhile and I am proud of that.\n  A lot of young people, young business men and women are going to \nbenefit from this. My own son, a young entrepreneur, will benefit from \nit. And even he was excited, the other night, when I told him what was \nin this bill. Nothing makes a father prouder than for his own son to \nsay, ``Dad, this will help me to create some more businesses and hire \nsome more people.'' He has 60 young people working for him now. This is \nwhat the American dream is all about: Investors, savers, farmers, small \nbusiness men and women, spouses, and seniors. This is one that really \ndoes what we said it was going to do, and we got it done. I am very \nproud of it.\n  This is the first significant tax cut for working Americans in 16 \nyears. It is long overdue. Taxes are too high in my opinion. The Tax \nCode is obviously too complex and complicated. The IRS is too intrusive \nin our lives and everybody knows it. Congressional Republicans and a \nlot of Democrats wanted to do more than just talk about tax relief, \nthey wanted to get it done. We wanted to deliver and we wanted to \nprovide this legislation. We picked up considerable bipartisan support \nand came together in a way that I have not seen the Senate come \ntogether in the years that I have been in the Senate, certainly as \nmajority leader. It was a good feeling. We went out on the steps of the \nCapitol and said we had done this job for the American people. I \nthought it was constructive and thoughtful, and I was very proud of it.\n  The President also supports this bill. I am glad that he has \nsupported this tax package and the tax relief that we are giving to the \nAmerican people. He insisted that some parts of it be dropped. I was \nvery disappointed in that. But we insisted on some things that he \ndidn't want to go along with. As I said repeatedly, we gave ground on \nboth sides, but we found common ground in many instances.\n  I was particularly concerned, though, about one provision that we had \nto drop, the so-called Coverdell amendment that would have allowed for \nan education IRA to be used to pay for education from K through high \nschool, for elementary and secondary. Yes, I like the fact that we are \nhelping community college opportunities for our children, and \nuniversities and colleges. But the truth of the matter is, the problem \nin education in America is not at the higher education level. Our \nhigher education system in America is a good one. It is broad, it is \ndiverse, there is lots of choice. The problem is at the elementary and \nsecondary level.\n  Why shouldn't a parent, who can now put $500 in the Roth education \nIRA opportunity, be able to take some of that money to help their \nchildren in the fourth grade with some tutoring, so they can learn to \nread better, or to get help with remedial arithmetic? Why shouldn't a \nparent be able to do that? I think they should, and I am very sorry \nthat we had to drop this from the package. But the President insisted \nthat this not be allowed because, he said, it would undermine public \neducation. I don't want to do that. I am a product of public education. \nMy mother is a public education schoolteacher. So there were some \ndisappointments along the way. But there is a lot of good in this bill.\n  Everybody can declare a victory in being for this, because the \nAmerican people, the American family will benefit from this \nlegislation. Three years ago, congressional Republicans promised the \nAmerican people a $500-per-child tax credit to help them save for the \nfuture or to meet the costs of raising a family in today's world. We \nkept that promise. And along the way, the Democrats got involved. They \nput their imprint on it. But the main thing is they are going to get \nthis help. Parents with children will get some help to do things for \ntheir own children. I think we should be proud of that.\n  At the start of this Congress I urged that the Republican conference \nintroduce, as our first bill, a bill to help families with the needs \nfor education and for college costs. S. 1, the first bill that was \nintroduced this year, our highest priority, was in education. The \nlegislation before us today incorporates many of those tax provisions.\n  If American families are looking for someone to thank, they need to \nlook to further than the sponsors and the leaders of this legislation, \nSenator Roth and Senator Moynihan. They really did a great job. They \nbrought us together and they produced the final package that we are \nvoting on here today.\n  Amazing as it seems, we have been willing to resist some of the \ncriticisms that we should not give tax relief for working Americans. We \nhave done it here. We have kept our promises. I think it is going to be \ngood for the economy. Allow the people, allow our people in this \ncountry to make some decisions of how they will help their own \nchildren, when it comes to the tax credit, and for education. Let them \ndecide how they will use their money to pay for education.\n  We are making individual retirement accounts available to almost \neverybody, especially homemakers. We have that up, now, so they can put \nin $2,000 like everybody else. Why shouldn't they be able to? But they \nhad not been able to in the past. Now homemakers have this opportunity, \njust like everybody else, to have this IRA.\n  We are reducing the unfair tax on capital gains, including \nhomeowners. That alone is going to help fire up the economy even more, \nfoster job creation and expand opportunity for every willing worker.\n  So, this is an important package. But I want the taxpayers of America \nto understand this. It is only a downpayment. It is not Utopia. It's \nnot everything we would like to do. It doesn't make the Tax Code a lot \nless complicated. In fact, it maybe goes the other way. But it's a step \nin the right direction. It provides help where it is needed and there \nwill be another day for us to have a fairer Tax Code. So, it is the \nkind of legislation that we need. We have come together to pass it. It \nwill provide extensive tax relief. Tax reform will be something we will \ndo another day.\n  But we have done a good job here, and I urge my colleagues to rally \nround the banner of lower taxes and economic growth and join me in \nsending \n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nAmerica's tax cut to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

Mr. President, while we all mention many people who had \na lot to do with our success, I believe if you were to ask the White \nHouse staff, all the way to the Chief of Staff, and ask all the staff \nthat work for us here on both sides, who was most responsible for \ngetting this job done, they would not say the Senator from New Mexico \nor the Senator from New Jersey or the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware. I think they would all say, ``Let's be honest about it. Bill \nHoagland, staff director for the Senate Budget Committee''--the man \nwithout whom we could not have done this.\n  I just want the Record to reflect that. I am sure they would agree \nwith me--those whom I have mentioned. It is just an obvious fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank all the Senators for their cooperation. I know this \nis kind of like ``school's out'' for a break, and we are taking \nadvantage of the opportunity to say good-bye to each other and enjoy \nthe district and State work period. But I want to thank all the \nSenators for the tremendous cooperation we have seen here in the last 2 \nweeks. I do not know that I have seen it any better since I have been \nin the Senate.\n  We have already moved 10 appropriations bills. We are going to try to \nget lined up to start on the 11th one right when we come back. We have \npassed these two very important bills, the Balanced Budget Act and the \nTax Relief Act. It took a lot of cooperation on both sides of the \naisle.\n  I want to thank my counterpart on the Democratic side of the aisle, \nSenator Daschle. He is a pleasure to work with. I think we have a \nrelationship that is important for the Senate; that we be able to talk \nto each other and work with each other in honesty and frankness. We are \ngoing to continue to do that.\n  Before we leave, we are going to work on doing as much as we can, and \nI think it is going to be substantial on the Executive Calendar. So I \njust want to thank Senator Daschle and our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for their good work.\n  If we could keep this pace going, I think the American people would \nbe very pleased, and maybe they would feel very good about our Senate \nand what we are trying to do.\n  So thank you very much for your cooperation.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know there are Members who wish to \nleave. I will be very brief.\n  Let me just commend the majority leader for his leadership in \nbringing us to this point. As he has indicated, we have the good \nfortune to have a good relationship, and we work very closely together. \nI think, in part, the results are very clear. That relationship has \nbeen productive.\n  Let me also commend the chairmen of the Finance Committee and the \nBudget Committee, and our ranking members on both the Finance Committee \nand the Budget Committee, for the extraordinary job they have done. \nObviously, you cannot lead if there are not those who are willing to \nfollow. We have followed, and we have worked in good faith on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  This is a great day for the Senate and a great day for America. I \nappreciate very much the opportunity, once more, to express our \ngratitude to all Senators.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle. I do want to also take a brief \nopportunity, without naming names--and I think their names should be \nput in the Record--to thank a lot of staff people who worked extremely \nlong hours, all night several times over the past few weeks, on both \nsides of the aisle. You know who we are talking about. We extend our \nappreciation and thanks to those staff members for their great work. \nThis was a monumental accomplishment. I don't know how you physically \ngot it done. I thank you for that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I congratulate the majority leader. He is \ncorrect, there has been a significant amount of progress made in the \nlast 2 weeks. I ask the majority leader publicly on the record what he \nand I have talked about a number of times privately, and that is an \nissue of enormous concern to some of us. We have written a letter to \nthe majority leader regarding a campaign finance reform debate. While \nwe leave here in good spirits and have cooperated, when we come back, \nmany of us are adamant about having the opportunity to debate campaign \nfinance reform. I ask the majority leader whether he has a sense of \nwhen that might take place or if he could give assurance that it will \ntake place.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I expected that I would get this question, \nand I don't have a time that I could give. I must say that the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is working right now and looking into \npotential campaign violations, and what happened in the last election. \nI think for us to proceed before we even get the completion of that \nwork would be premature. Regarding the last election, we ought to know \nwhat laws have been broken and how they were broken. I don't have a \ndate in mind.\n  I am sure I have been told by several Senators that this issue will \ncome up sometime soon. I understand that. I hope that we will be \npatient and take our time and maybe even see at some point if we could \nnot do something in this area in a bipartisan way. But I understand \nwhat the Senator from Massachusetts has said. He indicated he is going \nto bring it up at some point. I am sure that will happen. We don't have \nany time scheduled on that at this point.\n  When we come back, the focus will be on the three remaining \nappropriations bills that we have not passed, the conference reports \nthat we must pass, and pending legislation we must pass, including \nISTEA, the highway transportation legislation, which expires at the\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\nend of September. We have a lot of very serious work to do of interest \nto the Nation's Capital, to the people in America, including the \nInterior appropriations bill, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, as \nwell as the ISTEA bill. But there is time to look at these matters. I \nam sure they will be considered appropriately as we move into the fall.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the majority leader yield further?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield for a further question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the leader for that answer. I \nunderstand where he is heading with respect to that.\n  If I could ask further, I had wanted at this time, Mr. President, to \nbe able to introduce a bill. I don't know what the intentions of the \nleader are regarding time to be able to proceed and do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have some unanimous-consent requests and then Senator \nDomenici has an issue, but there will be time for brief remarks.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I just want to commend Senator Lott, the \nmajority leader, for the outstanding leadership he is providing here in \nthe Senate. Many things here have been accomplished. I don't recall, in \nthe 43 years I have been here, fine leadership shown that has gotten so \nmuch done in such a short time. I am proud of you. And I want to \ncommend Senator Daschle for his fine cooperation and leadership, too.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much.\n  Further, I want to say that we are going to have a period for morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, would it be appropriate at this time to ask \nif I could proceed after the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see a number of Senators that wish to \nspeak. I believe Senator Domenici has something he needs to do, and I \nhave a couple unanimous consents, and then the Senator may speak. \nWithin a very few minutes, he can get recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First of all, I join with my colleagues who have \ncommended the majority leader for the very efficient way in which the \nSenate has conducted itself over the past month. We have, obviously, \nprocessed a great deal of business.\n  I just want to say that I was very heartened to hear the majority \nleader state that it was his intention to address this Executive \nCalendar before we go out, I gather, with the anticipation of clearing, \nif not all of it, most of it, as I understand it.\n  I want to underscore how important that is. If we do it now, these \npeople can move into their positions and be functioning within the \nweek. If we don't do it now, then it obviously has to carry over into \nSeptember, and you are talking about losing 5, 6, 7 weeks before we get \npeople on the job.\n  I just want to thank the majority leader for his indication that he \nis going to address that issue before we depart.\n  Mr. LOTT. Maybe before we go out tonight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the leader will yield further. As a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, I commend the distinguished \nmajority leader, the Democratic leader, and the chairman and ranking \nmember of that committee for pushing us this far on the appropriations. \nIt is highly commendable.\n  I join my friend from Maryland in saying there are many of these \nnominations on the calendar that need to be cleared as soon as \npossible--especially the judges that are there. We have new vacancies \nin our courts. Again, once a person has been confirmed, it still takes \nweeks before they get out of whatever life they are in--private \npractice, or whatever--to get out of that and get set up and get their \nlaw clerks hired, and on and on, and with all that it means with their \nfamilies and lives and all. So if some can be cleared now, we know it \nwill be 5 weeks sooner.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. Leader, on the matter of the legislation we just \npassed, I want to make one comment. It is obvious that the Senator from \nNew Mexico is recognized as an effective chairman. It is obvious that \nthe Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is viewed as articulate and as \none of the brightest people here. It is obvious that everybody knows \nhow effective the ranking member of the Budget Committee is.\n  I want to make a personal comment that I never thought I would make, \nor need to make. I think the single-most underestimated person in this \nbody is one of the single-most effective people, and that is my senior \ncolleague, Bill Roth. He has a style that is so low-key and so quiet \nthat I don't think he gets the credit he deserves. I just want to \nremind everybody, notwithstanding the fact that everyone sees and hears \nmore about the able leaders I mentioned, this deal would not have been \ndone without Bill Roth. Bill Roth. People in my State love him, but \nthey don't even realize that.\n  I just want everybody to be reminded that this quiet guy from \nDelaware, who has a very different political view on a lot of things \nthan I do, is one of the single-most effective people we have. On last \nyear's welfare reform bill, and every major thing we have done in the \npast 18 months, he has been at the helm, or has played a major part.\n  I want to personally recognize the contribution he makes and state \nfor the record, I think he gets--not intentionally; I think \nunintentionally--less credit than anybody in this place, and I think he \nplays the most significant role in all of what we are rightfully \ncelebrating here, which is the passage of the tax bill and the reforms \nthat have taken place in welfare, et cetera. So I want the Record to \nreflect that the man from Delaware, my senior colleague, deserves a \nheck of a lot of credit.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for making \nthat comment. That is the kind of recognition that we should give more \nof around here, especially between colleagues of opposite parties.\n  Let me assure you that, without Senator Roth, the IRA provision and \nmany other provisions in this bill would not be there. He was dogged \nand determined and did a great job. I thank the Senator for what he \nsaid and the recognition he gave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8480-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PROVIDING FOR THE CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE TWO HOUSES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

It passed the Labor Committee by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 4.\n  Since the bill passed committee on June 18, supporters of FDA reform \nhave tried repeatedly to address the concerns of these four opponents. \nIn fact, supporters of reform have made an additional 30 concessions in \nthe bill since it was reported from committee.\n  Cosponsors of the bill, Democrat and Republican alike, met with \nSenator Kennedy this morning in a last ditch effort to convince him to \nlet the bill go forward. Despite the bill's strong bipartisan support \nand despite these additional compromises, he refused.\n  This legislation is too important to be held hostage. As such, I \nintend to bring the committee-passed FDA reform bill to the floor in \nSeptember. If necessary, I will file cloture to ensure that this \nimportant piece of business for the health of the American people is \ncompleted in a timely manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8482-5", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FDA REFORM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regret that we have been unable to \nreach final agreement so far on FDA reform. In fact, the negotiations \nthis month have made significant progress on almost all of the issues \nsurrounding the bill. Reasonable compromises were reached on 26 \nseparate proposals that had raised serious health and safety concerns \nand were opposed by the FDA and the administration.\n  Two issues remained today. It is critical that FDA be able to get all \nthe data they need to ensure that devices that have different \ntechnological characteristics from a predecessor device are safe and \neffective. Provisions of the committee-reported bill might unduly tie \nthe FDA's hands in this important area.\n  The second issue involves the proposal for sweeping Federal pre-\nemption of the current authority of States to regulate over-the-counter \ndrugs and cosmetics. In cosmetics, for example, there is virtually no \nsignificant Federal regulation at the present time, and States should \nhave the right to act to protect their citizens against dangerous \nproducts. Too often, there have been abuses such as lipsticks \ncontaining substances that could cause birth defects, skin creams made \nwith known carcinogens, excessive lead in hair dye, and suntan products \nthat produce severe chemical burns.\n  In my view, acceptable compromises can be reached on both of these \nissues, and I hope that good faith negotiations will continue.\n  Unfortunately, in the wake of the current impasses on these two \nissues, several additional matters that had previously been settled \nhave now been reopened. A fair overall compromise is still possible \nthat adequately protects the public, and I am optimistic that we can \nachieve it by September.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8482-6", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE OBSERVER GROUP\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

RIFFE, JR.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to note the passing, today, of an \nOhio legend. Early this morning, an Ohio legend died. Here is how Lee \nLeonard, the dean of the Ohio statehouse press corps, began his report \nin this morning's Columbus dispatch:\n\n       Vernal G. Riffe, Jr., who rose from a Scioto County \n     insurance salesman to become one of the most powerful figures \n     in Ohio's political history, died today at 1:30 a.m. He was \n     72.''\n\n  Vern Riffe served a record-breaking 20 years as Speaker of the Ohio \nHouse of Representatives, from 1975 to 1995. From the first day that he \nwas elected Speaker, he was ``The Speaker'' and will always be, Mr. \nPresident, ``The Speaker.'' He came to the Ohio House in 1959, spent 16 \nyears learning the skills that would make him the most effective as \nwell as the longest-serving speaker of the Ohio House of \nRepresentatives.\n  He studied the approaches of legislative veterans. He learned a lot. \nHe learned that, in a legislative body, you get a lot further by \nhelping your colleagues move their own legislation forward than you do \nby grandstanding. As a result, Vern Riffe quickly became the person \nboth Republican and Democratic Governors turned to to make things \nhappen. Vern Riffe was a pragmatic, results-oriented Speaker. He was a \npartisan, but his greatest victories came from his willingness to work \nwith Republican Ohio Governors to get things done for the people of \nOhio.\n  When Vern Riffe retired from the Speakership, he said this:\n\n       If I was 20 years younger, I might be in the mood for \n     forming my own party, called the Moderate Democrats or the \n     Middle of the Road Democrats.\n\n  That was Vern Riffe.\n  These are the lessons of Vern Riffe: Hard work, learn the details, \nbuild consensus, and put the interests of Ohio ahead of the interests \nof your political party.\n  Vern Riffe grew up in politics. his family was highly political, and \nfrom an early age he loved the nuts and bolts of making government \nwork. He used to say, ``I love being Speaker.''\n  Political scientist Samuel C. Patterson of the Ohio State University \nsummed up Riffe's style:.\n\n       Riffe loved working with his members, doing favors for \n     them, helping them get reelected, and assisting them in \n     fulfilling their own ambitions and their own objectives as \n     legislators. As a political leader, he was supportive, and \n     his success depended on his reliability and trust. Riffe's \n     friendliness and his southern Ohio, small town, 'down home' \n     demeanor, endeared him to his supporters and disarmed most of \n     his opponents. He was not stridently partisan, a quality \n     underscored by the fact that the two prominent Republicans, \n     former long-time Governor James A. Rhodes and former house \n     Republican leader Corwin Nixon, are among his closest \n     personal friends.\n\n  That is the Vern Riffe that I remember. He used to spend time at the \nGalleria across the street from the Statehouse, meeting with members of \nthe house and senate in a very informal way, reaching agreement on \nliterally countless issues. When he retired from the house a couple of \nyears ago, this is what one State representative said:\n\n       Vern Riffe is the Woody Hayes of Ohio politics. Without his \n     strong leadership, not just the Ohio House, but all of State \n     government will be fundamentally different.\n\n  I think that is right. Vern Riffe was a legend, a man who cared about \nusing the power he had to help the people of Ohio.\n  In conclusion, Vern Riffe never lost sight of the values he learned \nfrom his closest political adviser, and, as he told me, his closest \nfriend. That was his dad, Vernal G. Riffe, Sr., who was a former \nrailroader who served as mayor of the town of New Boston. Vern Riffe's \ndad used to tell him: ``Son, if you're going to be a leader, you've got \nto lead.'' Mr. President, Vern Riffe always led.\n  Another Ohio legend, John Mahaney, president of the Ohio Council of \nRetail Merchants, put it best. He said about Vern Riffe: ``It's like \nyou get in the Hall of Fame by batting .300, 15 out of 20 years. It's \nlongevity and consistency. And (Vern Riffe) passes both tests.''\n  Mr. President, we will miss him a great deal. In March of this year, \nhe and his wife Thelma began their 50th year of marriage. On behalf of \nthe people of Ohio, I express my condolences to Thelma and to their \nchildren--Cathy Skiver, Verna Kay Riffe, Mary Beth Hewitt, and Vernal \nG. Riffe III, and to their seven grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, he was a good man.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8483-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMPTROLLER GENERAL, GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before leaving for the August recess, I want \nto address the Senate briefly on the matter of the vacancy in the \nOffice of the Comptroller General. The General Accounting Office is a \nvital organization to the Congress, and the person selected to head the \nGAO must have the confidence of both the majority and minority.

Based on the \nprecedent of alternating between Houses, I will serve as chairman of \nthe commission, with the Speaker of the House serving as vice chair. \nThe Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction over the General \nAccounting Office, and I have asked Senator Thompson and his staff to \nmanage the administrative tasks of the commission.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to recognize \nan organization who has represented the visually impaired for 50 years. \nMembers of the National Federation of the Blind of Kentucky will \nconvene on September 5 and 6 to celebrate their work and commitment to \nimproving the lives of visually impaired citizens in the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky.\n  The organization's first president, Harold L. Reagan, lived his life \nnot as a blind person, but as an American citizen with a dream. Not \nonly was Reagan blind, but he also lost his arm. In the 1930's this was \nnot easy to overcome. However, this did not stop Reagan. He created an \nenterprise selling candy, soft drinks and cigarettes over a counter at \nthe Jefferson County Courthouse in Louisville, KY. Reagan was the first \nvisually impaired person to manage this type of business in Kentucky \nand inspired many others to follow in his footsteps.\n  Reagan faced adversity with courage and strength. Along with fellow \nsupporters, Reagan helped shape a small organization that became known \nas the Kentucky Federation of the Blind. This group challenged society \nto set aside their biases, and opened doors for the visually impaired. \nTheir efforts led to the establishment of a separate agency for the \nblind in Kentucky which improved services to the blind through \nadditional resources and the elimination of bureaucratic hurdles.\n  In 1947 Kentucky became the 27th State affiliated with the National \nFederation of the Blind. In 1979 Betty Niceley filled the shoes of her \nmentor as President of the Kentucky chapter.\n  Visually impaired Kentuckians, family, friends and citizens now reap \nthe\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\nbenefits of current information, education, and a forceful advocate on \nState and Federal issues.\n  Ongoing activities and constant public contact continues to make the \nNational Federation of the Blind of Kentucky a united force. Their \nefforts have distinguished Kentucky as a leader throughout the country \nfor its research and promotion of technology assisting visually \nimpaired users in obtaining highly sought after computer jobs.\n  As times change, so do biases and expectations. This year the U.S. \nSenate saw a staffer join us on the floor to assist with important \nlegislation. While this is not unusual, it was unusual to see this aid \nassisted by her guide dog. This same aid and guide dog assisted my \noffice a little over a year ago.\n  I would never say the road that Reagan and other visually impaired \nKentuckians have traveled was an easy one to travel, but a necessary \njourney to benefit generations to come. As friends and family gather \ntoday and tomorrow, it will not only be a time to reflect on the past, \nbut toward the future.\n  I am proud to stand before you and say the world is changing for the \nbetter. I know you will join me in congratulating the National \nFederation of the Blind of Kentucky for 50 years of dedication and \nservice in our quest for a better future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8483-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOE R.

Christian who will be retiring on August 19 \nfrom the U.S. Capitol Police after 20 years of service to the force.\n  As the officer on duty with the Capitol Third Division, Joe has given \nMembers and staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence a sense of safety and well-being that few others could. \nHis warm smile, good sense of humor and welcoming words have endeared \nhim to his colleagues as well.\n  Officer Joe Christian has demonstrated that he is a true Kentuckian \nby his commitment to serving the public good. While he may no longer \nlive in the Commonwealth, Joe has roots back home in Elkton, KY. I know \nthat his friends and family there are proud of his service to the U.S. \nCapitol Police and his service to the U.S. Navy. Joe joined the Navy at \n18 and for over 20 years, he flew all over the world with different \nsquadrons, earning an Honorable Discharge as well as a Good Conduct \nMedal with a five oak leaf cluster.\n  I am proud of Joe, too, and extend my best wishes to him as he begins \nthis new phase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8484-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8484-S8485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WILLIAM BRENNAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week this Nation lost a true \nAmerican hero with the passing of former Supreme Court Justice William \nBrennan. The contributions of William Brennan to our democratic way of \nlife are many and will continue, long after his passing, to touch the \nlives of people all across this Nation in the most important and \nfundamental ways. Always a staunch and unrelenting defender of \nindividual liberty, William Brennan helped to preserve many important \nrights that each of us, as Americans, enjoy today. He fought \nrelentlessly to preserve the right to vote, the right to free \nexpression, and the right to be treated as an equal with your fellow \ncitizens. His legacy is one that honors the fundamental notion that in \nAmerica, the individual truly does matter.\n  In terms of length of service on the Supreme Court and number of \nopinions written, William Brennan ranks near the top. However, to \nreduce his career to these simple numbers is to diminish the scope and \nimportance of William Brennan in shaping this Nation's constitutional \nlaw. Many of Brennan's most significant decisions were decided by \nnarrow margins and it is a testament not only to the undeniability of \nJustice Brennan's often cited Irish charm, but also to the power of his \nintellect that he could draw diverse Justices together to support \nimportant decisions which he drafted. In this regard, he may never be \nequaled.\n  Mr. President, there are many reasons to admire and respect William \nBrennan. He was a man of enormous dignity and compassion. His intellect \nand reasoning, second to none. Although there are many areas which one \ncould point to in order to highlight the greatness of William Brennan, \nI will note just two that are significant to me. First, his unrelenting \ndefense of the first amendment right to free expression. Because of \nWilliam Brennan, the media in this Nation retains the right to \ncriticize the government, to show the American people what goes on in \ntheir elected bodies--in other words, to hold us accountable. Absent \nthis right, the credibility of our democracy and our form of government \nwould be, in my opinion, greatly diminished. William Brennan understood \nthat if the first amendment was to mean anything, it must protect that \nexpression which was not popular. In upholding the first amendment in \nregard to flag desecration, Justice Brennan wrote that;\n\n       If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First \n     Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit \n     expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea \n     itself offensive or disagreeable.\n\n  In typical Brennan fashion, his opinion was joined by four colleagues \nof diverse perspectives, Justices Marshall, Blackmun, Kennedy, and \nScalia.\n  In regard to capital punishment, Brennan remained steadfastly \nopposed. Although he acknowledged that his view was the minority, he \nmaintained until the end that the death penalty was violative of the \neighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. In his \nestimation, a system which treated human beings as nonhuman or objects \nsimply to be toyed with and disregarded was simply not protected by the \nU.S. Constitution. In the wake of Justice Brennan's death I am reminded \nthat just a few short weeks ago, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives who supports the death penalty, stated on a national \nnews program that someday in America we will execute an innocent \nperson. He argued that while we don't want to do that, and will try to \nprevent it, it is an inevitable consequence of having capital \npunishment. This is a staggering, yet candid, statement which I think, \nmakes Justice Brennan's point in a very stark and chilling way. Justice \nBrennan may well have been on the minority on capital punishment Mr. \nPresident, that is not to say however, that his position was incorrect.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that Justice Brennan was a man \nthat I admired. His opinions were reasoned, intelligent, and always \nconsistent with the notion that in America the rights of the \nindividual, no matter his or her background, upbringing, political \nideology, or religious beliefs, mattered. That simple, yet often \noverlooked notion is the foundation of our democracy and was the \ncornerstone of Justice Brennan's approach to the law. He was truly the \nmost influential Justice of his time. And while I certainly add my name \nto the list of those who mourn his passing, I also join those who \ncelebrate the richness of his life and the countless opinions which \nhelped improve the lot of millions of Americans. Ours is a better \nNation because of William Brennan.\n  However, Mr. President, the greatest measure of William Brennan is \nnot one taken from afar--from simply reading his opinions or following \nthe public persona--but from those closest to him, his family, friends, \nand those who sat with him on the bench. In this regard the comments of \nhis colleagues are telling. Justice Souter called Brennan the most \nfearlessly principled guardian of the Constitution that has ever lived. \nJustice Scalia, a jurist often at philosophical odds with Brennan \ncalled him the most influential Justice of this century. Justice \nKennedy called him a great friend of freedom, not only for those who \nenjoy freedom, but also those who seek it. Justice Clarence Thomas was \nquoted recently as saying that there simply isn't a more decent or \nbrilliant human being than William Brennan. From these great jurists of \ndiverse backgrounds and ideological perspective, the message is the \nsame; William Brennan's contribution was undeniable, important, and \nlasting. It is not surprising Mr. President, that even in saying good-\nbye, Justice Brennan has once again forged a diverse coalition.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, at the close of business yesterday, \nWednesday, July 30, 1997, the Federal debt\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\nstood at $5,372,436,799,991.80.

I add a special word of thanks to Gary for his dedicated \nservice to me during my two terms as Governor of Missouri.\n  During my tenure as Governor, Gary and I traveled from one end of the \nState to the other, as well as around the country.

Mr. President, the balanced budget agreement passed \nby the Senate today was an extraordinary and historical accomplishment. \nThe American people can be proud that Congress took bipartisan action \nto provide not only the first balanced budget in a generation but also \ntax relief to working families, health care for uninsured children, \nfinancial relief for those seeking a college education and the promise \nof long-term solvency for Medicare.\n  In another historic yet less worthy act, the conferees quietly \nincluded in the bill a provision to, for the first time, relax the \ncross-ownership rules that prevent television stations or newspapers \nfrom owning a television station within the same city. The FCC has \nrightly enacted and enforced cross-ownership prohibitions for 50 years \nto ensure diversity of opinion and views on our local airwaves.\n  But the provision in the reconciliation bill would allow newspaper \nowners and broadcasters to bid on licenses within the same market \nduring the 2002 auction of analog broadcast signals in markets with \npopulations greater than 400,000. These signals will be made available \nas the current analog stations convert to digital transmission.\n  This action could have a seriously detrimental effect on the \ndiversity of the current mosaic of broadcast entities. Broadcast \ntelevision remains the most prolific form of local broadcast news and \nit is critical that this diversity is continued. Indeed, I am deeply \nconcerned by the effect that this provision could have on the FCC's \ncurrent review of cross-ownership rules.\n  Congress directed the FCC to review cross-ownership rules in the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 and the results of this review are \npending. While I believe Congress should revisit the reconciliation \nrelaxation provision on its own merits and free from the rush toward \npassage of the agreement, it is also critical that the FCC, during its \nown review of cross-ownership, does not interpret passage of this \nprovision as unobjected Congressional support for repeal or relaxation \nof cross-ownership rules.\n  Indeed, it is important to note that this provision is intended to \nprovide cross-ownership only when there is a doubling of broadcast \noutlets within a particular market and only in markets of populations \ngreater than 400,000. If Congress had wanted to take further action, it \nwould have done so and therefore, the FCC should not.\n  Our broadcast spectrum is one of our Nation's most valuable assets \nand one of the most powerful yet limited resource for the dissemination \nof ideas and free expression. It is critical that Congress work to \nprotect rather than dilute this resource and I will fight for the \nintegrity of our airwaves as Congress continues to address these \nissues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8485-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8485-S8486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TERRORIST BOMBING IN JERUSALEM\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and many others, as an original cosponsor of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 46.\n  Yesterday two suicide terrorist bombers blew themselves up in the \nMahane Yehuda open-air marketplace in the center of Jerusalem. These \nbombs were clearly timed to do the maximum possible damage. They \nexploded seconds apart at about 1 p.m. local time, at the height of the \nlunchtime shopping hour. Initial reports indicate that at least 18 \npeople were killed and over 100 were injured.\n  This was a despicable, bloodthirsty act, which all of us stand and \ncondemn in one voice. It is not yet known exactly who perpetrated the \nbombing, but it bears great similarity to attacks conducted in the past \nby the Palestinian extremist groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Whoever \nbears guilt for this terrible crime is beneath contempt.\n  We join Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Weizman, and the Israeli \npeople in mourning those who were murdered yesterday, and we offer our \ndeepest condolences to their families. To the wounded, we offer our \nprayers and hopes for their full recovery.\n  Sadly, Israelis have become all too familiar with having their daily \nroutines shattered by the sudden bloodshed and carnage of bombings in \nseemingly ordinary places--on a bus, in a marketplace, in park or a \ncafe. On top of all the other tragic aspects of these bombings, the way \nIsraelis are forced to live with the knowledge that their world could \nbe blown apart at any instant is a peculiar kind of torture.\n  President Clinton was exactly right when he said yesterday morning \nthat this bomb was aimed not only at innocent Israeli civilians, but \nalso at all those in the Middle East who genuinely desire peace. And I \nfear that this bombing, because of its timing and location, could be as \ndamaging to prospects for peace as any that we have seen.\n  The timing could hardly have been worse. The President's Special \nMiddle East Coordinator, Dennis Ross, was about to travel to Israel to \ntry to breathe new life into the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which \nhave been suspended for many months, but which were just beginning to \nshow signs of resuming. In fact, there is good reason to believe that \nthis attack was timed specifically to disrupt Mr. Ross's trip and the \nimpending resumption of the peace talks. Now it may be weeks or months \nbefore these talks can resume and be productive. For the extremists, \nthe greatest danger is that the talks could make progress, and they are \nobviously willing to do anything to prevent it.\n  This bombing also has ramifications for our work. On August 12, the \nMiddle East Peace Facilitation Act will expire. This act provided the \nlegislative framework for U.S. involvement in the peace process by \ngiving the President the authority to provide assistance to the \nPalestinian Authority, allow the\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\nPLO to operate an office in Washington, and waive other restrictions on \nUnited States-Palestinian contacts, if he certifies that the \nPalestinian Authority is fulfilling its commitments.\n  I had hoped that the House and Senate leadership would work with \nthose of us who care deeply about this issue to pass a short-term \nextension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, so that it does \nnot expire while the Congress is in recess next month. There are many \nMembers, myself included, who believe that the act needs to be reworked \nto establish a tougher standard of compliance, before it is extended \nfor the long term. But a short-term extension of 60 or 90 days would \ngive us the opportunity to negotiate a meaningful new version of the \nlaw, without this important legislation lapsing for a matter of weeks, \nor even months.\n  Now, under these circumstances, I do not think it will be possible to \npass to a short-term extension in the short time remaining before the \nAugust recess. I hope that we will be able to negotiate an appropriate \nreplacement for the current Middle East Peace Facilitation Act shortly \nafter the recess in September.\n  The location of this bombing also makes it deeply resonant. The \nMahane Yehuda marketplace is in the heart of downtown Jerusalem. It is \na place where every Israeli has spent time, and many Jerusalemites \nvisit or pass through it daily. It will be difficult to recover from an \nattack in such a central and symbolic place, and the Israeli Government \nwill find it difficult to engage in peace talks while this memory is \nfresh.\n  What will it take to recover from this bombing? Before anything else \ncan take place, it will take action by the Palestinian Authority. First \nand foremost, the Palestinian Authority should resume security \ncooperation with the Israeli government to the full extent that they \nhad cooperated before. At one time, in 1995 and part of 1996, Israeli \nan Palestinian security cooperation reached unprecedented levels. This \ncooperation reflected a mutual understanding in the shared stake both \nsides had in preventing acts of terrorism by extremists bent on \ndestroying the peace process.\n\n  That shared stake still exists today, but the Palestinian leadership \nmust recognize it and act upon it. Even if the Palestinians are angered \nby some Israeli actions, that does not change the mutual interest they \nhave in preventing terrorism. Because if anything will stop the peace \nprocess from achieving the aspirations of both Palestinians and \nIsraelis, terrorism will.\n  Second, the Palestinian Authority must reinvigorate its efforts to \nroot out terrorist groups in the areas under its control. This effort \nhas been spotty, at best, and Palestinian officials, including Chairman \nArafat, have been rightly criticized for giving less than clear signals \nthat terrorism will not be tolerated under any circumstances. This is \nnot acceptable. An unequivocal red light against terrorism and the \noperations of terrorist groups--a no-tolerance policy--is the only \nthing that is acceptable.\n  Chairman Arafat called Prime Minister Netanyahu shortly after the \nbombing to condemn the attack, which is the right thing for him to have \ndone. But he must not and cannot stop there. He should condemn publicly \nin the strongest possible language--in English and Arabic--these \nbombings and all other acts of terrorism. He should instruct his \nsecurity forces to dismantle the infrastructure of the terrorist \ngroups, arresting those who are complicit in the conduct of terrorist \nattacks. He should use his bully pulpit to insist that Palestinian \nsociety rejects the elements who believe their aspirations--or \nmartyrdom--can be attained by killing Israelis. If he fails to take \nthese steps, there can be no peace process, and Palestinian aspirations \nwill never be realized.\n  Finally, when the security situation is more stabilized, both sides \nmust resume peace talks with a view toward meeting only their own \nneeds, but the needs of the other side as well. If these talks are seen \nin purely zero-sum terms, they will go nowhere. Both sides must make \ntheir demands--on Israel's further redeployments in the West Bank, and \non final status issues like Jerusalem, settlements, refugees, and \nsovereignty--with the understanding that if the other side has no stake \nin the process, there will be no final status agreement that brings \nabout a lasting peace.\n  Clearly the peace process cannot coexist with terrorism. But despite \nyesterday's tragic and criminal bombing, the logic of this peace \nprocess, and the fundamental need for peace between Israelis and \nPalestinians has not changed. To give up on this effort would condemn \nfuture generations of Israelis to controlling a hostile population of \nover 2 million, to the detriment of Israel's long-term security and \nwell-being. It would also bury Palestinian dreams of self-\ndetermination.\n  To turn away now from the search for peace would be to reward the \nextremists for their acts of violence and terrorism. It would be a \nvictory for the barbaric suicide bombers of Mahane Yehuda. It would say \nto them: ``You were right. You win. There cannot and shall not be peace \nbetween Israelis and Palestinians.''\n  Neither Israelis nor Palestinians--nor the United States--can afford \nfor that to happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8485-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8486-S8487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ROSA PARKS TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to a \nnumber of organizations and individuals who gave of themselves at a \ncrucial time for the people of Michigan. These people and organizations \nextended aid to legendary Michigan civil rights leader Rosa Parks and \nto her organization, the Detroit-based Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute \nfor Self Development. Mrs. Parks and her organization are both Michigan \nand national treasures. They suffered a great tragedy over the past few \ndays, and I am greatly heartened that so many came forward to help in \nthe aftermath.\n  Mr. President, each year the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute \nsponsors a historical tour tracing the route of the Underground \nRailroad. On Wednesday, July 30, approximately 30 young men and women \non this tour, along with their chaperons, were traveling on Interstate \n95, south of Petersburg, VA, when their bus ran off the highway, slid \ndown an embankment and came to a rest on its side in the Nottoway \nRiver.\n  Many of those on board sustained serious injuries, and one chaperon, \nAdisa Foluke, whom Mrs. Parks has said she considers her grandson, was \nkilled. One of the young women, Tiandra Gunn, remains in a coma. A trip \nthat had begun with so much promise, had in an instant become a \nnightmare. Mrs. Parks and her associates from the Institute immediately \nflew to Virginia to be with the youths and their families during this \ndifficult time.\n  Rarely in such dire circumstances could one find reason to be \nheartened. However, the immediate and overwhelming response from the \nDetroit-area business community was to ask how they could help. \nChrysler Corp. offered the use of a private jet to return Mrs. Parks \nand her associates from Richmond, VA, to Detroit. Northwest Airlines \nprovided free air travel to the students stranded so far away from \nhome, and also arranged to transport the body of the deceased home to \nMichigan.\n  Examples of compassionate generosity weren't limited solely to \nMichigan businesses. The American Red Cross paid for the group's \nlodging for 2 nights and secured ground transportation. The local \nShoney's restaurant in Petersburg, VA donated free meals. Individual \nvolunteers, both in Michigan and Virginia, offered their help to the \nyoung men and women and their families.\n  The city of Detroit, and one of its most cherished citizens, \nexperienced great loss this week. However, I believe we have also \nexperienced hope. At a time when little was expected, a great deal was \ndelivered. No one has ever given more of themselves to their community \nthan Rosa Parks. I was proud to see so many who have benefited from her \nexample of selfless leadership respond in kind.\n  Mr. President, this has been a story of severe tragedy. But it has \nalso been a story of caring, of friends and neighbors galvanized by a \ndesire to help those in need. I extend my condolences to Mrs. Parks and \nto the rest of Adisa Foluke's family. I'm sure all of our prayers go \nout to Tiandra Gunn, the rest of the injured, and their families. I \nalso extend my thanks, on behalf of\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\nthe state of Michigan, to all those who gave so generously in this time \nof need. I would include in this category, not only Chrysler Corp., \nNorthwest Airlines, the American Red Cross, and Shoney's, but also \nEunice Miles of my Southfield office, and Steve Hessler, my deputy \npress secretary. Both provided quick response and extra time and effort \nduring a critical time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8486-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8487-S8488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NORTH KOREAN FAMINE--A HUMAN TRAGEDY AND A THREAT TO PEACE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to address a great human tragedy \nsilently unfolding in North Korea and the urgent need for the United \nStates to respond.\n  The North is experiencing a severe famine and has asked the world for \nhelp. Pyongyang has gratefully acknowledged our past assistance. It is \nin our interest to respond generously to their plight.\n\n\n                       on the brink of starvation\n\n  According to experts from the World Food Program [WFP] who recently \nreturned from extensive travels in North Korea, tens of thousands of \npeople are on the brink of starvation. Hundreds of thousands more are \nsuffering from severe malnutrition, the result of several years of \nscarcity.\n  The public food distribution system on which 78 percent of the \nNorth's population depends has effectively ceased to function in most \nparts of the country. In those few rural areas where the public \ndistribution system still is operating, rations have fallen to below \n100 grams per day, the equivalent of a small handful or rice or corn \nfor each person.\n  The evidence of famine is pervasive and undeniable. Children are \namong the hardest hit, their hair tinged red from malnutrition, their \ngrowth stunted, their eyes sunken and listless.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from this week's copy of Newsweek magazine, which includes a \nphotograph of starving North Korean children into the Record. I'd like \nto note for the record that a photograph of a Andrew Cunanan graced the \ncover, while the poignant photo of four starving North Korean \nkindergarten students was on page 46.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Newsweek Magazine, July 28, 1997]\n\n                          Just Skin and Bones\n\n                 (By Tom Masland and Jeffrey Bartholet)\n\n       It's a slow-motion catastrophe, largely hidden from \n     outsiders. But the latest visitors to North Korea confirm the \n     world's worst fears. A nation of 23 million people is \n     starving, slowly and painfully. ``Mere survival is becoming \n     more and more difficult,'' wrote one man to his mother in \n     Japan. ``There are people dying.'' Travelers describe scenes \n     that once were unthinkable in this police state: beggars in \n     the streets of Pyongyang, masked, armed robbers raiding \n     private homes for food, trees totally stripped of leaves and \n     edible bark. Perhaps most persuasive of all are the first \n     photographs to document the deepening tragedy. The one on \n     this page was taken in an orphanage by an official visitor \n     from a Roman Catholic charity. The blank stares of the \n     spindly infants cry out: time is short.\n       In response to the crisis, Washington last week doubled its \n     previous donation of food aid to the north. The promised \n     100,000 tons of grain represents slightly more than half the \n     $45.6 million requested by the World Food Program earlier \n     this month in direct response to the plight of North Korea's \n     children. Executive director Catherine Bertini says the WFP \n     needs enriched baby food for children who are too \n     malnourished to digest the customary relief meal, a handful \n     of ground corn. Bertini reports that the program's staff \n     members in North Korea ``estimate that 50 to 80 percent of \n     the children they have seen in nurseries are underweight and \n     markedly smaller than they should be for their age. They are \n     literally wasting away.''\n       Playing politics: The emergency food aid will help, but \n     it's not a lasting answer to North Korea's creeping famine. \n     The crisis is bound up with politics: North Koreans are going \n     hungry because their Stalinist economy is collapsing, and the \n     United States, Tokyo and Seoul are using food aid to lure \n     Pyongyang into four-way peace talks and economic reform. Yet \n     North Korean leader Kim Jong II and his cronies are wary of \n     any compromise that could loosen their grip on power. They're \n     prepared to do whatever they feel is necessary to survive--\n     and they're wildly unpredictable.\n       Managing North Korea's collapse has become a top priority \n     of the Clinton administration. The United States has 37,000 \n     troops based in South Korea to help deter Pyongyang. Yet as \n     North Korea deteriorates, fears mount that its leaders will \n     ``use it before they lose it.'' The endgame is no longer a \n     matter of if, but when. As a Rand Corporation study concluded \n     last year, ``The Korean Peninsula presents a strange paradox. \n     Nobody knows what might happen this year or next, but \n     everyone agrees on how things will look in 10 or 20 years. \n     The North Korean regime is doomed in the long run.''\n       In part to obtain famine relief, Pyongyang last month \n     finally agreed to attend peace talks in New York aimed at \n     ending the formal state of war that still applies on the \n     peninsula. And last week North Korea promised to lift a ban \n     that has prevented Japanese wives of North Koreans from \n     visiting their homeland for more than three decades. Japan, \n     which has vast stocks of surplus rice, now is considering \n     providing additional food aid. But anyone who thought \n     Pyongyang was turning soft got a rude reminder last week. A \n     squad of North Korean troops briefly crossed the \n     demilitarized zone and provoked the heaviest exchange of fire \n     with South Korean troops in two decades.\n       Why increase tensions along the most heavily armed border \n     in the world? Pyongyang may believe that by instigating a \n     fire fight along the border it reinforces the message that \n     North Korea is dangerously unstable--springing loose more \n     food aid from Washington, Japan and others. Some analysts \n     also think that there's a power struggle underway within the \n     regime between hardliners in the military and moderates in \n     the civilian bureaucracy. According to this view, every time \n     the moderates move to open relations with the outside world, \n     hard-liners resist. Last September the incursion of a North \n     Korean submarine on the South Korean coast led to a manhunt \n     in which 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans were killed--\n     just as Pyongyang was trying to persuade foreign businesses \n     to invest in a new free-trade zone. This time, hard-liners \n     may have wanted to pre-empt the Aug. 5 peace talks.\n       Once sanguine about a ``soft landing'' in Korea--in which \n     Pyongyang embraces economic reforms and gradual, peaceful \n     reunification--U.S. intelligence analysts now predict a \n     crash. In one scenario, reformers topple Kim in a palace coup \n     and call for help from Seoul or Beijing--creating yet another \n     delicate, hard-to-manage issue between Beijing and \n     Washington. Or perhaps North Korea attempts to seize Seoul, \n     hoping to achieve reunification on its own terms. One former \n     Pentagon analyst warns of a human-wave assault down high \n     ridges and hills where tanks can't operate. This would likely \n     come during the summer, when chemical weapons work most \n     effectively and haze hinders air operations. The argument \n     against such a disaster: China, North Korea's neighbor and \n     longtime socialist ally, can be expected to use all its \n     influence to deter such an attack.\n       Could famine bring on the collapse of the Pyongyang regime? \n     Conceivably, if North Koreans come to fear starvation more \n     than they do the government. But so far discipline remains \n     strong. U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, who visited the North in April, \n     recalls visiting a maternity clinic where mothers were dying \n     and 6-month-old infants looked like newborns. ``If you asked \n     what they planned to do, people answered, `The Dear Leader \n     will take care of us. He always does'.'' Hall said. Whoever \n     eventually rules a united Korean peninsula could pay the \n     price for years. ``This is one of the few countries I know \n     where the kids are growing up to be smaller than their \n     parents,'' says Hall. Some call it ``generational stunting.'' \n     ``If [children] are malnourished in these critical years, \n     they can't make it up,'' says one U.N. official. For North \n     Korea's hungry kids, the endgame is now.\n\n\n                        inadequate U.S. response\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. The United States has a long tradition of responding \ngenerously to people in need. By sharing our bounty we have saved \nmillions in Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Angola.\n  To date, however, our response to North Korea's famine has been \ncautious and inadequate.\n  Over the past 12 months, the United States has provided a total of \nabout $60 million in food aid, including the recent announcement of \n$27.4 million for 100,000 metric tons of grain.\n  The world, following our restrained lead, has been slow to meet the \ngenuine emergency needs of the North Korean people. According to the \nWorld Food Program, the North began 1997 roughly 2 million tons of \ngrain short of what it would need to avoid famine. But as of July 1, \nthe North had received a total of only about 423,000 tons of food aid, \nIt had managed to purchase or barter another 330,000 tons, leaving a \nshortfall of more than 1 million tons for the remainder of the calendar \nyear.\n  The United States has never linked politics with emergency food \nassistance, and we should not do so now.\n  We can do more.\n  And we should do more to avert mass starvation and the incumbent risk \nof political and military instability of the Korean peninsula.\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\n                            roots of famine\n\n  Why is the North experiencing a famine? North Korean authorities \nattribute the shortages to a string of bad weather, including serious \nflooding in 1995 and 1996. Truth be told, however, the famine is \nlargely the result of wrong-headed, discredited Communist economic \npolicies and the devotion of vast resources to the North Korean armed \nforces.\n  But this does not make the North Korean people less deserving of \nemergency relief. It is not ethically permissible to use starvation as \na weapon to force the North Korean dictatorship to undertake essential \neconomic reforms.\n  Some observers worry that the North might divert our food aid from \nthose who are truly hungry to the military or party elite.\n  But international relief agencies are able to send their monitors \nthrough-out the famine-stricken areas where supplies are being \ndelivered. The World Food Program has even chartered a helicopter to \nfacilitate oversight.\n  United States private voluntary organizations will soon begin \ndirectly supervising the distribution of American assistance, opening \nanother window into life inside the hermit kingdom.\n  The bottom line? We can have a high degree of confidence that the \nvast majority of any assistance we provide will reach the intended \ntargets.\n\n\n                        why not starve them out?\n\n  Opponents of emergency famine relief for North Korea wonder aloud \nwhether the famine might not be a blessing in disguise; the perfect \nmechanism to bring about the downfall of one of the most repressive \nregimes left on the planet. But this cynical view is not only immoral, \nit displays a total disregard for the potentially explosive results of \nsuch a policy of strangulation.\n  Famines are profoundly restabilizing events. No one can predict with \nconfidence how North Korea might respond. But it is obvious to me that \nwe do not want the North--which may possess one or two nuclear \nweapons--to experience panic, massive population migrations, and \ninstability.\n  In testimony earlier this month before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Andrew Natsios, director of foreign disaster assistance \nduring the Bush administration and now vice-president of World Vision, \na nongovernmental relief organization operating in North Korea, warned \nthat the North's famine could soon reach the irreversible stage.\n  He added that by the time the world sees CNN broadcasts or emaciated \nNorth Korean children too weak to lift themselves off their cots, it \nwill be too late to save them.\n\n\n                             food for peace\n\n  Next Tuesday, August 5, representatives of North Korea, South Korea, \nChina, and the United States are scheduled to convene talks aimed at \nreplacing the tattered 1953 Armistice with a peace treaty. If history \nis any guide, these historic negotiations are likely to be both \ndifficult and protracted.\n  But while the diplomats talk and the world waits and prays for peace, \nfamished innocent North Koreans move closer to death.\n  It is time for the United States to lead a comprehensive, humane \nresponse to the North's famine.\n  Not because the North has agreed to peace talks;\n  Not because the North has frozen its nuclear program and accepted \ninternational atomic energy agency monitoring of its Yongbyon nuclear \nfacility; and\n  Not because the North is cooperating for the first time in 50 years \nin the search for the remains of America's 8,000 missing servicemen \nfrom the Korean war.\n  We should respond because it is the smart thing to do. It is the \nnoble thing to do. It is an expression of all that is best about \nAmerica that cannot help but resonate in the hearts of the North Korean \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8487-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8488-S8491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATO ENLARGEMENT AFTER MADRID\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, earlier this month in Madrid the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization held a momentous summit meeting, which \nbrought together the heads of state and government of its 16-member \ncountries to discuss the future of the Alliance in the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I was privileged to be a member of a bipartisan, \nbicameral Congressional delegation to the summit meeting. Today, I \nwould like to discuss the results of Madrid and their important \nimplications for American foreign policy.\n  At Madrid, NATO took the historic step of inviting Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary to begin accession talks with the alliance.\n  The alliance now has several pressing priorities as a followup to the \nsummit.\n  As its first priority, NATO must complete these accession talks this \nfall with the three prospective new members. Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary have all met the basic alliance membership \nrequirements--democracy, civilian control of the military, the rule of \nlaw, no conflicts with neighbors, and the willingness and ability to \nassume alliance responsibilities.\n  NATO and the candidates must now assess the military capabilities of \neach of the three in detail, and must plainly state each country's \nresponsibilities and tasks within the alliance.\n  Of particular importance is that the issues of cost of enlargment \nmust be forthrightly addressed, both by the three prospective members \nand by all the current members of the alliance.\n  The goal is to successfully conclude the talks with Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary in time for the Protocol of Accession to be \nsigned at the NATO ministerial meeting in December of this year. The \nnext step is for each of the 16 current NATO members to begin the \nprocess of ratification of amending the Washington treaty. Of course, \nMr. President, according to our constitution, it is the U.S. Senate \nthat is responsible for advice and consent to treaties, and we \nanticipate that we will consider the NATO enlargement treaty amendment \nnext spring.\n  NATO's second major priority after Madrid is developing a \nstrengthened cooperative relationship with those countries that were \nnot invited to be in the first group of new members. At Madrid, NATO \nre-emphasized an ``Open Door'' policy by which the first group of \ninvited countries will not be the last. Additional candidacies will be \nconsidered, beginning with the next NATO summit, to be held here in \nWashington in April 1999 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the \nfounding of the alliance.\n  In an important gesture, the Madrid summit communique singled out for \nspecial mention the positive developments toward democracy and the rule \nof law in Slovenia and Romania. As many of my colleagues will remember, \nI was a strong advocate of Slovenia's being included in the first group \nof new members.\n  I anticipate that both Slovenia and Romania, and perhaps other \ncountries, will be invited to accession talks with NATO in 1999.\n  In addition, in a thinly veiled bow to Estonia, Latvia, and \nLithuania, the Madrid summit communique reiterated conditions set forth \nin NATO's 1995 study whereby no European democratic country will be \nexcluded from consideration for membership because of its geographic \nlocation.\n  Translated into real English that means that NATO will not allow \nMoscow to give the three Baltic states a double whammy.\n  In other words, the Soviet Union's illegal, forcible incorporation of \nthe Baltic states in 1940--which, I am proud to say, was never \nrecognized by the United States--will not be used as a pretext to veto \ntheir consideration for NATO membership.\n  Mr. President, Ukraine, with an area and population the size of \nFrance, is arguably the most strategically important country in East-\nCentral Europe. At Madrid, NATO and Ukraine signed a Charter on a \nDistinctive Partnership. Ukraine is currently not seeking NATO \nmembership, but under President Kuchma (KOOCH-ma) it has undertaken \ndemocratic and free-market reforms in an attempt to move closer to the \nWest. This charter should reinforce this trend.\n  In order to keep the enlargement momentum going in the countries not \nyet ready for membership, a new Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council was \ninaugurated at Madrid. This body will direct an enhanced Partnership \nfor Peace Program--a program involving more than two dozen countries, \nwhich, incidentally, has already far exceeded our most optimistic \nexpectations.\n  Of vital importance to the new security architecture in Europe is \nNATO's\n\n[[Page S8489]]\n\nnew relationship with the Russian Federation. Based on the Founding Act \nbetween NATO and Russia, that new relationship has begun to take shape.\n  The permanent joint council, whose consultative functions are \noutlined in the Founding Act, recently held a preliminary meeting, and \nmore are planned for the autumn.\n  Rather than being a rival for to the North Atlantic Council, as some \ncritics have asserted, the permanent joint council will be a proving \nground where Russia can show its intention to cooperate in a positive \nspirit with the West.\n  I hope and expect that it will act in this manner. If, however, \nMoscow chooses the old path of propaganda and confrontation, then the \npermanent joint council will atrophy. But, I re-emphasize, in no way \nwill the permanent joint council usurp the leading role in NATO played \nby the North Atlantic Council.\n  The third and final immediate priority for NATO after the Madrid \nsummit is to finalize the internal adaptation of the alliance. This, \nMr. President, is a complex and crucially important issue.\n  Beginning in 1991, NATO approved a new strategic concept, which moved \nbeyond the cold war focus on collective defense and toward more diverse \ntasks in a global context. In order to carry out these new tasks, the \nnew strategic concept emphasized the need for NATO to achieve an \neffective force projection capability.\n  At the January 1994 Brussels summit, NATO agreed to set up a more \nflexible set of options for organizing and conducting military \noperations. This goal was, and is, to be achieved through the mechanism \nof the combined joint task force, known by its acronym CJTF. Although \nthere has been considerable disagreement between the United States and \nFrance as to the theoretical details of how the CJTF is to be \ncontrolled, in practice both the IFOR and SFOR operations in Bosnia \nhave been unofficial combined joint task forces under NATO command and \ncontrol.\n  Mr. President, I am going into this level of detail because, as I \nwill discuss shortly, the question of post-SFOR Bosnia is inextricably \ntied in with the ratification of NATO enlargement.\n  Another aspect of NATO's internal adaptation concerns reforms in the \nalliance's command structure. At the June 1996 ministerial meeting in \nBerlin, NATO agreed that a European security and defense identity--\nknown by its initials ESDI--would be created within the framework of \nthe alliance by allowing European officers to wear a Western European \nUnion [WEU] command hat as well as their NATO hat.\n  As part of the restructuring, NATO has already reduced the number of \nits strategic commands from three to two, and it is also planning to \nreduce the number of major subordinate commands. It is at this \nintersection of ESDI and command structure, Mr. President, that the \nexpressed interests of France and the United States have collided.\n  The French want to have a European officer take over from an American \nas Commander of Armed Forces South [AFSOUTH] in Naples. We have \nrejected this proposal since it would impact upon our Sixth Fleet, even \nif the Fleet would formally remain under American command. Until now, \nthe dispute remains unresolved, but at Madrid the French agreed to keep \ntalking. In any event, disagreements over internal adaptation will not \nthreaten the enlargement process.\n  Mr. President, having been privileged to have been at Madrid and \nhaving followed the immediate follow-up to the summit, I find my belief \nreinforced that NATO is on the right track. There remain, however, two \nchallenges, which if not satisfactorily met, could well torpedo \nratification of NATO enlargement by this body. They are, first, \nburdensharing and, second, post-SFOR Bosnia.\n  The first challenge is an existential one for NATO. The heads of \nstate and government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic \nCouncil in Madrid directed the Council to ``bring to an early \nconclusion the concrete analysis of the resource implications of the \nforthcoming enlargement.'' The coming months will see serious \ndiscussion and study on the actual costs of enlargement.\n  The Pentagon Report to the Congress in February 1997 was an excellent \nstarting point. Personally, I find its methodology and conclusions \nconvincing, but they have already been challenged by some of our \nEuropean NATO partners. On other occasions I have discussed the details \nof the Pentagon study, so I will not take time today to repeat most of \nthem.\n  One aspect, though, bears special mention. Because the United States \nspent considerable sums of money in the 1980's and early 1990's to make \nour Europe-based forces deployable and sustainable, the Pentagon study \ncalculates our share of the total bill to be less than some Europeans \napparently would like. I believe that, in making that criticism, the \nEuropeans are forgetting that in 1991 they signed onto the new NATO \nstrategic concept that emphasizes force projection, to which I referred \nearlier.\n  If our European friends disagree, let them offer an alternative \nmethodology in the cost negotiations that were mandated at Madrid.\n  Even if the absolute cost to the United States of NATO enlargement is \nwell within our capabilities--as it is likely to be--we must insist \nthat the costs are fairly apportioned within the alliance.\n  I regret that the Madrid summit communique did not specifically call \nfor an equitable sharing of the burden of providing the resources for \nenlargement.\n  Moreover, the immediate post-Madrid statements by French President \nChirac who said that France would not spend an extra franc for \nenlargement, and by German Chancellor Kohl, who said that United States \ncost estimates of enlargement were exaggerated, were not encouraging. \nThey may accurately reflect Chirac's and Kohl's views, or they may \nmerely be opening negotiating positions.\n  In any event, I must emphasize in the strongest possible terms that \nthe North Atlantic alliance is a partnership, not an American charity \nenterprise.\n  While some of our European allies are making significant \ncontributions to alliance multinational military activities, to cost-\nsharing for stationed U.S. forces, and to foreign assistance--all of \nwhich have been listed by the Pentagon as relevant burden-sharing \ncriteria--only Italy, Greece, and Turkey met congressional targets last \nyear on defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product. \nAnd, Mr. President, one might add that the motivations of the last two \ncountries include arming to defend against each other.\n  I will be very surprised if NATO's definitive enlargement cost \nstudy--to be completed in the coming months--does not call for outlays \nthat will force Western European parliaments to increase considerably \ntheir appropriations for defense.\n  At that point, Mr. President, we will reach the alliance's moment of \ntruth. Eleven NATO members are also members of the European Union. I \nhave great sympathy for the European Union's strenuous efforts to \nachieve an ever closer union. Merely trying to fulfill the criteria for \nlaunching a common European currency is proving extremely difficult and \ncausing social tensions in several Western European countries.\n  But, Mr. President, we in the United States have also been taking \npainful steps to balance our own budget. The U.S. Federal work force is \nbeing reduced by more than a quarter-million, and our appropriations \nfor many worthy social, medical, and educational causes have been \ndrastically pared down on austerity grounds.\n  So, Mr. President, I don't think it is too much to ask of our \nEuropean allies what we have been asking of the American people. If one \nEurope, whole and free is worth ensuring through an enlarged NATO, then \nour European allies will take up the challenge and make the sacrifices \nthat we have made. If they feel it is not worth the price, then I fear \nthat the future of the entire alliance will be cast in doubt.\n  A corollary of burdensharing in NATO is the responsibility that the \nUnited States takes for the entire free world through its military \nactivities outside of Europe, especially in the Pacific and the Middle \nEast. As we proceed with NATO enlargement, we must be certain not to \nuse a disproportionate share of our defense funds in Europe and thereby \nweaken our ability to carry out our responsibilties elsewhere.\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\n I am confident that with equitable burdensharing of enlargement, this \nwill not happen.\n  The second looming challenge, Mr. President, is creating a post-SFOR \nforce for Bosnia. I have long called for applying the CJTF concept, to \nwhich I referred earlier, to Bosnia, so that our European allies can \nprovide ground forces there after June 30, 1998, supported by awesome \nAmerican air, naval, communications, and intelligence assets and an \nover-the-horizon U.S. Ready Reserve Force in the region.\n  An amendment to that effect was included in the fiscal year 1998 \nDefense Authorization Bill passed by the Senate.\n  If our European allies follow the logic of their repeated calls for a \nEuropean security and defense identity within NATO, which has been \nofficially recognized by the alliance, then they should seize the \nopportunity offered by the expiration of SFOR's mandate next June.\n  By taking up our offer of a CJTF they can consolidate the Dayton \npeace process and remove a major impediment to the ratification of NATO \nenlargement by the U. S. Senate.\n  If, on the other hand, our European allies persist in their in \ntogether, out together mantra, oblivious to the Madrid communique's \ncall for--``a true, balanced partnership in which Europe is taking on \ngreater responsibility'' then this body will come to the obvious \nconclusion that the alliance's official policy upon which enlargement \nis based no longer obtains. Such a development would have the gravest \nconsequences, not only for enlargement, but for the future of NATO \nitself.\n  Mr. President, I sound these warnings in the firm belief that my two \ndoomsday scenarios will not come to pass. For all but the most \nprovincial Europeans and isolationist Americans recognize the need for \nthe United States to remain intimately involved with Europe and will \nnot want to jeopardize that involvement. The history of the 20th \ncentury has shown that when the United States absents itself from \nEuropean affairs, the Europeans--unfortunately--are unable peacefully \nto resolve their disputes. The result in World War I and World War II \nwas an enormous American sacrifice of blood and treasure.\n  In order that we should never repeat that isolationist mistake, the \nUnited States in 1949 led the founding of NATO, the most successful \ndefensive alliance in history.\n  For nearly half a century it has kept the peace in Western Europe, \nallowing its European members to rebuild, overcome their own ethnic and \nnational animosities, and eventually to prosper.\n  Mr. President, NATO enlargement involves serious policy commitments \nfor the United States, and therefore must be held up to the closest \nscrutiny. Many of us have been posing relevant questions to the \nadministration for several months, and we have received satisfactory \nanswers. There will, of course, continue to be new issues to be faced \nas we get deeper into the details of enlargement. But I believe that it \nserves no useful purpose to repeatedly recycle already answered \nquestions, as if possessed with a need to reinvent the wheel.\n  For example, some of my colleagues recently asked, once again, what \nthreat NATO enlargement is designed to counter. But both the Clinton \nadministration and NATO long ago answered that question: the threat is \ninstability in Central and Eastern Europe, the crucible for two world \nwars in this century. NATO enlargement will extend the decades-old zone \nof stability eastward on the continent.\n  In case anyone thinks that I am only spouting theoretical political \nscience phrases, let me cite an article in the July 28, 1997 edition of \nThe Washington Times, which quotes the head of the Security Policy \nDivision of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. Saying that his country \nwas delighted by NATO's decision in Madrid to invite Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary to join, the Lithuanian official explained--\n``because that extends the zone of stability to our borders.''\n  By now we surely know that the addition of Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary, NATO is not drawing new dividing lines on the \ncontinent, as some of my colleagues recently suggested. I think the \njubilant crowd that welcomed the President in Bucharest--after the \nMadrid summit--has laid that myth to rest. The Romanians knew that \nNATO, by emphasizing its open door policy at Madrid, had once again \nmade clear that its goal is an undivided, peaceful, and free Europe--\nand an alliance that will welcome Romania as a member in the near \nfuture.\n  Some of my colleagues would like to come up with a finely delineated \ntaxonomy of ethnic quarrels, border disputes, external aggression, and \nthe like, as a precondition for moving ahead with NATO enlargement.\n  But, of course, such theoretical discussions are rapidly being made \nsuperfluous by the lure of NATO membership. Since enlargement became a \nreal possibility Hungary and Romania have formally improved their \nrelationship, as have Hungary and Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine, \nSlovenia and Italy, Poland and Lithuania, Germany and the Czech \nRepublic, Russia and Ukraine, and other European countries that I am \nprobably forgetting.\n  Mr. President, these historic reconciliations did not happen by \naccident. With the notable and sad exception of parts of the former \nYugoslavia, the various peoples of Central and Eastern Europe are no \nlonger wallowing in the swamp of ancient, tribal hatreds. Rather, they \nare attuned to the 21st century and the opportunities that NATO \nenlargement, above all, can offer.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked whether NATO membership will force \nthe new Eastern European democracies to spend too much on arms when \nexpenditures for infrastructure critical to economic growth are more \npressing. Leaving aside the rather patronizing tone of the question, \nthe answer has been clear for months: Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest each \nhas no trouble defining its national interest. Pending verification in \nthis fall's accession negotiations, the Polish, Czech, and Hungarian \nprocurement plans fall well within prudent limits of the free-market \neconomic reforms that all three have been implementing for several \nyears.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked whether membership in the European \nUnion might be a better option for these countries to achieve economic \nstability than NATO membership.\n  Again, Mr. President, I think we must treat the Central and East \nEuropeans like adults. They know what is vital to them.\n  Moreover, why--other than to throw up roadblocks in the NATO \nenlargement process--would one posit an artificial dilemma? It's not an \neither or choice: many of these countries are viable candidates for \nboth NATO and EU enlargement.\n  In fact, earlier this month the European Union invited the first \nthree NATO enlargement candidates--Poland, the Czech Republic, and \nHungary--plus Slovenia, Estonia, and Cyprus to membership talks for the \nnext round of EU enlargement.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked, what have we given up in terms of \nNATO's own freedom of action to deploy forces throughout the expanded \narea of the alliance in order to obtain Russian acquiescence to the \nexpansion plan?\n  Well, Mr. President, the answer is a simple, nothing. We have known \nsince NATO made crystal clear last March as part of its famous three \nno's declaration that the alliance has no reason, intention, or plan in \nthe current and foreseeable security environment permanently to station \nsubstantial combat forces of current members on the territory of new \nmembers. Obviously, if the security environment changes, so too will \nNATO's troop stationing policy. In short, we have retained our freedom \nof action and have given up nothing--zero. I hope that issue has been \nlaid to rest.\n  While everyone by now admits that Russia's leaders have acquiesced to \nNATO enlargement, some of my colleagues have asked the unanswerable \nquestion: But what of tomorrow's Russian leaders? They wonder whether \nNATO enlargement will create an incentive for Moscow to withhold its \nsupport for further strategic arms reductions.\n  First of all, no one can categorically disprove a negative. Some \nRussian leaders are against further strategic arms reductions for a \nvariety of reasons. NATO enlargement may be one of them, although I \nseriously doubt that\n\n[[Page S8491]]\n\nit is one of the more important ones. Ultimately, I believe that the \nnext generation of Russian leaders will see that arms control is in \ntheir own national self-interest.\n  Additionally, we should not forget that through the NATO-Russia \nFounding Act the Russians will have the opportunity not only to observe \nNATO first hand, but will also be able to work cooperatively with it. \nThey may not learn to love NATO, but at least they will see that it \ndoes not correspond to the aggressive, rapacious Stalinist caricature \nthat they grew up with.\n  Many of us in this body are justifiably concerned about the cost to \nthe American taxpayer of NATO enlargement, and I have talked myself \nblue in the face to Europeans making clear my insistence on equitable \nburdensharing. But I would also remind my colleagues that freedom is \nnot cost free. As a deterrerent to aggression, ethnic conflict, or \nother kinds of instability, an enlarged NATO is far less expensive than \nconducting a military operation after hostilities have broken out would \nbe.\n  Here again the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina is instructive. Had we \nbecome directly involved earlier with the lift and strike policy that I \nadvocated as early as 1992, we could have prevented many of the \nquarter-million deaths and 2 million displaced persons in that \ntormented country. Moreover, we would not be saddled with the enormous \nreconstruction costs that the United States and the rest of the world \ncommunity are now bearing.\n  So while we persist in our goal of a North Atlantic alliance of truly \nshared responsibilities, let us not lose sight of the bigger picture \nthat American expenditures on NATO are the best security investment \nthat this country can ever make.\n  Mr. President, I would summarize my thoughts since Madrid in the \nfollowing way: NATO enlargement is on the right track. It is a vital \nforce in the integration of the new Europe. Tough negotiating and \nbargaining lie ahead. Several key questions must be definitively \nanswered in the coming months, above all the actual cost of enlargement \nand how it will be apportioned. We must work out a satisfactory NATO-\nled, post-SFOR force for Bosnia. The Committee on Foreign Relations, \nfor example, will hold an extensive series of hearings on these topics. \nBut let us not confuse the debate by repeating already answered \nquestions.\n  I am convinced that after thorough scrutiny and debate, NATO \nenlargement will occur on schedule and will contribute to expanding and \nenhancing stability in Europe, and thereby will strengthen America's \nsecurity.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8488-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMBASSADOR RICHARD GARDNER'S OUTSTANDING SERVICE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, too often we take for granted the \nexceptional work done by our Ambassadors and members of the foreign \nservice. These individuals perform their duties in countries throughout \nthe world, often in difficult conditions. Their service is a great \ntribute to their ability and their loyalty to our Nation, and they \ndeserve America's enduring gratitude for the job they do so well in \nrepresenting our country in other lands.\n  Earlier this month, one of our most respected ambassadors, Richard \nGardner, completed his service as Ambassador to Spain. Dick has \npreviously served as Ambassador to Italy, and is widely recognized as \none of the Nation's foremost experts on foreign policy. The knowledge, \nenthusiasm, and diligence he brought to his post in Madrid \nsignificantly strengthened the political, economic, and cultural ties \nbetween our Nation and Spain.\n  I commend Ambassador Gardner for his outstanding service.\n  Leaders in Spain have recognized the remarkable contributions made by \nAmbassador Gardner, and I ask unanimous consent that a recent article \nby Miguel Herrero de Minon be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the Article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From ``El Pais'', July 1, 1997]\n\n                         A Fortunate Ambassador\n\n                     (by Miguel Herrero de Minion)\n\n       The U.S. Ambassador, Professor Gardner, and his wife, \n     Danielle, will soon conclude their mission in our country. \n     The time for farewells is the time for praise and the \n     Gardners have made so many friends here, and even established \n     family ties, that they will receive more than enough \n     accolades. That is why I only want to bear witness to a \n     simple, objective fact: Ambassador Gardner has been a \n     fortunate ambassador and good fortune, an excellent attribute \n     for the one who has it and, particularly in the position he \n     holds, requires two ingredients: specific circumstance and \n     the ability to be able to navigate through to a safe port. \n     The former is mere chance; the latter comes through \n     character, good fortune consists of building a destination \n     between the two.\n       The circumstance of Gardner's embassy in Spain is no less \n     than the maturation of the U.S.-Spanish relationship, which \n     led naturally to it becoming a truly ``special'' one. I think \n     I was the first, now a number of years ago, to suggest this \n     term, remarking that of all the countries in the European \n     Union with the exception of the United Kingdom, Spain is \n     potentially the one that has the most interests in common \n     with the United States. Accordingly, the sometimes \n     embarrassing security relationship begun over 40 years ago, \n     has been growing while increasing economic, cultural, \n     strategic and political ties have come to light.\n       Massive student and teacher exchanges contributed to making \n     Spain better known in the U.S. and to doing away with \n     mistrust here; the restoration of democracy in our country \n     opened the way to fuller cooperation, and the Gulf War marked \n     a basic turning point, at least in Spanish public opinion.\n       But Gardner has had the historic opportunity to contribute \n     decisively during these important recent years, to the \n     acceleration and maturation of this trend, by preparing \n     visits at the highest level in both directions, and \n     collaborating in common, bilateral and multilateral \n     undertakings, bringing the two societies closer together with \n     better knowledge of each other. It was during his tenure that \n     President Clinton launched the Transatlantic Agenda in Madrid \n     and, also in Madrid with the Spaniard Solana at the helm, \n     Atlantic Alliance reform took place, not to mention good \n     political collaboration in other areas of mutual interest. It \n     was also when economic and trade relations were intensified \n     between our two countries, and educational and cultural \n     relations between our two societies.\n       Gardner has been not only the representative of one Nation \n     and its Government in another, but also an excellent mediator \n     between two societies. He has come to learn and to teach, \n     opened up possibilities and launched institutions, mobilized \n     initiatives that in many cases are more private than public. \n     His professorial talents--the ability to turn Embassy \n     breakfasts into seminars--and his intellectual talents--he \n     has even enriched our bibliography with a masterpiece of \n     economic-diplomatic history--have served his mission well, as \n     has his liberal patriotism in the best tradition of American \n     internationalism--as opposed to unilateralism and \n     isolationism--which has always held that the implementation \n     of manifest destiny involves making oneself known, understood \n     and making friends.\n       The growing number of Spaniards who believe in the Atlantic \n     community will miss him, because good fortune, doing such a \n     good and timely job, is a rare and beneficent attribute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8491-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DONALD MARTIN\n\n  MR. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a member of \nmy staff who has served me and the Commonwealth of Virginia as a \nlegislative correspondent for the past 2 years.\n  Don Martin will be leaving my office to attend law school this fall. \nHe will be sorely missed by those who have grown to respect him and his \ntremendous talent and hard work.\n  Don is a native of Wytheville, VA, in the southwest portion of our \nState. He joined my staff in the summer of 1995, just weeks after \ngraduating from Yale University, in New Haven, CT. Don is the first \nmember of his family to attend college and the first to graduate from \nhigh school. At Yale, Don was a top student recognized for his \ncontributions as a community leader.\n  While attending George Wythe High School, Don was honored as class \npresident and recognized as the school's outstanding student. Don \nMartin was also Virginia's top high school debate champion in both 1990 \nand 1991.\n  Don's legislative responsibilities have focused on issues related to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works, on which I serve, \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Committee on Commerce, \nScience and Transportation, and the Committee on Government Affairs.\n  Mr. President, in the sincerest sense, Don has a goal to give back to \nhis family and community the same kind of love and commitment they gave \nhim. His goal is to get back home and make a positive difference in his \ncommunity of Wytheville. I respect him and wish him all the best.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8491-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n               THE TRAGIC BOMBING AT MAHANE YEHUDA MARKET\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday in Jerusalem, the Mahane Yehuda \nmarket was ripped apart by two suicide bombs that detonated only \nseconds apart. At least 15 people are dead and another 170 are \nestimated to be injured as a result of this cowardly act. I rise today \nto strongly condemn the bombings, and to extend my deepest sympathies \nto the people of Israel.\n  The images we have seen on the news have been heartbreaking. The \nbombs, packed with nails and screws, turned a busy produce market into \na horrifying scene of bloodshed and destruction. There is simply no \njustification for this indiscriminate killing of innocent people.\n  It has been reported that Issadin Kassam, a military wing of Hamas, \nhas claimed responsibility for the bombing. This would not be the first \ntime Hamas has terrorized the people of Israel and shown itself to be \nthe strongest enemy of peace in the region.\n  Mr. President, this small majority of extremists cannot be allowed to \nblock the peace that so many people desperately desire. Everyone \naffiliated with the peace process must now redouble their efforts to \nstabilize this region that has suffered so long.\n  Unfortunately, the peace process cannot move forward unless the \nPalestinian Authority keeps its promise to cooperate fully with Israeli \nefforts to combat terrorism. I am deeply saddened to report that to \ndate, Palestinian efforts have been inadequate. Only by working \ntogether in good faith can terrorism be vanquished from the Middle \nEast.\n  Once again, I express my sincerest condolences to the Israeli people \nfor their latest sacrifice in the quest for peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8492-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO DR.

Dr. Richard Lesher, president of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, will be retiring in mid-August of this year. \nDr. Lesher has successfully steered the world's largest business \nfederation during this era of global competition.\n  After nearly a quarter of a century with Dr. Lesher at the helm, the \nchamber's membership has grown to over 215,000 business members, 3,000 \nState and local chambers of commerce and over 1,200 trade and \nprofessional associations. In addition to the national membership, the \nU.S. chamber works closely with international members from over 60 \ncountries.\n  Dr. Lesher has worked tirelessly to improve the chamber and to \ncontinually champion the goals of the free enterprise system. In order \nto give his members a stronger voice in Congress, Dr. Lesher has \nestablished the Grassroots Action Information Network, or GAIN. He has \noverseen the creation of the National Chamber Litigation Center in \n1977, the only public policy law firm that represents American business \ninterests before regulatory agencies and the courts.\n  Dr. Lesher has been a constant source of inspiration and dedication \nin Washington, across the Nation, and throughout the world. His \ninnovative ideas, superb leadership and knowledge of issues have made \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce the Nation's leading business advocacy \ngroup. Dr. Lesher, thanks for your unfailing commitment to Americans \nand American business throughout your tenure. I wish you the very best \nin your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8492-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8492-S8493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PETER JENNISON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a very special \nVermonter. Peter Jennison has devoted much of his life to documenting \nour wonderful State.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Peter has authored ``Vermont: An \nExplorer's Guide,'' ``Roadside History of Vermont,'' numerous Vermont \nmagazine articles and reviews, and also ``Vermont on $500 A Day (More \nOr Less)''--and for those of you who are lucky enough to have visited \nVermont you understand the tongue-in-cheek title of the last book.\n  His skill and talent for writing and history earned him the Vermont \nBook Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. As \nsomeone who has enjoyed many of his books and magazine articles, I know \nthat this award is well deserved.\n  Peter is a longtime special friend of mine as is his wife Jane and I \nwanted the Senate to know about them.\n  The Rutland Herald recently ran an excellent piece on Peter Jennison. \nI ask unanimous consent that the article appear immediately following \nmy statement.\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, July 10, 1997]\n\n    A ``Born Again Vermonter'' Reflects on A Life Spent Among Books\n\n                         (By Melissa MacKenzie)\n\n       At 75 nothing shocks Peter S. Jennison except the prices of \n     books and hotels.\n       ``I can remember when a suite at the Plaza cost $10 a \n     day,'' he said with a chuckle on the morning of his big \n     birthday, July 2 was celebrated quietly, followed by a family \n     gathering at the weekend. Jane Jennison, his wife of 51 \n     years, was cheerful but bedridden with emphysema, knee \n     surgery and two hip replacements. Otherwise life appeared to \n     be going tolerably well in the 1840 brick cottage on the hill \n     above the Taftsville General Store.\n       Jennison, a ``born again'' Vermonter, who grew up in \n     Swanton and then lived many years in New York only to return \n     home again, is probably best known to the average reader as \n     one of the authors of ``Vermont: An Explorer's Guide'' and \n     the popular ``Roadside History of Vermont.''\n       Others may recognize him as the dry, accurate and often \n     humorous reviewer of restaurants and inns for Vermont \n     Magazine. Or you may have seen his books in libraries, \n     including two novels set in Vermont, ``The Governor,'' \n     written in 1964, and ``The Mimosa Smokers,'' and a semi-\n     serious guidebook called ``Vermont on $500 A Day (More or \n     Less).'' Two of his other books, ``History of Woodstock, \n     1890-1983,'' and ``Frederick Billings,'' written with Jane \n     Curtis and Frank Lieberman, reflect his historian side and \n     his lifelong interest in Vermont history.\n       An affable observant man known for his quiet wit, Jennison \n     and his wife, Jane, founded Countryman Press, (now a part of \n     the giant W.W. Norton Publishing Company), in Woodstock in \n     1973. Or re-founded, you might say. The Jennisons revived the \n     imprint, dormant since the 1930s, which had in the past \n     published such greats as Stephen Vincent Benet and Edgar Lee \n     Masters, and launched their own version, including a new, \n     colophon designed by Vermont artist Sabra Field.\n       Success came quickly, although it was hard work. Peter and \n     Jane worked from their kitchen table to produce Countryman's \n     first book, a guidebook called ``Wonderful Woodstock.'' and \n     only three years later published its first bestseller, \n     ``Backyard Livestock,'' by Steven Thomas, a book that is \n     still selling well today. By this time several veteran \n     editors and marketing people had joined the little \n     enterprise, among them, the late Keith Jennison, Peter's \n     brother, author of the humorous ``Yup * * * Nope and Other \n     Vermont Dialogues'', and three men who would eventually run \n     the company, Louis Kannenstine, Christopher Lloyd and Carl \n     Taylor.\n       The idea was to pay careful attention to the selection of \n     books, be willing to take a chance on a writer; and to take \n     pride in the way their books were designed. Said Jennison at \n     the time, ``Working this way is * * * a much more personal \n     kind of publishing that is possible elsewhere in the \n     conglomerate scene.'' It was a philosophy which saw little \n     Countryman become a David among the Goliaths.\n       ``Countryman was like a woodstove. You had to keep adding \n     logs. Bit by bit we grew beyond our expectations. We didn't \n     have a master plan, it just happened. The more books, the \n     more momentum,'' Jennison said.\n       The company operated from the Jennisons' home for the first \n     four years. Editing, billing and shipping continued to get \n     done at the kitchen table. Books were ferried to bookstores \n     in the back of a Toyota pickup truck. Next, Countryman moved \n     down the hill near the Taftsville General Store, where it \n     stayed until 1981 when it relocated to Woodstock and \n     constructed its own building on Route 4. Countryman Press \n     operated there until 1994. After the sale to W.W. Norton, the \n     staff relocated to Mt. Tom. The building is presently for \n     sale for $495,000.\n       Selling to a big New York City publisher was ``an emotional \n     wrench, like selling the family farm, but I realized we had, \n     so to speak, survived the childhood and the adolescence of \n     the company, and now we had grown up and got married,'' said \n     Jennison philosophically.\n       ``For a small publisher it was getting more and more \n     complicated and expensive to do business. The big wholesalers \n     and the chains are now dictating the rules of the game,'' he \n     added.\n       ``Publishing has gotten to be part of the entertainment \n     industry. More people are buying more books, but because of \n     the star system that dominates the industry, a lot of new \n     writers are being deprived of an audience. There are still a \n     lot of smaller presses, but they don't have access to the \n     major markets,'' Jennison said.\n\n[[Page S8493]]\n\n       Another factor is the reliance of the big players on \n     computers and the industry's fixation on the bottom line.\n       ``Unfortunately the buyers at Barnes and Noble and at \n     Ingram (the largest book distribution company in the U.S.) \n     are ruled by their computer records; how well an author sold \n     before, what type of book sold before, etc. I call it the \n     Bill Gates-is-God mentality,'' he said.\n       Jennison, however, remains hopeful, ``I am optimistic \n     enough to think there will always be a large number of people \n     who would rather curl up with a book than a computer game. \n     The format of the book will be with us for a long time. It'll \n     go on,'' he said.\n       In 1996 the Vermont Book Publishers Association awarded \n     Jennison a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions \n     to publishing.\n       A sixth-generation Vermonter, born on a dairy farm in \n     Swanton, north of St. Albans, Jennison attended a one room \n     school until his parents packed him off to Philips Academy, \n     Andover. Next came Middlebury College, interrupted in his \n     junior year by World War II. Jennison served three years with \n     the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, \n     as a code and ciphers specialist, decoding messages from U.S. \n     agents behind the lines in Germany, France and Norway, \n     Returning to Middlebury, he graduated with a degree in \n     American literature, married Jane, and began what was to \n     become a lifetime spent with books.\n       Jennison worked first for ``Publishers Weekly'' as a \n     reviews editor and feature writer, and then went on to become \n     Assistant Director of the American Book Publishers Council. \n     In the 1960s, he served on the National Book Committee, a \n     non-profit citizens group promoting books and libraries, \n     similar to the Vermont Center for the Book, but on a national \n     scale. Under the auspices of the Ford Foundation he also \n     worked with fledgling publishing companies in Africa, the \n     Middle East and Asia, as well as serving on the panel for the \n     National Book Awards.\n       ``The Natinal Book Awards weren't as high profile in the \n     sixties. We got a lot of local publicity, though, outside of \n     New York. Now, it's more like the Academy Awards,'' said \n     Jennison.\n       The Jennisons returned to Vermont in 1971. I'd had enough \n     of New York and I was tired of being held hostage by the New \n     Haven Railroad,'' recalled Jennison, referring to his years \n     as a commuter from suburban Westport, Conn.\n       Christina Tree, co-author of ``Vermont: An Explorer's \n     Guide,'' remembers the story a little differently. ``The way \n     I heard it, Peter came home one night after a hard day in the \n     city, wound up like a clock, and accidentally walked straight \n     off the patio into the family swimming pool, seersucker suit, \n     briefcase and all. He got out, sputtering, and yelled, ``That \n     does it. Jane, we're going back to Vermont.''\n       Although he is now officially retired, Jennison continues \n     to write for ``Vermont Magazine'' and will work again with \n     Tree on the next edition of ``Vermont: An Explorer's Guide.''\n       Countryman Press's ``The Explorer's Guide series'' started \n     in 1979. The first book was about Massachusetts, the home \n     state of Tree, a young travel writer at the Boston Globe. \n     Said Tree from her home in Cambridge, ``Peter hired me to \n     write the series. I wrote one on Massachusetts and one on \n     Maine. But the year I was to begin the one on Vermont, I had \n     some family difficulties, and Peter so-authored to help me \n     out.''\n       The partnership was such a success the two have continued \n     co-writing the book ever since.\n       ``We divided up the state,'' said Jennison. ``Now, when \n     it's time for a new edition, we switch sections and re-visit \n     old places and add new ones.''\n       The guidebook is published every two years and has garnered \n     much praise for its accuracy and attention to historical \n     detail. The most recent edition came out in May, which means \n     that come the summer of 1998, Jennison and Tree will again \n     switch their sections and start trekking for the 1999 \n     edition. Working off the previous edition on their computers, \n     the pair will meticulously re-check each entry, changing \n     phone numbers and prices where necessary adding names or \n     dropping them.\n       Said Christina Tree, ``The depth of Peter's knowledge of \n     Vermont is huge. He's seen tremendous changes in the state, \n     and he's got an interesting perspective, returning to Vermont \n     at the time he did, after being away for so long. He \n     personifies a certain kind of aristocratic Vermonter, who's \n     very sophisticated and also very active and involved. He's \n     low-key and witty and generous. And of course he's a fabulous \n     writer. Somebody ought to do an oral biography of him.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8492-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8493-S8498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFERENCE AGREEMENTS ON H.R. 2015 AND H.R. 2014, THE BALANCED BUDGET \n                        AND TAXPAYER RELIEF ACTS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate our leader, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Roth, our colleagues in the House, our colleagues in \nthe other party, and all those who worked so diligently to hammer out \nthe details of these agreements. I admit that I was somewhat skeptical \nthat the Congress and the Clinton administration could come to an \nagreement on these two very important bills. While I have some concerns \nabout certain aspects of these measures, I am pleased to be able to \nsupport the legislation.\n  These two bills will put our Nation back on the road to Federal \nresponsibility. The Balanced Budget Act will reduce Federal spending by \n$270 billion over the next 5 years, eliminating our annual deficits and \nresulting in a balanced budget by the year 2002. At the same time, we \nare providing $96 billion in much-needed tax relief over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, our Founding Fathers recognized the basic principle \nthat the Federal Government must not spend beyond its means. Thomas \nJefferson said, ``We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle \nposterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.'' \nUnfortunately, we have strayed far from Mr. Jefferson's wise advice.\n  Today, our Nation is burdened with a national debt in excess of $5.3 \ntrillion--or about $20,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. \nOur debt is still growing by about $4,500 per second--about the same \namount it would cost to send three people to a community college.\n  Although Congress has talked endlessly about balancing the budget, \nthe budget has not been balanced since 1969. We--the Congress and the \nPresident--have ignored our responsibility to put our fiscal house in \norder, choosing instead to leave future generations of Americans with \nan overwhelming legacy of debt.\n  Because Federal spending has been out of control, the American people \nhave been saddled with an unconscionable tax burden. In 1960, Americans \npaid approximately one dollar in taxes for every $50 they earned. \nToday, one out of every three dollars goes to the tax man. These \nconfiscatory tax policies are blatantly unfair to those who work hard \nto provide for their families.\n  The Balanced Budget Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid spending \nwithout reducing benefits, provides $24 billion for children's health \ninitiatives, and mandates savings in other Federal programs. It also \nprovides for effective enforcement of the discretionary spending \nlimitations necessary to balance the budget by 2002.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act will ease the unconscionable burden on \nAmerican taxpayers by reducing estate and capital gains taxes, \nproviding a $500 tax credit for children, and providing more \nflexibility in Individual Retirement Accounts. Small businesses will \ngain tax relief by restoring the deductibility of home office expenses \nand self-employed health insurance costs. These and other provisions \nwill allow Americans to keep more of the their hard-earned dollars, \nrather than turning them over to pay for a bloated Federal bureaucracy.\n  The American people have waited a long time for deficit reduction and \ntax relief. With this legislation, we are showing the American people \nthat we take our duties seriously, and I am pleased to support these \nbills.\n  Mr. President, there are several matters contained in these bills \nthat I would like to discuss at greater length, some good and some not \nso good.\n\n\n                           amtrak tax credit\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to remark on the conference agreement provision \ngiving $4.3 billion to Amtrak under the guise of so-called ``tax \nrelief.'' Given that Amtrak is exempt from most Federal tax burdens, \nthis scheme represents the greatest train robbery since the James \nBrothers retired.\n  How we can give a corporate tax refund to a quasi-governmental \ncorporation that has NEVER paid Federal corporate income taxes defies \nimagination. It's too bad the American taxpayers aren't so favorably \ntreated. I think every taxpayer would like the chance to receive a tax \nrefund they aren't legally owed. Of all the charades I have seen over \nthe years, this Amtrak ``special'' tax provision takes the cake.\n  I want the public to be aware, this bill contains $2.3 billion for \nAmtrak to be doled out over two years not subject to appropriation or \ncongressional oversight. This is the same outfit that has drained $20 \nbillion from the Federal Treasury to serve a small percentage of \ncommuters in the northeast.\n  This windfall would be accomplished through a far fetched tax scheme \nthat\n\n[[Page S8494]]\n\nwill give Amtrak tax credits for the operating losses incurred by \nfreight railroads. The provision instructs the Internal Revenue Service \nto sift back through the tax returns of the freight railroads and \ndetermine the losses they incurred from their passenger service from \n1917 to 1971, before Amtrak ever existed. Those losses, which no one \ncan quantify today, will then be provided to Amtrak in the form of $2.3 \nbillion in tax credits.\n  Mr. President, give me a break. Are we supposed to be fooled by this? \nIf we're going to permit a giveaway to Amtrak let's just be straight \nwith the American people. Let's not insult them with this bogus \ncharade. It's a mockery of our tax policy and an insult to the public.\n  Why didn't the conferees simply give $2.3 billion to Amtrak, without \nall the machinations? Because proponents of this provision know that if \nfunding were subject to appropriations, which is the normal process, \nCongress wouldn't fund it because its simply not our top transportation \npriority. So, we're supposed to buy this ludicrous notion that Amtrak \nis owed a tax refund on taxes they never paid. To think that anyone is \nsupposed to buy such a fairy tale strains the imagination, and adds to \nthe cynicism about how Congress operates.\n  Let me take a moment to recap how we got to this novel provision. As \nmy colleagues remember, the Senate-passed tax reconciliation bill \nincluded an Amtrak funding provision touted by its sponsors as a half \npenny for Amtrak. But the truth is that new money--some $2.3 billion in \nnew Federal subsidies--came at the expense of the tax cut promised to \nthe American people as part of the balanced budget agreement negotiated \nby the Administration and the Congress.\n  During the Senate floor debate, I strongly objected to that \nprovision. I also urged the conferees to reconsider the fiscal \nramifications of funneling such money to a system already losing more \nthan $700 million annually and serving less than 1 percent of the \ntraveling public. Unfortunately, the merits for sound Federal policies \ntoo often lose out to political will. That was the case during the \noriginal Senate debate and it is still the case today.\n  Again, the conference agreement which we are considering today \nprovides for a new and even more generous funding proposal for Amtrak--\none not previously considered by either the House or Senate. This \nproposal effectively provides more than $1 billion annually to Amtrak \nduring the next two years rather than the approximately $700 million \nannual subsidy over three years. This new pot of gold for the \nbottomless pit known as Amtrak will not, let me repeat, will not, be \nsubject to appropriations nor to Congressional oversight. Under the new \nproposal, the U.S. Treasury will be in charge.\n  One has to question just how far Congress is willing to go in its \nquest to find funny-money for Amtrak. Today, Congress is telling the \nAmerican public that they should believe there is some sort of \njustification for deeming Amtrak to have had operating losses prior to \nits existence. The American public is to believe Amtrak is entitled to \na tax credit for losses dating all the way back to 1917, even though it \nwasn't created until 1971.\n  What precedent does that set for our Federal tax policy? What type of \nsignal does this send to private corporations and citizens on how the \nwhimsy of Congress can retroactively recreate their tax histories? This \nproposed scheme is indefensible to the American public and sets an ill-\nadvised precedent.\n\n  Mr. President, while I adamantly object to the tax credit scheme for \nAmtrak, I do what to note that at least one shred of responsibility \nremains in the bill with respect to Amtrak. It's small consolidation \nbut the bill does link the disbursement of this unprecedented gift to \nthe enactment of comprehensive Amtrak reform legislation.\n  I would like to recognize Senator Hutchison for her leadership and \ntireless work to try to move true Amtrak reform legislation through \nthis Congress. While reform legislation was not included in this bill, \nI am confident Senator Hutchison will continue her endeavors to bring \nlegislation passed by the Commerce Committee to the full Senate. And \nfinally, I would like to thank the Majority Leader for the many hours \nhe devoted to resolving this and all the other provisions in this tax \nlegislation.\n  Before final passage of this bill, I look forward to entering into a \ncolloquy with the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee regarding the linkage of Amtrak's access to this new windfall \nto the passage of a comprehensive reform bill. We will, in that \ncolloquy, clarify that when we say a reform bill, that does not mean a \ncouple of lines tucked into an appropriations bill or a rider making \nsome cosmetic change to Amtrak. It means comprehensive, substantive \nmeaningful, reform to ensure that Amtrak operates more efficiently and \nto set up a process that will protect taxpayers if Amtrak does not meet \nits financial goals.\n  I say to my colleagues and to the public, watch very carefully. \nMeaning no disrespect to any member of this body, the same minds that \ndevise schemes like ``tax credits'' for Amtrak will employ their \ncreative powers to hatch clever ways of ``reforming'' Amtrak in order \nto release the money without Congress ever suspecting that's what we \ndid.\n  I hope that's not the next chapter in this charade. But, sadly, it \nwouldn't surprise me and I respectfully urge my colleagues--stay tuned.\n\n\n                   communications and spectrum issues\n\n  Mr. President, as one of the principal architects of Title III of the \nBalanced Budget Act, dealing with communications and spectrum \nallocations, I would like to briefly summarize its major provisions and \ngive you my perspectives on several of them. I spoke briefly on this \nissue yesterday, but I wanted to make very clear my views on these \nimportant issues.\n  This title is scored to achieve a total of $23.4 billion in budgetary \nsavings by the year 2003. Of this amount, all but $3 billion would be \nbrought in by spectrum auctions.\n  This spectrum to be auctioned will be derived from several different \nsources. Some of it consists of analog broadcast TV channels that will \nbe reclaimed from TV broadcasters as they move to their new digital TV \nchannels. Ten channels of this TV spectrum located between Channels 60 \nand 69 will be cleared of current users and reallocated for different \nuses ion an expedited basis. Of these ten channels, four--a total of 24 \nmegahertz of spectrum--will be reallocated for use by the nation's \npolice, fire, and emergency medical personnel and essential public \nsafety communications.\n  As demonstrated at a Commerce Committee hearing earlier this year, \npublic safety users have endured severe spectrum shortages over the \ncourse of the last decade. This spectrum shortage has hindered them \nfrom using advanced video and data transmission technologies, but it \nhas had an even more devastating impact on their ability to communicate \nacceptably using current technology. As demonstrated in the recent \ntragedies in Oklahoma City and the World Trade Tower, public safety \nofficials found they could not rely on their radio communications to \nreach individuals working at different places at the disaster scene.\n  Reallocating this 24 megahertz to public safety will take a big step \nforward in remedying what has truly become a national disgrace. I am \nprofoundly glad that in this budget agreement today we have \nacknowledged the debt we owe those whose job it is to protect our lives \nand property by giving them a resource that is badly needed and too \nlong denied.\n  The remaining 36 megahertz of spectrum in this band will be \nreallocated to other commercial uses and made available by auction. \nClearing the band of incumbent low-power users to accelerate its \navailability for auction and to maximize its auction value will be \nfurthered by a complementary provision of the bill that will allow the \nmajor incumbent low-power television licensees moved from this band to \nbe accommodated in available spectrum below Channel 60. The bill also \npreserves the value of the spectrum below Channel 60, however, by \nstipulating that any such accommodation of qualifying low-power \nstations shall only be made if otherwise consistent with the FCC's \ndigital table of allotments for those channels. This is a key provision \nin that it assures that we do not accommodate low-power stations, which \nare and will remain a secondary broadcast service, at the expense of \npossibly\n\n[[Page S8495]]\n\ndisrupting the planned transition to digital television that will free \nup the broadcasters' analog broadcast channels for auction in the \nfuture.\n  The bill provides that the remaining analog TV channels below Channel \n60 will be auctioned in the year 2002, notwithstanding the fact that \nthey will not be turned back and available for use until December 31, \n2006 at the earliest. I say ``at the earliest,'' Mr. President, because \nit is important to note that the bill contains several specified \ncircumstances under which the FCC may extend this date for stations in \nindividual television markets. Generally stated, the FCC may extend the \ndate under any of these circumstances: first, if one of the market \nstations affiliated with one of the four largest national television \nnetworks is not broadcasting a digital signal, and that failure is not \nfor lack of due diligences; second, that digital-to-analog converter \ntechnology isn't generally available in the market; or third, if more \nthan 15 percent of the television households in the market do not \nsubscribe to a multichannel digital program service that carries the \nlocal signals, do not have a digital television receiver, and do not \nhave at least one analog TV receiver equipped with a digital-to-analog \nconverter.\n  Mr. President, this waiver standard is a compromise between the \noriginal provision in the House bill, which was so liberal it \npotentially would have caused the analog broadcast channels to never \nhave had to have been returned for auction, and the Senate version, \nwhich was more rigorous in that it would have required the return of \nanalog channels given the general availability to consumers of other \nmeans of receiving digital signals.\n  I would clearly prefer the more rigorous test. In saying this, I am \nnot giving short shrift to the interests of TV viewers in my desire to \nhave some reasonable assurance that the government may reclaim this \nextraordinarily valuable analog TV spectrum by a specified date and \nauction it to help defray the deficit. Rather, I agree with \norganizations like Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, \nPublic Citizen and the National Taxpayers Union, all of whom favor a \nhard-and-fast analog channel turnback date of 2006 and all of whom say \nthat the consumer electronics industry is being perfectly realistic in \nits projections that digital-to-analog converter technology will, in \nfact, be generally available by the year 2006 at a cost comparable to, \nor less than, the cost of the cheapest black-and-white TV sets today.\n  So, Mr. President, when it comes to the bill's provisions on the \nanalog channel turnback date, I fear we have inadvisedly undercut the \nvalue this spectrum might otherwise bring at auction by including a \nwaiver standard in this bill that unnecessarily signals to bidders in \n2002 that the spectrum they're bidding on may not become available on \nany definitive date.\n  The only way to remedy this problem, Mr. President, is to expand the \npool of bidders who, notwithstanding this uncertainty, have a \nparticular incentive, plus substantial financial resources, to bid on \nthis spectrum anyway. The bill does this in an innovative but careful \nfashion by waiving otherwise-applicable FCC ownership restrictions to \nallow television licensees and newspaper owners in cities having a \npopulation of over 400,000 to bid on this spectrum and use it for \nwhatever use the FCC finds it to be suitable, including television.\n  The infusion of capital these multibillion-dollar mass media players \nwill bring to the analog auctions in these markets will be substantial. \nAnd yet, Mr. President, our bedrock concern over assuring a diversity \nof mass media viewpoints will not be compromised in any significant \nway.\n  I say this because this waiver is limited in scope, applying only to \nstations and newspapers in our 33 largest cities. In the smallest of \nthese large cities--which happens to be Tucson, by the way--there are \nover forty broadcast stations. The largest city in terms of number of \nbroadcast outlets, Los Angeles, has 72 radio and TV stations. In \nthinking about diversity in today's world, we also need to remember the \nrole cable television and the Internet now play in giving people \ninstant access to a variety of sources of news and information \nunimaginable when the FCC first developed these ownership restrictions \ndecades ago.\n  So, Mr. President, this provision will re-infuse into the analog \nauctions capital we may have otherwise drained by our provisions for \nwaiving the analog turnback date, and it will do this only in those \nplaces where the positive effect on auction values can be expected to \nbe greatest while, at the same time, the tremendous diversity of \ninformation sources available today assures that consumers will suffer \nno meaningful loss of viewpoints as a result.\n  One final category of new broadcast spectrum auctions should be \nmentioned. This bill would revoke the FCC's authority to use lotteries \nto select the licensees of new commercial radio and television stations \nwhere there is more than one mutually-exclusive applicant, and instead \nprovides for the use of auctions.\n  This measure, Mr. President, is not designed to raise revenues, \nalthough it will unquestionably do so; but rather to provide a \nstraightforward and sensible alternative to the FCC's old, time-\nconsuming comparative hearing process. In addition to the length of \ntime this process took to ultimately determine which party would get \nthe license--oftentimes years--the application of the convoluted system \nof comparative criteria often selected winners based on essentially \nmeaningless differences between the applicants. Not surprisingly, this \napproach was essentially struck down by the court several years ago. \nAuctions will provide an efficient way to dispose of the many hundreds \nof cases that have stacked up undecided since the court's decision, and \nprovide a similarly efficient way of selecting licensees in the future. \nThose applicants who have applications pending before the Commission \nwill be given a special period of 180 days in which to settle their \napplications and avoid auctions. In view of the different circumstances \npertaining where multiple applicants for noncommercial educational \nstations are involved, the FCC may use lotteries to select licensees \nfor such stations.\n  So much for analog television spectrum, Mr. President. In addition to \nall this spectrum, the bill also provides for the accelerated auction \nduring the out-years of 45 megahertz of spectrum previously identified \nfor this purpose by NTIA and the FCC. The bill further tasks NTIA and \nFCC to cause 75 more megahertz of spectrum, 55 of which is specifically \nidentified in the bill, to be reallocated from its current shared or \nexclusive government use and made available for auction. Concerns over \nthe possible inability to find suitable substitute spectrum for \nincumbent users are mitigated, and the auction revenues preserved, by \nfurther provisions enabling the President to nominate spectrum for \nreallocation other than the bands specified in the bill if these \nsubstitute bands can be shown to bring comparable auction revenue. \nFurther enhancing the likely value of this reallocated government \nspectrum at auction are complementary provisions authorizing private \nsuers to reimburse incumbent federal government licensees in these \nbands for the cost of moving to their new spectrum bands on an \nexpedited basis.\n  In addition, the bill contains several provisions designed to enhance \nthe revenues spectrum auctions will bring in by improving the auction \nprocess itself. Specifically, the bill would require the FCC to test \ncontingent combinatorial auction bidding, a system which many believe \nhelps bidders optimize their bidding strategy and thereby increases \nauction proceeds. It also requires the FCC to allow sufficient time \nprior to an auction to develop and promulgate auction rules that \npotential bidders can have an opportunity to factor into their bidding \nand business strategies. It also requires the FCC to establish reserve \nprices and minimum bids. Finally, it eliminates the entrepreneurial \nuncertainty, and consequent lessened auction revenues, that is caused \nwhen spectrum is allocated for any and all unspecified uses. It does \nthis by stating certain, limiting conditions and procedures under which \nthe FCC will be permitted to allocated spectrum for flexible use in the \nfuture. Collectively these provisions should result in increased \nrevenue from spectrum auctions.\n  This brings me, Mr. President, to one final provision of the bill \nintended to bring in an additional $3 billion: namely, the stratagem \nwhereby $3 billion is\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\nshifted between the Treasury and the universal service fund in such a \nway that it appears that $3 billion in new revenue will be deposited in \nthe Treasury in fiscal year 2002. This provision, which has been \nfoisted on us by the Administration and its Office of Management and \nBudget, is nothing more than a contrivance designed to make it appear \nthat a $3 billion budget deficit has been plugged, when all that will \nreally happen is that the fund will pay back to the Treasury precisely \nthe amount that the Treasury will first have given the fund. It's a \ndisingenuous and dangerous policy to pursue, and one I intend to \nexamine critically in Commerce Committee hearings in September.\n  In the meantime, the important thing to stress is that the telephone \nindustry universal service fund will not lose a dime. And because \ntelephone companies' payments into the fund are rescheduled, the amount \nof money they ultimately pay in will not be affected, and this should \nassure that telephone bills won't go up either, at least for this \nreason.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, let's be plain: a scam is a scam is a \nscam, and we should not condone scams, even those that don't appear to \nactually hurt anything. But I suggest that the better remedy is to pass \nlegislation that will not only address this particular scam, but also \nmake sure that others like it won't be foisted on us again. The \nCommerce Committee will address this in September, to guarantee the \nintegrity of the universal service fund and the continuity of the \nessential telecommunications services subsidized it.\n  This brings me to more fundamental concerns I have with the bill--\nconcerns I have stated before, but concerns that must be stated once \nmore. I have not believed, and I remain unconvinced, that the spectrum \nauctions provided for in the bill will generate anywhere near the $21.4 \nbillion that CBO estimates they will. I believe this is too much \nspectrum to put on the market in too compressed a timeframe. 75 percent \nof the revenues estimated to be generated is to come from auctions held \nin the out-years of 2002 and 2003. Even under the best of \ncircumstances, it is counterintuitive to think that flooding the market \nwith spectrum in those years will not substantially depress its value.\n  And these aren't even the best of circumstances, Mr. President. I \nhave already alluded to the devaluation that will inevitably result \nfrom bidding on spectrum that is variously unavailable for a number of \nyears after the auction or encumbered with existing users who must be \nrelocated. But the bottom line is, the scoring process and the demand \nto bring the revenues in within the five-year budget balancing window \nhave made better approaches impossible.\n  None of this should be interpreted as an indirect way of saying that \nspectrum auctions are a failure. But I have advocated them as an \nefficient way of assigning spectrum licenses that allows the public, to \nwhom the spectrum belongs, to realize the benefit of its market value. \nBut it cannot be forgotten that spectrum auctions are not, and never \nwere, intended to be a kind of ATM for Congress to run to every time it \nneeds a certain amount of money. Like any auction, spectrum auctions \nare subject to unpredictable vagaries that cannot be forecast, much \nless satisfactorily defended against. For this reason, like any \nauction, spectrum auctions cannot be relied upon to produce any given \namount of money. But despite this fact, Mr. President, that's exactly \nwhat you're banking on--and I do mean ``banking on'' in its literal \nsense--when you rely on spectrum auctions to wipe out a substantial \nchunk of the budget deficit by 2003.\n  Let me just say that I do not think it likely that spectrum auctions \nwill realize the $21.4 billion in revenue that has been estimated. \nNevertheless, the bill we vote on today will at least set us on the \nroad to achieving a balanced budget. For this reason, and despite my \nmisgivings about the credibility of achieving the amount of budget \nsavings we hope to achieve from this part of the package, I support the \nlegislation.\n\n\n                         medicare improvements\n\n  The Balanced Budget Act contains important changes to the Medicare \nsystem which will strengthen the program and protect it for current and \nfuture beneficiaries. The bill preserves and protects the Medicare \nprogram, while increasing choice within the program and expanding \nbenefits for beneficiaries. The Medicare Choice program created in this \nbill will allow seniors to select from a wide variety of options, \nincluding HMOs, PPOs, PSOs, and Private Fee-for-Service programs. In \naddition, the bill creates a Medical Savings Account demonstration \nprogram which will allow 390,000 beneficiaries to select a high-\ndeductible Medicare Choice plan.\n  Key provisions of the bill will help eliminate waste and fraud in the \nMedicare system which could result in significant savings. Significant \nportions of the ``Medicare Whistleblower'' legislation which I \nintroduced earlier this year are incorporated into the fraud prevention \nsection of this bill. Seniors will now have the ability to request \ncopies of their Medicare billing statements. In addition, seniors will \nbe able to easily report suspected fraud and abuse in the system.\n  Overall, the Medicare reforms in this plan will produce $115 billion \nin savings over the next five years, which protects the program for \ntoday's senior citizens and ensures Medicare will be available for \nfuture beneficiaries. In addition, the bill establishes a commission to \nstudy the Medicare system, with a mandate to make recommendations by \nMarch of 1999 on comprehensive reform of the program. I firmly believe \nthat our priority must remain protecting the Medicare system from \nbankruptcy by the year 2001, and I believe that this bill is an \nimportant first step in working toward that goal.\n\n\n                         children's health care\n\n  The Balanced Budget Act provides $24 billion to improve access to \nhealth insurance for uninsured children in our country and put \naffordable health care insurance within the reach of every family. This \nnew federal funding will allow states to expand Medicaid coverage or \ncreate innovative new programs which will address the specific health \ncare needs of low-income children.\n  Providing access to health care for uninsured children has been a \npriority for me since coming to the Senate. During the 103rd Congress, \nI offered legislation to address this problem, and I am pleased that we \nare able now to implement this new program for our nation's children.\n\n\n                             welfare reform\n\n  Last year, Congress made significant progress in reforming our \nwelfare system when we passed the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act. This much-needed legislation is \ndramatically improving our nation's welfare system and reducing the \ncosts of the system, by requiring able-bodied welfare recipients to \nwork and encouraging individuals to become self-sufficient.\n  However, the welfare reform law denied certain forms of public \nassistance to legal immigrants who were residing in this country prior \nto enactment of the legislation. At the time, I had concerns about the \npotentially disastrous impact this law would have on children, the \ndisabled, and elderly legal immigrants who would lose vital support \nservices such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). I am \npleased that this bill restores SSI eligibility for certain legal \nimmigrants and refugees. In addition, children who are legal immigrants \nwill be eligible for health insurance coverage as a part of the new, \nexpanded health insurance coverage contained in this package. These \nprovisions will provide necessary safeguards for these vulnerable \npopulations as we continue implementing the new welfare law.\n\n\n                           medicaid programs\n\n  Five states, including Arizona, operate managed care Medicaid \nprograms, through a Section 1115 waiver. Each of these states have \nexpanded coverage to children and vulnerable uninsured people beyond \nthe traditional Medicaid categories. They have been able to provide \nthese expanded services by using their disproportionate share hospital \n(DSH) funds.\n  I worked with my colleagues from the five affected states to protect \nthe option to provide this expanded coverage. The Balanced Budget Act \nclarifies that states which use their DSH payments for Section 1115 \nhealth care expansions would not be penalized by\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\nthe limitations being placed on DSH payments as a part of Medicaid \nreform in this bill. Our states will be able to continue providing \ninnovative and cost effective health care coverage to otherwise \nuninsured populations.\n  I am concerned, however, that the Medicaid reforms in this bill do \nnot include several important provisions.\n  The conferees eliminated an important provision contained in the \nSenate bill which would provide incentives for states to devise \ninnovative ways to meet expanding demand for access to Medicaid-funded \nhealth care coverage. This provision would have authorized the \ncontinuation of a state's successful Section 1115 waiver program and \nallow the states to expand coverage using state resources. This \nprovision would have lowered both state and federal costs of these \nprograms, and allowed states to expand coverage to their most \nvulnerable populations. I am very disappointed that the conferees did \nnot include it in the conference agreement.\n\n\n                             school choice\n\n  After the negotiations on the Balanced Budget Act were completed, \nPresident Clinton made a last-minute threat to veto the bill because it \ncontained an innovative and important educational provision that he \nclaimed would ``undermine public education''. This provision would have \ngiven parents the freedom to choose a school for their children based \non their unique educational needs. Parents would have been able to \nwithdraw funds from education savings accounts to pay tuition at the \nschool of their choice--public, private or sectarian. I find it greatly \ndisconcerting that President Clinton used the threat of a veto to force \nCongress to eliminate a provision which would have granted equal \neducational opportunity to all students.\n\n\n               medicare subvention for military retirees\n\n  I am pleased that the conferees retained the Senate provision to \nauthorize a pilot program to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of \nallowing Medicare reimbursement to military medical facilities that \ntreat Medicare-eligible military retirees. This provision will \nsignificantly decrease costs to both the federal government and \nmilitary retirees.\n  The provision authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to establish a demonstration project \nwherein the Secretary of HHS would reimburse the Secretary of Defense \nfrom the medicare trust funds for health care services furnished to \nmedicare-eligible military retirees or dependents. The three-year \nproject, beginning on January 1, 1998, is limited to six sites within \nthe military TRICARE regions. The TRICARE enrollment fee would be \nwaived for persons enrolled in the managed care option of TRICARE and \nthe minimum benefits would include at least the Medicare benefits. The \ndemonstration project is expected to cost $55 million in 1998, $65 \nmillion in 1999, and $75 million in 2000.\n  There are currently 1.3 million military retirees age 65 and older, \nabout 97% of whom are eligible for Medicare. About 230,000 currently \nuse military treatment facilities on a regular basis when space is \navailable, at a cost of $1.2 million per year.\n  The cost of providing health care to military retirees through \ncivilian Medicare providers has been estimated to be significantly \nhigher than the care that is provided at a military treatment facility. \nIn fact, the Department of Defense (DOD) found that the cost of care at \na military treatment facility is 10-24 percent less than that at a \ncivilian facility. DOD has testified to the Congress that they would be \nable to enroll and treat more Medicare-eligible beneficiaries at a \nlower cost to the government.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate provision to provide this critical \nmedical benefit to our nation's veterans was not included in the \nconference agreement. I hope that this pilot program for military \nretirees will provide the impetus for legislation to extend the program \nto veterans.\n\n\n                          pork-barrel spending\n\n  I am sorry to say that the Balanced Budget Act does contain some \nearmarks and special interest provisions, although I am happy to report \nthat there are very few in this bill.\n  It is unconscionable that the Congress would have the audacity to \nprotect special interests in this bill, when the money wasted could \nhave been used to provide additional tax relief for working Americans, \nhigher funding for children's health care, improved education programs, \nor just to reduce the deficit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of special interest items be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n\n                          debt limit increase\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I note with some dismay that the Balanced \nBudget Act increases the limit on the amount of debt the federal \ngovernment can incur to $5.95 trillion. I just want to point out to my \ncolleagues the irony of increasing the debt limit in a balanced budget \nact. Even as we pass this legislation to reduce federal spending by \n$270 billion over the next five years, we are forced to acknowledge \nthat annual deficits will continue to add to our enormous national debt \nfor several more years.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that these two bills will provide the deficit \nreduction and tax relief promised to the American people. Certainly, it \nhas not been possible to thoroughly analyze each provision of the \nlegislation in the short time it has been available to Senators. If, \nhowever, we remain committed to the fiscal responsibility embodied in \nthe Balanced Budget Act and the tax fairness of the Taxpayer Relief \nAct, the American people will soon reap the benefits of both lower \ntaxes and a declining national debt.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nObjectionable Provisions in the Conference Agreement on H.R. 2015, The \n                          Balanced Budget Act\n\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       Sec. 4011: Mandates establishment of Medicare Prepaid \n     Competitive Pricing Demonstration Projects, initially in 4 \n     areas (including one rural area), and then in up to 3 \n     additional areas\n       Sec. 4016: Mandates establishment of 9 Medicare Coordinated \n     Care Demonstration Projects, 5 in urban areas, 3 in rural \n     areas, and 1 in the District of Columbia ``operated by a \n     nonprofit academic medical center that maintains a National \n     Cancer Institute certified comprehensive cancer center''\n       Sec. 4019: Extends for two more years the Community Nursing \n     Organization demonstration projects in Mahomet, Illinois;

Mr. President, the Board of Directors of the Office of \nCompliance has issued its first decision on appeal. The case involved \nan alleged violation of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \nNotification [WARN] provisions made applicable by the Congressional \nAccountability Act of 1995. Pursuant to section 416(d) of the act and \nsection 104(d) of the office's regulations, the Board has exercised its \ndiscretion to make the decision public. It will be publicly available \nat the Office of Compliance and of the Office's Internet Website.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the decision of the Board of Directors \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Office of Compliance\n\n GERARD J. SCHMELZER, Appellant, v. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE \n           OFFICER, U.S. House of Representatives, Appellee.\n\n                        (Case No. 96-HS-14 (WN))\n\n       Before the Board of Directors: Glen D. Nager, Chair; James \n     N. Adler; Jerry M. Hunter; Lawrence Z. Lorber; Virginia A. \n     Seitz, Members.\n\n\n                   DECISION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n       These cases, consolidated on appeal, arise out of the \n     privatization of the internal postal operations of the House \n     of Representatives. Appellants are nine former employees of \n     the House of Representatives, who served in House Postal \n     Operations (the ``HPO'') under the Chief Administrative \n     Officer (the ``CAO'') of the House. Appellants lost their \n     jobs as a result of the privatization of the House's internal \n     mail functions. They subsequently filed claims with the \n     Office of Compliance alleging that the notice of the \n     privatization that they received did not satisfy the \n     requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (the ``WARN Act''), as applied by section \n     205 of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (the \n     ``CAA''), 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1315, and the Board's implementing \n     regulations.\n       Pursuant to section 405 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1405, a \n     Hearing Officer was appointed who heard all nine cases. Eight \n     of the cases, in which the parties were represented by the \n     same counsel, were consolidated for one hearing; the case of \n     appellant Schmelzer, which raised the same issues, was heard \n     in a separate hearing by the same Hearing Officer. In \n     separate decisions issued the same day, the Hearing Officer \n     determined, among other things, that the CAO had given \n     legally sufficient notice to all appellants and, finding no \n     violation of the Act, ordered entry of judgment in favor of \n     the CAO in each case. Decision of the Hearing Officer in \n     Gerald J. Schmelzer v. Office of the Chief Administrative \n     Officer, U.S. House of Representatives (the ``Schmelzer \n     Decision'') at 58-60. Decision of the Hearing Officer in Avis \n     Quick et al. v. Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, \n     U.S. House of Representatives (the ``Quick Decision'') at 59-\n     61. (All citations hereinafter to the Hearing Officer's \n     Decision or Findings of Fact shall be to Schmelzer, unless \n     otherwise stated.)\n       The Hearing Officer found that a memorandum that the Office \n     of the CAO distributed to HPO employees on December 13, 1995 \n     (the ``December 13, 1995 memorandum'') 1 \n     constituted written notice which substantially complied with \n     the CAA's notice requirements, even though it was technically \n     deficient, principally because it did not state the specific \n     date on which appellants' employment would terminate, as \n     required by the Board's regulations. The Hearing Officer \n     concluded, however, that in the particular circumstances of \n     this case, the technical defects of the memorandum were not \n     fatal because the memorandum provided a general indication of \n     the termination date and because that date had been \n     communicated in meetings attended by all appellants, was \n     widely publicized, was generally well-known, and was readily \n     ascertainable by HPO employees. Decision at 58. These appeals \n     followed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The December 13, 1995 memorandum is reproduced as \n     Appendix A to this opinion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                   I.\n\n       The Hearing Officer determined that the December 13, 1995 \n     memorandum ``needs to be read in context'' in order to decide \n     whether the omission of the specific closing date of the HPO \n     compelled a finding of violation, Decision at 53, and, to \n     that end, he considered the long and public process leading \n     up to the privatization, including a series of updating \n     memoranda and employee meetings which predated the \n     terminations occasioned by the privatization of the HPO by \n     sixty days or more. He found the following facts to be \n     relevant.\n       The CAO's first plan to privatize HPO functions was \n     submitted to the Committee on House Oversight of the House of \n     Representatives (the ``Committee'') on February 28, 1995, \n     and, at the Committee's request, the CAO twice submitted \n     revised plans over the next several months. See Decision at \n     5. The Hearing Officer found that, during this period, the \n     possible privatization of HPO operations was ``a subject \n     of discussion and interest'' among HPO employees. Id.\n       On June 14, 1995, the Committee directed the CAO to issue a \n     request for proposals (``RFP'') to contract out House mail \n     functions, and, on that same day, CAO managers distributed a \n     memorandum to HPO staff informing them of the Committee's \n     action and assuring them that any selected vendor would be \n     required to interview all interested current employees for \n     future employment with the vendor. House Comm. on House \n     Oversight, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., Resolution, ``Postal \n     Operations.'' The Hearing Officer found that, at this point, \n     the ``level of interest'' of HPO employees in the possibility \n     of privatization ``increased.'' Decision at 5. An RFP was \n     published in Commerce Business Daily during August, and, on \n     September 8, 1995, the Office of the CAO distributed another \n     memorandum to HPO employees. See id. at 6.\n       The memorandum of September 8, 1995 stated that it was \n     written in response to employee inquiries: ``many of you have \n     requested an update on the status of the [RFP] to outsource \n     Postal Operations.'' 2 Id. The memorandum \n     reiterated that the winning bidder would ``interview all \n     interested Postal Operations employees for possible \n     employment.'' Id. The memorandum also gave employees a \n     schedule for the transition to the private contractor, \n     stating that final bids were due in by September 15, 1995 and \n     that review and recommendation on award of the contract was \n     due to the Committee at the beginning of November. See id. \n     The September 8 memorandum concluded by telling employees \n     when the privatization was due to take place: ``[t]he new \n     facilities management company is scheduled to begin \n     operations in mid-December.'' Id. The memorandum also offered \n     to answer any ``additional questions'' that employees might \n     have. Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ The September 8, 1995 memorandum is reproduced as \n     Appendix B to this opinion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        On December 13, 1995, the Committee adopted a resolution \n     directing that ``all functions of House Postal Operations \n     shall be terminated as of the close of business on Tuesday, \n     February 13, 1996'' and authorizing the CAO to contract with \n     Pitney Bowes Management Services, Inc. (``PBMS'' or ``Pitney \n     Bowes'') to provide those internal mail services for the \n     House. House Comm. on House Oversight, 104th Cong., 1st \n     Sess., Resolution, ``House Postal Contract.'' 3 \n     The Committee resolution also instructed the CAO ``to \n     immediately provide sixty days notice to existing House \n     employees affected [by the privatization].'' Id. One of the \n     appellants attended the Committee meeting, and the resolution \n     of the Committee was posted for several days on the bulletin \n     board at the main HPO facility. See Findings of Fact at 3; \n     Quick Findings of Fact at 4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ The December 13, 1995 Committee Resolution is reproduced \n     as Appendix C to this opinion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On that same day, soon after the Committee meeting, in \n     response to the Committee's action, CAO management asked all \n     HPO employees who were present at work to attend either of \n     two meetings. It was at these meetings that CAO officials \n     distributed the December 13, 1995 memorandum, which announced \n     to employees the award of the contract to Pitney Bowes and \n     explained that the contractor would distribute \n     applications for employment the next day and would make \n     its hiring decisions in January, 1996. See Decision at 7. \n     The memorandum also promised that support, resources, and \n     employee assistance programs would be provided ``[t]o make \n     the transition from employment with the U.S. House of \n     Representatives as smooth as possible. * * *'' Id. at 48. \n     CAO managers also explained at the December 13 meeting \n     that February 14, 1996, Valentine's Day, was the target \n     date for Pitney Bowes to begin operations. See id. at 57.\n       Appellant Schmelzer acknowledged having received a copy of \n     the December 13, 1995 memorandum at one of the meetings, as \n     did one of the other appellants. See id. at 46; Quick \n     Decision at 48. All of the other appellants likewise attended \n     one of the meetings. See Quick Decision at 47-48.\n       On the next day, December 14, 1995, further meetings were \n     convened, at which Pitney Bowes met with the employees and \n     distributed job applications. Several representatives of the \n     CAO and of Pitney Bowes spoke, and it was stated at several \n     points that Pitney Bowes would begin serving as the House's \n     mail delivery contractor on Valentine's Day, February 14, \n     1996. See Findings of Fact at 4; Quick Findings of Fact at 5. \n     All appellants attended one of these meetings, and all \n     submitted job applications to Pitney Bowes. See Findings of \n     Fact at 4; Quick Findings of Fact at 5.\n       On January 22, 1996, individual letters were hand-delivered \n     to all HPO employees present\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\n     at work. Each letter stated that Pitney Bowes would assume \n     mail delivery functions on February 14, 1996, and that the \n     recipient's employment with the House would terminate at \n     close-of-business on February 13, 1996. All but two of the \n     appellants were at work on January 22 and received the letter \n     on that day. The two other appellants received their letters \n     on January 23 and January 29, when each returned to work. See \n     Findings of Fact at 5; Quick Findings of Fact at 6-7. The \n     legal sufficiency of the notice provided by these letters is \n     undisputed.\n       Both before and after the Committee's December 13, 1995 \n     decision to terminate all functions of the HPO, the CAO \n     offered an array of support services to HPO employees. See \n     Decision at 8-9; Quick Decision at 9-10. These included \n     establishing an outplacement service office, which assisted \n     employees with resume writing and preparing job applications, \n     as well as offering coaching on how to interview. See \n     Transcript in Quick at 179-184. A job bank listing sources \n     both inside the Congress and outside, as well as a bank of \n     computers and telephones for employee use, were also \n     provided. See id. Staff of the outplacement service also \n     furnished information on ``Ramspeck'' rights, health \n     insurance, and other employee benefits, as well as other \n     transition advice. See id.; Transcript in Schmelzer at 114. \n     In addition to the services provided in-house, the CAO had \n     arranged for the District of Columbia Employment Services to \n     present two workshops for postal employees on October 20, \n     1995, entitled, ``Job Hunting in Today's Tight Job Market,'' \n     which, among other things, explained the training \n     opportunities under the Economic Dislocation and Worker \n     Assistance Act. See Transcript in Quick at 182-83. Appellant \n     Schmelzer, among others, made use of the outplacement and \n     other services provided by the CAO for HPO employees. See \n     Findings of Fact at 5.\n       Appellants' employment with the House of Representatives \n     ended when HPO functions ceased at close of business on \n     February 13, 1996. Overall, of the 113 employees affected by \n     the privatization, three remained employed by the House of \n     Representatives under the CAO, and Pitney Bowes extended \n     offers of employment to 90 of the HPO employees, of whom \n     about two-thirds accepted and began working for Pitney Bowes \n     directly from their House employment, when Pitney Bowes took \n     over the internal House postal operations on February 14, \n     1996. See Decision at 9. All appellants interviewed for \n     employment with Pitney Bowes; two were not given offers of \n     employment; the rest declined the offers tendered. See id. at \n     8-9; Quick Decision at 8-9.\n\n\n                                 II. a.\n\n       Appellants petitioned the Board to review and reverse the \n     Hearing Officer's decisions. They argue that the Hearing \n     Officer misconstrued the applicable law in concluding that \n     the December 13, 1995 memorandum substantially complied with \n     the notice requirements of the WARN Act, as applied by the \n     CAA. Appellants in Quick also argue on appeal that the \n     Hearing Officer erred in concluding that the distribution of \n     the December 13, 1995 memorandum constituted a reasonable \n     method of delivery. Appellant Schmelzer does not join in this \n     contention, having acknowledged his receipt of the December \n     13, 1995 memorandum. See Findings of Fact at 4; see also \n     Appellant's Brief at 7.\n       Appellee CAO seeks affirmance on a number of grounds. \n     Appellee argues that the Hearing Officer's conclusion that \n     the notice provided by the CAO substantially complied with \n     section 205 of the CAA and the pertinent regulations is based \n     on the correct application of law and is supported by \n     substantial evidence in the record. Alternatively, appellee \n     argues that, as a matter of law, section 205 of the CAA did \n     not apply to the closing of the HPO because the decision to \n     close the HPO was made and notice to employees of the closing \n     was delivered before the effective date of section 205 of the \n     CAA. Appellee also contends that fewer than fifty employees \n     actually suffered an employment loss when the number of \n     employees who were offered employment with Pitney Bowes is \n     calculated under the sale of business/privatization exclusion \n     of section 2(b)(1) of the WARN Act, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2101(b)(1), as applied by section 225(f)(1) of the CAA, \n     2 U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1), and section 639.4(c) of the Board's \n     regulations. In addition, appellee argues that, even if the \n     CAO were to be found liable for a technical violation of the \n     notice requirements, the Hearing Officer's findings of fact \n     support granting the CAO a good faith reduction or \n     elimination of damages, as provided by section 5(a)(4) of the \n     WARN Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2104(a)(4), as applied by section \n     205(b) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1315(b).\n       Because the Board agrees with the Hearing Officer's \n     conclusion that, in the totality of the circumstances here, \n     the notice provided by the December 13, 1995 memorandum \n     substantially complied with the notice requirements of the \n     Act and the applicable regulations, we do not reach the \n     alternative grounds for affirmance urged by the CAO. We \n     therefore turn to the notice requirements of the Act and the \n     Board's WARN Act regulations.4\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\4\\ The CAO has raised the question whether the Board's WARN \n     Act regulations can fairly be applied to the December 13, \n     1995 notice since these regulations did not go into effect \n     until January 23, 1996. In light of our disposition of the \n     case, the Board need not decide this issue which, in the \n     unique circumstances of this case, is without precedential \n     value. We note, however, that the Board's regulations are, as \n     required by section 205(c)(2) of the CAA, substantively the \n     same as the Department of Labor WARN Act regulations. See \n     also section 411 of the CAA (stating that the Department of \n     Labor's WARN Act regulations apply ``to the extent necessary \n     and appropriate'' where the Board has not issued a regulation \n     required by the CAA to implement a statutory provision).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                 II. b.\n\n       Section 205(a) of the CAA provides ``Worker Adjustment and \n     Retraining Notification Rights'' to covered employees, as \n     follows: ``No employing office shall be closed or a mass \n     layoff ordered within the meaning of section 3 of the Worker \n     Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2102) until the end of a 60-day period after the \n     employing office serves written notice of such prospective \n     closing or layoff to representatives of covered employees or, \n     if there are no representatives, to covered employees.''\n       While the statute does not explicitly state what the notice \n     must contain, the regulations have mandated that certain \n     information be provided in order to effectuate the purpose of \n     the WARN Act to provide workers with adequate advance \n     notification of an employment loss. As explained in the \n     Department of Labor's regulations and in section 639.1(a) of \n     the Board's Interim Regulations, WARN Act notice ``provides \n     workers and their families some transition time to adjust to \n     the prospective loss of employment, to seek and obtain \n     alternative jobs and, if necessary, to enter skill training \n     or retraining that will allow these workers to successfully \n     compete in the job market.'' Notice of Adoption of Regulation \n     and Submission for Approval and Issuance of Interim \n     Regulations, 142 Cong. Rec. S271-72 (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996) \n     (All citations are to the ``Interim Regulations,'' which were \n     in effect at the time of the privatization of the HPO). See \n     also the Department of Labor's response to comments on its \n     regulatory notice requirements: ``While the Act does not \n     enumerate specific elements which should be included in the \n     advance written notice, * * * [t]he content of notice to each \n     party [required by the regulations] is designed to provide \n     information necessary for each of them to take responsible \n     action.'' 54 Fed. Reg. 16042, 16059 (April 20, 1989) \n     (Response to Comments, section 639.7(d) WARN Notice).\n       To effectuate the notification purposes of the WARN Act, \n     section 639.7(d) of the Board's Interim Regulations, like the \n     Department of Labor's WARN Act regulations, requires that \n     notice to individual employees contain the following four \n     elements:\n       (1) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (2) The expected date when the office closing or mass \n     layoff will commence and the expected date when the \n     individual employee will be separated;\n       (3) An indication whether or not bumping rights exist;\n       (4) The name and telephone number of an employing office \n     official to contact for further information.\n       142 Cong. Rec. S270, S274 (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996).\n       Courts construing these notice requirements have, in light \n     of the notice purposes of the WARN Act, distinguished between \n     the situation in which an employer has failed to provide any \n     written notice, and the situation in which written notice was \n     provided, but the contents of the notice failed to meet the \n     technical requirements of the regulations. See, e.g., \n     Carpenters Dist. Council v. Dillard Dep't Stores, 15 F.3d \n     1275, 1287 n.19 (5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 933 \n     (1995); accord Saxion v. Titan-C-Mfg. Inc., 86 F.3d 553, 561 \n     (6th Cir. 1996); Marques v. Telles Ranch, 867 F. Supp. 1438, \n     1445-46 (N.D. Cal. 1994); United Automobile Aerospace & \n     Agricultural Implement of America Local 1077 v. Shadyside \n     Stamping Corp., 1991 WL 340191 (S.D. Ohio) (dictum), aff'd \n     without published opinion, 947 F.2d 946 (6th Cir.1991). The \n     Hearing Officer appropriately was guided by these cases, \n     which we also find to be persuasive. 5\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\5\\ Section 405(h) of the CAA provides that ``[a] hearing \n     officer who conducts a hearing * * * shall be guided by \n     judicial decisions under the laws made applicable by section \n     102 [of the CAA] * * *.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1405(h).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In Dillard, the court, considering the adequacy of notices \n     that gave inaccurate termination dates, noted that ``neither \n     the regulations nor the Act itself addresses how courts are \n     to treat notices that are determined to be defective or \n     inadequate. As such, neither the Act nor the regulations \n     suggest that defective notice is automatically to be treated \n     as though no notice had been provided at all.'' 15 F.3d at \n     1287 n.19 (citation omitted). Similarly, the Saxion court, \n     quoting Dillard with approval in a case in which the notice \n     failed to give a termination date, among its other technical \n     deficiencies, concluded: ``We are not persuaded that the \n     technical deficiencies in the March 13 letter required the \n     district court to proceed as if there had been no notice at \n     all.'' 86 F.3d at 561. Likewise, in Marques, the court again \n     quoted Dillard with approval, and construed the Department of \n     Labor regulations as providing that ``technical deficiencies \n     or omissions in notice do not invalidate notice or result in \n     WARN liability.'' 867 F. Supp. at 1445. In that case, the \n     court found adequate a WARN notice provided to seasonal \n     workers during their seasonal lay-off, despite its lack of \n     date, because the court concluded that, in context, the \n     notice could only be read as referring to a permanent \n     layoff beginning in the upcoming harvest season. Id. at \n     1446. Finally, in\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\n     Shadyside Stamping Corp., the court, analyzing whether \n     notices that, among other things, failed to provide \n     precise termination dates, were nonetheless adequate, \n     found relevant whether ``all the information required to \n     be provided by the employer was produced or at least well \n     known.'' 1991 WL 34091 at star page 7 (emphasis added). \n     Thus, all four cases stand for the proposition that \n     omitting termination dates or providing inaccurate \n     termination dates does not necessarily render written WARN \n     notices fatally deficient.\n       The Department of Labor's interpretative comments to the \n     enforcement provisions of its WARN Act regulations also \n     distinguish between the failure to give notice and the \n     provision of technically defective notice. The Department of \n     Labor's commentary on its WARN Act regulations provides \n     guidance that ``technical violations of the notice \n     requirements not intended to evade the purposes of WARN ought \n     to be treated differently than either the failure to give \n     notice or the giving of notice intended to evade the purposes \n     of the Act.'' 54 Fed. Reg. 16042, 16043 (April 20, 1989) \n     (Response to Comments, section 639.1(d) WARN Enforcement). \n     Some ``technical violations'' are best characterized as \n     ``minor, inadvertent errors,'' which the Department of Labor \n     states ``are not intended to be violations of the \n     regulations.'' Id. ``Other kinds of violations, i.e., the \n     failure to provide information required in these regulations, \n     may constitute a violation of WARN.'' Id. (emphasis added). \n     Thus, the Department of Labor indicates that such errors \n     ``may,'' but do not necessarily, violate the Act. We agree.\n       When faced with technically deficient WARN notices, courts \n     have, consistent with the Department of Labor's view, asked \n     whether, in the circumstances of the case, the employees \n     nonetheless received notice that satisfies the purposes of \n     the Act. See, e.g. Dillard, 15 F.3d. at 1286; Marques, 867 F. \n     Supp. at 1445. In making that determination, courts have \n     consistently looked at all the communications provided by \n     employers to determine whether, when viewed in context, one \n     or more written communications qualified as notice under the \n     WARN Act and applicable regulations. See Kalwaytis v. \n     Preferred Meal Systems, Inc., 78 F.3d 117, 121-22 (3d. Cir.), \n     cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 73 (1996); Dillard, 15 F.3d. at \n     1286-87; Saxion, 86 F.3d at 561; Marques, 867 F. Supp. at \n     1445-46. Cf. also Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Int'l \n     Union v. American Home Products Corp., 790 F. Supp. 1441 \n     (N.D. Ind. 1992) (employer who failed timely to update \n     written notice provided one year in advance of closing which \n     contained inaccurate termination date and who provided only \n     seven days written notice of actual termination date was \n     entitled to summary judgment based upon statutory good faith \n     defense because the requirements of the regulations were \n     unclear); Shadyside Stamping Corp., 1991 WL 340191 at star \n     pages 8-10 (employer who provided five months written notice \n     and a written reminder notice, but failed to meet the \n     technical requirements of the regulations, was entitled to \n     summary judgment based upon statutory good faith defense).\n       In Kalwaytis, the employer wrote a letter to employees laid \n     off by the outsourcing of its school meal preparation \n     services informing them that it was ceasing food service \n     operations at its plant and contracting out that function. \n     The initial letter stated that the new employer has \n     ``an immediate offer of employment to make to you.'' Id. \n     at 119. A later letter made clear that an offer of \n     employment was in the contractor's discretion. Id. The \n     court concluded that adequate notice had been provided: \n     ``Giving a reasonably pragmatic interpretation of the two \n     letters, we conclude that, read together, they do meet the \n     statutory requirements of notice.'' Id. at 122.\n       Similarly, the Dillard court, construing a series of three \n     written notices, the last two of which gave estimated \n     termination dates that did not provide the full sixty days \n     required by the WARN Act, found that employees who actually \n     worked for at least sixty days after receipt of the notices \n     were not entitled to back pay damages because they had, in \n     fact, received the notice that they were entitled to under \n     the Act. 15 F.3d. at 1286-87. The court concluded that any \n     other interpretation was ``inconsistent with both the \n     language and the purpose of the Act'' which requires only \n     that an employer provide sixty days notice of termination. \n     Id. at 1286.\n       Likewise, in Saxion, 86 F.3d at 561, the court found that \n     appellant should not have been found in violation of the WARN \n     Act for the full sixty-day period where, ten days before the \n     plant shut down, appellant gave a written notice stating that \n     the plant was going to close and giving the name and phone \n     number of a company official to contact with further \n     questions. The court reduced the violation period to fifty \n     days, despite the omission of the date of the plant's shut \n     down, concluding: ``[t]hat the notice was deficient in other \n     respects does not change the fact that ten days before the \n     plant was closed, the affected employees clearly knew that it \n     was going to be closed.'' Id.\n       Finally, in Marques, 867 F. Supp. at 1445, the court \n     analyzed the notice in light of whether the purpose of the \n     notice provision was served and determined that, because none \n     of the omissions in the notice caused harm to the employees, \n     the technical deficiencies did not give rise to liability. \n     The court found that, despite the lack of a specific \n     separation date, the time frame could be determined from the \n     notice and surrounding circumstances. Id. The omission of \n     bumping rights was immaterial since employees did not enjoy \n     such rights. Id. Further, ``although there was no name and \n     number of a company official to contact for further \n     information, Plaintiffs clearly knew and understood how to \n     contact Defendants because Plaintiffs had done so every \n     season to determine the date harvesting operations were to \n     resume.'' Id. Thus, the deficiencies in the written notice \n     did not undermine the notice purposes of the Act because \n     employees either already knew the missing information from \n     other contexts or could infer it from the notice and \n     surrounding circumstances, or because it was irrelevant to \n     their situation.\n       In sum, courts have approached the notice requirements with \n     an eye to practicalities: ``Fairly read, the regulations \n     require a practical and realistic appraisal of the \n     information given to affected employees.'' Kalwaytis, 78 F.3d \n     at 121-22. Evaluating the notices received by employees from \n     that practical perspective, the courts in Marques, Saxion, \n     and Dillard found that the omissions in the written notices \n     did not undermine the purpose of the statute where the \n     pertinent information that the written notice should have \n     conveyed was actually known by, or was readily available to, \n     the employees. Thus, under the applicable case law, the \n     Hearing Officer was correct in concluding that: ``[u]nder \n     prevailing WARN case law, neither the inclusion of inaccurate \n     termination dates, nor the omission of termination dates \n     altogether, necessarily renders a WARN notice defective, \n     particularly if employees can easily ascertain the date \n     from surrounding circumstances or readily available \n     sources of information.'' Decision at 56.\n\n\n                                 II. c.\n\n       We also conclude that the substantial compliance standard \n     adopted by the Hearing Officer is an appropriate standard to \n     be used in determining if a violation has occurred. Indeed, \n     all cases construing a written WARN notice that is \n     technically defective because of the omission or inaccurate \n     statement of a termination date use the substantial \n     compliance standard, either explicitly, Marques, F. Supp. at \n     1446, and Shadyside Stamping Corp., 1991 WL 340191 at star \n     pages 7-9, or implicitly, Saxion, 86 F.3d at 561, and \n     Dillard, 15 F.3d at 1286-87 & n.19. 6\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ We note that courts have held that substantial compliance \n     is sufficient to meet the notice requirements of a number of \n     other employment-related regulatory schemes. For example, \n     under ERISA, if a plan administrator denies a claim without \n     providing notice that meets applicable regulatory \n     requirements, several circuits have applied a ``substantial \n     compliance'' standard in evaluating whether the defects in \n     notice invalidate the plan administrator's decision. See \n     Brogan v. Holland, 105 F.3d 158, 164-65 (4th Cir. 1997); \n     Donato v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,19 F.3d 375, 382-83 (7th \n     Cir. 1994); see also Kent v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co., \n     96 F.3d 803, 807 (6th Cir. 1996). A substantial compliance \n     standard has also been applied to notice that unions must \n     provide to employees regarding service fees, see Laramie v. \n     County of Santa Clara, 784 F. Supp. 1492 (N.D. Cal. 1992), \n     see also Chicago Teachers Union Local 1 v. Hudson, 475 U.S. \n     292, 307 n.18 (1986); notice procedure for discharging school \n     teachers, see Roberts v. Van Buren Public Schools, 773 F.2d \n     949, 959 (8th Cir. 1985); and notice expressing intent to \n     terminate a collective bargaining agreement, see Purex Corp. \n     v. Automotive, Petroleum and Allied Indus. Employees Union, \n     Local 618, 543 F. Supp. 1011, 1015-1016 (E.D. Mo. 1982), \n     aff'd 705 F.2d 274 (8th Cir. 1983).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        This standard is particularly appropriate here because the \n     instant cases arose during the early days of implementation \n     of section 205 of the CAA. It was over a month before the \n     January 23, 1996 effective date of section 205 of the CAA and \n     of the Board's Interim Regulations that the Committee on \n     House Oversight adopted the resolution instructing the CAO \n     ``to immediately provide sixty days notice to existing House \n     employees affected by the issuance of the contract.'' The \n     memorandum from the CAO explaining the situation to employees \n     was issued on the same date as the resolution. This was a \n     period that the Board described as one of ``regulatory \n     uncertainty.'' Notice of Issuance of Interim Regulations, 142 \n     Cong. Rec. S270, S271 (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996). As the Board \n     there noted: ``[i]n the absence of the issuance of such \n     interim regulations, covered employees, employing offices, \n     and the Office of Compliance staff itself would be forced to \n     operate in regulatory uncertainty. * * * [E]mploying offices \n     and the Office of Compliance staff might not know what \n     regulation, if any, would be found applicable in particular \n     circumstances absent the procedures suggested here.'' Id.\n       In comparable circumstances, the Department of Labor \n     concluded that ``* * * in the early days of WARN \n     implementation substantial compliance with regulatory \n     requirements should be sufficient to comply with WARN.'' 53 \n     Fed. Reg. 48884-85 (1988) (notice adopting interim \n     interpretative rules of Dec 2, 1988). Courts construing WARN \n     notices issued during the transition period adopted the \n     substantial compliance standard. See, e.g. Shadyside Stamping \n     Corp., 1991 WL 340191, at star pages 7-9 (noting that the \n     substantial compliance standard may be satisfied if the \n     information missing from the notice was otherwise provided by \n     the employer or was readily available to employees).\n\n\n                                  III.\n\n       With these principles in mind, we turn to the notice \n     provided to employees in this case. The Board agrees with the \n     Hearing Officer that the December 13, 1995 memorandum can \n     fairly be read to supply two of the four elements required by \n     section 639.7(d) of the Board's regulations, that is, a \n     statement\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\n     to the effect that House Postal Operations is to be \n     permanently closed and the name and telephone number of an \n     official to contact for further information. See sections \n     639.7(d)(1), (4).\n       Looking at the actual language of the memorandum, the Board \n     agrees with the Hearing Officer's conclusion that today's \n     government employees, especially those of the 104th Congress \n     in which privatization had been a topic of debate, would \n     reasonably understand that the issuance of a request for \n     proposals ``to privatize the current House postal delivery \n     operations'' meant that the House was seeking to contract \n     with a private contractor to perform the jobs of the current \n     incumbents. The only logical inference from the announcement \n     of ``Pitney Bowes Management Services being selected as the \n     House vendor for postal delivery operations'' is that this \n     private contractor has now been hired to take over the \n     functions of the HPO.\n       The memorandum also makes clear that jobs with the new \n     contractor are not automatic. Employees must apply, go \n     through an interview process, and await the contractor's \n     independent hiring decisions. The memorandum states that \n     ``the vendor has agreed to interview all current Postal \n     Operations employees interested in employment with their \n     organization'' (emphasis added). This confirms that the \n     current House jobs in Postal Operations are going to be \n     privatized and that future jobs in postal operations will be \n     with the private contractor who is now conducting interviews \n     for that employment. Moreover, the memorandum also states \n     that hiring decisions will be made by PBMS: ``The vendor will \n     inform you directly if you are selected for a position in \n     their organization.'' Finally, the memorandum describes the \n     services that will be made available to make the employees' \n     ``transition from employment with the U.S. House of \n     Representatives as smooth as possible'' (emphasis added). The \n     plain meaning of ``transition from House employment'' is that \n     the employees' current jobs will be terminated when PBMS \n     takes over on February 14, 1996, a date that has been \n     identified for the HPO employees. Thus, this notice is like \n     the second notice in Kalwaytis, 78 F.3d at 122, which made \n     clear that laid-off employees would have to apply for \n     employment directly with the new employer. Therefore, \n     the Board agrees with the Hearing Officer that the \n     December 13, 1995 memorandum substantially complies with \n     the requirement of section 639.7(d)(1) of the Board's \n     Interim Regulations.\n       The memorandum gives employees several points of contact \n     for further information, in satisfaction of section \n     639.7(d)(4). It provides the address and telephone numbers of \n     ``[t]he Human Resources' Office of Training'' and the \n     ``Outplacement Resources Center,'' as well as stating the \n     full name and title of the memorandum's author, the Associate \n     Administrator for Human Resources in the Office of the CAO. \n     Clearly, employees knew how to get in touch with someone on \n     the CAO's staff who could answer their questions. Moreover, \n     the omission of the telephone number of the Associate \n     Administrator for Human Resources was of no consequence; she \n     spoke at the orientation meeting introducing Pitney Bowes \n     Management Services, attended by all appellants, the day \n     after the memorandum was distributed.\n       The memorandum fails, however, to inform employees whether \n     bumping rights exist, as required by section 639.7(d)(3). \n     However, there was no testimony during the Hearing regarding \n     this omission, nor any complaint on appeal. Moreover, bumping \n     rights have no relevance, where, as here, the entire \n     operation is closed. See Marques, 867 F. Supp. at 1446. The \n     Board therefore agrees with the Hearing Officer's conclusion \n     that, in these circumstances, the omission of this \n     information is a minor, inadvertent error, within the meaning \n     of section 639.7(a)(4) of the Board's regulations.\n       The December 13, 1995 memorandum also fail to state \n     explicitly the expected date of the office closing and the \n     expected date when employees will be separated from \n     employment, as required by section 639.7(d)(2). However, as \n     the Hearing Officer concluded, ``[g]iven that the December \n     13, 1995 memorandum provides some indication of the \n     privatization date (i.e., reasonably soon after completion of \n     the interview process in January 1996), given that the date \n     was fixed and certain and widely publicized in a variety of \n     oral and written ways, and given that employees had a wealth \n     of readily available means to ascertain the date, . . . [the \n     failure to provide this date] does not compel a finding of \n     violation.'' Decision at 58. While the December 13, 1995 \n     memorandum was technically deficient in its failure to \n     provide the date required by section 639.7(d)(2) of the \n     Board's WARN Act regulations, the information missing from \n     the notice was otherwise provided to employees by the CAO and \n     also was readily available to them from a number of sources, \n     at least sixty days in advance of the employees' termination, \n     such that the purposes of the WARN Act were satisfied. See \n     Marques, 867 F. Supp. at 1445-46; see also Saxion, 86 F.3d at \n     561; see also Shadyside Stamping Corp., 1991 WL 340191 at \n     star pages 7-8.\n       Examining the record, moreover, the Board does not find \n     that the omission of the termination date from the CAO's \n     otherwise timely and adequate written notice defeated the \n     purposes of the statute. Judged in the totality of the \n     circumstances, the CAO took appropriate steps under the WARN \n     Act, as applied by the CAA, to provide adequate notice for \n     employees to make the transition to new employment. In the \n     spirit of the purposes of the WARN Act, see section 639.1(a) \n     of the Board's regulations, the CAO voluntarily gave \n     employees early notice that the Committee on House Oversight \n     was contemplating the privatization of the HPO. The CAO's \n     June memorandum was updated by notice in September in a \n     memorandum that provided an actual schedule for the \n     privatization process, based on the best information then \n     available. It is in this context that the December 13, 1995 \n     memorandum must be read to determine whether the omission of \n     the date deprived employees of legally sufficient notice of \n     their date of termination.7\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\7\\ We note that the December 13, 1995 memorandum was part of \n     the CAO's response to the Committee's direction to \n     ``immediately provide sixty days notice to existing House \n     employees affected'' by the Committee resolution of December \n     13, 1995 authorizing the contract to privatize the HPO.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The December 13 memorandum states that the ``review/\n     selection process'' for employment with PBMS ``will be \n     completed in January, 1996.'' From that information, \n     employees could expect that the contractor would begin \n     operations shortly thereafter as, in fact, PBMS did. That \n     conclusion is supported by the fact that the earlier \n     memorandum of September 8, 1995 had notified employees that \n     the contractor was ``scheduled to begin operations in mid-\n     December,'' so that employees were already on written notice \n     that the contractor would take over shortly. While it was \n     clear by December 13, 1995, that the earlier deadline had \n     slipped, the fact remains that, through the September 8, 1995 \n     memorandum, employees had received written notice of a likely \n     termination date, and were given updated information about \n     the contractor's plans on December 13, 1995, over sixty days \n     before their actual termination.\n       Looking at the September 8, 1995 memorandum together with \n     the December 13, 1995 memorandum, the Board finds this to be \n     a situation in which employees received multiple notices \n     whose technical deficiencies do not merit a finding of \n     liability. See, e.g., Kalwaytis, 78 F.3d at 121-22; Dillard, \n     15 F.3d at 1286-87 & n.19; cf. American Home Products, 790 F. \n     Supp. at 1444-45, 1450-53; Shadyside Stamping Corp., 1991 WL \n     340191 at star pages 1-3, 8-11. Reading the letters together, \n     and making ``a practical and realistic appraisal of the \n     information given to affected employees,'' Kalwaytis, 78 F.3d \n     at 121-22, the Board concludes that, over sixty days before \n     their termination, appellants were provided with adequate \n     information to determine that they were going to lose their \n     government jobs on February 13, 1996, when the contractor \n     took over House Postal Operations.\n       Thus, because appellants received over sixty days written \n     notice from the mid-December estimated take-over by the \n     contractor, they were like those employees in Dillard who \n     worked past the estimated termination dates given in their \n     notices such that they actually received over sixty days \n     notice, see 15 F.3d at 1286-87 & n.19. As the Dillard court \n     held, sixty days notice satisfies ``both the language and the \n     purpose of the Act.'' Id. at 1286. Such actual notice of \n     termination is what is essentially required by the notice \n     requirements of the Act to give employees adequate notice to \n     plan for the loss of their jobs. In such circumstances, the \n     inaccuracy in the termination date is not fatal. See id.\n       Moreover, as the Hearing Officer found, the date was well \n     known and widely disseminated. Decision at 56-58. Appellant \n     Schmelzer, for example, conceded that he was well aware of \n     the termination date; he wrote it on his application for \n     employment with PBMS. See id. at 57. Another appellant \n     attended part of the Committee meeting in which the \n     resolution was passed that effected the February 13, 1996 \n     closure of the HPO. See Quick Findings of Fact at 4. And the \n     Committee's resolution was posted on the HPO bulletin board. \n     See Decision at 56-57. Further, testimony credited by the \n     Hearing Officer made clear that the date of Valentine's Day, \n     February 14, 1996, was stated repeatedly at the December 14, \n     1995 meeting attended by all appellants. See id. at 57; Quick \n     Decision at 58. In addition, the Hearing Officer noted seven \n     ways by which any employee, still in doubt, could have \n     ascertained the information. Decision at 57. Notable among \n     his findings was the simple expedient of asking the question \n     at either the December 13 or the December 14 meetings, \n     attended by all appellants, during which the Office of the \n     CAO not only provided question-and-answer periods, but also \n     announced the February 14, 1996 date for PBMS to take over \n     the HPO operations. Id. Or employees could have called any of \n     the three official CAO management sources provided on the \n     December 13, 1995 memorandum. Id.\n       The Board therefore concludes that there is substantial \n     evidence in the record supporting the Hearing Officer's \n     conclusion that, at least sixty days before the closing of \n     the HPO, all appellants either knew the dates on which their \n     employment with the House would terminate and PBMS would take \n     over the functions of the HPO or attended a meeting that took \n     place at least sixty days before the closing of the HPO, at \n     which these dates were discussed. Thus, the notification \n     purpose of the statute was satisfied despite the technical \n     deficiencies in the December 13, 1995 memorandum. See \n     Marques, 867 F. Supp. at 1445-46, see also Saxion, 86 F.3d at \n     561; Dillard, 15 F.3d at 1287 & n.19.\n       The only case cited by appellants as compelling a different \n     result, American Home\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\n     Products, does not. In that case, employees were provided \n     with only seven days actual notice of the date of their \n     layoff and they had no other source of information from which \n     they could learn the date. However, that situation is \n     markedly different from the case here, where the employees \n     were provided with multiple written notices and where the \n     final written notice, coupled with the information readily \n     available to the employees, reasonably assured sixty days \n     actual notice of the employees' termination date. Thus, we \n     affirm the Hearing Officer's conclusion that, in the totality \n     of the circumstances, the employees were provided with \n     adequate notice under the requirements of the CAA and the \n     applicable regulations.\n       Appellants in Quick also argue on appeal that the Hearing \n     Officer erred in concluding that the distribution of the \n     December 13, 1995 memorandum constituted a reasonable method \n     of delivery, and they contrast the handout of that memorandum \n     with the individualized delivery of the January 22, 1996 \n     termination notice, with signed receipt. This contention is \n     without merit. Section 639.8 of the Board's Regulations \n     allows the use of ``[a]ny reasonable method of delivery'' and \n     terms signed receipts ``optional.'' Under the circumstances \n     here, we agree with the Hearing Officer's conclusion that \n     distributing a memorandum at the meetings of the employees \n     was a reasonable method of effecting delivery to these \n     employees.\n       This is not a case in which the employer failed to provide \n     notice or provided notice intended to evade the purposes of \n     the notice requirements of the CAA. See Department of Labor \n     Preamble to the WARN Act Regulations, 54 Fed. Reg. 16042, \n     16043 (April 20, 1989) (Response to Comments, section \n     639.1(d) WARN Enforcement). To the contrary. Four separate \n     written notices were provided to employees. Four meetings \n     informing employees of the privatization were held in the \n     space of two days. The Committee itself was cognizant of the \n     need to provide timely notice to the employees. Its \n     resolution of December 13, 1995 directed the CAO to provide \n     sixty days notice to the employees immediately.\n       Indeed, the House tried in many additional ways, in the \n     spirit of the underlying purposes of the WARN Act, to ease \n     the transition to new employment. The Committee required, as \n     a condition of the contract, that the contractor interview \n     all current House employees for the jobs that were \n     privatized. The Office of the CAO went beyond the suggestions \n     in section 639.7(d) of the Board's regulations for providing \n     transition information useful to the employees. An array of \n     transition and support services were offered, including a job \n     bank, help with job applications, and resume writing, \n     computer training courses, stress management training, and \n     making arrangements for outplacement seminars for the \n     employees. These efforts further belie any suggestion that \n     the CAO was attempting to evade the purposes of the Act.\n       In sum, the record is clear that the privatization of the \n     HPO was not the type of stealth plant closing which leaves \n     employees adrift and which the Act, and its inclusion in the \n     CAA, were meant to prevent. There was a public debate and a \n     public decision regarding the privatization of House Postal \n     Operations, and employees were advised of these developments \n     as they occurred. In addition to the multiple written notices \n     provided, public employee meetings were held sixty days in \n     advance of any terminations. At these meetings, the process \n     and specific effective date of the privatization were \n     repeatedly announced. In these circumstances, it would \n     elevate form over substance to find that the CAO's written \n     notices of the privatization of the HPO violated the WARN \n     Act, as applied by the CAA. The Board therefore affirms the \n     decisions of the Hearing Officer.\n       It is so ordered.\n       Issued, Washington, D.C., July 29, 1997\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Office of Postal Operations Staff.\n     From: Kay E. Ford, Associate Administrator Human Resources.\n     Subject: Status of Operations.\n     Date: December 13, 1995.\n       As you have been previously informed, on Wednesday, June \n     14, 1995 the Committee on House Oversight authorized the \n     preparation and issuance of requests for possible (RFP's) to \n     privatize the current House postal delivery operations.\n       The review of the proposals submitted resulted in Pitney \n     Bowes Management Services being selected as the House vendor \n     for postal delivery operations. The selection of Pitney Bowes \n     Management Services has subsequently been approved by the \n     Committee on House Oversight. As a condition of the selection \n     process, the vendor has agreed to interview all current \n     Postal Operations employees interested in employment with \n     their organization.\n       To facilitate this process the vendor will distribute \n     applications for employment on Thursday, December 14, 1995. \n     We have been assured that their review/selection process will \n     be completed in January, 1996.

As you \n     know the Committee on House Oversight on June 14, 1995 \n     approved the issuance of a request for proposal. This RFP was \n     publicly advertised on August 7, 1995 and a bidders \n     conference to answer bidder's questions was held on August \n     27, 1995. Final bids are due to the Office of Procurement and \n     Purchasing by close of business September 15, 1995.\n       There has been a great deal of interest shown by facilities \n     management companies and we expect some very competitive \n     bids. However, we have structured the requirements of the RFP \n     to ensure that the winning bidder runs the ``world class'' \n     operation that the House desires and deserves. As announced \n     on June 14, 1995, the winning bidder will interview all \n     interested Postal Operations employees for possible \n     employment.\n       The bids will be analyzed and a final recommendation will \n     be submitted to the Committee on House Oversight by the \n     beginning of November. The new facilities management company \n     is scheduled to begin operations in mid-December. Please let \n     me know if you have additional questions.\n\n               Appendix C.--Committee on House Oversight\n\n                   Resolution.--House Postal Contract\n\n\n                       Adopted December 13, 1995\n\n       Resolved, that all functions of House Postal Operations \n     shall be terminated as of the close of business on Tuesday, \n     February 13, 1996. The Chief Administrative Officer is hereby \n     authorized to execute the contract with Pitney Bowes \n     Management Services (hereinafter ``Contractor'') as submitted \n     to the Committee on November 7, 1995 as a result of CAO \n     Solicitation 95-R-003 issued in accordance with the Committee \n     Resolution entitled, ``Postal Operations'' adopted on June \n     14, 1995 by the Committee on House Oversight.\n       Resolved further, that the Committee on House Oversight \n     directs the Chief Administrative Officer to fully cooperate \n     with the Contractor to implement the mandates of the June 14 \n     Resolution by facilitating an orderly transition of \n     operations between the House and the Contractor, and by \n     ensuring that all existing House employees affected by the \n     issuance of the contract shall be given an opportunity to \n     apply for, be interviewed for, and be considered for \n     employment with respect to the contract arising from CAO \n     Solicitation 95-R-003.\n       Resolved further, that the Committee directs the CAO to \n     immediately provide sixty days notice to existing House \n     employees affected by the issuance of the contract arising \n     from CAO Solicitation 95-R-003 and further directs the CAO to \n     fully implement the provisions of the Committee Resolution \n     adopted on June 14, 1995 entitled ``Employee Assistance with \n     respect to existing House employees affected by the issuance \n     of the contract arising from CAO Solicitation 95-R-003.\n       Resolved further, that the Chief Administrative Officer \n     shall report to the Committee, no later than the tenth day of \n     each month, beginning in January 1996 on the status of \n     implementation of the House Postal Contract.\n       Member Seitz, with whom Chairman Nager joins, concurring in \n     the judgment: 1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\  Member Hunter also joins in those parts of the \n     concurrence discussing substantial compliance, with the \n     exception of footnote 3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       I agree with the majority opinion's conclusion that the \n     Hearing Officer's decision should be affirmed because \n     appellants received notices which, in combination, \n     substantially complied with WARN Act requirements. The path I \n     followed to this conclusion diverges somewhat from that of \n     the majority, and so I briefly describe my reasoning.\n       The doctrine of substantial compliance considers whether a \n     defendant in technical noncompliance with a statutory \n     requirement has taken action sufficient to meet the purposes \n     of the statutory requirement at issue. See, e.g., Hickel v. \n     Oil Shale Corp., 400 U.S. 48 (1970) (annual work assessment \n     requirements of federal mining laws); Kent v. United Omaha \n     Life Ins. Co., 96 F.3d 803, 807 (6th Cir. 1996) (notice \n     requirements in regulations under the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act); Donato v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., \n     19 F.3d 375, 382-83 (7th Cir. 1994) (same); Straub v. A.P. \n     Green, 38 F.3d 448, 452-53 (9th Cir. 1994) (service of \n     process requirements under Foreign Service Immunities Act). \n     If federal law has been ``followed sufficiently so as to \n     carry out the intent for which [the law] was adopted,'' a \n     defendant is said to have substantially\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\n     complied. Videotronics v. Bend Electronics, 586 F. Supp. 478, \n     484 (D. Nev. 1984).\n       The substantial compliance doctrine is closely related to \n     the de minimis doctrine which refers to a legal violation or \n     harm, ``often but not always trivial, for which the courts do \n     not think a legal remedy should be provided.'' Hessel v. \n     O'Hearn, 977 F.2d 299, 304 (7th Cir. 1992) (citations \n     omitted). See id. (describing substantial performance and de \n     minimis as ``closely related . . . meliorative doctrines''). \n     As is true of the substantial compliance doctrine, \n     ``[w]hether a particular activity is a de minimis deviation \n     from a prescribed standard must, of course, be determined \n     with reference to the purpose of the standard.'' Wisconsin \n     Dept. of Revenue v. Wrigley, 506 U.S. 214, 232 (1992).\n       Whether the substantial compliance doctrine applies in a \n     particular context is an ordinary question of statutory and \n     regulatory interpretation. In some contexts, courts have \n     concluded that there was no room for application of the \n     doctrine. See, e.g., United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, \n     100-102 (1985) (filing requirements of Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act); Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Educ., 470 \n     U.S. 656, 663-64 (1985) (repayment requirements of Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act). In other contexts, where the \n     purpose of a federal enactment may be achieved with \n     substantial compliance, courts have permitted the doctrine's \n     application. See, e.g., Hickel v. Oil Shale Corp., 400 U.S. \n     at 100-02; Kent v. United Omaha Life Ins. Co., 96 F.3d at \n     807; Donato v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 19 F.3d at 382-83; \n     Straub v. A.P. Green, 38 F.3d at, 452-53. Unlike the \n     substantial compliance doctrine, the de minimis doctrine is \n     generally presumed to apply to violations of federal \n     statutes, absent some contrary indication from Congress. See, \n     e.g., Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue v. Wrigley, 506 U.S. at 231.\n       The first question to consider in this case is whether \n     either the substantial compliance doctrine or the de minimis \n     doctrine applies to the WARN Act requirements incorporated by \n     reference in the CAA, specifically the written notice \n     requirements of section 205(a) of the CAA and section \n     639.7(d) of the Board's Interim WARN Act regulations. I \n     conclude that the WARN Act's written notice requirements are \n     best interpreted to allow application of the substantial \n     compliance and de minimis doctrines in cases in which \n     technically deficient written notice has been provided.\n       As explained in the majority opinion, the purpose of the \n     WARN Act is ``to provide workers with adequate advance \n     notification of an employment loss.'' Supra at 6. A WARN Act \n     notice ``provides workers and their families some transition \n     time to adjust to the prospective loss of employment, to seek \n     and obtain alternative jobs and, if necessary, to enter skill \n     training or retraining that will allow these workers to \n     successfully compete in the job market.'' Notice of Adoption \n     of Regulations and Submission for Approval and Issuance of \n     Interim Regulations, 142 Cong. Rec. S271-72 (daily ed. Jan. \n     22, 1996). The regulations require that an employing office \n     provide employees with written notice of several pieces of \n     information, most importantly the date on which that employee \n     will no longer have a job. The superiority of a fully \n     compliant written notice delivered individually is that a \n     writing is best calculated both to convey the information \n     that must be conveyed and to demonstrate beyond question (and \n     litigation) that the required notice has been provided. But \n     there are circumstances in which an omission from the writing \n     will not defeat the purpose of the WARN Act's legal \n     requirements. That purpose is to provide employees with \n     actual notice that they are going to lose their job and when \n     that job loss will take place. Because the purpose of the \n     written notice requirement can be fulfilled when employing \n     offices actually provide affected employees with timely \n     notice of impending job loss, I conclude that both the \n     substantial compliance and the de minimis doctrines are \n     applicable to the WARN Act requirements at issue.2\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Federal courts to have considered the question have \n     implicitly agreed with this conclusion. See supra at 10 \n     (citing and describing cases).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       That brings me to the difficult question of whether the \n     employing office here, the Office of the CAO of the House of \n     Representatives, substantially complied with section 205(a) \n     of the CAA, and section 639.7(d) of the Board's implementing \n     regulations (or, put differently, whether its violation of \n     the legal requirements was de minimis). When a plant or \n     office closing is to occur, the most important questions for \n     employees and their families are whether they are going to \n     lose their jobs and, if so, when. And, although the CAO \n     provided employees with a timely written notice on December \n     13, 1995, it failed to put the most critical information--the \n     date of certain job loss--in that notice. There is no \n     apparent reason for the omission, and the CAO has provided no \n     explanation that makes sense in light of its admitted \n     knowledge of the relevant date. Indeed, the Committee on \n     House Oversight of the House of Representatives appears to \n     have instructed the CAO immediately to provide employees with \n     the required notice of all relevant information, including \n     the date. See supra at 3.3\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ Had the CAO done as the Committee instructed, the CAO \n     would likely have avoided this extended litigation. But I \n     disagree with the majority opinion's suggestion that the \n     actions of the Committee or certain other actions of the CAO \n     on behalf of employees are relevant to the question of the \n     CAO's substantial compliance. The latter actions, i.e., the \n     employee assistance proffered by the CAO, might have been \n     relevant to the CAO's defense of good faith.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Hearing Officer concluded, however, that the CAO had \n     substantially complied with the notice requirements and that \n     the omissions were ``minor''--i.e., de minimis. He first \n     determined that the CAO had provided a written notice, that \n     the written notice contained two of the four items as to \n     which notice is required, and that, as to a third item \n     (bumping rights), the requirement was inapplicable and no \n     notice was required. With respect to the fourth item--notice \n     of the date of job loss--the Hearing Officer determined that \n     the written notice failed to provide that vital date.\n       The Hearing Officer nonetheless determined that the CAO \n     substantially complied with the written notice requirement \n     or, put differently, that any violation was minor or de \n     minimis. He found that: (a) The CAO provided, on September 8, \n     1995, a written notice indicating that employees would lose \n     their jobs due to privatization and stating that \n     privatization was likely to occur by mid-December 1995; (b) \n     The CAO provided on December 13, 1995, a written notice again \n     indicating that employees would lose their jobs due to \n     privatization and that such job loss would occur some time \n     after January 1996; and (c) The CAO convened meetings on \n     December 13, and 14, 1996, at least one of which each \n     employee attended, where the CAO stated repeatedly that \n     February 14, 1996 was the date on which the private \n     contractor would take over House Post Office operations. As \n     to appellant Schmelzer, the Hearing Officer expressly found \n     actual notice of the date of job loss. And as to the \n     appellants in Quick, the Hearing Officer determined that \n     actual notice of the date of job loss was repeatedly given at \n     meetings on December 14, 1996 and that each appellant was \n     present at one of those meetings. The fairest reading of \n     these findings is that the CAO actually provided the Quick \n     appellants with notice of the date of job loss. These factual \n     findings are fully supported on the record.\n       Based on these factual determinations, the Hearing Officer \n     concluded that the CAO substantially complied with the WARN \n     Act's legal requirements, and that, in these unique \n     circumstances, the omissions from the written notice were de \n     minimis. I believe that his legal conclusion, based on the \n     facts, is correct. I therefore concur in the judgment \n     affirming his decision and order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8498-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECONCILIATION SPENDING BILL AND TAX CUT BILL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted for both the spending and tax \nreform bill because I believe they will strengthen our economy and \nprovide needed tax relief for millions of Americans.\n  First and foremost, these bills balance the budget by 2002. This is a \nremarkable testament to the extraordinary health of our Nation's \neconomy.\n  In 1992, just 6 years ago, the budget deficit stood at $290 billion. \nThanks in large part to the economic plan passed in 1993, the budget \ndeficit will decline this year to $45 billion.\n  In 1992, unemployment stood at 7.5 nationwide and 9.6 percent in \nCalifornia. Robust economic growth spurred by responsible economic \npolicy has caused unemployment to decline to historically low levels.\n  This bill cuts taxes for millions of American working families. In \nfact, this bill contains the largest tax decrease in 16 years. These \ntax cuts are directed where they are needed most, at middle class \nworking families, promoting savings for retirement and education. The \n$500 per child tax credit will give parents an extra helping hand in \nproviding for their children. These are tax cuts that I wholeheartedly \nsupport.\n  I am especially pleased that this bill makes important investments in \nhealth care for uninsured children. I believe the $24 billion provided \nin the bill for children's health care may be the most significant \nhealth policy achievement in over 30 years.\n  I am very pleased that the conferees on the Tax Reconciliation bill \nrejected an unwise proposal to raise the Medicare eligibility age. I \nbelieve that retaining health coverage for our senior citizens must \nremain a national priority.\n  Two important priorities of mine were also included in the final \nreconciliation bill. My 401(k) Protection Act, which helps secure the \nretirement savings of millions of Americans will soon become law. \nFinally, I am pleased that the conferees included my Computer Donation \nIncentive Act, which provides tax benefits for the donation of \ncomputers to elementary and high schools.\n  I am proud to support this bill and am confident that it will add to \nthe strong economic growth our Nation has enjoyed over the past six \nyears.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8503-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8504-S8505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n  PENDING NOMINATION OF MARGARET MORROW TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n              JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we adjourn until September, I once again \nnote my dissatisfaction with the lack of progress we have made in \nconfirming the many fine women and men whom President Clinton has \nnominated to the federal judiciary.\n  This year the Senate has confirmed only 9 federal judges before the \nAugust recess during a period of 108 vacancies. Thus, when the Senate \nreturns in September it will remain on the snail-like pace that the \nRepublican leadership has maintained throughout the year of confirming \none judge per month. Meanwhile, vacancies have continued to mount and \nthe delays in filling vacancies continue to grow.\n  It is discouraging to once again have to call attention to the fact \nthat some 40 nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee--\nnominees who have yet to be accorded even a hearing during this \nCongress. Many of these nominations have been pending since the very \nfirst day of this session, having been re-nominated by the President \nafter having been held up during last year's partisan stall. Thus, the \nCommittee has not yet worked through the backlog of nominees left \npending from last year. Several of those pending before the Committee \nhad hearings or were reported favorably last Congress but have been \npassed over so far this year, while the vacancies for which they were \nnominated as long as 27 months ago persist.\n  Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must \nunderstand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of \njustice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot lock \nup criminals if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil \nand criminal cases in the emergency districts, in particular, are \ngrowing taller by the day.\n  I was delighted when the Senate moved promptly on the nomination of \nAlan Gold before the July recess, but his is the only nomination that \nhas been confirmed promptly all year. There is no excuse for the \nSenate's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding \nindividuals as Professor William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, \nJr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. Aiken, \nand Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding \nnominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a \nhearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been reported last \nyear. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have been \npassed over so far this year.\n  We continue to fall farther and farther behind the pace established \nby the 104th Congress. By this time two years ago, Senator Hatch had \nheld seven confirmation hearings involving 31 judicial nominees, and \nthe Senate had proceeded to confirm 26 federal judges. The record this \nyear does not compare: Four hearings instead of seven; nine judges \nconfirmed instead of 26.\n  I recently received a copy of a letter dated July 14, 1997, sent to \nPresident Clinton and the Republican Leader of the Senate by seven \npresidents of national legal associations. These presidents note the \n``looming crisis in the Nation brought on by the extraordinary number \nof vacant federal judicial positions\" and the ``injustice of this \nsituation for all of society.'' They point to ``[d]angerously crowded \ndockets, suspended civil case dockets, burgeoning criminal caseloads, \noverburdened judges, and chronically undermanned courts'' as \ncircumstances that ``undermine our democracy and respect for the \nsupremacy of law.'' I agree with these distinguished leaders that we \nmust without further delay ``devote the time and resources necessary to \nexpedite the selection and confirmation process for federal judicial \nnominees.'' The President is doing his part, having sent us 14 \nnominations in the last two days. The Senate should start doing its \npart.\n  I want to turn briefly to the long pending nomination of Ms. Margaret \nMorrow to be a District Court Judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia. Mr. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this \nyear but May of 1966. She had a confirmation hearing and was \nunanimously reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June \n1996. Her nomination was, thus, first pending before the Senate more \nthan a year ago. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the \nelection year shutdown.\n  She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her \nsecond confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the \nJudiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When \nshe was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported \nwith the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the \nSenate Executive Calendar for more than six weeks and has been passed \nover, again, as the Senate is about to adjourn for a month-long recess.\n  This is an outstanding nominee to the District Court. She is \nexceptionally well qualified to be a Federal judge. I have heard no one \ncontend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial \nringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she \nvoted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years.\n  She has told the Committee:\n\n       I support citizen initiatives, and believe they are an \n     important aspect of our democratic form of government. The \n     1988 article was not meant to be critical of citizen \n     initiatives, but of the lack of procedures designed to \n     eliminate confusion and make clear and relevant information \n     about initiatives available to voters. I was trying to \n     suggest ways in which the initiative process could be \n     strengthened, by communicating more information to the \n     electorate about the substance of initiative measures and by \n     eliminating drafting errors that form the basis for a legal \n     challenge. I believe it important for citizens to obtain as \n     much information as possible respecting any matter on which \n     they cast a vote.\n       I believe the citizen initiative process is clearly \n     constitutional. I also recognize and support the doctrine \n     established in case law that initiative measures are \n     presumptively constitutional, and strongly agree with [the] \n     statement that initiative measures that are constitutional \n     and properly drafted should not be overturned or enjoined by \n     the courts.\n       In passing on the legality of initiative measures, judges \n     should apply the law, not substitute their personal opinion \n     of matters of public policy for the opinion of the \n     electorate.\n       My goal was not to eliminate the need for initiatives. \n     Rather, I was proposing ways to strengthen the initiative \n     process by making it more efficient and less costly, so that \n     it could better serve the purpose for which it was originally \n     intended. At the same time, I was suggesting measures to \n     increase the Legislature's willingness to address issues of \n     concern to ordinary citizens regardless of the views of \n     special interests or campaign contributors. I do not believe \n     these goals are inconsistent.\n       . . . . The reasons that led Governor Johnson to create the \n     initiative process in 1911 are still valid today, and it \n     remains an important aspect of our democratic form of \n     government.\n\n  Does this sound like someone who is anti-democratic? No objective \nevaluation of the record can yield the conclusion that she is anti-\ninitiative. No fair reading of her statements suggests a basis for any \nsuch assertion.\n  She has been forced to respond to questions about particular judicial \ndecisions. I find this especially ironic is light of the Judiciary \nCommittee's questionnaire in which we ask whether anyone involved in \nthe process of selecting the nominee discussed with her ``any specific \ncase, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be \ninterpreted as asking how you would rule on such case, issue, or \nquestion.'' We try to ensure that the Administration imposes no litmus \ntests and does not ask about specific cases--and then some on the \nJudiciary Committee turn around and do exactly that.\n  The Committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert \nBork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that \nwhat is required to be confirmed to the District Court in this \nCongress?\n  With respect to the issue of ``judicial activism,'' we have the \nnominee's views. She told the Committee: ``The specific role of a trial \njudge is to apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the \nSupreme Court and Courts of Appeals. His or her role is not to `make \nlaw.' '' She also noted: ``Given the restrictions of the case and \ncontroversy requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies \navailable, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems \nfacing our society, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job \nof the legislative and executive branches in our constitutional \nstructure.''\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\n  I am appalled at the treatment that Margaret Morrow has received \nbefore the Senate and have spoken about her on the Senate floor on many \noccasions. It is long past time for the Senate to take up this \nnomination, debate it and vote on it. In my view, the Senate should \ncertainly have done so before adjourning for a month-long recess.\n  Margaret Morrow was the first woman President of the California Bar \nAssociation and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar \nAssociation. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is \ncurrently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. \nShe is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and \nby Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican \nAdministration. Representative James Rogan attended her second \nconfirmation hearing to endorse her.\n  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women \ninvolved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive \nand responsible. Her good works should not be punished but commended. \nHer public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve \nthis treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away from \ngovernment service.\n  The President of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the \nPresident of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the President of the Los \nAngeles County Bar Association, the President of the National \nConference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys \nfrom the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: ``Margaret Morrow is \nwidely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both \nparties'' and she ``is exactly the kind of person who should be \nappointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women \nacross the country.'' I could not agree more.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to confirm \nMargaret Morrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two letters to which I have referred \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 14, 1997.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon Trent Lott,\n     The Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Mr. President and Mr. Majority Leader: Among the \n     constitutional responsibilities entrusted to the President \n     and the Senate, none is more essential to the foundation upon \n     which our democracy rests than the appointment of justices \n     and judges to serve at all levels of the federal bench. \n     Notwithstanding the intensely political nature of the \n     process, historically this critical duty has been carried out \n     with bipartisan cooperation to ensure a highly qualified and \n     effective federal judiciary.\n       There is a looming crisis in the Nation brought on by the \n     extraordinary number of vacant federal judicial positions and \n     the resulting problems that are associated with delayed \n     judicial appointments. There are 102 pending judicial \n     vacancies, or 11 percent of the number of authorized judicial \n     positions. A record 24 of these Article III positions have \n     been vacant for more than 18 months. Those courts hardest hit \n     are among the Nation's busiest, for example, the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals has 9 of its 28 positions vacant. At \n     the district court level, six States have unusually high \n     vacancy rates: 10 in California, 8 in Pennsylvania, 6 in New \n     York, 5 in Illinois, and 4 each in Texas and Louisiana.\n       The injustice of this situation for all of society cannot \n     be overstated. Dangerously crowded dockets, suspended civil \n     case dockets, burgeoning criminal caseloads, overburdened \n     judges, and chronically undermanned courts undermine our \n     democracy and respect for the supremacy of law.\n       We, the undersigned representatives of national legal \n     organizations, call upon the President and the Senate to \n     devote the time and resources necessary to expedite the \n     selection and confirmation process for federal judicial \n     nominees. We respectfully urge all participants in the \n     process to move quickly to resolve the issues that have \n     resulted in these numerous and longstanding vacancies in \n     order to preserve the integrity of our justice system.\n\n     N.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We write to you to protest the \n     treatment which one of President Clinton's nominees for the \n     Federal District Court is receiving. We refer to Margaret \n     Morrow, who has been nominated for the United States District \n     Court in the Central District of California. As of today we \n     have been waiting a full year for her confirmation.\n       Margaret Morrow has qualifications which set her apart as \n     one uniquely qualified to be a federal judge. She is a magna \n     cum laude graduate of Bryn Mawr College and a cum laude \n     graduate of Harvard Law School. She has a 23-year career in \n     private practice with an emphasis in complicated commercial \n     and corporate litigation with extensive experience in federal \n     courts. She has received a long list of awards and \n     recognition as a top lawyer in her field, her community and \n     her state.\n       Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges \n     and community leaders of both parties. Many have written to \n     you. Because of her outstanding qualifications and broad \n     support, it is difficult to understand why she has not moved \n     expeditiously through the confirmation process.\n       Margaret Morrow is a leader and role model among women \n     lawyers in California. She was the second woman President of \n     25,000 member Los Angeles Bar Association and the first woman \n     President of the largest mandatory bar association in the \n     country, the 150,000 member State Bar of California.\n       Margaret Morrow is exactly the kind of person who should be \n     appointed to such a position and held up as an example to \n     young women across our country. Instead she is subjected to \n     multiple hearings and seemingly endless rounds of questions, \n     apparently without good reason.\n       We urge you to send a message that exceptionally well \n     qualified women who are community leaders should apply to the \n     U.S. Senate for federal judgships. We urge you to move her \n     nomination to the Senate floor and to act quickly to confirm \n     it.\n\n     Nancy Hoffmeier Zamora, Esq.,\n       President, Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles.\n     Judith Lichtman, Esq.,\n       President, Women's Legal Defense Fund.\n     Karen Nobumoto, Esq.,\n       President, John M.

Mr. President, I am happy to join as a cosponsor to S. \n625, the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1997. This bill enjoys wide \nbipartisan support for the choice that it offers every American when \nchoosing car insurance. Under this bill, families and individuals will \nbe able to exchange the right to bring certain lawsuits for a \nsubstantial savings on their automobile insurance. This bill will allow \nconsumers the right to purchase a low-cost policy that will cover \nmedical bills and lost wages but not pain and suffering damage claims. \nThose policies will also give the purchasers immunity from pain and \nsuffering claims against them. The current State liability systems will \nremain intact as a choice for individuals who would prefer the freedom\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\nto sue and be sued for pain and suffering damages.\n  American taxpayers stand to save a total of $45 billion nationwide. \nThis savings would go directly in the pocket of every insured person at \nno cost to the taxpayers. The Joint Economic Committee has projected \nthat the auto choice option will save Oklahomans $420 million in \nautomobile insurance premiums and will put $186 back into the accounts \nof every person with a car. This is the equivalent of an instant tax \ncut for every insured person.\n  The New York Times stated that with this bill: ``Everyone would win--\nexcept the lawyers'' that live off of the current liability system. In \nfact, trial lawyers take in an estimated $17 billion a year from auto \naccident cases. USA Today reported that 35 cents of every auto premium \ndollar goes to lawyers.\n  This bill has been labeled a ``model of federalism.'' Each State has \nthe right to opt out of auto choice if the State insurance commissioner \nfinds that residents fail to receive at least a 30 percent reduction in \nbodily injury premiums. The State legislature retains the right to \nsimply pass a law against this option and keep its current auto \nliability system.\n  There is mounting evidence that the current auto liability insurance \nsystem has become prey to rampant fraud and abuse, which is constantly \nfed by inflated pain and suffering claims. FBI Director Louis Freeh \nestimated that the average household pays an additional $200 in \nunnecessary premiums just to cover these fraudulent schemes. This hits \nlow income families particularly hard since about one-third of a \nfamily's disposable income is consumed by car insurance costs. Auto \nchoice will put that money back into the pockets of taxpayers to help \npay for needed expenses, providing long-overdue relief to all who \nchoose this option.\n  I am happy to cosponsor this bill and hope that every American with \ncar insurance will be given the opportunity to make this choice to \nprovide long over due relief to all who choose this option. It is time \nfor all drivers to begin to enjoy lower auto premiums and to allow \ngovernment to spend its resources outside of the courtroom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8505-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER PARKING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 85, S. 797.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 797) to amend the John F. Kennedy Center Act to \n     authorize the design and construction of additions to the \n     parking garage and certain site improvements, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 797, the John F. Kennedy Center Parking Improvement Act. \nThis legislation, which will help to address parking and security \nproblems at the Kennedy Center, was approved unanimously by the \nCommittee On Environment and Public Works on June 5 of this year. I \nwant to recognize the bill's cosponsors, Senators Lott, Baucus, \nStevens, and Kennedy, for their valuable assistance.\n  Briefly, Mr. President, this legislation provides authority to the \nKennedy Center Board of Trustees to construct an addition to the \nexisting parking garage at each of the north and south ends of the \nCenter. Importantly, the Congressional Budget Office, in their letter \nof June 11, 1997, wrote that there will be not Federal costs associated \nwith the enactment of S. 797.\n  The garage project will be financed through the issuance of \nindustrial revenue bonds which will be repaid entirely with revenue \nderived from operation of the expanded garage. The bill includes a \nprovision explicitly prohibiting the use of appropriated funds for the \npurpose of constructing or financing the parking garage expansion.\n  Also included in the bill is authorization for the Center to take \naction on site modifications for the improvement of security on the \nsite. The Center has conducted a complete security review, and among \nthe recommendations are changes to the main approach and plaza. This \nlegislation allows the Center to pursue site modifications for the \nprotection of the building and its visitors. The authorization of \nappropriations for this work, the site improvements and modifications, \nis provided by existing law.\n  Consistent with the John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments of 1994, \nthe Center's plans for the garage expansion and other, related site \nimprovements will be developed in close consultation with the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  Mr. President, the legislation reflects the commitment of the Kennedy \nCenter Trustees to continually improve this Presidential monument for \nthe benefit of the public--in a manner that is financially responsible. \nI want to again thank Senators Lott, Baucus, Stevens, and Kennedy, for \ntheir help in drafting this bill. I urge the Senate to adopt this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8506-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8506-S8511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMENDMENT NOS. 1048 THROUGH 1053, EN BLOC\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has an enriched legacy of Hispanic \n     influence in politics, government, economic development, and \n     cultural expression.\n       (2) The Hispanic culture in what is now the United States \n     can be traced to 1528 when a Spanish expedition from Cuba to \n     Florida was shipwrecked on the Texas coast.\n       (3) The Hispanic culture in New Mexico can be traced to \n     1539 when a Spanish Franciscan Friar, Marcos de Niza, and his \n     guide, Estevanico, traveled into present day New Mexico in \n     search of the fabled city of Cibola and made contact with the \n     people of Zuni.\n       (4) The Hispanic influence in New Mexico is particularly \n     dominant and a part of daily living for all the citizens of \n     New Mexico, who are a diverse composite of racial, ethnic, \n     and cultural peoples. Don Juan de Oarte and the first New \n     Mexican families established the first capital in the United \n     States, San Juan de los Cabelleros, in July of 1598.\n       (5) Based on the 1990 census, there are approximately \n     650,000 Hispanics in New Mexico, the majority having roots \n     reaching back ten or more generations.\n       (6) There are an additional 200,000 Hispanics living \n     outside of New Mexico with roots in New Mexico.\n       (7) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center is a living \n     tribute to the Hispanic experience and will provide all \n     citizens of New Mexico, the Southwestern United States, the \n     entire United States, and around the world, an opportunity to \n     learn about, partake in, and enjoy the unique Hispanic \n     culture, and the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will \n     assure that this 400-year old culture is preserved.\n       (8) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will teach, \n     showcase, and share all facets of Hispanic culture, including \n     literature, performing arts, visual arts, culinary arts, and \n     language arts.\n       (9) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will promote a \n     better cross-cultural understanding of the Hispanic culture \n     and the\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\n     contributions of individuals to the society in which we all \n     live.\n       (10) In 1993, the legislature and Governor of New Mexico \n     created the Hispanic Cultural Division as a division within \n     the Office of Cultural Affairs. One of the principal \n     responsibilities of the Hispanic Cultural Division is to \n     oversee the planning, construction, and operation of the New \n     Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (11) The mission of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     is to create a greater appreciation and understanding of \n     Hispanic culture.\n       (12) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will serve as \n     a local, regional, national, and international site for the \n     study and advancement of Hispanic culture, expressing both \n     the rich history and the forward-looking aspirations of \n     Hispanics throughout the world.\n       (13) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will be a \n     Hispanic arts and humanities showcase to display the works of \n     national and international artists, and to provide a venue \n     for educators, scholars, artists, children, elders, and the \n     general public.\n       (14) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will provide a \n     venue for presenting the historic and contemporary \n     representations and achievements of the Hispanic culture.\n       (15) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will sponsor \n     arts and humanities programs, including programs related to \n     visual arts of all forms (including drama, dance, and \n     traditional and contemporary music), research, literary arts, \n     genealogy, oral history, publications, and special events \n     such as, fiestas, culinary arts demonstrations, film video \n     productions, storytelling presentations and education \n     programs.\n       (16) Phase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     complex is scheduled to be completed by August of 1998 and is \n     planned to consist of an art gallery with exhibition space \n     and a museum, administrative offices, a restaurant, a \n     ballroom, a gift shop, an amphitheater, a research and \n     literary arts center, and other components.\n       (17) Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     complex is planned to include a performing arts center \n     (containing a 700-seat theater, a stage house, and a 300-seat \n     film/video theater), a 150-seat black box theater, an art \n     studio building, a culinary arts building, and a research and \n     literary arts building.\n       (18) It is appropriate for the Federal Government to share \n     in the cost of constructing the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n     Center because Congress recognizes that the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center has the potential to be a premier \n     facility for performing arts and a national repository for \n     Hispanic arts and culture.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Center.--The term ``Center'' means the Center for \n     Performing Arts, within the complex known as the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center, which Center for the Performing \n     Arts is a central facility in Phase II of the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center complex.\n       (2) Hispanic cultural division.--The term ``Hispanic \n     Cultural Division'' means the Hispanic Cultural Division of \n     the Office of Cultural Affairs of the State of New Mexico.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (c) Construction of Center.--The Secretary shall award a \n     grant to New Mexico to pay for the Federal share of the costs \n     of the design, construction, furnishing, and equipping of the \n     Center for Performing Arts that will be located at a site to \n     be determined by the Hispanic Cultural Division, within the \n     complex known as the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (d) Grant Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--In order to receive a grant awarded under \n     subsection (c), New Mexico, acting through the Director of \n     the Hispanic Cultural Division--\n       (A) shall submit to the Secretary, within 30 days of the \n     date of enactment of this section, a copy of the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center Program document dated January 1996;

Mr. President, tonight we are passing the Kennedy \nCenter garage bill with an amendment authorizing the the Hispanic \nCultural Center's Performing Arts Center. On a day when we pass the \nmonumental spending bill and a tax cut I am pleased that we are also \nauthorizing this cultural center.\n  We could not be here today passing the cultural center bill if it \nwere not that Senator Chafee was willing to be so helpful to me. He let \nme attach this amendment to the urgently needed legislation for the \nKennedy Center. I want to thank Senator Chafee for his tremendous \ncooperation and legislative skills. I want to thank him for helping \naccomplish a very important project for the State of New Mexico. Next \nyear marks the 400th anniversary of the first Hispanic settlement in \nthe United States and it happened to be located in New Mexico.\n  Many celebrations are planned around the State, but this cultural \ncenter will be a permanent addition and showcase.\n  Mr. President, I am eager to present my colleagues with a wonderful \nplan to honor and perpetuate the Hispanic culture of America. Next \nyear, 1998, is the 400th anniversary of Hispanic presence in New \nMexico. In 1598, Juan de Onate conquered New Mexico and founded the \nsecond city of the United States, San Gabriel de los Espanoles. This \nwas the first permanent Spanish settlement in New Mexico. From New \nMexico, Juan de Onate traveled across the desert to California where he \nfounded San Francisco in 1605.\n  On the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Spanish presence, New \nMexico will be beginning a new era of Spanish pride and cooperation \nwith other cultures. In New Mexico, we are very proud of our cultural \nrelations between the Indian, Spanish, and Anglo people. It is now time \nto pay special tribute to the Spanish people of New Mexico and the \nUnited States.\n  In preparing for the 400th anniversary celebrations, the State of New \nMexico has invested over $17.7 million toward the establishment of \nphase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center. In addition, the \ncity of Albuquerque has donated 10.9 acres and an historic 22,000 \nsquare foot building.\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\n Twelve acres of ``bosque'' land near the Rio Grande have also been \ndonated by the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District. Private \ncontributions are also helping to meet the Hispanic Cultural Center \ngoals.\n  I am asking my colleagues to match these New Mexico contributions \nwith the funds to build the critical Hispanic Performing Arts Center at \nan estimated cost of $17.8 million. I believe the people of New Mexico \nhave done a stellar job in committing their own resources for an art \ngallery, museum, restaurant, ballroom, amphitheater, research center, \nliterary arts center, and other supportive components.\n  To showcase the Hispanic culture in New Mexico for all Americans, the \nHispanic Performing Arts Center is a vital component. Phase II plans \ninclude a 700-seat theater, a stage house, a 300-seat film/video \ncenter, a 150-seat black box theater, an art studio building, a \nculinary art building, and a research and literary arts building. The \nestimated cost of all phase II components is $26 million. By agreeing \nto fund the Hispanic Performing Arts Center, Congress will make a \nsignificant contribution toward the phase II plan.\n  Not counting the land contributions, phase I and phase II design, \nconstruction, equipping, and furnishing is estimated to cost slightly \nmore than $40 million. Major infrastructure components are included in \nboth phases. These include an aqueduct, acequia, and pond from the \nBarelas Drain; parking; a plaza and courtyard, and landscaping.\n  Phase I is now near the bidding stage. The Hispanic Performing Arts \nand Film Arts--the three theaters--are estimated to cost $17.8 million, \nwith necessary equipment--construction: $15.9 million; fixed equipment: \n$1.9 million. The remaining components of phase II are estimated to \ncost $8 million.\n  This multifaceted Hispanic Cultural Center is designed to showcase, \nshare, archive, preserve, and enhance the rich Hispanic culture for \nlocal, regional, and national audiences. It is designed to be a tourist \nattraction as well as a great source of local pride.\n  The Hispanic Cultural Center will be the southernmost facility on a \ncultural corridor that includes the Rio Grande Nature Center, the \nAlbuquerque Aquarium, Botanical Gardens, and the Rio Grande Zoo. \nHistoric Old Town Albuquerque is at the center of this cultural \ncorridor.\n  Antoine Predock of Albuquerque and Pedro Marquez of Santa Fe are the \nproject architects. They have emphasized the inclusion of New Mexico \narchitectural features such as adobe construction--like the existing \nhistoric building used as the administrative center--courtyards, \nportals, cottonwoods for shading, and the irrigation ditches known in \nNew Mexico as ``acequias''. The site is at the corner of Fourth Street \nand Bridge Boulevard in Southwest Albuquerque.\n  Once built, the Hispanic Cultural Center will employ over 100 people. \nTourism dollars are expected to increase in this part of Albuquerque, \nand new ancillary businesses are anticipated to complement and enhance \nthe attractions in the historic Barelas Neighborhood of Albuquerque.\n  The many forms of art, culture, research, performing arts, culinary \narts, literature, and other activities are expected to add important \ncultural connections to the roots of the local and State Hispanic \npeople. Completion of the Hispanic Performing Arts Center will be the \nmajor facility needed to showcase live and filmed Spanish cultural \nevents. A whole new industry of preserving, showcasing, and enhancing \npride in Spanish cultural roots is a vital anticipated benefit of this \nNew Mexico-based Hispanic institution.\n  Visitors are expected from California, New York, Florida, Texas, \nWisconsin, Minnesota, and other States with large Hispanic populations. \nThe New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center and its active Hispanic \nPerforming Arts Center are expected to become nationally known \ntreasures of living Hispanic culture in America.\n  I believe that the Federal funding for the Hispanic Performing Arts \nCenter will be just the perfect contribution to a budding national \ntreasure in its critical formative stages. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the funding for the Hispanic Performing Arts Center in \nAlbuquerque, NM, in honor of the 400th anniversary of Spanish culture, \nand in hopes of seeing the preservation and enhancement of this culture \nflourish into its 500th year.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1049\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a subject that is \nvery important to the people of New Mexico; not just the Hispanic \ncommunity, but people of all ethnicities that value the rich, \nhistorical traditions of our State. Today, I am proud to be co-\nsponsoring with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \nlegislation that will finally make possible the creation of an Hispanic \nCultural Center. The Center has been in the planning stages for many \nyears and, when completed, will be the product of very hard work by \nnumerous people in New Mexico. I would like to thank Senator Domenici \nfor his work and Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee, Senator Bond, and \nSenator Gorton for their efforts to make this Center a reality, and I \ncongratulate them.\n  Mr. President, the United States and New Mexico have enjoyed an \nenriched legacy of Hispanic tradition and culture. New Mexico \nespecially can be proud of strong Hispanic participation in politics, \ngovernment, economic development, and cultural expression. Hispanic \npresence in the United States reaches far back to 1528, and in New \nMexico to 1539. Hispanic influence on our society can be seen all \nacross our state, in our architecture, food, clothing, literature, \nmusic, family tradition, and even the names of many of our towns and \ncities; names like ``Alamogordo,'' ``Raton,'' ``Quemado,'' and \n``Penasco.'' Since the time that Don Juan de Onate first settled New \nMexico in 1598, Hispanic families have been a part of the New Mexico \nlandscape. Today, we can look forward to a Center that will showcase \nthis rich tradition, and it will serve as a living tribute to the \nHispanic experience for all citizens of our Nation.\n  Regrettably, our Federal Government has done too little to recognize \nthat the Hispanic community has been present on this continent for 500 \nyears and has been an integral fiber in our Nation's fabric. The \nHispanic culture has made and continues to make many valuable \ncontributions to our society as a whole. Hispanics make up the fastest \ngrowing minority group in this country. The Census Bureau reports that \nHispanics presently account for 11 percent of our Nation's population, \nand by 2025 it will have accounted for 44 percent of the national \npopulation growth.\n  Certainly, the Center will promote a better understanding of \nHispanics, and, more importantly, will serve as a showcase of how New \nMexico is a place where many cultures, including Anglo, Native \nAmerican, and African American, live and work together in magnificent \nharmony. This legislation is an important first step by our Federal \nGovernment to long-delayed recognition.\n  There is still much work to be done to make this Center a reality, \nhowever. Construction on the facility will begin, and the location of \nthe Center is presently being determined. I strongly encourage all \nconcerned parties to work together to ensure that the spirit of the \nCenter remains intact.\n  Again, Mr. President, on behalf of the people of New Mexico, I thank \nthe distinguished Senators.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1050\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the design, construction, furnishing and \n equipping of a Center for Historically Black Heritage within Florida \n                            A University)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

RELOCATION AND EXPANSION OF HAFFENREFFER MUSEUM OF \n                   ANTHROPOLOGY.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Museum.--The term ``Museum'' means the Haffenreffer \n     Museum of Anthropology at Brown University in Providence, \n     Rhode Island.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (b) Relocation and Expansion of Museum.--The Secretary \n     shall make a grant to Brown University in Providence, Rhode \n     Island, to pay the Federal share of the costs associated with \n     the relocation and expansion of the Museum, including the \n     design, construction, renovation, restoration, furnishing, \n     and equipping of the Museum.\n       (c) Grant Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--To receive a grant under subsection (b), \n     the Museum shall submit to the Secretary a proposal for the \n     use of the grant.\n       (2) Federal share.--The Federal share of the costs \n     described in subsection (b) shall be 20 percent.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $3,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \nconsidering legislation to assist in the relocation and expansion of \nthe Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown University in \nProvidence, RI.\n  In 1955, the family of Rudolf F. Haffenreffer bequeathed to Brown \nUniversity the museum he had founded in Bristol, RI. The museum \nincludes more than 100,000 objects from native peoples of the Americas, \nAfrica, Asia, and the Pacific.\n  This is a teaching museum owned and supported by Brown University. It \nhas a number of world-class holdings that attract scholars from all \nover the globe, and has been described by the American Association of \nMuseums as a ``superb medium- to small-sized facility with outstanding \ncollections, excellent exhibits, and a superb program of public \neducation and outreach.''\n  While maintaining objects from around the world, the Haffenreffer \nMuseum exhibits extensive archaeological materials from New England \nthat are used to interpret prehistoric and historical cultural \ndevelopments in Rhode Island and surrounding States. This legislation \nauthorizes $3 million to preserve these culturally important \ncollections and to provide expanded exhibition space that will make \nthem more accessible to schoolchildren, scholars, students, and other \nvisitors.\n  In 1995, Brown University acquired from the Resolution Trust \nCorporation [RTC] the historic Old Stone Bank building, built in 1854, \nalong with the 1928 Federal-style residence known as the Benoni-Cooke \nHouse, both located in downtown Providence. The RTC took over both \nproperties when the Old Stone Bank failed in 1993.\n  Prior to Brown's purchase of these sites, it was unclear how or \nwhether they would be put to use. The funds authorized by this bill \nwill contribute a modest portion of the estimated $15 million Brown \nUniversity will spend to relocate the Haffenreffer Museum from Bristol, \nRI, to the bank building and the Benoni-Cooke House, both of which are \nlisted on the National Register of Historic Places.\n  Mr. President, this is indeed a win-win project being carried out by \nBrown University. We will renovate, preserve and make fine use of two \nhistoric architectural landmarks--while providing greater access to an \nextraordinary tool for cultural and historical education. This is a \nfine example of the type of assistance our Federal Government can \nprovide to local communities to preserve and make available for future \ngenerations the significant developments of our past.\n  Mr. President, I encourage the support of colleagues.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1052\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. XXX. ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH CENTER.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall award \n     a grant to Juniata College for the construction of an \n     environmental research facilities and structures at Raystown \n     Lake, Pennsylvania.\n       (b) Coordination.--As a condition to receipt of the grant \n     authorized in subsection (a), officials of Juniata College \n     shall coordinate with the Baltimore District of the Army \n     Corps of Engineers.\n       (c) Appropriations Authorized.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated $5,000,000 to carry out this section.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1053\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.

CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has an enriched legacy of Hispanic \n     influence in politics, government, economic development, and \n     cultural expression.\n       (2) The Hispanic culture in what is now the United States \n     can be traced to 1528 when a Spanish expedition from Cuba to \n     Florida was shipwrecked on the Texas coast.\n       (3) The Hispanic culture in New Mexico can be traced to \n     1539 when a Spanish Franciscan Friar, Marcos de Niza, and his \n     guide, Estevanico, traveled into present day New Mexico in \n     search of the fabled city of Cibola and made contact with the \n     people of Zuni.\n       (4) The Hispanic influence in New Mexico is particularly \n     dominant and a part of daily living for all the citizens of \n     New Mexico, who are a diverse composite of racial, ethnic, \n     and cultural peoples. Don Juan de Oarte and the first New \n     Mexican families established the first capital in the United \n     States, San Juan de los Cabelleros, in July of 1598.\n       (5) Based on the 1990 census, there are approximately \n     650,000 Hispanics in New Mexico, the majority having roots \n     reaching back ten or more generations.\n       (6) There are an additional 200,000 Hispanics living \n     outside of New Mexico with roots in New Mexico.\n       (7) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center is a living \n     tribute to the Hispanic experience and will provide all \n     citizens of New Mexico, the Southwestern United States, the \n     entire United States, and around the world, an opportunity to \n     learn about, partake in, and enjoy the unique Hispanic \n     culture, and the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will \n     assure that this 400-year old culture is preserved.\n       (8) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will teach, \n     showcase, and share all facets of Hispanic culture, including \n     literature, performing arts, visual arts, culinary arts, and \n     language arts.\n       (9) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will promote a \n     better cross-cultural understanding of the Hispanic culture \n     and the contributions of individuals to the society in which \n     we all live.\n       (10) In 1993, the legislature and Governor of New Mexico \n     created the Hispanic Cultural Division as a division within \n     the Office of Cultural Affairs. One of the principal \n     responsibilities of the Hispanic Cultural Division is to \n     oversee the planning, construction, and operation of the New \n     Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (11) The mission of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     is to create a greater appreciation and understanding of \n     Hispanic culture.\n       (12) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will serve as \n     a local, regional, national, and international site for the \n     study and advancement of Hispanic culture, expressing both \n     the rich history and the forward-looking aspirations of \n     Hispanics throughout the world.\n       (13) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will be a \n     Hispanic arts and humanities showcase to display the works of \n     national and international artists, and to provide a venue \n     for educators, scholars, artists, children, elders, and the \n     general public.\n       (14) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will provide a \n     venue for presenting the historic and contemporary \n     representations and achievements of the Hispanic culture.\n       (15) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will sponsor \n     arts and humanities programs, including programs related to \n     visual arts of all forms (including drama, dance, and \n     traditional and contemporary music), research, literary arts, \n     genealogy, oral history, publications, and special events \n     such as, fiestas, culinary arts demonstrations, film video \n     productions, storytelling presentations and education \n     programs.\n       (16) Phase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     complex is scheduled to be completed by August of 1998 and is \n     planned to consist of an art gallery with exhibition space \n     and a museum, administrative offices, a restaurant, a \n     ballroom, a gift shop, an amphitheater, a research and \n     literary arts center, and other components.\n       (17) Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     complex is planned to include a performing arts center \n     (containing a 700-seat theater, a stage house, and a 300-seat \n     film/video theater), a 150-seat black box theater, an art \n     studio building, a culinary arts building, and a research and \n     literary arts building.\n       (18) It is appropriate for the Federal Government to share \n     in the cost of constructing the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n     Center because Congress recognizes that the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center has the potential to be a premier \n     facility for performing arts and a national repository for \n     Hispanic arts and culture.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Center.--The term ``Center'' means the Center for \n     Performing Arts, within the complex known as the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center, which Center for the Performing \n     Arts is a central facility in Phase II of the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center complex.\n       (2) Hispanic cultural division.--The term ``Hispanic \n     Cultural Division'' means the Hispanic Cultural Division of \n     the Office of Cultural Affairs of the State of New Mexico.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (c) Construction of Center.--The Secretary shall award a \n     grant to New Mexico to pay for the Federal share of the costs \n     of the design, construction, furnishing, and equipping of the \n     Center for Performing Arts that will be located at a site to \n     be determined by the Hispanic Cultural Division, within the \n     complex known as the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (d) Grant Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--In order to receive a grant awarded under \n     subsection (c), New Mexico, acting through the Director of \n     the Hispanic Cultural Division--\n       (A) shall submit to the Secretary, within 30 days of the \n     date of enactment of this section, a copy of the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center Program document dated January 1996;

and\n       (D) that the contract for the construction of the Center--\n       (i) shall be awarded pursuant to a competitive bidding \n     process; and\n       (ii) shall be awarded not later than 3 months after the \n     solicitation for bids for the construction of the Center.\n       (3) Federal share.--The Federal share of the costs \n     described in subsection (c) shall be 50 percent.\n       (4) Non-federal share.--The non-Federal share of the costs \n     described in subsection (c) shall be in cash or in kind \n     fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. \n     The non-Federal share shall include any contribution received \n     by New Mexico for the design, construction, furnishing, or \n     equipping of Phase I or Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic \n     Cultural Center complex prior to the date of enactment of \n     this section.

Mr. President, I rise to speak today with respect to a \ndevelopment which has occurred by an act of omission rather than \ncommission on the part of the Secretary of State.\n  As the President I am sure is aware, for approximately 10 years \nAmerican citizens have had passport restrictions which have prevented \nthem from being able to travel to the country of Lebanon. The way the \nprocess works is, at various intervals--most recently at 6-month \nintervals--this ``travel ban,'' as it is referred to, was back before \nthe Secretary of State for renewal, and it has continued to be renewed \nfor additional 6-month periods for quite some time. The 6-month period \nexpired as of the 1st of August. This Secretary of State decided, after \nmuch consideration of the merits of these issues, not to extend the \ntravel ban further.\n  I want to rise today--I have had a chance to be on the floor in \nmorning business prior to this--to both commend the Secretary of State \nfor her difficult situation and to applaud her courage in making this \ndecision. This was a very controversial issue. It is one that both this \nSecretary of State and her predecessors have had to look at hard and \nlong because, obviously, there is a need to balance, on the one hand, \nthe security interests of United States citizens who might travel to \nLebanon and, on the other hand, both humanitarian as well as economic \nconsiderations of those who had a desire to make such trips.\n  I believe the Secretary of State made the right decision. For a \nvariety of reasons, Americans need to be able to travel to Lebanon. \nThey need to be able to travel there freely. First and foremost is the \nneed for families to be able to reunify. Many American citizens of \nLebanese ancestry have close relatives who are in Lebanon and are not \nable to visit them because of this travel ban.\n  For economic reasons it makes sense for the travel ban to have been \nlifted. The fact is that Lebanon is in a very successful rebuilding \nperiod, and that rebuilding process has included many foreign nations \nwho have come to Lebanon's aid and many foreign companies who have \ntaken advantage of the opportunities to rebuild the phone and utilities \nand other systems of the country. American companies have not been able \nto do that. Mr. President, they have missed an opportunity to create \njobs and to create opportunities here at home as well as in Lebanon. By \nlifting the ban that opportunity is now available again.\n  Another argument for lifting the ban which I found very compelling \nwas the argument that it is important from the standpoint of the Middle \nEast stability for the United States to be engaged in Lebanon. In \nrecent years, Lebanon has found itself occupied by numerous foreign \nforces. During that timeframe, it has not been able to look to the \nWest, and particularly to the United States, for help and assistance in \nthe process of moving the direction of economic growth and democratic \nprinciples.\n  Having a greater United States role in Lebanon, I think, will make it \neasier for Lebanon to be become once again a fully independent and \nfully sovereign nation and to see all foreign forces leave that \ncountry. So for all of these reasons, the lifting of this ban comes at \nthe right time. It is the right choice.\n  Arrayed against these, as I said, are units with security concerns. \nThe fact is that there are many countries in the world today that are \nno safer to travel to than Lebanon but in which case there is no travel \nban. There are travel advisories. The Secretary of State will be \nissuing that type of travel advisory to make sure that Americans \nunderstand the risks involved. Indeed, I would like to put on the \nrecord my own strong observation that there are risks to Americans to \ntravel there. It is not yet the case that one can go to Lebanon without \nbeing aware of the mind flow, of the potential problems that might \nexist there, particularly in certain parts of the country, for American \ntravelers.\n  At the same time we have numerous countries in the world where such \nrisks exist. I believe a travel advisory is the proper way in which to \naddress it rather than an outright travel ban.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, as I say, I think the \nSecretary of State has done the right thing. I hope that Americans will \nonce again get to know Lebanon and that the relationship that once \nexisted between our countries, which was a very close and warm \nrelationship, can be built once more.\n  I would also like to conclude by congratulating the Lebanese people. \nThis travel ban being lifted is in no small measure a result of the \nefforts on the part of the Lebanese Government and the Lebanese people \nto address the security concerns which we have had. A variety of \nactions have already taken place. A number of further commitments were \nmade in the process of discussing the renewal of this ban. I believe \nthat Prime Minister Hariri and the Government of Lebanon are prepared \nto live up to those commitments\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\nfully and completely. As they do, I believe they will ensure that the \ndecision made by the Secretary of State was the right one.\n  So for these reasons, I would like to commend once again the \nSecretary of State. I would like to commend the Lebanese Government and \nthe people of Lebanon. I would like to urge our colleagues to keep \ntheir eye on Lebanon and to look for other ways by which we can build a \nstrong relationship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take the floor tonight to discuss a \nresolution that I have introduced with Senator Warner to permit \nindividuals with disabilities full access to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. I believe that this resolution will be approved later tonight \nand has been reviewed by both the majority and the minority. I \nanticipate that it will be incorporated into the final business of the \nU.S. Senate during the wrap-up session before the session formally \nconcludes.\n  Mr. President, this resolution that I offer tonight will close the \nbook on discrimination against individuals with disabilities on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Earlier this year, after a visually impaired professional on my staff \nwas barred from bringing her guide dog onto the floor, the Senate \nadopted a resolution providing for temporary case-by-case entry to the \nfloor for those professionals with disabilities. This was a good step--\nan important step. But it still left some room for discrimination.\n  The resolution that will be considered by the Senate tonight will \nensure that as a matter of formal Senate rule there is no \ndiscrimination permitted against individuals with disabilities. There \nwill no longer be a double standard in the U.S. Senate. Senate staffers \nwith disabilities who have the privilege of the Senate floor will be \npermitted to bring onto the Senate floor supporting aids and services \nsuch as canes, service dogs, interpreters, or assistive devices.\n  This is an important day for the Senate, for people with \ndisabilities, and for our whole country because it makes clear that the \nU.S. Congress ought to follow the laws that apply to everyone else in \nour country.\n  I especially want, Mr. President, to recognize the hard work of the \nchairman of the Rules Committee, Senator John Warner, in moving this \nresolution forward. As every Member of this body knows, he has an \nenormous workload. He was extremely gracious to me in working to \ndevelop this resolution and gain bipartisan support for it.\n  I would also like to pay a special tribute to the senior Senator from \nthe State of West Virginia, Senator Byrd, whose expert knowledge of the \nSenate rules was of enormous benefit in drafting this new resolution.\n  As a relatively new Senator, I have great esteem for the constant \ncare which Senator Byrd uses to guard the traditions and prerogatives \nof this body. I am of the view that every U.S. Senator owes a debt of \ngratitude to the Senator from West Virginia for his constant vigilance \nwith respect to ensuring the rights of all on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, this is an important resolution. It is justice long \noverdue. Earlier this year, a congressional fellow in my office was \ndenied access to the Senate floor because she uses a guide dog. That \nguide dog is a working dog; a guide dog that serves as the eyes for a \nvisually impaired person. The people of this country were offended, and \nthey sent a message that this type of discrimination is unacceptable to \nthem.\n  My office, like many others in the U.S. Senate, were inundated with \ncalls, mail, and e-mail.\n  There was one letter I received that recounted a bit of history that \nI would like to briefly share.\n  The letter that was sent to me told a story about the Senate in the \n1930s when there were some Members who disapproved of a guide dog \ncoming onto the Senate floor. The individual then who needed the \nassistance of the guide dog was Senator Schall of Minnesota. The letter \ndescribed the Senator's first entry into the Chamber with his guide dog \nand how the other Senators rose, one by one, and then in large numbers \napplauded him. The Senate galleries followed suit until the whole \nSenate was just one gigantic standing ovation.\n  The letter goes on to say that Senator Schall stopped by his seat, \nturned and listened to the ovation from all around him and was touched \nas the ovation continued and continued. Waving to the crowd, the \nSenator took his seat and commanded his guide dog, Lux, to lie down. \nThe guide dog then curled up under the Senator's desk, tucking his body \nso it would not be in the way of any Senator who passed by. The May 22, \n1933, issue of the Congressional Record documents how strongly the \nAmerican public reacted to the news of the death of Senator Schall's \nguide dog. The guide dog died after being separated a few days from the \nSenator when he thought it would be inappropriate to take the dog with \nhim to attend the funeral of another Senator. Senator Schall said then:\n\n       Mr. President, since the death of my good dog, Lux, last \n     March, the mails of this and other countries have brought me \n     hundreds of letters of regret. So many expressions of \n     interest have gladdened and surprised me.\n\n  It seems to me that the action that the Senate will take shortly \nmakes it clear that we have not forgotten how important it is to stand \nfor the principle of equal justice in this Chamber. What we do each day \nis set an example, and here particularly an important example, because \nas a result of the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Congressional \nAccountability Act, and other statutes, we make clear that the laws of \nthe United States are going to apply in this Chamber.\n  As a result of this resolution, and particularly the extremely \nhelpful work that Senator Warner and Senator Byrd have done, it is \ngoing to be possible to have a formal Senate rule that ensures that \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities is not going to be \ntolerated on this floor.\n  This rule takes the generally accepted definition of an individual \nwith a disability, defined as one who has a physical or mental \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life \nactivities of such individual, and says it is not possible to \ndiscriminate against that individual in this Chamber.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to observe that there are 49 \nmillion Americans with a disabilities. Under the law, they are \nguaranteed the same rights as all other Americans in terms of access to \njobs, insurance, transportation, and telecommunications technology. \nThey are not guaranteed special treatment. They are guaranteed just \nequal access. That is what this resolution is all about, equal access.\n  Finally, Mr. President, many lessons have been learned from this \nexperience. I believe that the Senate and our country are more aware \nand sensitive to the many issues facing individuals with disabilities. \nWe have seen that rules can and should be updated to meet the changing \nneeds of our society. I believe that the Senate and our country as a \nwhole are better off as a result of the consideration of this \nresolution and the strong bipartisan support that has developed here \nand in our country.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an important day for the Senate, a \ngood day for the Senate, because it was a day which ensures that our \ncountry is a bit more fair, a bit more sensitive to the needs of those \nwith disabilities. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwho have helped me so much, particularly Senators Warner and Byrd.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Byrd, Reid, \nKerry, Chafee, Akaka, Kennedy, Murray, Bingaman, Murkowski, Feingold, \nHatch, Durbin, and Harkin be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8512-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8512-S8513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONDEMNATION OF JERUSALEM BOMBING\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday, while thousands of innocent men, \nwomen and children shopped in Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem, the \npeace of that sunny afternoon was shattered when two bombs filled with \nscrews and nails detonated. Fifteen people were killed, close to 200 \npersons\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\nwere injured. Later that day, the Israeli Cabinet voted to break off \nall contact with the Palestinian Authority, jeopardizing hopes that had \nsoared just days ago when Israelis and Palestinians had agreed to \nresume peace talks for the first time since March.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of the peace process, and there \nis no doubt in anyone's mind that this is a complicated issue and peace \nwill only be secured after prolonged negotiations and compromises on \nboth sides. No one expects it to be easy.\n  However, the first step simply must be to end the violence. Terrorist \nacts such as yesterday's bombing simply cannot be tolerated. There is \nno reason, no excuse, no possible justification for killing innocent \ncivilians shopping in a street market. It is an act of terrorism, \nnothing more, nothing less.\n  Peace cannot be secured until the citizens of the Middle East are \ncertain that they are safe. They will not feel safe until they trust \neach other, and they will not trust each other until their actions \nmatch their words and deeds. Yasser Arafat said he condemns these \nterrorists. He said it is an act against the peace process. Yet, it is \nmore than likely that a known terrorist group detonated those bombs in \nthe market. These terrorist groups have never had to account for their \nviolent deeds.\n  The Palestinian Authority must match its words of condemnation with \nacts. It must take tangible steps to increase security activity and \nsecurity cooperation. It must be committed to bringing those who are \nresponsible for this unconscionable act of terrorism to justice. Only \nwhen it is clear that these acts of terrorism will no longer be \ntolerated will they cease. Only when they cease can we take another \nstep down that very long road to peace.\n  I extend my condolences to the families of those who were killed. It \nis my sincere hope it is the last time that the people of Israel and \nthe people of Palestine will endure the suffering and fear that \nterrorist acts bring.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8512-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8513-S8515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RESULTS OF BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, for the first time since 1969, \nCongress has balanced the budget. This is not just a victory for \nCongress. This is a victory for the American people.\n  I am reminded of a term that is used in science known as ``vector \naddition.'' Simply stated, it says that you subtract forces working \nagainst one another and you add forces working with one another.\n  While I am not here to talk about science or math, my point is that \nwe diminish our collective energy when we work against each other, but \nwe expand our ability to help everyone when we work together. When we \nset aside our differences, we are stronger as a Nation and stronger as \na people. By working together we move forward, and that means that \neverybody wins.\n  Mr. President, the American people are winners today because of the \nspirit of cooperation that went into the tax relief and spending \nreduction bills, a credit to the leadership of President Clinton, the \nleadership of the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth and Senator Moynihan, and the leadership of the Budget \nCommittee chairman, Senator Domenici, and the ranking Democrat, Senator \nLautenberg.\n  Mr. President, this is people-oriented legislation, and I am pleased \nto be able to say that it is bipartisan legislation that invests in our \nchildren and in their futures. It achieves fiscal responsibility while \nat the same time it is socially fair. It improves health for children \nand health care for the elderly. It takes at least a small step toward \nrebuilding our Nation's crumbling schools and a much larger step toward \nexpanding opportunities for our children to attend college.\n  Most importantly of all, we are providing real tax relief for \nAmerican families. For the first years of the new century we will see \nin this country a balanced budget again for the first time in a \ngeneration.\n  This legislative victory did not come without sacrifice. The \nfoundation for today's achievement was had in 1993 when Congress, by \nthe narrowest of margins, enacted the highly successful 1993 deficit \nreduction legislation that has already brought down the Federal deficit \nfrom over $280 billion to about $65 billion, or perhaps even lower, \nthis year. Critics argued at the time that the bill would plunge our \ncountry into a recession, that it would stoke inflation, and that it \nwould throw hundreds of thousands of people out of work. A few of our \nsenatorial colleagues who supported the bill later lost their elections \nbecause of that support. Those Members of Congress chose statesmanship \nover politics, and today I think it is important to pay tribute to \ntheir foresight.\n  The legislation that we passed this afternoon builds on what we \nachieved in 1993. It nonetheless represents an enormous accomplishment, \none in which every American can take justifiable pride. The United \nStates is once again leading the way to get its fiscal house in order \nwhile investing in families, children and in students and in economic \ngrowth. By contrast, in Europe, deficits in many countries as a \npercentage of their gross domestic product are triple what ours is--and \neven higher--and they have no solution in sight. Again, I believe that \nwe have shown the way to achieve fiscal responsibility and social \nfairness to the world.\n  As a Member of the Senate Finance Committee, I am pleased that this \nbill reflects a number of my own particular priorities. First, it helps \nyoung college graduates to repay their student loans by making the \ninterest deductible once again. We all know how rapidly college costs \nhave increased and are increasing and how many students start out their \nworking careers with huge debts, huge student loan debts. The proposal \nthat Senator Grassley and I worked together on will make a real \ndifference to graduates as they begin to start their careers to begin \ntheir families. They will be able to deduct the interest on those \nloans. And given sometimes that those loans can be as high as $80,000 \nand $90,000, this should be a benefit to young people who want to \npursue education.\n  Second, the bill contains a version of the proposal that I offered in \nthe Senate that will help to create new economic activity and new jobs \nat thousands of abandoned commercial and industrial sites around the \nworld.\n  There are all too many brownfields sites in our communities, property \nthat had formerly been used by business but which has become \nenvironmentally contaminated or polluted and then abandoned. By \nallowing those individuals who want to clean up these polluted areas \nand use them for new businesses, by allowing them to expense the costs \nof their environmental cleanup rather than having to capitalize those \ncosts over a period of years, it will create a brand new incentive to \nbring this property back into the economic mainstream, to create jobs, \nto clean up the environment, and to restore and reclaim parts of our \ncommunities all over this country.\n  Third, this bill will begin to address a problem that I have spoken \nabout on the Senate floor many times, the crumbling schools around \nAmerica. Since I have come to the Senate, I have worked to forge a new \nFederal and State and local partnership to rebuild our Nation's \ncrumbling schools. We cannot lift our kids up if our schools are \nfalling down, and I am pleased that this bill has taken the first step \nin that direction by creating a new category of no-interest bonds for \ncommunities to use to rehabilitate their schools. High poverty \ndistricts will be able to issue $800,000 in bonds to repair their \nschools, to pay for new teacher training, new equipment purchases and \nother expenses needed for revitalization of educational facilities.\n  I think that is an important step in the right direction. It does not \nbegin to do all that we need to do, but it is a step.\n  The bill also increases the small issuer arbitrage rebate exemption \nfor certain school facilities funds which provide some small rural \nschools with relief from the burdensome administrative requirements \nassociated with the issuance of tax-free bonds. And so everybody wins \nunder this approach to rebuilding the schools. Although these \nproposals, frankly, are dwarfed by the $112 billion in school \nconstruction need\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\nthat the General Accounting Office has documented for us, I think these \ntwo provisions send a message that Congress believes there is a Federal \nrole for rebuilding our Nation's schools and for cooperating and \nsupporting State and local governments in their efforts. This is not \nabout interfering with local control in any way. We just want to begin \nto engage as a national community to provide support for States and \nlocal governments to do what they deem appropriate in terms of giving \nour young people the educational facilities they need in which to \nlearn.\n  I believe it is inexcusable that in our country, the wealthiest \nnation in the world, every day 14 million children go to schools with \nbroken windows, leaking pipes and overcrowded rooms, and I appreciate \nthe leadership that is being demonstrated in this area.\n  I look forward to continue with Congressman Rangel on the House side, \nwho made this one of his top priorities. I look forward to working with \nhim and my other colleagues to create a true partnership among the \nFederal, State, and local governments, again, to get our school \nfacilities in shape, to bring them up to code and to give our young \npeople the kinds of facilities that they deserve for a 21st century \neducation.\n  I want to take particular note, also, of the changes that were made \nto the proposal for the $500-per-child tax credit. This portion of the \nbill provides real help to hard-working American families, and I am \nparticularly pleased that millions of families with incomes as low as \n$18,000 a year, families who pay thousands of dollars in payroll taxes \nbut who have little or no income tax liability, they will now be able \nto take advantage of the $500-per-child tax credit. Those low-income \nfamilies are doing exactly what everyone says they should do. They are \nworking hard and they are paying taxes. They deserve this tax relief, \nand I am very pleased that, at the insistence of President Clinton, \nthey will receive it as part of the compromise achieved in this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  In addition, this bill takes many other steps to expand opportunity \nand economic growth. The Hope Scholarship will provide families with a \ntuition tax credit to help families carry the burdens of college costs. \nAfter the first 2 years of college, a tax credit of 20 percent of \ncollege tuition costs up to $10,000 annually will be available to \nstudents and their families. Moreover, employers' ability to deduct the \nemployees' college tuition will be preserved in this legislation. That \nis an important kind of incentive, I think, to keep for our country.\n  Lastly, students will not be forced to pay taxes on the scholarships \nand fellowships they receive for their hard work. I, again, believe \nthese are positive steps in the right direction.\n  The bill further ensures that children will no longer have to go \nwithout adequate health care. The bill contains the single largest \ninvestment in health care for children since the passage of Medicaid in \n1965. It invests an unprecedented $24 billion to provide meaningful \nhealth coverage for almost half of the Nation's uninsured children.\n  At the same time, the bill also protects something called EPSDT. That \nstands for Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Testing, which is \nvery important in terms of the quality of service provided for \nchildren, eye and ear examinations and the like. It preserves a basic \nlevel of benefits and services for children under Medicaid, the \nMedicaid Program, and gives States the additional flexibility at the \nsame time to assure that those children are covered with health \ninsurance for the entire year, as opposed to the trend that we see now \nin which they come on and go off of the Medicaid Program. So children \nwill have more insurance because of this bill that we passed this \nafternoon than they have ever enjoyed in this country before. I think \nthat is important.\n  Turning to the Medicare Program for seniors, I, like many other \nMembers, had reservations, frankly, about the bill that we initially \npassed out of the Senate. I was one of the two members of the Senate \nFinance Committee who did not vote for the means testing or the age \nchanges or the copayments on Medicare, simply because we had not looked \nat the issues enough, and because I think those changes simply shifted \nthe program costs to beneficiaries rather than truly protecting \nMedicare. More important, rather than allowing us to bring more people \ninto health coverage, it was pushing people out of the health care \nsystem.\n  I am pleased we have not rushed to judgment in terms of changing \nMedicare, because, again, we should be moving in the direction of \nproviding universal coverage and coverage for seniors that is \ncomprehensive instead of cutting away arbitrarily and making arbitrary \nchanges. So the commission in this bill will allow us to take up the \ndebate of what changes should be made over the long haul to preserve \nthe long-term solvency of Medicare so we can pass on to the next \ngeneration of Americans at least as much, in terms of health coverage, \nas we in our time inherited from the last generation of decisionmakers. \nI think that is our obligation here.\n  I am pleased, also, that this legislation no longer includes the \nprovisions to charge income-related part B premiums, increase the \nMedicaid eligibility age, nor charge seniors who prefer a home setting \nas opposed to institutionalization a $5-per-visit home health care \ncopayment. These are vitally important improvements on the legislation. \nWhile many Members on both sides of the aisle disagree, I believe, \nagain, we need to take this up, to have a public debate about what \nchanges are appropriate before we rush to judgment in regards to that.\n  The conference agreement also makes major improvements in the \nMedicare managed care payment rate changes. While I continue to believe \nthat moving to a 50-percent national/50-percent local payment rate \nblend moves too far away from recognizing local cost differentials, \nguaranteeing a minimum payment update is a marked improvement over the \noriginal provisions as they even came out of our committee. So, again, \nthe conference agreement strikes a more equitable balance between \nencouraging managed care growth in rural areas and underserved areas \nand not undermining the existing managed care enrollment.\n  The legislation also retains a number of important aspects from the \noriginal Senate bill, including prevention services, if you will, \ncoverage of diabetes self-management training, colorectal cancer \nscreening, mammography screens without the deductible requirement. We \nhad to fight and raise the point that the deductible on mammograms was \nabsolutely inappropriate, so the investment in mammograms without \ndeductibles will benefit an additional 2 million women.\n  Again, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine shows \nthat a copayment causes a threefold dropoff in the number of women \ngetting mammograms. So, providing this screening without deductible is \nvitally important to the health of American women.\n  My praise for this legislation does not mean that I do not continue \nto have some major concerns about certain aspects of the bill. There \nare several non-worker-friendly provisions that I believe move \ncompletely in the wrong direction. One of those provisions has to do \nwith overruling of the court decision in the Pennington case, which \ncame out of my State of Illinois. Despite our success in stripping the \npreemption from the original Senate bill, the conferees have decided to \nrestore it. I think that is unfortunate. But it is an issue that was \nfolded in this legislation, and, again, the benefits of the bill \nweighed against these changes are something we will have to take up \nseparately. So, while we did not Byrd-rule the issue on Pennington at \nthis time, I understand there is legislation that I strongly will \nsupport in regards to that issue of unemployment compensation and \nsecurity.\n  The agreement also punts on the long-term Medicare solvency issue. \nAgain, the commission will have to take up that issue. I look forward \nto their deliberation.\n  One last thing having to do with my State specifically, and those \nparts of the country that we like to call the heartland. We were very \ninterested in the ethanol tax credit. Ethanol has an important place in \nour energy future in this country. I believe we should be aggressively \nmoving to promote its use. This legislation kind of keeps the ethanol \ntax treatment the same way that it is currently, instead of extending \nit into the future in ways that I thought would have been more \nappropriate.\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\n There were a number of us--in fact, 70 Members of the Senate voted for \nthe more extensive treatment and support for ethanol. Again, that came \nout in the conference and that is regrettable. But we will continue to \nfight this fight on behalf of ethanol. I have every expectation and \nconfidence that we will be successful in the long run.\n  There are a lot of other provisions such as capital gains and estate \ntax provisions that I have not taken the time to discuss here today. I \nwill not take the additional time to do so now. Instead, I just want to \nmake it clear that I strongly supported the overall bill and the \nbipartisan approach that made it possible. It was that cooperation, \nthat coming together, that building on our strength with the view and \nthe interests of all the American people, that allowed us to have this \nvictory today.\n  We did the right thing for America's children. We did the right thing \nfor America's students, our families, and we are doing the right thing \nfor the next generation of Americans. Achieving fiscal responsibility \nand social fairness simultaneously is something that many thought could \nnot happen. We have done it with this legislation that we passed, and I \nthink every Member of this body who voted for it has reason to be proud \nof the work of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \ntwo young people who served on my staff through all the long hours and \ndifficult days of the last year.\n  After I was elected majority leader, the next morning at 9 o'clock, I \nwas in the majority leader's office, but I only had about a third or \nhalf of the staff that I needed. I had some interns from my State of \nMississippi, some college students, who had been working with me just \nthrough the summer. I asked them to stay and help us, and they have \nbeen with me the last year.\n  They filled positions that are very vital. They did a great job.\n  Dan Dukes of Como, MS, has been like my alter ego. He has been with \nme throughout the day and, on occasions, when I had to go downtown, he \nhas just done a fantastic job.\n  He has been my personal assistant, shepherding my appointments, \nfinding my lost notebooks, and keeping up with my headlong dashes from \nmeeting to meeting.\n  Dan has had the patience of a saint and the attention to detail of a \nseasoned Hill staffer. It is an understatement to say that I will miss \nhim as he returns home to finish his studies at the University of the \nSouth in Sewanee, TN.\n  This is one of those occasions when we say goodbye to a young man \nwith every expectation that we will be seeing him often--and hearing \nabout him too. I have the same feeling about him as I once had about a \nyoungster on my staff by the name of Chip Pickering, who now represents \nthe Third District of our State.\n  I want to express to him publicly my appreciation for filling in the \nway he did and doing a great job.\n  I also want to recognize Celeste Embrey of Southaven, MS, who has \nbeen one of the two receptionists in my front office who answered the \nthousands of calls that have come in, some of them not always very \ncomplimentary. She has done it with just charm and grace. In fact, she \ndoes just a great job that the President of pro tempore, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, comes by to check on her several times each week \nto make sure she is doing all right. She appreciates that, and I \nappreciate that.\n  Even my colleagues who do not know her by name know well her \nunfailing smile, her enthusiastic greeting, her ability to make \neveryone feel at home.\n  If you have enjoyed the atmosphere of true southern hospitality in my \noffice, you have Celeste to thank. But you cannot fully appreciate what \nshe has done for us until you overhear her conversations with callers--\nwhether from Mississippi or around the country.\n  She has always dealt with their questions and handled their \ncomplaints with a concern and patience that go well beyond the call of \nduty.\n  Celeste is off to graduate school, and though there will soon be \nanother person at her desk in my outer office, there will still be a \nvoid in our staff. I will have to get her new phone number so that any \nof us who miss the brightness of her welcome and the cheer of her voice \ncan keep in close touch.\n  Dan and Celeste are the kind of young people who keep up our faith in \nthe rising generation. I am proud of them. I hope they will always be \nproud to have been part of the Lott team.\n  I want to say to these two very fine young people, I really \nappreciate their work. I am proud of them, and I wish them Godspeed in \nwhatever they do in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8515-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATIONS TO REMAIN IN STATUS QUO\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Dave \nNakdimen, an outstanding newsman, who retired after a wonderful career \nin television news.\n  Dave served the Louisville area for 36 years on WAVE television news.\n  Dave was born in London, KY, and became interested in journalism by \nlistening to the radio at an early age. After years of listening to \npolitical news and election-night returns, Dave decided to study \njournalism at the University of Kentucky. After graduation in 1955, he \ntook a job as a sports writer with the Lexington Leader. While working \nin Lexington, he met his future wife, Wanda, who was moving to \nLouisville to take a job at a local hospital. After they became \nengaged, they packed their bags and headed to Louisville, where Dave \nlanded a job at WAVE-TV. The rest is history.\n  WAVE was his first job in broadcast media. Dave was assigned to cover \ncity hall, and there he met and interviewed some of the most important \nmen and women in the last half of this century. Dave covered the civil \nrights movement of the 1960's, where he interviewed Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. during an open-housing march. He also interviewed Ronald \nReagan, George Bush, David Brinkley, John Wayne, and countless other \nmemorable personalities.\n  Dave won't be resting during his retirement, though; he's returning \nto WAVE-TV after a brief vacation to produce weekly commentaries for \nthe station's 6 o'clock newscasts. When asked by the the Courier-\nJournal if he would repeat his experience in journalism, Mr. Nakdimen \nresponded: ``I think so. I really enjoyed it. It was a lot of hard \nwork, but it was a lot of fun, too.'' Dave's colleagues also remember \nhim fondly. Kathy Beck, the news director at WAVE-TV, said Dave is ``a \nman of great integrity'' throughout the news world.\n  All those who know Dave know that he gives his endeavors his all. He \nis a deacon at his church, and he shows intense faithfulness in \nsupporting his beloved University of Kentucky Wildcat\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\nbasketball team. Dave's retirement means he will be able to do more of \nthe things he loves, including spending time with his wife, Wanda, and \nhis daughter, Suzanne.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in paying \ntribute to the career of Dave Nakdimen. It surely has been a memorable \none.\n  Mr. President, in the world of television news it is extremely \ndifficult to develop expertise in covering politics. Most of the \npolitical reporters that we deal with who are really talented in \ncovering what the occupant of the Chair and myself do everyday tend to \nbe in print journalism.\n  There is one real exception to that: Dave Nakdimen. Dave was the only \nexpert political reporter I ever met in local television. He had a \ndistinguished career. We will all miss him greatly. He is a man of \ngreat principle, a personal friend. I remember meeting him when I was \nin my twenties sitting in the office of a local official in Jefferson \nCounty, that is, Louisville, KY. He was doing his job then. He is a \nsuperb individual, a fine man with deep religious convictions who will \nbe missed in the reporting of political news in my hometown.\n  Mr. President, I wish Dave Nakdimen well in his retirement years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from The Courier-Journal be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, July 11, 1997]\n\n              WAVE's Nakdimen Is Retiring After 3 Decades\n\n                            (By Tom Dorsey)\n\n       Today is the last day on the job for WAVE reporter Dave \n     Nakdimen after 36 years.\n       ``I plopped down here in 1961 and have been in the same \n     spot ever since,'' said Nakdimen. The soft-spoken journalist \n     with the dry sense of humor has been a fixture on the local \n     TV scene.\n       ``He's a wonderful guy and clever writer,'' said WAVE \n     colleague Jackie Hays. ``If I had a question on anything--but \n     especially politics--I knew he'd know the answer.''\n       Nekdimen, 64, probably holds the record for the most years \n     as a TV reporter in Louisville.\n       He remembers covering political races in which candidates \n     ran as segregationist. He recalls interviewing the Rev. Dr. \n     Martin Luther King Jr. during an open-housing march in the \n     '60s.\n       After the interview Nakdimen discovered that the sound \n     system wasn't working. ``So when King came around the block \n     again, we asked him if he'd do the interview over and he was \n     nice enough to do it.''\n       On another day Nakdimen was assigned to do one of those \n     worst-intersection-in-town stories.\n       ``As I was standing there shooting the film, an accident \n     happened right in front of me that perfectly illustrated the \n     traffic problem,'' Nakdimen said. ``I ran back to the station \n     knowing what a great story I had, opened the camera and found \n     there was no film in it.''\n       Most days went better than that for the man who was born in \n     St. Charles, Va. He grew up in London, Ky., listening to \n     election-night returns and political conventions on radio.\n       That's what got him interested in the news. When he \n     graduated from London High School, he went on to study \n     journalism at the University of Kentucky, where he graduated \n     in 1955.\n       His first job was writing sports for the Lexington Leader, \n     the former afternoon newspaper. He almost connected with a \n     job at The Courier-Journal. Along the way he became engaged \n     to his future wife, Wanda. She was a nurse who was taking a \n     job in Louisville, so he found one here too.\n       ``WAVE (radio and TV) was looking for somebody to cover \n     City Hall,'' he said. ``I had never worked a day on radio or \n     TV in my life, but I decided to take a shot at it.''\n       The rest is history--36 years of it on the job and in the \n     marriage.\n       The first two weeks on the job, he met David Brinkley and \n     Ronald Reagan. ``It was fun to talk with John Wayne, sit down \n     with George Bush or chase Hubert Humphrey around,'' he said.\n       But there were other stories, too, many of them tragic. ``I \n     think the Standard Gravure (1989 shootings) stands out in my \n     mind as the story I will never forget.'' The 1974 tornado \n     that ravaged large parts of Louisville is a close second.\n       What's changed the most about TV news?\n       ``Oh, it's the technology without a doubt,'' Nakdimen said. \n     When he began working at WAVE, stories were covered with a \n     Polaroid camera. Film came along a few years later, but it \n     was grainy black and white.\n       ``Color followed, then small, live cameras and satellites \n     and now digital television is on the way,'' Nakdimen said.\n       ``There's so much production to a TV newscast today, \n     especially with the emphasis on live coverage.'' It's a far \n     cry from the news he saw as a boy in London.\n       Nakdimen Remembers NBC's John Cameron Swayze and CBS' \n     Douglas Edwards doing 15-minute nightly newscasts in \n     television's early days. ``They just sat in front of a camera \n     and read the news; it was pretty much radio on TV,'' he said.\n       In many ways the last 36 years has zipped by like a tape on \n     fast-forward. But Nakdimen won't be leaving it all behind.\n       ``I'll still be doing a once-a-week commentary for WAVE and \n     some political and election analysis to keep my hand in,'' he \n     said.\n       Would Nakdimen do those 36 years over again?\n       ``I think so. I really enjoyed it. It was a lot of hard \n     work, but it was a lot of fun too.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8515-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8516-S8519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators \non both sides of the aisle, as we have cleared these lists. When we get \nthrough today, we hope to have cleared most of the Executive Calendar. \nWe have some that are still being held for matching nominations, some \nreservations on both sides. But when we get through here, I believe we \nwill have cleared all that is on the calendar, except maybe those that \nhave just been reported today and maybe just eight or nine others that \nwe are still working on.\n  I appreciate, again, the support that we have had from Senators on \nboth sides and from the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar: Nos. 121 through 127, 133, 134, 166 through 170, \n171, 172, 173, 174, 175 through 178, 179, 182 through 185, 201, 203, \n204, 205 through 223, 225 through 232, and all nominations placed on \nthe Secretary's desk in the Foreign Service.\n  I finally ask consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of George Munoz, to be president \nof OPIC. I understand that before the Senate confirms the above \nnominations, there are several Senators who may like to speak.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements \nrelating to the nominations appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  I might note, Mr. President, we are still trying to clear some other \nnominations. There may be another opportunity before the night is over \nto clear some other nominations. Some of these nominations did not \nactually get reported from the committees until today. We are \nscrambling to try to see if we can get them confirmed so they can begin \ntheir service during the August recess. Therefore, that completes my \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I first \nwant to commend the distinguished majority leader for his work in \nhelping us clear the Executive Calendar.\n  There is a lot of work done with this unanimous consent request. And \nwe have attempted to work together to do as much as is possible. I \nregret, frankly, that there are still a number of nominees, as the \nmajority leader has mentioned, that are not covered by this unanimous-\nconsent request. And I am hopeful that over the next few hours we may \nstill allow for the confirmation of a number of those who are still \npending.\n  As the leader indicated, some of those were just reported out of \ncommittee today. I guess most particularly, Mr. President, I am \nconcerned that there are a number of judicial nominees that have been \non the calendar for many, many months. And I\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\nhope that we can reach some accommodation with regard to those nominees \nas well.\n  It has been requested of me, and I am happy to do so, that we would \nask unanimous consent that the majority leader's request be amended to \ninclude the four other judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar and \nthe five that were reported from the Judiciary Committee today. That \nwould complete our work with regard to the judicial committee \nnominations. Many of those, as I said, have been pending now for a long \nperiod of time. And it would mean a good deal to a lot of Members, and \ncertainly to the families of these judicial nominees, if they could be \nincluded. And so I ask unanimous consent at this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have to object to that request. But I note \nto the Senator from South Dakota--again, I understand why he would need \nto make that request. And I appreciate his cooperation. I observe that \nwe have moved several judges in this group of nominations, some of them \nthat have been pending literally back to last year, including some \ncircuit judges, and that there are only four remaining that are on the \ncalendar. I think we can maybe clear some more, one or two more of \nthose early when we come back in session.\n  I think a couple of them, we may have to call them up and have a \nvote. I am prepared to call them up and have debate and a vote on them \nas we did with regard to Mr. Klein at the Justice Department. I think \nthat these holds can only last so long. And we have to call them up and \nhave a vote one way or the other.\n  The other nominations were only reported today. I think there are \nseveral of them that we can do quickly. A couple of them I know there \nis no problem with, but there are some others we just have not had a \nchance to discuss with the chairman and run them through our hotline \nand get them cleared. But we will be down to very few of these judges. \nAnd I hope to keep moving along as they come out of committee, \nincluding the ones that we moved here today. I believe they included \nthe four I mentioned, and maybe there is one other one in sort of a \nunique category that we did approve. But we will keep working on it. \nAnd something more may even happen before the night is out. We will see \nhow that goes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just respond very briefly, I \njust say to the majority leader, I understand his explanation. And I \nwill not object to the unanimous-consent request because obviously this \nis a great deal of work on the Executive Calendar. And I appreciate his \ncooperation on those for which he can be helpful.\n  I say that there are a large number of nominees that are still \npending in committee. And it will be our desire to clear the committees \nof the pending nominations as well when we return following the August \nrecess. And I intend to work with the leader and with our chairmen to \nensure that they all are provided the opportunity to be considered and \nthen ultimately confirmed on the Senate floor. I hope we can do that. \nAnd I have had the assurances by the majority leader that it is his \nintention as well when we return. I look forward to working with him to \nmake that happen.\n  So I will not object.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for doing that. I do note that we had \n10 pages of nominations. When the night is over, those that were on the \ncalendar will be down to one page. And some of those have holds on both \nsides of the aisle. We are still working on trying to move those. So I \nappreciate your cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of Jane Garvey's \nconfirmation as Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration \n[FAA]. It is our responsibility to move forward with this nominee now. \nThe Administration waited at least 7 months to name a successor to \nformer FAA Administrator David Hinson. We cannot afford to let this \ncritical safety post remain vacant any longer.\n  Ms. Garvey will be the first FAA Administrator to serve in the five-\nyear term we established in last year's FAA reauthorization bill. The \nresponsibilities and the challenges she faces are daunting. Ms. Garvey \nneeds our full support in meeting these challenges head-on. Both she \nand the traveling public deserve no less.\n  My reservations about Ms. Garvey's abilities are no secret. Her only \nreal aviation experience is a 2-year stint as director of the Boston \nLogan airport. It is almost unfair for the Administration to have \nthrust Ms. Garvey into such a highly accountable safety position \nwithout requisite aviation expertise. Ms. Garvey's principal area of \nexpertise is surface transportation. Representatives from the highway \nsector praise her several years of public service, both at the \nMassachusetts Department of Public Works and as Assistant Administrator \nof the Federal Highway Administration.\n  In both of these positions, Ms. Garvey had responsibilities \nassociated with the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project in \nBoston. This may be a project that is now proceeding according to \nschedule, and within revised budget estimates. Let us not forget, \nthough, that the cost estimates for the project have been revised from \nan estimated $2 billion to a cost that exceeds $10 billion. Federal \ntaxpayers, of course, are picking up most of the tab. I do not hold Ms. \nGarvey entirely responsible for this boondoggle. Neither do I think she \ncan distance herself entirely from this monument to pork-barrel \npolitics.\n  Ms. Garvey's involvement in this project holds particular \nsignificance in light of the history of mismanagement of large \nacquisition projects at the FAA.\n  I, obviously cannot, nor do I intend to, credit Ms. Garvey with any \nof these problems at the FAA. I simply make the point that her \nassociation with the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project is not \na ringing endorsement of her ability to manage large FAA acquisition \nprograms within budget.\n  Much of the FAA's misfortune has been attributed to the culture of \nits bureaucracy. Ms. Garvey receives high marks for her superior \nmanagement abilities. Perhaps she is just the breath of fresh air we \nneed at the FAA, to make sure that the Agency remains the premier \naviation safety Agency in the world.\n  Again, I wish Ms. Garvey every success, and I pledge to do whatever I \ncan to support her in her new role. I urge that we move forward \nexpeditiously in confirming Ms. Garvey as the next FAA Administrator.\n  I want to assure Ms. Garvey that the Commerce Committee and the \nAviation Subcommittee will be watching very carefully and closely, \nbecause she does not come to this job highly qualified, and that was \nmade clear during her hearings. I believe the President of the United \nStates has the ability to nominate people he wants for important \npositions. I believe, therefore, that we should move forward \nexpeditiously with Ms. Garvey's nomination. At the same time, I have \ngrave and severe reservations. And, also, at the same time, I will do \neverything I can to see that she succeeds in her new and most daunting \ntask.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Jane Garvey's \nconfirmation as Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration \n[FAA].\n  As the new FAA Administrator, Ms. Garvey is facing significant \nchallenges. These challenges include ensuring that air travel is safe, \nthat the modernization of the air traffic control system is done on \ntime and on budget, and that airport development keeps pace with the \nexpected significant increases in passengers and cargo. Ms. Garvey also \nfaces a significant challenge to independently assess aviation funding \nneeds, and to speak out as to what the true needs are.\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\n  We are counting on Ms. Garvey to provide strong leadership. Many \npositive statements have been made about her tenure at the Federal \nHighway Administration, and about her outstanding management skills and \nstrong financial experience. These qualities will serve Ms. Garvey well \nin running the FAA, and in working with the Congress.\n  I have heard a great deal about the need to change how things are \ndone at the FAA, and some of Ms. Garvey's past accomplishments indicate \nthat she is up to the task. I understand that one of her most \nnoteworthy accomplishments at the Federal Highway Administration was to \nhelp implement innovative financing options to accelerate completion of \nhighway projects and to leverage federal funds. Through her efforts, \nunnecessary restrictions were cleared away, and program flexibility was \nprovided that allowed good ideas to be introduced. Such actions show \nthat she can look beyond business as usual, and see opportunities to \nmake improvements. Such creativity is needed at the FAA.\n  I am sure that no one needs to be reminded that aviation safety is \nthe paramount responsibility of the FAA. I expect Ms. Garvey to take \nwhatever reasonable action is necessary to see that the FAA is \nproactive, and makes whatever changes are needed before, not after, an \nairline accident occurs. The public expects and deserves nothing less.\n  Ms. Garvey will be the first FAA Administrator to have a fixed 5-year \nterm. The Congress established this term so that the FAA would have the \ncontinuity and direction that its complex, technical, and costly \nprograms require. Ms. Garvey has made a public commitment that she will \nstay for the full 5 years of her term. I would encourage her to keep \nthis commitment.\n  I look forward to working with Ms. Garvey to address the needs of the \nnation's aviation system, and to see that it continues to be the \nsafest, most efficient system in the world. I wish Ms. Garvey great \nsuccess. I would join with Senator McCain in urging this body to \nquickly confirm Ms. Garvey as the next Administrator of the FAA. Thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nPresident's nomination of a new Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration [FAA], Ms. Jane Garvey. We have waited several months \nfor this nomination, and I want to thank my distinguished colleague and \nChairman, Senator McCain, for bringing Ms. Garvey's nomination up for a \nvote so expeditiously.\n  I want to point out Ms. Garvey's impressive public service record. \nShe has held several important positions with both State and Federal \nGovernments. I find it encouraging to find someone with Ms. Garvey's \nleadership capabilities dedicating her career to public service. All \ntoo often society's best and brightest leave public service for more \nlucrative pursuits. But with Ms. Garvey, we have one of the best making \na significant contribution for the good of the public. I applaud Ms. \nGarvey for that.\n  Ms. Garvey comes to us after receiving high marks for her work as \nDeputy Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. During her \ntenure, Ms. Garvey has demonstrated that she is an impressive leader. \nThis nation deserves a nominee like Ms. Garvey to lead the FAA.\n  The FAA's job is to safely operate the national air system. When it \ncomes to safety, there is always room for improvement. Improving the \nsystem is a monumental task, and Ms. Garvey certainly has her work cut \nout for her.\n  The FAA also plays an important role in developing and promoting \nairport development. Airport development is a critical component in \npromoting the growth of aviation. In my home state of South Carolina, \nthe economic impact of aviation statewide is more than $3 billion. The \ntravel and tourism industry is the State's second largest employer. \nWithout modern airports, the economy in South Carolina--and in every \nother state--suffers. Infrastructure development fuels travel and \ntourism and enables communities to attract new business to all of South \nCarolina.\n  Because of Ms. Garvey's extensive background at the highway \ndepartment, I expect she will bring creativity and ingenuity to the \nAirport Improvement Program. The program is a critical component of our \nnation's transportation infrastructure, and I am enthusiastic about Ms. \nGarvey's ability to manage this program well.\n  I want to conclude by commending the people at the FAA. All day, \nevery day, they ensure that millions of Americans reach their \ndestinations safely. But the system needs to be modernized, and it \nneeds to be done well. I look forward to working with Ms. Garvey and \nSecretary of Transportation Slater over the next several years, as we \nmove toward improving the safety of our entire transportation network.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve Ms. Garvey as Administrator for the \nFederal Aviation Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8516-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8519-S8520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JANE GARVEY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on June 24, I had the privilege of \nintroducing Ms. Jane Garvey of Massachusetts to the Senate Commerce \nCommittee as President Clinton's nominee to be the next administrator \nof the Federal Aviation Administration. On that day I proclaimed that \nshe has the experience, the intellect and the management skills \nnecessary to prepare the FAA for the challenges of the 21st Century.\n  Since my introduction, the Chairman and other members of this \nCommittee have put forth questions, both verbally and in writing, on a \nrange of issues pertaining to Ms. Garvey's past experience and to the \nimportant challenges facing the FAA. In my view, her answers have, \nindeed, borne out my glowing introduction and have demonstrated beyond \nany doubt that she will be an excellent FAA Administrator. Indeed, Ms. \nGarvey s nomination comes to the floor with the unanimous support of \nthe Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. President, the challenges before the FAA are enormous. Among \nother matters, the next Administrator will need to effectively \nmodernize the nation's air traffic control system to keep pace with \nAmerica's growing air travel needs. She will also be charged with \nefficiently procuring and deploying the next generation of explosive \ndetection equipment to protect our nation's citizens from rogue \nelements who seek to indiscriminately harm air travelers. Action on \nthese and other matters are essential to ensuring the safety and \nsecurity of all American citizens. To address these matters and guide \nthe world's largest aviation agency into the 21st Century, the \nPresident sought a strong and capable leader with proven and tested \nmanagement skills. In my view, the President could not have made a \nbetter choice.\n  Jane Garvey has long been recognized in Massachusetts and in \nWashington as a top-quality public servant with superior management \nskills. Jane Garvey directed the Massachusetts Department of Public \nWorks, the 8th largest state highway program in the nation, where she \nsupervised the state's multibillion-dollar highway construction \nprogram. Jane Garvey also served as Massachusetts Director of Aviation, \nmanaging airport operations at Logan Airport in Boston and directing \nthe planning of Logan's $1 billion modernization. Upon coming to \nWashington where Jane has been Deputy and Acting Administrator of the \nFederal Highway Administration, Jane supervised an agency with a $20 \nbillion dollar budget and offices in every state. At each step in her \nimpressive career, Jane Garvey has received praise from government and \nindustry officials alike. In my view, there can be no doubt that Jane \nGarvey has the vision and proven administrative experience to manage \nthe FAA.\n  However, aside from her managerial expertise, Jane Garvey has also \ndeveloped a reputation for putting safety first. Over the past four \nyears, Jane Garvey has been a recognized leader in moving safety to the \ntop of Federal Highway's agenda. Hazardous highway-rail grade crossings \nare being eliminated; truck safety standards are being upgraded; and \ninfrastructure investments and high-tech intelligent transportation \nsystems are emphasizing safety first. In fact, as Massachusetts \nDirector of Aviation, Jane oversaw the deployment of prototype safety \nsystems to prevent runway collisions and a communications center that \nintegrated operations with safety and weather information. Jane Garvey \nhas\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\nconsistently made public safety her highest priority, and she will take \nthis commitment to safety with her to the FAA. She is the best choice \nto ensure that our nation's passenger air system remains the world's \nsafest as air traffic continues to increase.\n  Finally, Jane Garvey understands the value and promise of technology. \nShe presently oversees nearly a half-billion dollars annually in \nFederal Highway technology research and development including the \ndeployment of intelligent transportation systems that apply advanced \ncomputer and communications technologies to travel. At Logan Airport, \nJane Garvey managed the deployment of modernized air traffic control \nsystems and made the airport a testing ground for such innovative \ntechnologies as radar-linked runway-guide guard lights and converging \nrunway display aids.\n  Jane Garvey's management experience combined with her understanding \nof emerging technologies will enable the FAA to deploy cutting-edge \ntechnologies on time and within its budget, and will help the FAA to \ndeploy the air-traffic control systems and safety improvements \nnecessary to support our nation s growing air travel needs.\n  Mr. President, I submit to you that above all else, a vote for Jane \nGarvey to be the next FAA Administrator is a vote for superior \nmanagement and an unwavering commitment to public safety. I urge my \ncolleagues to unanimously support this nomination.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the President's \nnomination of a new Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration [FAA], Ms. Jane Garvey. Ms. Garvey comes to us with over \na decade of distinguished public service.\n  From 1991 to 1993, Ms. Garvey served as director of aviation for the \nMassachusetts Port Authority. Before that, Ms. Garvey served as the \ncommissioner and associate commissioner for the Massachusetts \nDepartment of Public Works from 1983 to 1991. Ms. Garvey's experience \nin public office is impressive. That experience will prove invaluable \nin her ability to manage a complex agency like the FAA.\n  Over the last several years, Linda Daschle and David Hinson worked \nhard to change the direction of the FAA. Ms. Garvey, if confirmed, will \nneed to continue those efforts. Ms. Garvey comes to this position as a \nproven manager with outstanding leadership skills. She will need those \nskills to navigate the FAA through some choppy waters over the next 5 \nyears.\n  During the confirmation hearing, the chairman expressed concern about \nMs. Garvey's involvement with the cost overruns for the central artery/\nthird harbor tunnel project in Boston. I want to take a moment to \naddress the chairman's concerns. Let me suggest that, from what we have \nbeen able to piece together, Ms. Garvey took several proactive steps to \ntry and keep that project within budget. First and foremost, a \nsignificant reason for the cost overrun is because of inflation. The \noriginal cost estimate of $2.6 billion was based on 1982 dollars, \nwhich, at the time, was a standard method for calculating project costs \nat FHWA. The project is now expected to be completed at $10.4 billion. \nOf that increase, approximately $4.1 billion is a result of inflation.\n  The scope of the project has changed over the past 15 years as well. \nThe total cost of the project now includes several new interchanges, \nadditional pavement work, bridge work, in addition to the cost of \nrelocating a toll plaza. Many of these items were not funded by the \nhighway administration, but were still included in the total cost of \nthe project. Ms. Garvey has noted that, as deputy administrator for \nFHWA, these additional costs would not be borne by the Federal \nGovernment--the State of Massachusetts must assume these costs.\n  It strikes me that--from what the committee has been able to gather--\nthat Ms. Garvey has been proactive in trying to contain the costs of \nthis project. For example, Ms. Garvey, while deputy at FHWA, imposed \ncaps that limited Federal spending on this project. This is the kind of \nproactive leadership we need to ensure that Federal resources are used \nwisely.\n\n  I believe Ms. Garvey's experience with the central artery project \nwill help her manage the sizable effort now underway at the FAA to \nmodernize the air traffic control system. These are large, complex \nefforts, similar in scope to the central artery/third harbor tunnel \nproject. One of those efforts is the replacement of several critical \nair traffic control computer systems. This effort must run smoothly and \nwithin budget, and the nominee's leadership will provide much needed \nguidance in achieving this critical objective.\n  Another FAA effort will be the transition to a global positioning \nsystem [GPS]. By moving to GPS, the industry expects to save billions \nof dollars every year from more efficient navigation. Like replacing \nthe air traffic control systems, the transition to GPS must also be \nmanaged smoothly. I expect Ms. Garvey's dedication and leadership will \nhelp FAA succeed in this effort.\n  Let us also not forget the critical role FAA plays in ensuring that \nair transportation remains the safest way to travel. Every day, 365 \ndays a year, thousands of aircraft make their way safely thanks in part \nto the nationals air traffic control system. The FAA manages this \nsystem admirably, but there is always room for improvement. I \nanticipate Ms. Garvey will bring her ingenuity and creativity to the \ntask of improving safety. If approved, I pledge to work with Ms. Garvey \nto make air travel as safe as it can be.\n  I know Secretary Slater holds a similar philosophy on safety--and I \nalso know Ms. Garvey and Mr. Slater have an excellent working \nrelationship. By working together, I expect the team of Slater and \nGarvey to effectively manage a safe and efficient national air system.\n  Ms. Garvey comes to us having won high marks as Deputy Director for \nthe Highway Administration. Those who worked with her at the Agency and \nthose from outside the Agency all credit Ms. Garvey with strong \nleadership, dedication, and ingenuity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n\n              STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF ERIC L. CLAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I delighted that the majority leader has \ndecided to take up the nomination of Eric L. Clay to be a U.S. Circuit \nJudge for the Sixth Circuit. Mr. Clay is a well-qualified nominee.\n  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the \nSenate on May 22, 1997. The sixth circuit desperately needs Eric Clay \nto help manage its growing backlog of cases. In fact, the sixth circuit \nhas three vacancies, two of which have been designated judicial \nemergencies by the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  We first received Eric Clay's nomination in March 1996. He was \naccorded a hearing in the last Congress on March 26, 1996, and was \nreported by Judiciary Committee to the full Senate on April 25, 1996. \nUnfortunately, his nomination was never acted upon because of the \nPresidential election year slowdown of judicial confirmations in 1996.\n  The President renominated Eric Clay on the first day of this Congress \nfor the same vacancy on the sixth circuit, which vacancy has existed \nsince September 1994. This is one of the judicial emergency vacancies \nthat we should have filled last year. This vacancy has persisted for \nmore than 2\\1/2\\ years. He has the support of both Senators from \nMichigan, a Republican and a Democrat. He had a confirmation hearing on \nMay 7 and the committee considered and unanimously reported his \nnomination to the Senate 2 weeks later. This important nomination was \nheld without action on the Senate Executive Calendar for over 2 months \nby the Republican leadership.\n  I am delighted for Mr. Clay and his family that his nomination is \nfinally being confirmed and am confident that he will make a fine \nmember of the sixth circuit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8519-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8520-S8521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF ARTHUR GAJARSA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Majority Leader has \ndecided to take up the nomination of Arthur Gajarsa to be a United \nStates Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit. Mr. Gajarsa is a well-\nqualified nominee.\n  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the \nSenate on May 22, 1997. The Federal Circuit desperately needs Arthur \nGajarsa to help manage its growing backlog of cases.\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\n  We first received Arthur Gajarsa's nomination in April 1996. He was \naccorded a hearing in the last Congress on June 25, 1996, and was \nunanimously reported by Judiciary Committee to the full Senate 2 days \nlater. Unfortunately, his nomination was never acted upon because of \nthe Presidential election year shutdown of judicial confirmations in \n1996.\n  The President renominated Arthur Gajarsa on the first day of this \nCongress for the same vacancy on the Federal Circuit, which vacancy has \nexisted since November 1995. This vacancy has persisted for more than \n1\\1/2\\ years. He has the support of both Senators from Maryland. He had \na confirmation hearing on May 7 and the Committee considered and \nunanimously reported his nomination to the Senate 2 weeks later. This \nnomination has been pending on the Senate Calendar since May 22. \nApparently, after these 2 months on the Senate Executive Calendar \nwithout action or any explanation for its inaction, the Republican \nleadership is prepared to allow the Senate to approve this nomination.\n  I am delighted for Mr. Gajarsa and his family that he is finally \nbeing confirmed. He will make a fine judge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8520-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8521-S8523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF THOMAS W. THRASH, JR.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has \ndecided to take up the nomination of Thomas W. Thrash, Jr., to be a \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia. Mr. \nThrash is a well-qualified nominee.\n  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the \nSenate on May 22, 1997. The Northern District of Georgia Sixth Circuit \ndesperately needs Thomas Thrash to help manage its growing backlog of \ncases.\n  We first received Thomas Thrash's nomination in May 1996. He was \naccorded a hearing last Congress on July 31, 1996, but his nomination \nfell victim to the Presidential election year confirmation shutdown of \n1996. The President renominated him on the first day of this Congress \nfor the same vacancy on the District Court for the Northern District of \nGeorgia, which vacancy has existed since March 1996. He had a \nconfirmation hearing on May 7 where he was supported by both Senator \nCleland and Senator Coverdell and was reported to the Senate by the \nJudiciary Committee 2 weeks later. This is another of the nominations \nthat has languished on the Senate Executive Calendar since long before \nthe July 4 recess. I am glad that the Republican leadership has allowed \nthis nomination to go forward. I congratulate Mr. Thrash and his family \non his confirmation.\n\n\n              Statement of the Nomination of Philip Lader\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Mr. Philip Lader to \nbe Ambassador. Philip Lader is a man of integrity and honor whom I hold \nin high esteem. He has a deep respect for the British people and their \nbeautiful country. I know that he, along with his wife Linda, and their \ntwo young daughters Mary Catherine and Whittaker will represent the \nUnited States well at the Court of St. James and will make us all very \nproud.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the confirmation of \nMr. Philip Lader to be the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom of \nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland. I have known Mr. Lader and his \nfamily for years, and I believe he will work hard to maintain and \nstrengthen the long and valuable friendship between our two nations.\n  Although he was born in New York, and was educated at Duke \nUniversity, the University of Michigan, Harvard, and Oxford, Mr. Lader \nhas called South Carolina home for many years. It is in South Carolina \nwhere he established himself as a leader in business and education. He \nwas associated for 10 years with Sea Pines Co., a developer and \noperator of award-winning recreational communities on Hilton Head \nIsland. In addition, he has held the following business positions: \npresident of Business Executives for National Security; founding \ndirector of the South Carolina Jobs/Economic Development Authority; \ndirector of First Union National Bank (S.C.) and First Carolina Bank; \ndirector of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce; chairman of the \nSouth Carolina Governor's Council on Small and Minority Business; and a \nmember of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee's Travel and Tourism \nAdvisory Committee. In 1981, he founded Renaissance Weekend, a family \nretreat for innovative leaders.\n  In education, he served as president of Winthrop College in Rock \nHill, SC, from 1983 to 1985. During his tenure, Winthrop was awarded \nthe National Gold Medal for general improvements in programs. \nAcademically, he has served as chairman of the South Carolina Rhodes \nScholarship Committee, trustee of three colleges, and director of the \nAlumni Association at Duke University. He has taught courses at many \nuniversities and has been awarded honorary doctorates by five \ninstitutions.\n  Mr. President, for the past several years, Phil Lader has been \nutilizing his business skills in the U.S. Government. He most recently \nserved as Administrator of the Small Business Administration. Prior to \nthat, he was Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Chief of \nStaff. He has also been Deputy Director for Management at the Office of \nManagement and Budget and has been chairman of the National Performance \nReview's Policy Committee, the President's Management Council, and the \nPresident's Council on Integrity and Efficiency. In addition, he has \nserved on the National Economic Council, the President's Export \nCouncil, the Community Empowerment Board, and the Board of Governors of \nthe American Red Cross. Currently, he is a member of the Council on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. President, all of the business, academic, and Government \nexperience that I have just described are tremendous assets Mr. Lader \nwill bring to the Court of St. James. However, Mr. Lader has even more \nto offer this position, both professionally and personally. \nProfessionally, he was executive vice president of Sir James \nGoldsmith's U.S. holding company, which was responsible for the \nanalysis and sales of lands previously owned by Crown Zellerbach and \nDiamond International Corporations. He was also president of Bond \nUniversity, the first private university in Australia, a British \nCommonwealth nation.\n  Personally, the Lader family has strong ties to the United Kingdom, \nparticularly England and Scotland. He studied English constitutional \nhistory at Oxford University and is an Honorary Fellow of Pembroke \nCollege at Oxford. Further, the ancestors of his lovely wife, Linda, \nemigrated from Henley-on-Thames, just west of London. In fact, her late \nstepmother, Catherine Marshall, was the author of ``A Man Called \nPeter,'' the biography of her husband, the Scottish Presbyterian \nMinister Peter Marshall, who served as the U.S. Senate Chaplain from \n1947 until his death in 1949. Mrs. Lader is a trustee of the American \nUniversity in London.\n  Phil Lader is a man of integrity and honor, whom I hold in high \nesteem. He has a deep respect for the British people and their \nbeautiful country. I know that he, along with his wife Linda and their \ntwo young daughters, Mary Catherine and Whittaker, will represent the \nUnited States well at the Court of St. James and will make us all very \nproud.\n  Mr. President, I reiterate my strong support for the confirmation of \nPhil Lader to be Ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \nNorthern Ireland. I have no doubt that he will live up to the \ncommitment he made to the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this week \nand devote his time and energy ``not only to the salient matters of \ndiplomacy, but also to the arts and letters, the streets and fields, \nthe industries and entrepreneurs, those who innovate and those in need, \nall of which preserve and strengthen the heritage and common causes of \nAmerica and the United Kingdom.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n              Statement on the Nomination of Felix Rohatyn\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was privileged to be on the floor at the \ntime the distinguished majority leader put forth the Executive \nCalendar, including the name of Felix Rohatyn to be the United States \nAmbassador to France. I had the privilege of introducing Mr. Rohatyn to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations. And together with his lovely wife, \nElizabeth, I assure the\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nSenate that they will make an extraordinarily competent team to \nrepresent our Nation.\n  And now, Mr. President, I am going to do something that is unusual. I \nask unanimous consent that Mr. Rohatyn's statement before the committee \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement by Felix G. Rohatyn Before the Subcommittee on European \n    Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, July 29, 1997\n\n       Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee.\n       It is a great honor for me to appear before you today to \n     seek your consent to President Clinton's nomination of me to \n     serve as the next American Ambassador to France. It is also a \n     very emotional experience, for many reasons.\n       Let me begin by expressing to you, Mr. Chairman, my \n     appreciation for your courtesies and those of your staff. You \n     have been gracious and helpful to me and to my family in \n     assisting us through this rather daunting process.\n       I am, as you know, a refugee who came to this country from \n     Nazi-occupied Europe in 1942. As long as I can remember, \n     going back to those very dark days, being an American was my \n     dream. I was fortunate to achieve that dream, and America has \n     more than fulfilled all of my expectations. To represent, at \n     this time, my adopted country as her Ambassador would be the \n     culmination of my career; to have been nominated to represent \n     my country in France, a country where I spent part of my \n     childhood and with which I have had a lifelong relationship, \n     both professional and personal, seems to me more than I could \n     have ever hoped for.\n       I have been fortunate in having had a long and active \n     career in investment banking. Over the last 40 years or so I \n     have provided financial advice to a number of domestic and \n     foreign corporations, mainly involving their activities in \n     mergers and acquisitions. I have also, over the years, served \n     on the boards of directors of a number of large multinational \n     corporations. This activity has included a number of \n     negotiations through which French companies made significant \n     investments in the U.S. and vice versa. This, coupled with \n     the fact that my former firm has an affiliate in Paris, has \n     allowed me to maintain close personal relationships with a \n     number of French business leaders, as well as with leaders \n     from the world of culture, media and the arts. I have also \n     over the years known a number of senior government leaders \n     and have had the honor of being decorated by the French \n     government.\n       I believe that my business experience, as well as my \n     relationship with French leaders and my knowledge of France \n     in general, will enable me to represent my country \n     effectively if you choose to consent to my nomination.\n       I also believe that our relationship with France is \n     extraordinarily important. Aside from the history of allied \n     cooperation going back to Washington, Thomas Jefferson and \n     Lafayette, we have fought side by side with France in World \n     Wars One and Two, and more recently in the Gulf War. We sit \n     side by side with France in the U.N. Security Council, in the \n     OECD, and in every other major multinational institution; our \n     soldiers are participating together today in NATO's important \n     peacekeeping operation in Bosnia. France is one of our \n     largest trade partners and one of the largest foreign direct \n     investors in the U.S.; we are the largest foreign investor in \n     France. While we have many differences with France, in a \n     variety of areas, I believe that, most importantly, France is \n     a democracy which is our friend and with whom we share our \n     most important values.\n       France, like some other European countries, is going \n     through a difficult period of adjustment to the changes \n     demanded by global economic forces. France's success is \n     dealing with her problems is important not only in the \n     context of our bilateral relationship, but also in the \n     context of the future architecture of Europe. The U.S. has, \n     for the last 50 years, encouraged the political and economic \n     integration of Europe. France's role in such integration is \n     critical.\n       Mr. Chairman, I have had the great privilege of serving my \n     city and my state at a time when New York City was in \n     considerable difficulty. I hope that you will give me the \n     opportunity, by consenting to my nomination, to represent my \n     country's interests at a time and in a place which is \n     important to the U.S. I can assure you that, should you do me \n     this honor, I will make every effort to do so effectively.\n\n\n          STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF JAMIE RAPPAPORT CLARK\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about \nthe nomination of Jamie Rappaport Clark to be Director of the United \nStates Fish and Wildlife Service. The President nominated Ms. Clark on \nJuly 9, and I am pleased to report that last Thursday, July 24, the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works reported out the nomination.\n  Jamie Clark is an outstanding candidate for the tasks at hand. She \nhas worked closely with the Environment Committee staff and Committee \nmembers' staff on the Endangered Species Act and other tough issues. I \nhave heard nothing but glowing reports of her ability to work with the \nAdministration and Congress, which will serve her well, if confirmed. \nThroughout her educational and professional experiences, she has been \ninvolved on a daily basis with the principles of fish and wildlife \nmanagement. Jamie Clark has worked with the Fish and Wildlife Service \nfor over 8 years, both at the regional level and at headquarters. For \nthe past 4 years of her tenure with the Service, she has held the \nposition of Associate Director of Ecological Services.\n  Prior to joining the Fish and Wildlife Service, Jamie Clark was the \nlead technical authority for fish and wildlife management on U.S. Army \ninstallations worldwide. From 1984 until 1988, she managed the Natural \nand Cultural Resources program within the National Guard. She also was \na research biologist for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute and \nworked for the National Institute for Urban Wildlife as a wildlife \nbiologist.\n  Jamie Clark's educational background is equally impressive and suits \nher well to the position of Fish and Wildlife Service Director. She \nholds a master's degree (MS) in Wildlife Ecology from the University of \nMaryland and a bachelor's degree (BS) in Wildlife Biology.\n  If confirmed, Jamie Clark will be responsible for developing and \ncarrying out policies to conserve, protect, and enhance the Nation's \nfish and wildlife and their habitats. A number of challenging tasks \nfall on the shoulders of the Fish and Wildlife Service Director, \nincluding the management of the National Wildlife Refuge System; the \nimplementation of the Endangered Species Act; fish hatchery management; \nrecreational fishing programs; management of non-indigenous and exotic \nspecies; conservation and management of migratory waterfowl and wild \nbirds; and the list of responsibilities goes on.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service is an agency with the wonderful but \ndifficult task of serving as an advocate for fish and wildlife. It must \nprotect these public resources in the face of much criticism and \nquestion. The Service is charged with fulfilling its own mission in \nlight of competing and sometimes conflicting mandates. It also must \naddress the contentious issues of private property rights, water \nrights, and takings. The Service has done a remarkable job in recent \nyears of developing initiatives that deal with many of these issues. \nThe internal guidance documents for permits; the new safe harbor, \ncandidate conservation and ``no-surprises'' policies; the policy for \nNative American rights; and the streamlining initiatives for federal \nagencies have all led to better implementation of the Endangered \nSpecies Act, better public relations, and ultimately better protection \nfor the species.\n  I am confident that Jamie Clark has the experience, insight, and the \nstrength to lead the Fish and Wildlife Service to continue these \ninitiatives and develop new ones through the challenges ahead. Thank \nyou.\n\n\n            statement on the nomination of edward gnehm, jr.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is a great personal pleasure for me to \nexpress my congratulations to Ambassador Edward Ghehm, Jr. as the \nSenate completes its action on his nomination to be Director General of \nthe Foreign Service. I have known Edward Ghehm, or Skip, as his friends \ncall him, since the days when we were in college together. He and I \nwere college roommates for 3 years. Skip has been a brother to me since \nwe first met. I know him better than any investigator could hope--and \nthere isn't anything I know I wouldn't share, from his sense of humor \nto his work ethic. Skip has always put God and Country first. He has \nlived a motto that says, ``If what you did yesterday still seems \nimportant, you haven't done much today.''\n  It doesn't seem all that long ago, we were both attending George \nWashington University here in the Nation's Capital. We used to dream \nabout the future. I can tell you, we never dreamed that ``someday'' \nwe'd both be before a congressional panel, me as the junior Senator \nfrom Wyoming, and Skip as the President's nominee for a key State \nDepartment post.\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\n  Through the years, we have kept track of each other. I have been very \nproud, but not surprised, that Skip has gone on to accomplish great \nthings in his career with the State Department. I've lived around the \nworld through my brother.\n  Skip has been a man for our time. A quick glance at Skip's duty sheet \nwill show that whenever there has been a ``hot spot'' in the world \ncommunity that warranted the careful attention of the State Department \nand a search for ``the right one''--someone with a great sensitivity to \na tense foreign situation and strong diplomatic skills to help find a \nsolution--Skip was often the one they called.\n  To name a few of his tours of duty with the State Department, Skip \nhas served in the Vietnamese Embassy, he has been in Nepal, and he has \nbeen stationed in many posts in the Middle East.\n  Skip was a part of the team that negotiated hostage releases. He has \nbeen in charge of evacuating Embassy families. Each change of \nadministration has sought out his expertise, his counsel, and his \nactive participation in our foreign policy. When Operation Desert Storm \nbecame necessary, once again Skip was there, serving as our Ambassador \nto Kuwait. You'll remember the proud moment when the American flag went \nback up at our Embassy--Skip was the person you saw raise the colors.\n  Most recently, Skip has been serving as the Deputy U.S. \nRepresentative to the United Nations.\n  Ambassador Gnehm is a man of great character, strongly held \nprinciples, and the greatest integrity you could hope to find. He has \nearned the respect of those he works with, and his counterparts in the \nforeign countries and Embassies in which he has been assigned.\n  Skip is the perfect choice for the Foreign Service. He has always \nseen the foreign service as his best chance to serve--to make a \ndifference. And he has made a difference. He has the experience and the \ndetermination it takes to succeed. He's a proven leader who understands \nthe need to follow orders and the direction of our foreign policy. He \npossesses the finest of administration skills. I have no doubt that the \nwealth of talent he possesses will enable him to lead with confidence. \nAs always, Skip will do a fine job and produce results.\n  It is with great pleasure that I support his nomination.\n\n\n     NOMINATIONS OF GEORGE OMAS, JAMES ATKINS, AND JANICE LACHANCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have had some others cleared. Therefore, \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senate continue in executive session \nto consider the following nominations on the Executive Calendar, the \nnominations of George Omas, James Atkins, and Janice Lachance which \nwere reported from the Governmental Affairs Committee today, that the \nnominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, any statements relating to the nominations appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record, and the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my support for the \n1998-1999 Reauthorization of the Earthquake Hazard Reduction Act of \n1977.\n  I think we can all agree that the goal of the National Earthquake \nHazard Reduction Program is a prime example of the proper role for \ngovernment. In this bill we are calling for continued effort in the \nareas of public education, fundamental earth science research, \ndevelopment of better materials and building practices, and other \nactivities that reduce the risk to life and property.\n  This bill contains a provision that builds upon the national seismic \nnetwork, improving its capability and forming the basis for a real-time \nseismic hazard warning system. A real-time warning system has the \npotential to save lives by alerting people outside the immediate area \nof an impending seismic shock. Advance warning can be critical in \npreventing injury by giving communities time to curtail high risk \nactivities such as high-speed rail transportation, as well as shutoff \nof selected gas, electrical and water feeders to the effected area. \nThis is pivotal in limiting the collateral damage caused after an \nearthquake by fire.\n  As we have all seen by the devastation in Northridge, CA, the \nconsequences of an earthquake are simply too important for a region to \nbe lulled into a false sense of safety. This point was brought home to \nme when I heard that an earthquake had struck Chattanooga. Certainly, \nnot by any means, a large event, but a reminder, that the threat of \nearthquakes occur throughout the Nation.\n  We have also included an important provision which underscores our \ncommitment to education. This bill would let NSF create and disseminate \nearth science educational materials in a way that permits easy access \nby educators and the general public. Acknowledging that FEMA and NSF \nhave both done an outstanding job in creating educational material, we \nare looking for continued cooperation of all the agencies, one of the \nhallmarks of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program [NEHRP].\n  To speed the process of moving this important legislation forward, I \noffer a technical amendment which brings the funding authority for USGS \nto the same level reflected in the House of Representatives version of \nthis bill. The adoption of this amendment should reduce the time it \nwill take for this important legislation to become law.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the passage of this legislation will \ncontinue of the good work that these four agencies have been \nundertaking--work that saves property, but most importantly, saves \nAmerican lives.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr President, I rise today in support of passage of S. \n910, a bill to reauthorize appropriations for the Earthquake Hazards \nReduction Act. Catastrophic earthquakes are inevitable in the United \nStates. Scientists consider California to be the most likely location \nfor major earthquakes; however, all or parts of 39 states--populated by \nmore than 70 million people--have been classified as having major or \nmoderate seismic risk. Earthquakes are not uncommon in Alaska, Idaho, \nUtah, and Nevada. Major earthquakes east of the Rockies are infrequent \nbut can prove devastating. In 1811-12, three huge earthquakes rocked \nthe New Madrid area of Missouri, near St. Louis and Memphis. These \nearthquakes were so powerful that they changed the course of the \nMississippi River and rang bells in Boston. In 1886, an earthquake \nleveled my hometown of Charleston. Estimates of the strength of the \nCharleston quake range from 7.0 to 7.6 on the Richter Scale. Of \nparticular interest and concern about the east coast quakes is that \nthere is no known geological origin for them. This fact underscores the\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\npossibility of unpredictable seismic activity in the United States.\n  What we do know, though, is that the loss of life and property from \nearthquakes can be considerable. For example, the January 17, 1994, \nearthquake at Northridge, CA, was classified as only ``moderate'' in \nmagnitude. Nonetheless, 57 people died, and injuries totaled over \n6,500. In addition, insurance payments for this moderate event were \nover $6 billion, and the Federal supplemental appropriation totaled \nanother $9 billion. The Northridge has become the second most expensive \nnatural disaster in American history, exceeded only by Hurricane \nAndrew. Reducing damage from earthquakes would not only save lives but \nalso save both private insurers and the Federal Government considerable \namounts of money.\n  That is what NEHRP, National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, \nestablished by the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, is \ndesigned to do. It is a Federal interagency program designed to help \nminimize the loss of life and property caused by earthquakes. It \nsupports scientific research on the origins of earthquakes, and funds \nengineering research to make buildings and other structures more \nseismically resistant. NEHRP also disseminates this technical \ninformation to the states, and helps states and localities prepare for \nearthquakes. NEHRP focuses on helping states prepare for earthquakes, \nin contrast to Federal disaster response programs that help states \nafter a major event.\n  The Northridge earthquake illustrates both NEHRP's accomplishments \nand what some observers believe are continuing problems.\n  The most important accomplishment was the survival of most of the \nbuildings and highway overpasses which were built to meet new seismic \ncodes or retrofitted to meet those codes. For example, highway bridges \ndesigned using standards developed after the late 1970s performed very \nwell. The most dramatic story concerns the retrofit of older highway \noverpasses. After the Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California in \n1989, university researchers and Federal engineers, using NEHRP funds, \nundertook a crash program to develop new ways to retrofit older highway \nbridges and began applying those retrofit techniques to overpasses in \nSouthern California. At Northridge, six major highway bridges \ncollapsed. While further study is needed, it appears that the older \noverpasses that were retrofitted survived, while those that did not \noften failed.\n  Northridge also illustrated some continuing problems such as the \nstrength of ``lifelines''--water line, natural gas pipelines, \nelectrical lines, and so forth. Little research has been done to date \non how to make these facilities more earthquake-resistant. Dramatic \nfilm from Northridge showed flooded streets with shooting jets of \nburning natural gas and illustrated how easily these lines are broken.\n  Mr. President, S. 910 will authorize the funding needed to continue \nthe good work that has been done by the four participating agencies in \nNEHRP--the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Geological \nSurvey, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology--and will allow them to address problems like \nruptured lifelines that continue to plague disaster response teams.\n  This bill also will require new assessments of our seismic hazard \nwarning systems, and our earthquake emergency training facilities to \nensure that the warning systems and training facilities are up to date, \nproperly operating, and responsive. In assessing the current conditions \nof the seismic monitoring networks, the agencies are expected to pay \ngreater attention to understudied areas like the eastern seaboard where \ncatastrophic seismic events have occurred in the past, and are \npredicted to occur in the future--yet are more difficult to understand.\n  This is a good bill. I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his \ndiligence in this area, and I encourage my colleagues to support \npassage of this measure today.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1054\n\n       (Purpose: To increase the authorization for the United \n     States Geological Survey for 1998 and 1999.)\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass the bill H.R. \n1944, authorizing an exchange of lands between the U.S. Forest Service, \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Lake County, OR.\n  My colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, joined me in introducing S. \n881 on June 11. The chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski, was extremely helpful and the bill was \nincluded in a hearing on various land exchange bills on June 18th. The \nU.S. House passed the companion measure, sponsored by the chairman of \nthe House Agriculture Committee, Congressman Smith, on July 22. The \nEnergy Committee reported the House bill yesterday, and I greatly \nappreciate the Chairman's excellent work to bring the bill to floor for \nfinal passage today.\n  This legislation will go far to keep the Warner Canyon Ski Area of \nLakeview, OR, in business. If ever there was such a thing as a \ncommunity ski area, this is it. It is low tech. It is run by a non-\nprofit local organization. This legislation is clearly in the public \ninterest of Lakeview, OR, and the Nation.\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\n  This bill has important benefits to the Hart Mountain Antelope \nRefuge, as well. Management of our National Wildlife Refuges can be \nburdened when there are privately owned lands inside of a refuge \nboundary, and this measure allows the refuge to take ownership to more \nthan 300 acres of county owned lands inside the refuge. With this \nacquisition we move closer to the permanent protection of this \nimportant Oregon wildlife refuge.\n  I was pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Gordon Smith, \nand I urge its passage.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 110, which was \nreported by the Rules Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 110) to permit an individual with a \n     disability with access to the Senate floor to bring necessary \n     supporting aids and services.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the chairman of the \nRules Committee, the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for his \ncooperation in moving forward with such an extremely important matter. \nBecause of its significance, I think it would be useful for us to \nengage in a colloquy to enlighten the Senate further as to the intent \nof this resolution.\n  It is my understanding that the purpose of this resolution is to \nclarify that individuals with disabilities who have been given the \nprivilege of access to the Senate floor under rule XXIII of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate may bring necessary supporting aids or \nservices onto the floor. This will ensure that the staff of a Senator \nwishes to have on the floor will not be denied the privilege of the \nfloor because the staffer happens to use a guide dog or a wheelchair. \nThis resolution is intended to be broadly interpreted to cover all \nindividuals with disabilities. Is my understanding correct that this is \nthe purpose of the resolution?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. By adopting this resolution, the Senate \nhopes to be a model for the country in its treatment of individuals \nwith disabilities. The Senate intends to be nondiscriminatory and \naccommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities who may use \nsupporting aids or services. For purposes of this resolution, \nindividuals with disabilities are those who have a physical or mental \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life \nactivities, and supporting aids and services are not intended to be \nlimited to the illustrative examples provided in the resolution.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The resolution also contains a condition on the use of \nsupporting aids and services where such use would place a significant \ndifficulty or expense on the operations of the Senate. Is my \nunderstanding correct that this undue burden language is intended to \napply only in very unusual circumstances, such as where significant \narchitectural modifications might be necessary?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. This modifying language would apply only \nin extreme circumstances.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have one final question: is my understanding correct \nthat the Rules Committee has written a letter of guidance to assist the \nSergeant at Arms in interpreting and implementing this resolution?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. The Rules Committee will send a letter \nof guidance to the Sergeant at Arms that should be used in interpreting \nthe resolution.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       at the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 2. ENHANCEMENT OF JUDICIAL INFORMATION DISSEMINATION.\n\n       Section 103(b)(2) of the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 \n     (Public Law 101-650; 104 Stat. 5096; 28 U.S.C. 471 note) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(A)'' after ``(2)'';\n       (2) by striking ``sections 471 through 478'' and inserting \n     ``sections 472, 473, 474, 475, 477, and 478''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B) The requirements set forth in section 476 of title \n     28, United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall \n     remain in effect permanently.''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 \nestablished a process for developing new discovery and case management \nprocedures designed to reduce costs and delay in Federal litigation.\n  My amendment to S. 996 would make permanent one very successful \nreform from the Civil Justice Reform Act--the requirement that a list \nof each Federal judge's 6-month-old motions and 3-year-old cases be \npublished and disseminated twice every year.\n  According to the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, this public \nreporting requirement led to a 25 percent reduction in the number of \ncases pending more than 3 years in the Federal system, even though the \ntotal number of cases filed during the 4-year study period actually \nincreased--proving again that Justice Brandeis was correct in saying \nthat ``sunlight is the best disinfectant.''\n  This very effective reporting requirement will expire in December \nunless Congress acts. With my amendment, I seek to extend this \nreporting requirement.\n  This amendment marks the first step in implementing the findings of \nthe studies called for by the original Civil Justice Reform Act. The \nRand study of the pilot projects set up by the act found that early \njudicial supervision of the discovery process can both reduce delay and \nlitigation costs. These and other procedural reforms ought to be \nincorporated into the everday practices of our Federal bench to \nproduced savings for the taxpayers and increase the efficiency of our \nFederal courts.\n  I intend to continue working with my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, as well as the Judicial Conference, to search for and \nimplement improvements in our Federal civil justice system.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1055) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as \namended, be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Iraqi emergency is to continue in \neffect beyond August 2, 1997, to the Federal Register for publication.\n  The crisis between the United States and Iraq that led to the \ndeclaration on August 2, 1990, of a national emergency has not been \nresolved. The Government of Iraq continues to engage in activities \ninimical to the stability in the Middle East and hostile to United \nStates interests in the region.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency \nwith respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order 12722 and \nmatters relating to Executive Orders 12724 and 12817 (the ``Executive \nOrders''). The report covers events from February 2 through August 1, \n1997.\n  Executive Order 12722 ordered the immediate blocking of all property \nand interests in property of the Government of Iraq (including the \nCentral Bank of Iraq) then or thereafter located in the United States \nor within the possession or control of a United States person. That \norder also prohibited the importation into the United States of goods \nand services of Iraqi origin, as well as the exportation of goods, \nservices, and technology from the United States to Iraq. The order \nprohibited travel-related transactions to or from Iraq and the \nperformance of any contracting support of any industrial, commercial, \nor governmental project in Iraq. United States persons were also \nprohibited from granting or extending credit or loans to the Government \nof Iraq.\n  The foregoing prohibitions (as well as the blocking of Government of \nIraq property) were continued and augmented on August 9, 1990, by \nExecutive Order 12724, which was issued in order to align the sanctions \nimposed by the United States with United Nations Security Council \nResolution (UNSCR) 661 of August 6, 1990.\n  1. In April 1995, the U.N. Security Council adopted UNSCR 986 \nauthorizing Iraq to export up to $1 billion in petroleum and petroleum \nproducts every 90 days for a total of 180 days under U.N. supervision \nin order to finance the purchase of food, medicine, and other \nhumanitarian supplies. UNSCR 986 includes arrangements to ensure \nequitable distribution of humanitarian goods purchased with UNSCR 986 \noil revenues to all the people of Iraq. The resolution also provides \nfor the payment of compensation to victims of Iraqi aggression and for \nthe funding of other U.N. activities with respect to Iraq. On May 20, \n1996, a memorandum of understanding was concluded between the \nSecretariat of the United Nations and the Government of Iraq agreeing \non terms for implementing UNSCR 986. On August 8, 1996, the UNSC \ncommittee established pursuant to UNSCR 661 (``the 661 Committee'') \nadopted procedures to be employed by the 661 Committee in \nimplementation of UNSCR 986. On December 9, 1996, the Secretary General \nreleased the report requested by paragraph 13 of UNSCR 986, making \nUNSCR 986 effective as of 12:01 a.m. December 10.\n  On June 4, 1997, the U.N. Security Council adopted UNSCR 1111, \nrenewing for another 180 days the authorization for Iraqi petroleum \nsales contained in UNSCR 986 of April 14, 1995. The Resolution became \neffective on June 8, 1997. During the reporting period, imports into \nthe United States under this program totaled approximately 9.5 million \nbarrels.\n  2. There have been no amendments to the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, \n31 C.F.R. Part 575 (the ``ISR'' or the ``Regulations'') administered by \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Department of the \nTreasury during the reporting period.\n  As previously reported, the Regulations were amended on December 10, \n1996, to provide a statement of licensing policy regarding specific \nlicensing of United States persons seeking to purchase Iraqi-origin \npetroleum and petroleum products from Iraq (61 Fed. Reg. 65312, \nDecember 11, 1996). Statements of licensing policy were also provided \nregarding sales of essential parts and equipment for the Kirkuk-\nYumurtalik pipeline systems, and sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq, \npursuant to United Nations approval. A general license was also added \nto authorize dealings in Iraqi-origin petroleum and petroleum products \nthat have been exported from Iraq with the United Nations and United \nStates Government approval.\n\n  All executory contracts must contain terms requiring that all \nproceeds of the oil purchases from the Government of Iraq, including \nthe State Oil Marketing Organization, must be placed in the U.N. escrow \naccount at Banque National de Paris, New York (the ``986 escrow \naccount''), and all Iraqi payments for authorized sales of pipeline \nparts and equipment, humanitarian goods, and incidental transaction \ncosts borne by Iraq will, upon arrival by the 661 Committee, be paid or \npayable out of the 986 escrow account.\n  3. Investigations of possible violations of the Iraqi sanctions \ncontinue to be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. \nSeveral cases from prior reporting periods are continuing and recent \nadditional allegations have been referred by the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control (OFAC) to the U.S. Customs Service for Investigation.\n  On July 10, 1995, an indictment was brought against three U.S. \ncitizens in the Eastern District of New York for conspiracy in a case \ninvolving the attempted exportation and transshipment to Iraq of \nzirconium ingots in violation of the IEEPA and the ISR. The intended \nuse of the merchandise was the manufacture of cladding for radioactive \nmaterials to be used in nuclear reactors. The case was the culmination \nof a successful undercover operation conducted by agents of the U.S. \nCustoms Service in New York in cooperation with OFAC and the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. On February 6, \n1997, one of the defendants pled guilty to a 10-count criminal \nindictment including conspiracy to violate the Iraqi Sanctions and the \nIEEPA. The trial of the remaining defendants is ongoing.\n  Investigation also continues into the roles played by various \nindividuals and firms outside Iraq in the Iraqi government procurement \nnetwork. These investigations may lead to additions to OFAC's listing \nof individuals and organizations determined to be Specially Designated \nNationals (SDNs) of the Government of Iraq.\n  Since my last report, OFAC collected four civil monetary penalties \ntotaling more than $470,000 for violations of IEEPA and the ISR. The \nviolations involved brokerage firms' failure to block assets of an \nIraqi SDN and effecting certain securities trades with respect thereto. \nAdditional administrative proceedings have been initiated and others \nawait commencement.\n  4. The Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued a total of 700 \nspecific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to Iraq or Iraqi \nassets since August 1990. Licenses have been issued for transactions \nsuch as the filing of legal action against Iraqi governmental entities, \nlegal representation of Iraq, and the exportation to Iraq of donated \nmedicine, medical supplies, and food intended for humanitarian relief \npurposes, executory contracts pursuant to UNSCR 986, sales of \nhumanitarian supplies to Iraq under UNSCR 986, the execution of powers \nof attorney relating to the administration of personal assets and \ndecedents' estates in Iraq and the protection of preexistent \nintellectual property rights in Iraq. Since my last report, 47 specific \nlicenses have been issued.\n  5. The expense incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from February 2 through August 1, 1997, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iraq are reported \nto be about $1.2 million, most of which represents wage and salary \ncosts for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business \nAffairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of \nInternational Organization Affairs, the Bureau of Political-Military \nAffairs, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the U.S. Mission to \nthe United Nations, and the Office of the Legal\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nAdvisor), and the Department of Transportation (particularly the U.S. \nCoast Guard).\n\n  6. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in response \nto Iraq's illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait, a clear act of \nbrutal aggression. The United States, together with the international \ncommunity, is maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq because the \nIraqi regime has failed to comply fully with relevant United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions. Security Council Resolutions on Iraq call \nfor the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi \nrecognition of Kuwait and the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait \nboundary, the release of Kuwaiti and other third-country nationals, \ncompensation for victims of Iraqi aggression, long-term monitoring of \nweapons of mass destruction capabilities, the return of Kuwaiti assets \nstolen during Iraq's illegal occupation of Kuwait, renunciation of \nterrorism, an end to internal Iraqi repression of its own civilian \npopulation, and the facilitation of access of international relief \norganizations to all those in need in all parts of Iraq. Seven years \nafter the invasion, a pattern of defiance persists: a refusal to \naccount for missing Kuwaiti detainees; failure to return Kuwaiti \nproperty worth millions of dollars, including military equipment that \nwas used by Iraq in its movement of troops to the Kuwaiti border in \nOctober 1994; sponsorship of assassinations in Lebanon and in northern \nIraq; incomplete declarations to weapons instructors and refusal of \nunimpeded access by these inspectors; and ongoing widespread human \nrights violations. As a result, the U.N. sanctions remain in place; the \nUnited States will continue to enforce those sanctions under domestic \nauthority.\n  The Baghdad government continues to violate basic human rights of its \nown citizens through the systematic repression of minorities and denial \nof humanitarian assistance. The Government of Iraq has repeatedly said \nit will not be bound by UNSCR 668. The Iraqi military routinely \nharasses residents of the north, and has attempted to ``Arabize'' the \nKurdish, Turcomen, and Assyrian areas in the north. Iraq has not \nrelented in its artillery attacks against civilian population centers \nin the south, or in its burning and draining operations in the southern \nmarshes, which have forced thousands to flee to neighboring states.\n  The policies and actions of the Saddam Hussein regime continue to \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States, as well as to regional peace and \nsecurity. The U.N. resolutions affirm that the Security Council must be \nassured of Iraq's peaceful intentions in judging its compliance with \nsanctions. Because of Iraq's failure to comply fully with these \nresolutions, the United States will continue to apply economic \nsanctions to deter it from threatening peace and stability in the \nregion.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to authorize the use of certain public housing \noperating funds to provide tenant-based assistance to public housing \nresidents; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n          THE CRIME VICTIM HOUSING VOUCHERS BILL JULY 30, 1997\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Today, Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill \nthat would provide for more public housing vouchers. I have been \nworking on this issue in the Housing Subcommittee, and it is my hope \nthat a similar provision will be placed in the Public Housing bill.\n  The original intent of the Federal housing assistance program was to \nprovide temporary housing to poor individuals and families. Since their \ninception, federal housing programs have grown dramatically. Today they \nprovide $25 billion per year in housing assistance.\n  In my view, the voucher program is the best means for low-income \nfamilies to find secure affordable rental housing. The voucher program \nfirst began in 1974 and has grown to serve over 1.5 million low-income \nfamilies today. These families are empowered with the choice of where \nthey want to live and are given the freedom to determine what \nsurroundings they desire. Vouchers are the preferable means of \nproviding affordable housing to low-income individuals.\n  Vouchers enjoy wide support, including past Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. In fact, the current Secretary of HUD, Secretary \nAndrew Cuomo supports an expanded voucher program.\n  Vouchers are very popular, which is demonstrated by the 1.5 million \nfamilies who are currently using vouchers or certificates. Vouchers \nempower individuals and promote competition within Public Housing \nAuthorities and within the community, thereby lowering costs and \nimproving conditions for the residents. Vouchers or other alternatives \ncan be less expensive than the current public housing program; they can \nsave the government money, and improve conditions for the tenants.\n  Studies have indicated that project-based housing assistance costs \nmore on average than the voucher housing program. In fact, the findings \nof the June 1995 GAO report indicated that housing vouchers cost 10 \npercent less than project-based housing. This study clearly \ndemonstrated that on a national average, the section 8 tenant-based \nhousing program is cheaper than the public unit-based housing program. \nIn fact, one can say that the savings from the movement to vouchers \nwould amount to $640 million per year which could add additional \nhousing assistance.\n  Under this legislation, ten percent of the public housing operating \nfunds that are distributed to each public housing authority would be \nmade available for those who currently live in the public housing unit \nand wish to be given a voucher. Nothing would be required or mandated; \nit is simply a choice given to the resident. In fact, we make clear \nthat any unexpended amounts set aside for vouchers would be used by the \nPHAs for normal operating funds.\n  Quite frankly, I really don't know how anyone could oppose this \nprovision unless they are just opposed to giving people a choice and an \nopportunity.\n  The language that I have proposed also establishes a preference for \ncrime victims. It states that a voucher will be made available to any \nresident of public housing who is the victim of a crime of violence \nthat has been reported to law enforcement. People should have the \noption of vouchers when their housing is unsafe.\n  My strong belief is that we should increase the pace at which we move \nahead with the conversion of housing from the old central planning and \nconcentrated public housing model, to one of choice and opportunities \nthrough the use of vouchers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Campbell, Mr. Domenici and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1095. A bill to enhance the administrative authority of the \nrespective presidents of Haskell Indian Nations University and the \nSouthwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n     THE HASKELL INDIAN NATIONS UNIVERSITY AND SOUTHWESTERN INDIAN \n        POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Haskell \nIndian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute \nAdministrative Systems Act of 1997. I am pleased to have my colleagues, \nSenators Sam Brownback, Jeff Bingaman, Pete Domenici, and Daniel \nInouye, and Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell as cosponsors. This legislation will provide Haskell Indian \nNations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute the \nadministrative authority and flexibility to complete their transitions \nfrom two year institutions to a 4-year university for Haskell, and a \nnational community college for SIPI.\n  Located in Lawrence, KS, Haskell is an educational institution rich \nin history and opportunity for American Indian and Alaskan Native \ncommunities. Founded in 1884 as the United States Indian Industrial \nTraining School, Haskell has grown from a school providing agricultural \neducation for grades one through five to a fully accredited four-year \nuniversity. In October 1993, Haskell changed its name from Haskell \nIndian Junior College to Haskell Indian Nations University after \nreceiving accreditation to offer a bachelor of science degree in \nelementary teacher education. Since its inception, Haskell has provided \ntuition-free education, culturally sensitive curricula, innovative \nservices and a commitment to academic excellence to federally \nrecognized tribal members. With as many as 175 tribes represented in \nthe student body, Haskell offers Native American history, institutions, \narts, literature, and language courses integrating the perspectives of \nvarious Native American cultures. Haskell continues development of 4-\nyear programs in other fields, striving to meet the challenge of \nenriching the lives of young native Americans and Alaska Natives.\n  I support Haskell's vision to become a national center for Indian \neducation, research, and cultural programs; increasing the knowledge \nand supporting the educational needs of American Indians and Alaskan \nNatives. This legislation, which allows the institution to remain \nwithin the Bureau of Indian Affairs and employees to continue \nparticipation in Federal retirement and health benefit programs, \nprovides the Haskell president and Board of Regents authority over \norganizational structure, classification of positions, recruitment, \nprocurement, and determination of all human resource policies and \nprocedures. In short, this legislation completes Haskell's transition \nby giving the school the autonomy enjoyed by the tribally controlled \ncommunity colleges and BIA elementary and secondary schools. As Haskell \ncontinues to change and meet the educational demands of native \nAmericans and Alaskan Natives into the 21st Century, so too should the \nsystem by which Haskell is administered change and grow. The Haskell \nIndian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute \nAdministrative Systems Act of 1997 complements the educational and \nadministrative efforts of these schools, giving Haskell and SIPI the \nsupport and flexibility required to progress and develop into \noutstanding institutions of higher learning. My Kansas colleague, \nRepresentative Vincent Snowbarger, has introduced this bill in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1095\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nthe State of Kansas, Senator Roberts, in introducing a bill that will \nenable two Tribal Colleges to pursue their missions without the burden \nof unnecessary Federal regulations. Like Haskell Indian Nations \nUniversity, the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute of \nAlbuquerque (SIPI) is one of about 30 Tribal Colleges that is supported \nby the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Many of the students at these colleges \nare the first in their families to attend college, and having a Tribal \nCollege near their home and in tune with their tradition is critical to \ntheir education and economic success. Both Haskell and SIPI have grown \nin academic stature in the past few decades. SIPI recently marked its \n25th anniversary and adopted a Master Plan that will guide the growth \nof its programs and facilities beyond the year 2000.\n  A recent report by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of \nTeaching entitled ``Native American Colleges: Progress and Prospects,'' \ndocuments the critical role that these colleges play in offering Native \nAmericans access to higher education. This report also traces the \nhistory of the relationship between the Federal government and Tribal \nColleges. Haskell and SIPI are the only Tribal Colleges that are \nadministered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and as a result are bound \nby the personnel regulations that apply to Federal agencies. At one \ntime, this policy made sense and allowed these two universities to \nestablish an administrative infrastructure and academic programs. But \nas the Carnegie Foundation report points out, the relationship between \nthe Federal government and Tribal Colleges should evolve as the \ninstitutions take on more self-determination. The time has come to \nenact legislation that reflects the growth of these institutions.\n  The Federal personnel regulations imposed on SIPI and Haskell are \ninappropriate for institutions of higher education and are not \nrecognized by accreditation organizations. This bill would allow \nHaskell and SIPI to establish independent authority over their \npersonnel policies and practices. There is a world of difference \nbetween a Federal agency and a thriving institution of higher \neducation, and these differences should be reflected in their personnel \nclassification, pay systems, and policies for hiring and promotion. \nSIPI needs the authority to hire and promote faculty and staff on the \nbasis of their intellect and the excellence of their teaching, \nresearch, and service to the institution.\n  The U.S. military academies have encountered these same obstacles, \nand they have adopted alternative personnel regulations approved by the \nOffice of Personnel Management. The personnel authority that would be \nestablished under this bill have been modeled after those in use by the \nU.S. Air Force Academy. OPM has been consulted and is in agreement with \nthe contents of this bill.\n  I agree with the Carnegie Foundation's report when it says: ``These \ninstitutions have taken on a breathtaking array of responsibilities. \nWith each passing year, tribal colleges prove their worth to tribal \ncommunities, and to the nation. They can longer be dismissed as risky \nexperiments, nor can their accomplishments be ignored. They are a \npermanent part of their reservations and this country.''\n  I applaud Senator Roberts' efforts to develop and introduce this \nlegislation. I look forward to working with him and with Senators \nCampbell and Inouye of the Committee on Indian Affairs to provide these \ntwo institutions with the flexibility they need to continue to \nflourish.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1096.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The structure of the Internal Revenue Service should be \n     strengthened to ensure focus and better target its budgeting, \n     staffing, and technology to serve the American taxpayer and \n     collect the Federal revenue.\n       (2) The American public expects timely, accurate, and \n     respectful service from the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (3) The job of the Internal Revenue Service is to operate \n     as an efficient financial management organization.\n       (4) The bulk of the Federal revenue is generated through \n     voluntary compliance. Taxpayer service and education, as well \n     as targeted compliance and enforcement initiatives, increase \n     voluntary compliance.\n       (5) While the Internal Revenue Service must maintain a \n     strong enforcement presence, its core and the core of the \n     Federal revenue stream lie in a revamped, modern, \n     technologically advanced organization that can track \n     finances, send out clear notices, and assist taxpayers \n     promptly and efficiently.\n       (6) The Internal Revenue Service governance, management, \n     and oversight structures must: develop and maintain a shared \n     vision with continuity; set and maintain priorities and \n     strategic direction; impose accountability on senior \n     management; provide oversight through a credible board, \n     including members who bring private sector expertise to the \n     Internal Revenue Service; develop appropriate measures of \n     success; align budget and technology with priorities and \n     strategic direction; and coordinate oversight and identify \n     problems at an early stage.\n       (7) The Internal Revenue Service must use information \n     technology as an enabler of its strategic objectives.\n       (8) Electronic filing can increase cost savings and \n     compliance.\n       (9) In order to ensure that fewer taxpayers are subject to \n     improper treatment by the Internal Revenue Service, Congress \n     and the agency need to focus on preventing problems before \n     they occur.\n       (10) There currently is no mechanism in place to ensure \n     that Members of Congress have a complete understanding of how \n     tax legislation will affect taxpayers and the Internal \n     Revenue Service and to create incentives to simplify the tax \n     law, and to ensure that Congress hears directly from the \n     Internal Revenue Service during the legislative process.\n       (b) The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To restructure the Internal Revenue Service, \n     transforming it into a world class service organization.\n       (2) To establish taxpayer satisfaction as the goal of the \n     Internal Revenue Service, such that the Internal Revenue \n     Service should only initiate contact with a taxpayer if the \n     agency is prepared to devote the resources necessary for a \n     proper and timely resolution of the matter.\n       (3) To provide for direct accountability to the President \n     for tax administration, an Internal Revenue Service Oversight \n     Board, a strengthened Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and \n     coordinated congressional oversight to ensure that there are \n     clear lines of accountability and that the leadership of the \n     Internal Revenue Service has the continuity and expertise to \n     guide the agency.\n       (4) To enable the Internal Revenue Service to recruit and \n     train a first-class workforce that will be rewarded for \n     performance and held accountable for working with taxpayers \n     to solve problems.\n       (5) To establish paperless filing as the preferred and most \n     convenient means of filing tax returns for the vast majority \n     of taxpayers within 10 years of enactment of this Act.\n       (6) To provide additional taxpayer protections and rights \n     and to ensure that taxpayers receive fair, impartial, timely, \n     and courteous treatment from the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (7) To establish the resolution of the century date change \n     problem as the highest technology priority of the Internal \n     Revenue Service.\n       (8) To establish procedures to minimize complexity in the \n     tax law and simplify tax administration, and provide Congress \n     with an independent view of tax administration from the \n     Internal Revenue Service.\n   TITLE I--EXECUTIVE BRANCH GOVERNANCE AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE \n                        INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n     Subtitle A--Executive Branch Governance and Senior Management\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to reduce acid deposition under the Clean Air Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n                THE ACID DEPOSITION CONTROL ACT OF 1997.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Acid \nDeposition Control Act of 1997, a bill to combat acid rain and help \nrestore health to the Nation's sensitive ecosystems--such as the \nAdirondack Park in my home State of New York. My friend and colleague, \nSenator D'Amato is cosponsor of this measure.\n  Mr. President, in the 1960's, fishermen in the Adirondacks began to \ncomplain about more than the big ones that got away. Fish, once \nabundant, were not simply becoming harder to catch. They had \ndisappeared. Initially, pollution seemed an unlikely cause. The lakes \nlie in a park protected by the New York State Constitution from most \ndisturbances by human activities. Most of the lakes are virtually \ninaccessible, except to fishermen--and the winds that blow in from \nindustrial pockets across the Midwest.\n  Before long, pioneering scientists such as Cornell University's \nEugene Likens and Carl Schofield and Syracuse University's Charles \nDriscoll established a link between increased deposition of acidic \ncompounds in rainfall and the absence or deformity of fish in lakes \nwith clear water and low pH.\n  This was precisely the phenomenon first documented by Robert Angus \nSmith in Manchester, England, in 1852. More recently, acid rain had \nbeen of concern in Scandinavia. Acids lofted into the atmosphere from \ntall smokestacks in the industrial basin of the Ruhr River, falling on \nwatersheds that were, in many places, little more than bare rock. \nCloser to the source, acid rain was blamed for Waldsterben, the death \nof Germany's prized Black Forest.\n  We have learned a great deal since then. In June 1980, Congress \npassed the Energy Security Act, Public Law 96-264. Title VII consisted \nof a bill I introduced in 1979, the Acid Precipitation Act of 1980. It \nestablished the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program \n[NAPAP]--an interagency research program to foster the development of \nscience-based Federal policy regarding acid rain. This program resulted \nin the establishment of long-term acid deposition monitoring programs, \na network of permanent forest plots and lake sampling regimes, over \n1,500 peer reviewed publications, and perhaps more important the \nissuance of 71 doctoral degrees in acid deposition research during the \n1980's compared to only 2 in the decade before.\n  By the end of this massive study, scientists worldwide gathered in \nSouth Carolina to discuss what they had learned. They learned that at \nleast 800 lakes and 2,200 streams in the eastern United States had been \nmade acidic by acid rain; they predicted that an additional 10 percent \nwould become acidic over the next decade without additional \nlegislation. And they confirmed--as had been expected--that sulfur \ndioxide emissions were found to be a significant factor in acidifying \necosystems. Sulfur dioxide had contributed to forest decline in high \nelevation areas, corrosion of stone and metal structures, and reduced \nvisibility.\n  In 1990, Congress enacted acid rain controls to reduce sulfur dioxide \nemissions by 10 million tons below 1985 levels, utilizing a unique, \nmarket-based approach to ensure the most cost-effective pollution \nreduction possible. At the time, the measure was expected to have some \nnoticeable--but not overwhelming--beneficial effects.\n  We were right. Visibility has increased. Acidification of lake waters \nand deterioration of materials has been reduced. The incidence of \nrespiratory disease has decreased. The market-based emissions trading \napproach has proved a tremendous success, fostering reductions nearly \n40 percent beyond that which the act required, at costs amounting to a \nmere fraction of industry and government predictions. Equally \nimportant, our knowledge increased.\n  In recent years, scientists have identified another important \nprecursor of acid rain: nitrogen oxides. Studies on the combined effect \nof sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide strongly suggest that the Clean \nAir Act will not be adequate to prevent long-term deterioration of \nnational treasures such as the Adirondack Mountains and the Chesapeake \nBay. According to a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] study, \neven with the reductions required by the Clean Air Act, up to 45 \npercent of the lakes in the Adirondacks will become too acidic to \nsupport most aquatic life by the year 2040. Lakes too acidic to support \nlife. Now there is a powerful image.\n  The bill I introduce today requires an additional 50-percent \nreduction of sulfur dioxide and a 75-percent reduction in the level of \nnitrogen oxides emitted from electric utilities. This legislation \nblends the best judgment of top scientists with the successful, market-\nbased approach of the existing program.\n  The legislation calls for a nitrogen oxide cap and trade program \nsimilar to the sulfur dioxide program presently administered by EPA's \nAcid Rain Division. Under the program, EPA officials would divide a \nfixed--capped--number of nitrogen oxide emission allowances among the \n48 contiguous States each year, basing each State's share of allowances \non the State's share of the power generated within the 48 States.\n  Each State, in turn, would divide the allowances among the utilities \nwithin the State, in whatever manner the State sees fit. Each allowance \nrepresents a limited right to emit 1 ton of NOX pollution. \nEach utility must conduct an accounting procedure to ensure that they \nhold enough allowances to cover their emissions tonnage. A utility with \nmore allowances than emissions may sell their additional allowances or \nsave them for use in a future year. Likewise, a utility with fewer \nallowances than emissions would purchase excess allowances from another \nsource.\n  If for any reason a State does not wish to administer the allocation \nof allowances to its utilities, the EPA Administrator will distribute \nthe allowances automatically, giving each utility a share of the \nState's allowances equal to that utility's share of the State's power \ngeneration.\n  In addition to contributing to acid deposition, NOX \npollution contributes to ozone pollution, a respiratory and pulmonary \nirritant which can cause significant adverse health effects. Because \nheat and sunlight are necessary components in the creation of ozone \npollution, ozone is most prevalent in warm summer months. Therefore, in \nan effort to reduce ozone pollution, the legislation would take \nadditional measures to reduce summertime NOX emissions. \nDuring the months of May, June, July, August, and September, an \nelectric utility would be forced to surrender two allowances per ton of \nNOX emitted.\n  The NOX trading program would commence operation on \nJanuary 1, 2000, beginning with an annual cap of 5.4 million allowances \nand cutting back to 3.0 million allowances beginning in 2003. EPA \nmodeling suggests that, due to\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\nthe two-for-one ozone season emissions provision, the actual emissions \nwill likely drop to approximately 2.3 million tons per year after \n2003--a reduction of approximately 70 percent from 1995 levels.\n  Mr. President, there were days when dark plumes of smoke coming out \nof factory smokestacks were signs of prosperity. There was nothing Jim \nFarley liked to do better than put up a new Post Office and hire an \nartist to paint on its walls prosperity returning. Black columns of \nsmoke reaching up to the sky--strong colors for what we hoped would be \na strong economy.\n  Lord Kelvin used to point out that one can't solve a problem that one \ncannot measure. We have spent decades measuring, and now it is time to \nupdate our policy response in order to solve the problem. It is time to \nadjust to the consequences of what we have learned. Mr. President, I \nurge my colleagues to support the Acid Deposition Control Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1097\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Acid Deposition Control \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) reductions of atmospheric nitrogen oxide and sulfur \n     dioxide from utility plants, in addition to the reductions \n     required under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), \n     are needed to reduce acid deposition and its serious adverse \n     effects on public health, natural resources, building \n     structures, sensitive ecosystems, and visibility;\n       (2) nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide contribute to the \n     development of fine particulates, suspected of causing human \n     mortality and morbidity to a significant extent;\n       (3) regional nitrogen oxide reductions of 50 percent in the \n     Eastern United States, in addition to the reductions required \n     under the Clean Air Act, may be necessary to protect \n     sensitive watersheds from the effects of nitrogen deposition;\n       (4) without reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur \n     dioxide, the number of acidic lakes in the Adirondacks in the \n     State of New York is expected to increase by up to 40 percent \n     by 2040; and\n       (5) nitrogen oxide is highly mobile and can lead to ozone \n     formation hundreds of miles from the emitting source.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize the current scientific understanding that \n     emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, and the acid \n     deposition resulting from emissions of nitrogen oxide and \n     sulfur dioxide, present a substantial human health and \n     environmental risk;\n       (2) to require reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur \n     dioxide emissions;\n       (3) to support the efforts of the Ozone Transport \n     Assessment Group to reduce ozone pollution;\n       (4) to reduce utility emissions of nitrogen oxide by 70 \n     percent from 1990 levels; and\n       (5) to reduce utility emissions of sulfur dioxide by 50 \n     percent after the implementation of phase II sulfur dioxide \n     requirements under section 405 of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7651d).\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Moynihan, in introducing legislation \nthat we believe will curb the devastating effects of acid rain in New \nYork State and throughout the entire Nation. Our bill seeks to place \ncontrols on the emission of the pollutants that cause acid rain and \nacid deposition--Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxide \n(NOx)--beyond those levels enacted in the 1990 Clean Air \nAct. In this way, we will ensure that those entities that are primarily \nresponsible for the pollution that affects down-wind States such as New \nYork are held to the same strict accountability.\n  New Yorkers know all too well that pollution transported from up-wind \nsources has had a devastating impact on the Adirondacks as well as \nother regions within the State. The prevalence of acid deposition has \nreached the point where the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] \nestimates that without further controls of nitrogen oxides, the number \nof acidic lakes in the Adirondacks could increase to 43 percent by the \nyear 2040. Such an increase will see approximately 1,300 lakes out of \nthe 3,000 in the Adirondacks become chronically acidic. Clearly, we \nmust take action to prevent this from becoming a reality.\n  Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, a cap on SO2 emissions was \nenacted. It was designed to reduce the overall level of this pollutant \nby 50 percent by the year 2000. To provide an incentive to decrease \nemissions even more, a system of trading allowances for SO2 \nwas established. An ``allowance'' allows a utility to emit 1 ton of \nSO2 pollution. These trading allowances enable utilities \nthat have reached their allowable emission caps for SO2 to \nbuy another utility's excess capability. This ability to ``trade'' tons \nof SO2 has been popular with utilities and has actually \nbrought significant reductions in the amount of SO2 emitted \nin a cost-effective manner. The legislation that we are introducing \ntoday builds on that success by instituting a NOx cap and \ntrade program that we believe will have a positive impact on the \nenvironment.\n  Under the bill, the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] would be \nrequired to allocate a capped number of NOx emission \nallowances nationwide--excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The EPA would base \neach State's allotment on the percentage share of power each State \ngenerates within the 48 contiguous States. So, if a particular State \ngenerates 5 percent of the power in the Continental United States, then \nthat State would be entitled to 5 percent of the total emissions pool.\n  Once a State had received its emission allowances, the State would be \nable to divide those allowances within the State in any manner it \nchooses. Utilities would be required to ensure that they have enough \ntons at their disposal to cover their total emission tonnage. If a \nState had additional tons, they would be able to sell allowances or \n``bank'' them for use at a future time. A utility without enough \nallowances would have to buy them on the open market, an option \ncurrently in practice with SO2. Utilities that do not abide \nby these restrictions on capping and trading NOx allowances \nwould be fined $6,000 per ton emitted over the established limit for \nthat plant. States that are unwilling or unable to determine the \nallocation of allowances to utilities within their State would have \nthat capability default to the EPA.\n  The NOx trading program would go into effect in the year \n2000 with an annual cap of 5.4 million allowances nationwide decreasing \nto 3 million allowances in 2003. Currently, utilities emit \napproximately 6.5 million tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx).\n  The bill would also create further protections against harmful \npollution during the summer months when ozone levels are at their \nhighest. When NOx combines with heat, sunlight and volatile \norganic compounds [VOC's], the end product is ozone. Thus, ideal \nconditions for high levels of ground-level ozone occur mainly in the \nsummer months. To combat this, the legislation calls for utilities to \ngive up two allowances for each ton of NOx emitted during \nthe months of May, June, July, August and September instead of the one \nallowance per ton that would apply for the remaining 7 months of the \nyear. This would effectively drop the total emission of NOx \nto 2.3 million tons after the year 2003 and would create approximately \na 70 percent reduction in NOx emissions from the 1990 level.\n  In addition, the bill calls for further reductions in SO2 \nin the year 2003, when utilities will be required to use two allowances \nper ton of SO2 emitted instead of one. This would cut these \nemissions in half. The bill also requires the EPA to conduct a study on \nthe effects that mercury, a toxic metal, may have on the environment \nand how to measure this mercury with an eye towards possible monitoring \nand control of mercury emissions in the future.\n  Finally, the bill contains a provision for specific research on the \neffect of acid deposition on the sensitive ecosystems of the \nAdirondacks, the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains, the Mid-Appalachian \nMountains and water bodies of the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, Long \nIsland Sound and the Chesapeake Bay. If proven by research that a \nparticular region is still threatened, then the Administrator may take \nfurther steps to promote environmental recovery of that region.\n  We in New York continue to see the effects that acid rain and acid \ndeposition have on our environment. Lakes, streams and trees in the \nAdirondacks are still dying due to the continued emission and transport \nof these pollutants. Other states and other regions throughout our \nnation have similar problems. If we are to pass along a healthy \nenvironment to our children and grandchildren, we must be willing to \nenact the controls that will preserve that legacy. The legislation that \nSenator Moynihan and I have proposed is strong medicine, but it will \nenable us to sustain our heritage for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1098. A bill to provide for the debarment or suspension from \nFederal procurement and nonprocurement activities of persons that \nviolate certain labor and safety laws; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n          THE FEDERAL PROCUREMENT AND ASSISTANCE INTEGRITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation to improve the efficiency and protect the integrity of \nFederal procurement and assistance programs, by ensuring that the \nFederal Government does business with responsible contractors and \nparticipants.\n  The United States General Accounting Office [GAO] has found that \nbillions\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\nof dollars in Federal procurement contracts and assistance are going to \nindividuals and corporations which are violating our nation's labor and \nemployment laws. In 1995, the GAO reported that more than $23 billion \nin Federal contracts were awarded in fiscal year 1993 to contractors \nwho violated labor laws. That is 13 percent of the $182 billion in \nFederal contracts awarded that year. Part of the reason for this, the \nGAO found, is that the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces \nour nation's labor laws, does not know whether violators of the law are \nreceiving Federal contracts. And the General Services Administration, \nwhich oversees Federal procurement, does not know the labor relations \nrecords of Federal contractors.\n  Last year, the GAO reported that $38 billion in Federal contracts in \nfiscal year 1994 were awarded to contractors who had violated workplace \nhealth and safety laws. That is 22 percent of the $176 billion in \nFederal contracts of $25,000 or more which were awarded that year. The \nGAO found that 35 people died and 55 more people were hospitalized in \nfiscal year 1994 as a result of injuries at the workplaces of federal \ncontractors who violated health and safety laws. These contractors were \nassessed a total of $10.9 million in penalties in fiscal year 1994--\nwhile being awarded $38 billion in Federal contracts.\n  The GAO concluded that, although federal agencies have the authority \nto deny contracts and federal assistance to companies that violate \nFederal laws, this authority is rarely used in the case of safety and \nhealth violations. The GAO found that federal agencies do not normally \ncollect or receive information about which contractors are violating \nhealth and safety laws--even when contractors have been assessed large \npenalties for egregious or repeat violations.\n  The Federal Government should not ignore the health and safety \nrecords of companies that apply for federal contracts and assistance. A \nreport published this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine \nconcludes that job-related injuries and illnesses in the United States \nare more common than previously thought, costing the nation more than \nAIDS, Alzheimer's, cancer or heart disease. The report, which analyzed \nnational estimates of job-related illnesses and injuries in 1992, \nstates that more than 13 million Americans were injured from job-\nrelated causes in just one year--more than four times the number of \npeople who live in the City of Chicago. The report concluded that the \ncost to our country from workplace injuries and illnesses was $171 \nbillion in 1992.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to taxpayers, working \nAmericans and law-abiding businesses, to ensure that federal tax \ndollars do not go to individuals and corporations that violate safety \nand health, labor and veterans' employment preference laws. About 26 \nmillion Americans are employed by federal contractors and \nsubcontractors. They deserve to know that their Government is not \nrewarding employers who violate the laws that protect American workers \nand veterans.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will improve the enforcement \nof our nation's health and safety, labor and veterans' employment laws, \nand provide an incentive to contractors to comply with the law. This \nlegislation will allow the Secretary of Labor to debar or suspend a \nperson from receiving Federal contracts or assistance for violating the \nNational Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act or the disabled and Vietnam-era \nveterans hiring preference law. It will require the Secretary of Labor \nand the National Labor Relations Board to develop procedures to \ndetermine whether a violation of law is serious enough to warrant \ndebarment or suspension. And, as recommended by the GAO, this \nlegislation will require ongoing exchanges of information among Federal \nagencies to improve their ability to enforce our nation's laws. This \nlegislation is identical to a bill introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Lane Evans of Illinois, and it is \nsimilar to legislation introduced in previous years by former Senator \nPaul Simon.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that the vast majority of \nFederal contractors obey the law. This legislation is only directed at \nthose who are violating the law. It will deny Federal contracts and \nassistance to individuals and companies that violate the law and ensure \nthat Federal contracts are awarded to companies that respect the law.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1098\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Procurement and \n     Assistance Integrity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to improve the efficiency and \n     effectiveness and protect the integrity of the Federal \n     procurement and assistance systems by ensuring that the \n     Federal Government does business with responsible contractors \n     and participants.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION FOR VIOLATORS OF CERTAIN \n                   LABOR AND SAFETY LAWS.\n\n       (a) Debarment and Suspension.--The Secretary of Labor may \n     debar or suspend a person from procurement activities or \n     nonprocurement activities upon a finding, in accordance with \n     procedures developed under this section, that the person \n     violated any of the following laws:\n       (1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et \n     seq.).\n       (2) The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et \n     seq.).\n       (3) The Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 651 \n     et seq.).\n       (4) Section 4212(a) of title 38, United States Code.\n       (b) Procedures.--The Secretary of Labor and the National \n     Labor Relations Board shall jointly develop procedures to \n     determine whether a violation of a law listed in subsection \n     (a) is serious enough to warrant debarment or suspension \n     under that subsection. The procedures shall provide for an \n     assessment of the nature and extent of compliance with such \n     laws, including whether there are or were single or multiple \n     violations of those laws or other labor or safety laws and \n     whether the violations occur or have occurred at one \n     facility, several facilities, or throughout the company \n     concerned. In developing the procedures, the Secretary and \n     the Board shall consult with departments and agencies of \n     the Federal Government and provide, to the extent \n     feasible, for ongoing exchanges of information between the \n     departments and agencies and the Department of Labor and \n     the Board in order to accurately carry out such \n     assessments.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Debar.--The term ``debar'' means to exclude, pursuant \n     to established administrative procedures, from Federal \n     Government contracting and subcontracting, or from \n     participation in nonprocurement activities, for a specified \n     period of time commensurate with the seriousness of the \n     failure or offense or the inadequacy of performance.\n       (2) Nonprocurement activities.--The term ``nonprocurement \n     activities'' means all programs and activities involving \n     Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits, \n     as covered by Executive Order No. 12549 and the Office of \n     Management and Budget guidelines implementing that order.\n       (3) Procurement activities.--The term ``procurement \n     activities'' means all acquisition programs and activities of \n     the Federal Government, as defined in the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation.\n       (4) Suspend.--The term ``suspend'' means to disqualify, \n     pursuant to established administrative procedures, from \n     Federal Government contracting and subcontracting, or from \n     participation in nonprocurement activities, for a temporary \n     period of time because an entity or individual is suspected \n     of engaging in criminal, fraudulent, or seriously improper \n     conduct.\n       (d) Effective Date.--This Act shall take effect on October \n     1, 1997.\n       (e) Regulations.--The Federal Acquisition Regulation and \n     the regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12549 \n     shall be revised to include provisions to carry out this Act.\n       (f) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor and the \n     National Labor Relations Board shall jointly submit to \n     Congress a report on the implementation of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. JOHNSON):\n  S. 1099. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to acquire \nsuch land in the vicinity of Pierre, South Dakota, as the Secretary \ndetermines is adversely affected by the full wintertime Oahe Powerplant \nrelease; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n    RELOCATION OF RESIDENTS IN PIERRE AND FT. PIERRE, SOUTH DAKOTA, \n                              LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide the Corps of Engineers with the authority to buy-out and \nrelocate people living in the southeast Pierre and Ft.\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\nPierre areas that are being flooded by the federal Pick-Sloan project. \nThis is a chronic problem that is getting worse every year as sediment \nbuilds up at the delta of the Bad and Missouri Rivers.\n  In the Pierre and Ft. Pierre area, high water levels, exacerbated by \nsediment buildup and ice, regularly leads to the flooding of homes in \nthe wintertime. The situation has become intolerable, and it is not \nfair for the residents of this area to continue to suffer as the result \nof the operation of this federal project. Moreover, the flooding \nproblem hinders the ability of the Western Area Power Administration to \ngenerate hydroelectric power from the Oahe dam, resulting in the loss \nof millions of dollars in revenues to the federal government each year.\n  To address this problem, I added a provision to the 1996 Water \nResources Development Act to require the Corps of Engineers to develop \na plan to remove the sediment blocking the channel and to reduce the \nerosion that is leading to this persistent buildup of sediment at the \ndelta. Hopefully, this effort will lead to the development of a means \nof moving some of the sediment and of a plan to better prevent erosion \nin the Bad River watershed. One local resident, Mike Harrison, has \ndeveloped a plan to help clear the channel of sediment which holds \npromise and which the Corps will evaluate with funds appropriated for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  Even if that effort is successful, however, and we are able to \nrelieve some of the pressure on the channel, sediment from the Bad \nRiver will continue to build up at that location. In short, while we \nmay be able to increase the capacity of the channel to transport water \nand thus allow for greater hydroelectric power generation in the \nwintertime, it is difficult to envision a time when we will be able to \npermanently alleviate the risk of flooding to the homeowners in the \narea.\n  Therefore, I am introducing this legislation to authorize the Corps \nto relocate the affected homeowners and ensure that they never again \nhave to face the prospects of enduring flooded homes during our cold \nSouth Dakota winters. It is my strong hope Congress will recognize the \nseverity of this problem and move swiftly to enact and implement this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1099\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACQUISITION OF LAND NEAR PIERRE, SOUTH DAKOTA.\n\n       To provide full operational capability to carry out the \n     authorized purposes of the Missouri River Main Stem dams that \n     are part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program \n     authorized by section 9 of the Act entitled ``An Act \n     authorizing the construction of certain public works on \n     rivers and harbors for flood control, and for other \n     purposes'', approved December 22, 1944, the Secretary of the \n     Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, may acquire, \n     from willing sellers, such land in the vicinity of Pierre, \n     South Dakota, as the Secretary determines is adversely \n     affected by the full wintertime Oahe Powerplant release.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Ford, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n        Hollings):\n  S. 1100. A bill to amend the Covenant To Establish a Commonwealth of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union With the United States \nof America, the legislation approving such covenant, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the commonwealth of the northern mariana reform act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Commonwealth of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands Reform Act, a bipartisan initiative to \ncurb immigration, wage, and apparel labeling abuses in the CNMI. \nSenators Collins, Hutchinson of Arkansas, Landrieu, Bumpers, Ford, \nBingaman, and Hollings are cosponsors of this legislation.\n  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is located 3,900 \nmiles west of Hawaii. Following World War II, the United States \nadministered the islands under a U.N. Trusteeship.\n  In 1975, the people of the CNMI voted for political union with the \nUnited States. Today the CNMI is a U.S. territory.\n  A 1976 covenant enacted by Congress gave U.S. citizenship to \nresidents of the CNMI. The covenant exempted the Commonwealth from U.S. \nimmigration and minimum wage laws, however. This omission has led to a \nnumber of abuses in the CNMI that my bill would rectify.\n\n\n                     immigration abuse in the cnmi\n\n  I am sure many Senators will find it hard to believe that the \nImmigration and Nationality Act does not apply to all territories in \nthe U.S. As surprising as it may be, the CNMI is exempt from U.S. \nimmigration law.\n  Let me explain the origins of this unique situation. At the time that \nthe covenant establishing the CNMI was negotiated, the Northern \nMarianas leadership expressed concern that immigrants from neighboring \nAsian countries might settle in the CNMI and thereby alter the \nCommonwealth's culture. The island government requested that it be \ngiven exclusive authority over immigration so that it could limit the \nentry of aliens and preserve local culture and customs. Congress agreed \nto the request, but specifically reserved the right to extend Federal \nimmigration law to the CNMI if the situation warranted.\n  After 20 years, CNMI immigration policy is a proven failure. In 1980, \nthe Commonwealth's population was 16,780. Of these, 12 percent were \nalien residents. Today, CNMI's population is 59,000, more than half of \nwhom are aliens.\n  Rather than preventing an influx of immigrants, the CNMI has \nestablished an aggressive policy of recruiting low-wage, foreign guest \nworkers to operate an ever-expanding garment and tourism industry. \nAccording to the CNMI representative in Washington, local immigration \npolicy has ``no limit. It is wide open, unrestricted.''\n  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service reports that CNMI \nauthorities have no reliable records of aliens who have entered the \nCNMI, how long they remain, and when, if ever, they depart. Ninety-one \npercent of the private sector work force are alien guest workers. These \nworkers have overwhelmed the CNMI, driving up unemployment in the \nCommonwealth to 14 percent. There is no justification for an \nimmigration policy that admits foreign workers in such overwhelming \nnumbers that it leads to double-digit unemployment.\n  The application of U.S. immigration law to the CNMI is long overdue. \nThe CNMI has exploited its immigration exemption to the point where \nalien workers constitute a majority of the CNMI population. The \nCommonwealth's exemption from the Immigration and Nationality Act has \nbeen so abused that protecting the island culture ceases to be an \nissue.\n  Despite a 3-year effort by the U.S. Departments of Justice, Labor, \nand Interior, and an appropriation of $10 million by Congress, there \nhad been little or no improvement in CNMI immigration policy. In fact, \nthe Commonwealth's immigration policy has grown worse. Between January \n1995 and May 1996, 23 new garment companies received operating \nlicenses, prompting the CNMI Government to enact legislation to double \nthe number of foreign workers permitted in the island's garment \nindustry.\n\n\n                         ``made in usa'' abuse\n\n  The U.S. apparel industry would be shocked to learn that in 1996, \n$555 million of textile products labeled ``Made in USA'' were cut and \nsewn in the CNMI by workers who enjoy none of the protections typically \nassociated with the ``Made in USA'' label. Even more frightening is the \nfact that the CNMI textile industry is growing at a rate of 30 percent \nannually. Textile manufacturers across the United States who pay their \nemployees the Federal minimum wage are undercut by CNMI competitors who \nlabel their garments ``Made in USA'' but employ foreign laborers to sew \nforeign fabric, pay them $3.05 an hour and subject them to feudal \nworking conditions.\n  The evidence that garments sewn in the CNMI directly and unfairly \ncompete with U.S. apparel manufacturers is very strong. According to \nthe Commerce Department, 85 percent of CNMI apparel is classified as \nimport sensitive. This classification means that the CNMI garments \ncompete with segments of the U.S. apparel industry that are \nexperiencing significant decline due to heavy import penetration.\n\n[[Page S8553]]\n\n  Apparel manufacturers in the CNMI enjoy benefits that far exceed \nthose enjoyed by foreign or domestic manufacturers. CNMI garment \nfactories are not subject to the U.S. minimum wage and pay no duty on \nfabrics they import. Furthermore, quotas do not apply to either fabric \nimported into the Commonwealth, or to finished garments cut and sewn in \nthe CNMI using foreign labor. Yet these products are labeled ``Made in \nthe USA'' and compete unfairly with apparel employment elsewhere in the \nUnited States.\n  The July 1997 report on labor, immigration, and law enforcement in \nthe CNMI confirms my analysis of the Commonwealth's garment industry. \nPage 13 of the report contains the following finding:\n\n       The duty and quota-free preferences afforded to products of \n     the CNMI, coupled with local control of immigration and \n     minimum wage, have led to a rapidly growing garment \n     manufacturing industry. Apparel manufacturers operating in \n     the CNMI, who mainly employ workers from the People's \n     Republic of China, label their products ``Made in the USA,'' \n     and use Chinese fabric not subject to United States duty or \n     quota. By using the CNMI as an apparel manufacturing base, \n     these manufacturers avoid duties and are not subject to \n     United States quotas on finished products. These imports \n     adversely affect the United States apparel industry's \n     employment and profits.\n\n  In some cases, these garment factories are transplanted to the CNMI \nfrom the People's Republic of China. They are owned or managed by \nChinese nationals, and staffed by bonded and indentured Chinese \nlaborers. Despite promises of the American dream if they work in the \nCNMI, laborers must sign contracts with government officials in the \nPeople's Republic of China that waive rights guaranteed to U.S. \nworkers, forbid participation in religious and political activities \nwhile in the U.S., prohibit workers from marrying, and subject \nemployees to penalties in China for violations of their labor \ncontracts.\n  In factories with close ties to China, compliance with labor \ncontracts is directly monitored by representatives of the Chinese \ngovernment. These working conditions hardly justify granting ``Made in \nthe USA'' status to CNMI garments.\n\n\n          cnmi denies employment opportunities to u.s. workers\n\n  The 1976 covenant exempts the CNMI from the Federal minimum wage. \nThis exemption was granted with the understanding that as its economy \ngrew and prospered, the CNMI would raise its minimum wage to the \nFederal level. Foreign workers typically enter the CNMI under 1-year \nwork permits and are paid a minimum of wage of $3.05.\n  According to the July 1997 report by the Department of the Interior, \nthe lower minimum wage, combined with unlimited access to foreign \nlabor, creates an incentive for employers to hire foreign labor for all \njobs, including skilled and entry level jobs at or near the minimum \nwage. Employment statistics clearly support the Interior Department \nanalysis.\n  Ninety-one percent of the private sector work force are alien guest \nworkers. U.S. citizens who can find work, and there are many who \ncannot, are typically employed by the government in jobs that pay more \nthan the minimum wage. Due to its irresponsible immigration policy, \nforeign workers have overwhelmed the CNMI to the point where \nunemployment among U.S. citizens living in the Commonwealth is 14 \npercent. The CNMI preference for foreign laborers deprives U.S. \ncitizens of private sector opportunities and leaves them with the \nlimited options of government work, unemployment and welfare, or \nrelocation to Guam or the mainland.\n  The minimum wage is sometimes a lightning-rod issue for Republicans. \nHowever, in a labor market where there is an unlimited supply of guest \nworkers, the low CNMI minimum wage means that low-wage alien laborers \nare displacing U.S. workers. Any policy that favors foreign workers \nover the interests of employed and unemployed U.S. citizens is \nindefensible.\n\n\n                        labor abuse in the cnmi\n\n  CNMI immigration and wage abuses have caused a number of collateral \nproblems. Pervasive labor abuses in the Commonwealth have provoked \ninternational outrage. In 1995, the Philippine government imposed a \nmoratorium on immigration of Filipino workers in the CNMI. The \nPhilippine Government's extraordinary action to protect its citizens \nfrom employment in the CNMI was the first such decision by a foreign \ngovernment in U.S. history. Although the Philippine Government has \nsince lifted the moratorium, recurring abuses prompted Philippine \nofficials to announce that the moratorium may soon be reimposed.\n  While the U.S. minimum wage does not apply, CNMI must adhere to all \nother Federal labor laws. The U.S. Department of Labor has uncovered a \nsystematic pattern of labor abuses in the CNMI. These abuses are a \ndirect consequence of the Commonwealth's unrestricted immigration \npolicy. Examples include involuntary servitude and peonage, illegal \nwithholding of wages, nonpayment of overtime wages, illegal deductions \nfrom paychecks to cover employer expenses, kickbacks of wages to \nemployers, and employee lock-downs in work sites and living barracks.\n\n\n                     human rights and sexual abuse\n\n  The Commonwealth's immigration policy results in serious problems in \nother areas. The Justice Department has documented numerous cases of \nwomen and girls being recruited from the Philippines, China, and other \nAsian countries expressly for criminal sexual activity. These abuses \nare a direct consequence of the Commonwealth's unrestricted immigration \npolicy.\n  Typically, these women are told they will work in the CNMI as \nwaitresses, but are forced into nude dancing and prostitution upon \ntheir arrival. The Justice Department described this situation as the \n``systematic trafficking of women and minors for prostitution,'' which \nmay also involve illegal smuggling, organized crime, immigration \ndocument fraud, and pornography. Cases of sexual servitude have also \nbeen identified.\n  The U.S. Justice Department also found cases of female guest workers \nand aliens living in the CNMI being forced into prostitution through \nintimidation or threats of physical harm. In some instances, women who \nresist are kidnapped, raped, and tortured.\n  To correct these abuses in the CNMI, my bill makes three changes in \nFederal law. First, it extends the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nthe Commonwealth so that the CNMI will end its dependence on foreign \nlabor.\n  Second, it would limit use of the ``Made in USA'' label to apparel \nmanufactured with a minimum percentage of U.S. citizen labor. In 1999, \nthe minimum percentage of U.S. citizen labor must be 20 percent. In \n2000, the minimum percentage must be 35 percent and thereafter the \nminimum percentage rises to 50 percent.\n  Finally, my bill would make the U.S. minimum wage applicable to the \nCNMI so that the CNMI garment industry competes fairly with industry on \nthe U.S. mainland.\n  Despite efforts to portray itself as an economic miracle, there is a \ndark side to the CNMI economy. Citizens and foreign laborers pay a very \nhigh price for the Commonwealth's economic success, and enjoy few \nbenefits of that success. The time for patience has ended. The time has \ncome to force changes that the Commonwealth has been unwilling to \nenact.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the following additional documents \nbe printed in the Record: the executive summary of the Clinton \nadministration's July 1997 report on labor, immigration, and law \nenforcement in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the \nLibrary of Congress translation of a Chinese shadow contract, the memo \nfrom the State Department confirming that an agency of the Chinese \nGovernment is a party to the shadow contract, and a June 20, 1997, \nWashington Times article and a June 6, 1997, Honolulu Star-Bulletin \narticle on the CNMI.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1100\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands Reform Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands in\n\n[[Page S8554]]\n\n     Political Union with the United States of America was \n     approved by Congress pursuant to Public Law 94-241, 90 Stat. \n     263;\n       (2) at the time that the Covenant was being negotiated, \n     representatives of the government of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands expressed concern that United States immigration laws \n     would allow unrestricted immigration into their small island \n     community;\n       (3) in response to these concerns, section 503(a) of the \n     Covenant provided that the Immigration and Naturalization Act \n     did not immediately apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands;\n       (4) Congress expressly reserved the right to extend the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Act to the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands at a future date;\n       (5) following the enactment of the Covenant, the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands instituted a \n     largely unrestricted immigration policy, causing the \n     Commonwealth's population to increase from 16,780 in 1980 to \n     a population of over 58,800 in 1995, with foreign workers \n     outnumbering United States citizens;\n       (6) as a result of these immigration policies, 91 percent \n     of the private sector work force in the Commonwealth is \n     comprised of foreign workers;\n       (7) the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has \n     used its immigration policy to recruit a large, low-cost \n     foreign work force of desperately poor individuals with no \n     meaningful opportunity to demand safe living and working \n     conditions or fair wages and benefits;\n       (8) notwithstanding an unemployment rate of 14 percent \n     among United States citizens, the Commonwealth has recruited \n     increasing numbers of foreign workers;\n       (9) even though the Commonwealth alleges that unfilled job \n     openings justify recruitment of an increasing number of \n     foreign workers, the Commonwealth's own statistics indicate \n     an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent foreign workers;\n       (10) the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     reported that the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands has no reliable records of aliens who have entered \n     the Commonwealth, how long they remain, and when, if ever, \n     they depart;\n       (11) at the time that the Covenant was being negotiated, \n     representatives of the government of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands expressed concern that the minimum wage provisions of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act would disrupt the Commonwealth's \n     struggling local economy;\n       (12) in response to these concerns, section 503(c) of the \n     Covenant provided that the minimum wage provisions of the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act did not immediately apply to the \n     Commonwealth;\n       (13) Congress expressly reserved the right to extend the \n     minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands at a future \n     date;\n       (14) the economy of the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands has grown significantly and, in 1996, annual \n     gross business revenues rose to $1,500,000,000, a 6-fold \n     increase during the past decade;\n       (15) the current minimum wage in the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands is only $3.05 per hour for garment \n     and construction industry workers and $3.05 per hour for \n     those working in other industries;\n       (16) the U.S. Department of Labor has uncovered a \n     systematic pattern of labor abuses in the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, including--\n       (a) involuntary servitude and peonage,\n       (b) illegal withholding of wages earned,\n       (c) non-payment of overtime wages,\n       (d) illegal deductions from paychecks,\n       (e) kickbacks of wages paid to employees,\n       (f) employee lock-downs in work sites and living barracks, \n     and\n       (g) unsafe and unhealthy working and living environments;\n       (17) despite an expectation that they will enjoy the \n     American dream in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands, foreign workers have been required to sign contracts \n     with government representatives in the Peoples Republic of \n     China which--\n       (a) waive rights guaranteed to U.S. workers,\n       (b) forbid participation in religious and political \n     activities while in the United States,\n       (c) prohibit workers from dating or marrying in the United \n     States,\n       (d) subject employees to civil and labor penalties if \n     returned to China, and\n       (e) permit Chinese government recruiters to charge a fee of \n     25 percent of an employee's net pay for a period of two \n     years;\n       (18) the U.S. Department of Justice has determined that the \n     immigration and labor situation in the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands has created a major organized crime \n     problem in the Commonwealth which involves--\n       (a) Immigration document fraud,\n       (b) Public corruption,\n       (c) Racketeering,\n       (d) Drug trafficking,\n       (e) Prostitution,\n       (f) Pornography,\n       (g) Extortion,\n       (h) Gambling,\n       (i) Smuggling, and\n       (j) Other forms of violent crime;\n       (19) the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating \n     numerous cases in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands of women being recruited from the Philippines, China, \n     and other Asian countries expressly for criminal sexual \n     activity, and has also described this situation as the \n     ``systematic trafficking of women and minors for \n     prostitution;''\n       (20) the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is \n     exempt from Federal immigration law, the Federal minimum wage \n     law, and Federal tariffs and taxes, yet its products are sold \n     as ``Made in USA'' although 95 percent of the workers in the \n     garment manufacturing industry are not U.S. citizens;\n       (21) garments made in the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands carrying the ``Made in USA'' label compete \n     directly with garments made on the United States mainland by \n     workers and businesses that are subject to Federal \n     immigration law, the Federal minimum wage law, and Federal \n     taxes;\n       (22) in 1996, garment manufacturers in the Commonwealth \n     shipped garments to the Continental United States with a \n     wholesale value of $555 million, a 30 percent increase over \n     the previous year;\n       (23) Congress appropriated $10 million to fund a 3-year \n     initiative by the U.S. Departments of Justice, Labor, and \n     Interior to assist the Commonwealth in its efforts to improve \n     its labor and immigration policies;\n       (24) despite this appropriation there has been little or no \n     improvement in the immigration and labor policies of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands;\n       (25) the government of the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands has been ineffective in stemming the flow of \n     immigration onto United States soil, raising the wage and \n     living standards for workers, and aggressively \n     prosecuting labor and human rights abuses;\n       (26) despite efforts by the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \n     administrations to persuade the government of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to correct \n     problems in the Commonwealth, the situation has only \n     deteriorated; and\n       (27) the continuing concern about labor abuses, the \n     Commonwealth's immigration policy, and the employment of \n     foreign workers in a manner that unfairly competes with other \n     U.S. manufacturing prompted President Clinton on May 30, 1997 \n     to notify the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands that Federal immigration and minimum wage \n     laws should be applied to the Commonwealth.\n\n     SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n       (a) Article V, Section 506 of the Covenant to Establish a \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political \n     Union with the United States of America (approved by Public \n     Law 94-241, 90 Stat. 263) is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof the following:\n       ``(e)(1) For purposes of entry into the Northern Mariana \n     Islands by any individual (but not for purposes of entry by \n     an individual into the United States from the Northern \n     Mariana Islands), the Immigration and Nationality Act shall \n     apply as if the Northern Mariana Islands were a State (as \n     defined in section 101(a)(36) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act).\n       ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), with respect to an \n     individual seeking entry into the Northern Mariana Islands \n     for purposes of employment in the textile, hotel, tourist, or \n     construction industry (including employment as a contractor), \n     the Federal statutes and regulations governing admission to \n     Guam of individuals described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act shall apply.

Not later \n     than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Commonwealth \n     of the Northern Mariana Islands Reform Act, the Attorney \n     General shall submit a report on the status of implementing \n     this section.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act except that the amendment designated as ``(e)(2)'' \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR TEXTILE FIBER PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) Public Law 94-241 is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 6. LABELING OF TEXTILE FIBER PRODUCTS.\n\n       ``(a) No textile fiber product that is made or assembled in \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall have a \n     stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification or \n     substitute therefore on or affixed to the product stating \n     `Made in USA' or otherwise stating or implying that the \n     product was made or assembled in the United States unless the \n     product is made or assembled using direct labor that meets \n     the required percentage of qualified manhours.\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\n       ``(b) A textile fiber product that does not meet the \n     requirements of subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     misbranded for purposes of the Textile Fiber Products \n     Identification Act (Public Law 85-897, 72 Stat. 1717).\n       ``(c) In this section:\n       ``(1) Direct labor.--The term `direct labor' includes any \n     work provided to prepare, assemble, process, package, or \n     transport a textile fiber product, but does not include \n     supervisory, management, security, or administrative work.\n       ``(2) Freely associated states.--The term `Freely \n     Associated States'  means the Republic of Palau, the Republic \n     of the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of \n     Micronesia.\n       ``(3) Qualified manhours.--The term `qualified manhours \n     means the manhours of direct labor performed by persons who \n     are citizens or nationals of the United States or citizen of \n     the Freely Associated States.\n       ``(4) Required percentage.--The term `required percentage' \n     means--\n       ``(A) 20 percent, for the period beginning January 1, 1998, \n     through December 31, 1998;\n       ``(B) 35 percent, for the period beginning January 1, 1999, \n     through December 31, 1999; and\n       ``(C) 50 percent, for the period beginning January 1, 2000, \n     and thereafter.\n       ``(b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Section 503 of Article V of the Covenant to Establish a \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political \n     Union with the United States of America, approved by Public \n     Law 94-241 is amended by deleting ``States; and (c) the \n     minimum wage provisions of Section 6, Act of June 25, 1938, \n     52 Stat. 1062, as amended,'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``States.''.\n       (b) Public Law 94-241, 90 Stat. 263, is amended by adding \n     at the end thereof the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 7.

The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     include the results of such study in the annual report, \n     entitled ``Federal-CNMI Initiative on Labor, Immigration, and \n     Law Enforcement,'' transmitted to Congress.\n\n     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Federal-CNMI Initiative on Labor, Immigration, and Law Enforcement In \n      the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, July 1997\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       The United States took the Northern Mariana Islands from \n     Japan in 1944 and administered the islands under a United \n     Nations trusteeship agreement until 1986. At that time, the \n     Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands in Political Union with the United States of America \n     (Covenant) came into full effect, and the residents were \n     granted United States citizenship. In developing their \n     Covenant agreement with the United States, the Northern \n     Marianas negotiators expressed concern that the Federal \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) would permit excessive \n     immigration to the islands from neighboring Asian countries \n     that would permanently overwhelm the local culture and \n     community. Federal negotiators and the Congress, therefore, \n     agreed to not immediately extend Federal immigration control. \n     Ironically, CNMI policies have resulted in aliens becoming a \n     majority of the island's population. These policies include \n     use of low-wage temporary alien workers for permanent jobs \n     and the aggressive promotion of garment manufacturing. Wages \n     lower than the Federal minimum wage are possible because the \n     Federal minimum wage was not extended to the Northern Mariana \n     Islands. The garment industry takes advantage of the \n     immigration and minimum wage exemption privileges, as well as \n     privileged exceptions to the Federal trade laws, to ship \n     products partially manufactured in the islands into the \n     United States market even though the islands are outside the \n     customs territory of the United States.\n       Federal officials have expressed concern about the CNMI \n     alien labor system since at least 1984, when the Interior \n     Department's Assistant Secretary for Territorial and \n     International Affairs first officially suggested the \n     extension of Federal immigration authority as provided in \n     section 503 of the Covenant. Despite repeated expressions of \n     Federal concern with CNMI policies, the CNMI imported \n     increasing numbers of temporary alien workers and promoted \n     the garment industry's expansion. The Congress, in 1994, \n     directed the establishment of a joint program with the CNMI \n     to respond to the widening range of labor, immigration, and \n     law enforcement problems. After three years under this \n     Federal-CNMI Initiative on Labor, Immigration, and Law \n     Enforcement (Initiative), agencies report that these negative \n     trends not only persist, but in a number of instances, are \n     worsening:\n       United States citizens--mostly indigenous people--are now a \n     minority of the population. The CNMI population has grown by \n     250 percent since the 1980 census. Temporary alien workers \n     now comprise 69 percent of the labor force. The children of \n     alien mothers not born in the CNMI, the United States or the \n     freely associated states account for 16 percent of United \n     States citizens in the CNMI.\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Service finds that the \n     CNMI immigration system is ineffective, resulting in a large \n     CNMI illegal immigrant population and the smuggling of \n     illegals into the United States immigration zone. Estimates \n     of illegal aliens in the CNMI range from 4.2 percent to 25.5 \n     percent of United States citizen population in the CNMI. The \n     Department of Justice finds that the foreign criminal \n     presence is increasing.\n       Alien workers account for over 90 percent of the CNMI's \n     private sector workforce, while unemployment among locally-\n     born United States citizens is at 14.2 percent.\n       Worker complaints over wages due and working conditions \n     continue undiminished, with the governments of the \n     Philippines and China expressing concern about the treatment \n     of their citizens. Allegations persist regarding the CHMI's \n     inability to protect workers against crimes such as \n     illegal recruitment, battery, rape, child labor, and \n     forced prostitution.\n       Some workers labor under ``shadow'' or secondary contracts \n     signed in their home country that subvert their rights under \n     the Constitution of the United States, such as their right to \n     engage in political and religious activities while on United \n     States soil.\n       CNMI alien labor policies are having a profound negative \n     effect on public services and infrastructure such as \n     education, health care, public safety, water, sewer, and \n     solid waste disposal.\n       Apparel manufacturers operating in the CNMI, who mainly \n     employ workers from the People's Republic of China, label \n     their products ``Made in USA'', and use Chinese fabric not \n     subject to United States duty or quota. By using the CNMI as \n     an apparel manufacturing base, these manufacturers avoid \n     duties and are not subject to United States quotas on \n     finished products. These imports adversely affect the United \n     States apparel industry's employment and profits.\n       The CNMI is a producer of several sensitive apparel \n     products where United States producers' share of the market \n     is 50 percent or less. Imports of these sensitive apparel \n     products from the CNMI, at an average landed value of $462.7 \n     million in 1996, represented 5.7 percent of total United \n     States imports of these products. In recent years, total \n     garment shipments from the CNMI to the United States have \n     increased by 30 percent a year, with an acceleration to 45 \n     percent in the first four months of 1997 over the same months \n     in 1996. The average landed value of CNMI garment shipments \n     to the United States is now at a rate of $625 million \n     annually.\n       Federal agencies have worked closely with the CNMI leaders \n     to correct these problems under the Initiative. Work \n     continues with many conscientious CNMI officials. The \n     Administration, however, finds that the government of the \n     CNMI is unwilling to alter its basic immigration, minimum \n     wage, and garment manufacturing policies; and that there are \n     fundamental weaknesses in law enforcement.\n       The Administration, therefore, believes that a Federal \n     policy framework addressing immigration, minimum wage, and \n     the duty-free shipment of products is needed to properly \n     address these problems and to promote CNMI economic \n     development consistent with our country's policies and \n     values.\n       Accordingly, the Administration recommends that the \n     Congress extend Federal\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\n     immigration and minimum wage policies as provided in section \n     503 of the Covenant. In addition, the Administration \n     recommends that the Congress close the loophole being \n     exploited by the CNMI garment industry by requiring \n     certification that at least 50 percent United States labor \n     (and freely associated state citizen labor) is employed in \n     order for products to carry the ``Made in USA'' label and \n     receive duty-free access to the United States market. \n     Finally, in order to minimize adverse economic consequences, \n     the Administration plans to work with CNMI representatives, \n     and proposes that these measures be phased in by the Congress \n     in a reasonable and appropriate manner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n      Department of State, Office of Chinese and Mongolian affairs\n\n     Date: July 22, 1997.\n     To: Patrick McGary, Office of Senator Akaka.\n     From: Cari Enav.\n     RE: Hiuzhou Corporation of the Overseas Labor Service.\n       Message: According to the Huizhou Foreign Affairs Office, \n     the Huizhou Corporation of the Overseas Labor Services is \n     state-owned enterprise.

Afraid to \n     go to the local authorities, Mrs. Landeza had walked for \n     hours to the refuge of an underground network on Rota.\n       Mrs. Doromal, then 40, quickly dressed and set out to help. \n     Such missions were in stark contrast to what the art teacher \n     from Vernon, Conn., expected when she first came to the U.S.-\n     owned Northern Mariana Islands, a scattering of volcanic \n     specks in the western Pacific Ocean.\n       Mrs. Doromal and her family loved Rota's sandy beaches and \n     clear, blue ocean. But drastic changes were taking place in \n     this paradise--changes that have deeply stained America's \n     reputation as the champion of human rights all over the \n     world.\n       Lured by fee-driven recruiters, thousands of poor Asian \n     ``guest workers'' were entering the Northern Marianas. \n     Virtually every native household had at least one Philippine \n     maid.\n       Mrs. Doromal soon discovered serious cases of workers being \n     cheated out of wages and physically abused. The transgressors \n     were the native population--an elite minority who maintained \n     effective control of every government function. Although the \n     newcomers outnumbered the natives, they had no voice or vote. \n     And so Wendy Doromal, less than 5 feet tall but forceful and \n     articulate, gradually became their advocate.\n       ``When I saw Thelma that morning,'' Mrs. Doromal recalls, \n     ``the fear shot from her face into my heart. She'd been \n     beaten and she was crying and trembling.''\n       Mrs. Landeza's tale was harrowing. At 38 and widowed, the \n     small, sweet-faced woman had sought work in the Northern \n     Marianas to send money to her five children in the \n     Philippines. ``It was supposed to be like going to America,'' \n     she said.\n       But that's not the way it turned out for Mrs. Landeza or \n     thousands of other men and women like her. From 1990 to 1993, \n     she says, she was paid the domestic wage of 69 cents an hour \n     for 12-hour days; she also was ``rented out'' to another \n     party for an additional six hours a day, for which she never \n     saw a cent. Mrs. Landeza was supposed to have Sundays off but \n     says she did not.\n       Like many other workers, Mrs. Landeza was afraid to \n     complain to local labor officials. She says her boss, Rafael \n     Quitugua, flaunted his connections with those very people. \n     She couldn't risk being returned jobless to the Philippines.\n       Then, according to Mrs. Landeza, on the night of Oct. 16, \n     1993, Mr. Quitugua ordered her to clean up a bar he owned. \n     Driving her back home, the man reached for Mrs. Landeza and \n     said, ``I like you very much.'' He veered down a path toward \n     an isolated beach.\n\n\n                            no action taken\n\n       ``I screamed and fought him and begged him to take me \n     home,'' she said. ``But he beat me and finally raped me. He \n     said, `If you ever tell what happened, I'll kill you.' ''\n       Mrs. Doromal didn't want this to become another \n     unprosecuted case because of ``insufficient evidence.'' So \n     she and Mrs. Landeza took the first morning flight to the \n     island of Saipan, the Northern Marianas' seat of government.\n       There, Dr. David McGarey of the Commonwealth Health Center \n     noted abrasions on Mrs. Landeza's body. He diagnosed \n     ``apparent rape'' and collected specimens for a rape evidence \n     kit that he turned over to authorities.\n       Mrs. Doromal also summoned Renato Villapando, principal \n     officer of the Philippine consulate. To assure immediate \n     attention, he wrote a detailed account of Mrs.\n\n[[Page S8557]]\n\n     Landeza's story that he sent to the attorney general of the \n     Northern Marianas.\n       Weeks passed, however, and then months. No charges were \n     brought. Mr. Quitugua, meanwhile, maintained his innocence.\n       American interest in the Northern Marianas was born in the \n     blood of 5,289 troops who died there in 1944 wresting the \n     islands from the Japanese. The territories languished for \n     decades until 1976, when the U.S. Congress created the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).\n       A decade later, its residents became American citizens. \n     Under the agreement, Congress allowed the CNMI to set its own \n     immigration policies, and the U.S. minimum wage would not \n     apply to its workers.\n       The result was rapid economic growth as entrepreneurs \n     flocked to Saipan to open factories and develop tourism. The \n     most common products were garments carrying the coveted \n     ``Made in U.S.A.'' label that entered the U.S. mainland duty-\n     free. From all over Asia, especially the Philippines, \n     destitute workers arrived to work in these factories and in \n     the islands' booming hotels, restaurants and bars.\n       Their wages, though higher than in their native countries, \n     were quite low--and remain so today. The biggest winners are \n     the natives. The law grants a legal monopoly of all land in \n     the Northern Marianas to these Pacific islanders, who can \n     lease their property to factory and hotel operators at \n     handsome prices.\n       Today only about 38 percent of the CNMI population of \n     59,000 is of native descent.\n       ``They are an exclusive minority with the power to dominate \n     and exploit others,'' said Mikel W. Schwab, assistant U.S. \n     attorney and chief of the civil division that oversees the \n     CNMI. ``What's missing is equal protection under the law.''\n       Responsibility for human rights abuses lies ultimately with \n     the U.S. Congress, which oversees CNMI wage and immigration \n     policies. Legislation addressing these issues is now being \n     considered.\n       The case of Thelma Landeza was one of more than 500 \n     complaints that reached Mrs. Doromal starting in 1989.\n       While more than half the cases involved wage disputes, \n     others included workers tortured, forced into prostitution \n     and held in sexual servitude.\n       ``In my own experience as a civil prosecutor,'' said Mr. \n     Schwab, ``I have witnessed a level of human exploitation that \n     makes Doromal's cases ring with credibility.''\n       But his civil division had no primary authority to \n     investigate or prosecute rapes and assaults that occurred in \n     jurisdictions under the control of the CNMI attorney \n     general's office.\n       Mrs. Doromal and her husband, Boboy, provided food and \n     shelter for workers and helped them file complaints. Most \n     important, they stood beside them in the face of predictable \n     wrath from their employers and government officials.\n\n\n                            hollow promises\n\n       As Mrs. Doromal continued her fearless campaign, CNMI \n     authorities sought to discredit her. She was accused of \n     everything from fabricating stories to harboring illegal \n     workers. By the summer of 1994, however, her files had become \n     the basis for a government task force investigation.\n       Growing publicity about worker abuses set off local rage \n     against Mrs. Doromal and her family. Anonymous phone calls \n     threatened death. The tires of the family car were slashed. \n     Her family was ostracized, and this pressure forced Mrs. \n     Doromal to resign from her teaching position.\n       On Aug. 29, 1994, the Doromals fled to Saipan. There, CNMI \n     Gov. Froilan C. Tenorio met with Mrs. Doromal and assured her \n     that the worst labor abusers would be prosecuted.\n       In September, Mr. Tenorio sat before a U.S. Senate \n     subcommittee in Washington. With great humility he conceded \n     that many of the charges reported in the press--which were \n     first raised by Mrs. Doromal--were accurate:\n       ``I am saddened and ashamed. Workers have been cheated and \n     forced to live in subhuman conditions, locked in during \n     nonwork hours, and been beaten and raped. Our administration \n     will do everything in our power to end labor abuse''.\n\n\n                           blaming the victim\n\n       A few days after meeting with Mr. Tenorio, Mrs. Doromal \n     received a call from Rota's underground network. A hysterical \n     young woman named Teresa--not her real name--was claiming \n     that for several weeks she had been locked up by her employer \n     and repeatedly raped.\n       Mrs Doromal arranged for Teresa to be brought to a Saipan \n     hospital. ``She kept going into corners and rocking back and \n     forth, crying,'' Mrs. Doromal said.\n       Teresa, 24, was an animated woman who had studied hotel and \n     restaurant management in the Philippines. But employment \n     there was scarce. A job on Rota with an establishment \n     described by the recruiter as an ``upscale restaurant'' \n     seemed the surest route to good money. The establishment, \n     however, was little more than a brothel.\n       In desperation, Teresa accepted the friendly overtures of a \n     politically well-connected many who got her out of the club. \n     Teresa says she went to work for him--only to be locked in a \n     remote farmhouse where she was tied up, beaten and raped \n     daily until she escaped after three weeks.\n       Under the glare of publicity stirred up by Mrs. Doromal, \n     the CNMI attorney general's office investigated Teresa's \n     case. Four months later, it concluded that the evidence was \n     insufficient to go to trial. The case was dropped.\n       Two weeks after Teresa's case was dropped, Mr. Tenorio was \n     back in Washington to inform Congress that his administration \n     was making substantial progress in cleaning up human rights \n     violations. Employers who abuse contract workers, he said, \n     ``are being investigated, prosecuted and convicted.''\n       To Mrs. Doromal, such words meant that nothing had changed. \n     But with no regular job, her family couldn't stay in the \n     Northern Marianas; they returned to the U.S. mainland in May \n     1995.\n       In December 1995, nearly a year after Mr. Tenorio last told \n     Congress he was cleaning up human right violations, Maria--\n     not her real name--a tiny Philippine woman with a childlike \n     face, stood frozen on the stage of a Rota nightclub tears in \n     her eyes. It was Maria's first night of work, and she had \n     been promised she would never be asked to dance nude. But now \n     amid catcalls, her boss was demanding that she strip.\n       He threatened her until she gave in. But that wasn't \n     enough; soon he demanded that she have sex with him and ``go \n     out with customers.'' Maria refused. She was forced from her \n     job and returned to the Philippines, where she told her story \n     to Reader's Digest.\n       Despite such reports, CNMI acting Attorney General Robert \n     B. Dunlap II claims conditions are much improved.\n       ``We sent two investigators to Rota,'' he said. ``They \n     stayed a week trying to attract a prostitute--and never found \n     one.''\n       Mr. Tenorio, up for re-election in November, maintains he \n     is doing all he can to make a good situation for contract \n     workers even better. Meanwhile, he is conducting a $1 million \n     public relations campaign to shore up the CNMI's image, \n     bringing dozens of congressmen and staffers to tour the \n     Northern Marianas.\n       ``The thinking is `Don't fix the problem, fix the image,' \n     '' said Eric Grigoire, a New Jersey native who is the human \n     rights advocate for the Catholic Church in the Northern \n     Marianas. He is still summoned to Rota regularly by Mrs. \n     Doromal's original underground network.\n       What of Thelma Landeza? In February 1995--more than 16 \n     months after she reported being kidnapped, raped and beaten--\n     her boss, Rafael Quitugua, was charged with the crime, He \n     pleaded not guilty. In December 1995 the charge was dropped.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Star-Bulletin, June 6, 1997]\n\n           Exploited in Saipan Sex Bar, Teen Finds Haven Here\n\n\n Isle Filipino Coalition for Solidarity is a Godsend for Abused Workers\n\n                          (By Susan Kreifels)\n\n       Katrina turns 16 Monday, finally getting a taste of \n     sweetness in her otherwise bitter dose of life.\n       Hawaii's Filipino Coalition for Solidarity has provided the \n     teenage girl haven since March from her grim life in Saipan, \n     where she said she had been sexually exploited in a barroom \n     since she was 14.\n       The civil rights advocacy group hopes to find a way to keep \n     her in the United States, far from threats from her former \n     employers, who now face a federal lawsuit on Saipan for \n     alleged violations of child labor and wage laws.\n       Katrina is the young girl's stage name. Her real name is \n     being withheld to protect her identity in the eighth-grade \n     classroom she now attends on Oahu.\n       Born in Manila to a poor squatter family, she ran away when \n     she was 13, ending up in the arms of unscrupulous recruiters.\n       Although she admits she lied that she was 19 in the \n     beginning, Katrina said she later told the recruiters her \n     real age.\n       But, according to the girl, the recruiters arranged a \n     passport that claimed she was born in 1974 instead of 1981.\n       Katrina ended up in Saipan, where her recruiter-boss \n     promised to make her a ``starlet.'' But for the then 14-year-\n     old, it was a horror role in which customers abused her naked \n     body and had live sex with her and other bar girls on stage.\n       Performances, she said, were videotaped. If she didn't do \n     what she was told, her bosses threatened to ship her back to \n     the Philippines at her own expense.\n       ``I was scared. I don't have any money. What happens to me? \n     Maybe I will die.''\n       Katrina describes her life as one much older than her \n     years.\n       She and other Filipino women who worked in the Saipan bar \n     stayed in barracks, virtual prisoners who couldn't go out. \n     ``They treated us like animals.''\n       She sent most of her salary home to her mother.\n       ``In school, I was very religious. I feel there is no God \n     anymore. I prayed but no response,'' she said.\n       She drank alcohol every night because ``it's easier to do \n     anything if you're drunk. You can't really feel anything.\n       ``I try to put it behind me. Sometimes I think, how did I \n     do that? Animal people only do that. I get depressed.''\n       Last October she went to government labor officials on \n     Saipan and filed a complaint, which led to the U.S. \n     Department of Labor lawsuit. Her former employers tried to \n     bribe her to give up her complaint, ``but I wanted to see \n     justice.''\n       And, she says with some disbelief, ``after all I \n     experienced, suddenly I'm here.''\n\n\n                       Coalition monitors Saipan\n\n       Nic Musico of the Filipino Coalition for Solidarity said \n     the Hawaii group has been\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\n     monitoring abuse of Filipino workers in the Commonwealth of \n     Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory 3,900 miles west \n     of Hawaii, for the last four years. The group has given haven \n     to other Filipino workers.\n       The commonwealth, which doesn't fall under U.S. wage or \n     immigration laws, offers low minimum wages ($2.95) and tax \n     incentives that have fueled Saipan's $500 million-a-year \n     garment industry. More than 30,000 imported laborers from the \n     Philippines, China and other Asian countries work the mills \n     on this small island of 25,000 citizens. The government says \n     without the foreign workers, its garment and tourism industry \n     would collapse.\n       There were more than 500 labor complaints filed last year, \n     according to the commonwealth government. Some are passed \n     along to the U.S. Department of Labor to pursue. In 1994, the \n     department successfully sued a Japanese company that owned \n     several bars employing underage girls.\n       The lawsuit involving Katrina and her co-workers, filed in \n     the U.S. District Court in Saipan, is not expected to go to \n     trial until late this year. Defendants Eugene R. Zamora, Sr., \n     and Marylou ``Malou'' Zamora, whom Katrina said brought her \n     to Saipan from the Philippines, are believed to have returned \n     to their home country. Defendant Francisco Matsunaga, the \n     Zamoras' partner at the Club Kalesa, where Katrina worked, \n     died last November.\n       Michael Bayer, wage and hour investigator on Saipan for the \n     U.S. Department of Labor, said the foreign workers are tied \n     to one-year contracts they know don't have to be renewed.\n       ``The more abused, poor, desperate they are in their home \n     country, the more willing they are to put up with someplace \n     else,'' said Bayer, emphasizing he was giving a personal \n     opinion rather than an official one. ``They have no voice. \n     There are no unions. The only outlet is to file a \n     complaint.''\n\n\n                         clinton sends warning\n\n       There are moves in Congress to force the commonwealth to \n     comply with U.S. wage and immigration laws. Last week \n     President Clinton sent commonwealth Gov. Froilan C. Tenorio a \n     letter warning that his administration would work with \n     Congress to extend U.S. laws there:\n       ``The minimum wage is plainly inadequate; there have been \n     persistent incidents of improper treatment of alien workers \n     and inadequate enforcement of their rights; and manufacturers \n     using foreign workers unfairly compete with other production \n     under the U.S. flag,'' Clinton's letter said. He said he \n     would work with Congress to amend the 1976 covenant that \n     created a political union with the islands and made their \n     residents U.S. citizens but allowed the commonwealth to \n     control its immigration and minimum wage.\n       Dave Ecret, acting public information officer for Tenorlo's \n     office, said the commonwealth has made ``tremendous \n     improvements'' in the labor situation and believes Clinton \n     has been misinformed of the current situation.\n       Some Republicans in Congress agree. Rep. Dick Armey, House \n     majority leader, and Rep. Tom DeLay, House majority whip, \n     assured Tenorio this week in a letter that any legislation \n     that would ``harm the economic, social or political well \n     being of the CNMI is counter to the principles of the \n     Republican Party, and this Congress has no intention of \n     voting on such legislation.'' The two commended the islands \n     for their commitment to ending labor problems.\n\n\n                          Akaka backs Clinton\n\n       Hawaii's Sen. Daniel Akaka, a Democrat, said yesterday at \n     he supported Clinton's letter and would work to bring changes \n     in the commonwealth, where ``horror stories of labor abuses \n     continue to abound, while CNMI (commonwealth) officials \n     launch a public relations campaign touting the territory as \n     an economic model for the rest of the nation.''\n       Ecret said the government has forced companies to clean up \n     workers' barracks and doubled the commonwealth government's \n     immigration and labor staffs to more quickly resolve abuse \n     cases.\n       Ecret also said businesses must pay room and board in \n     addition to minimum wages, raising the cost of labor of \n     Saipan. He said any changes in labor and immigration laws on \n     Saipan would be ``devastating'' to the economy.\n       While politicians debate the bigger issues, members of the \n     Filipino Coalition for Solidarity are working to protect the \n     people caught up in them, like Katrina. Musico said his group \n     has solicited people to adopt Katrina, but time is running \n     out--an adoption application must be filed before she turns \n     16. Musico is more optimistic that she will be granted \n     special asylum.\n       For now, Katrina has been given permission to stay in the \n     United States until November.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bryan, \n        Mr. Bennett, Mr. Burns, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Campbell, \n        Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 1102. A bill to amend the general mining laws to provide a \nreasonable royalty from mineral activities on Federal lands, to specify \nreclamation requirements for mineral activities on Federal lands, to \ncreate a State program for the reclamation of abandoned hard rock \nmining sites on Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   the mining law reform act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in the last Congress, Members in the Senate \nand our colleagues in the other Chamber worked hard to reform the laws \nunder which the U.S. mining industry operate on the vast Federal lands \nof the west. Members on both sides of the aisle, from all regions of \nthe country, acknowledged that the Mining Law of 1872 needed change. \nThis body and the other body passed legislation to reform the mining \nlaw only to have our efforts vetoed by the President. I believe it is \ntime to make another effort to pass mining reform legislation and to \nengage the Clinton administration in meaningful discussion that can \nbring to a close the long and fruitless debate we have so far had on \nthis issue.\n  Today, I am introducing, a bipartisan bill in conjunction with \nChairman Murkowski, Senator Reid, and Senator Bryan and five other of \nour colleagues to legislatively solve the problems that we see with the \nmining law. The Mining Law Reform Act of 1997, is a bill which will \nensure continued mineral production in the United States. It provides \nfor a fair economic return from minerals extracted on public lands, and \nwill link mining practices on federal lands to State and Federal \nenvironmental laws and land-use plans. This bill provides a balanced \nand equitable solution to concerns raised over the existing mining law.\n  Mining in the United States is an important part of our nation's \neconomy. It serves the national interest by maintaining a steady and \nreliable supply of the materials that drive our industries. Revenue \nfrom mining fuels local economies by providing family income and \npreserving community tax bases. Mining has become an American success \nstory. Fifteen years ago, U.S. manufacturers were forced to rely on \nforeign producers for 75 percent of the gold they needed. Today, the \nU.S. is more than self-sufficient. The combined direct and indirect \nimpact on the economy of our nation by the mining industry in 1995 was \nalmost $524 billion. This is nine times the value of the actual \nminerals that were mined. Obviously we are talking about a very \nsignificant portion of our economy and one that we can not cavalierly \nassign to the economic antique shed. This information is from a recent \nreport by the Western Economic Analysis Center. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the summary of this report be made a part of the Record.\n  Mining, however, is a business associated with enormous up-front \ncosts and marginal profits. Excessive royalties discourage, and in \nother countries have discouraged, mineral exploration. Too large a \nroyalty would undermine the competitiveness of the mining industry. The \nend result of excessive government involvement would be the movement of \nmining operations overseas and the loss of American jobs. The \nlegislation I am introducing today will keep U.S. mines competitive and \nprevent the movement of U.S. jobs to other countries.\n  The General Mining Law is the cornerstone of U.S. mining practices. \nIt establishes a useful relationship between industry and government to \npromote the extraction of minerals from mineral rich Federal lands. \nAlthough the cornerstone of this laws was originally enacted in 1872, \nit remains to function effectively today. The law has been amended and \nrevised many times since its original passage. The legislation I am \nintroducing today preserves the solid foundation provided by this law \nand makes some important revisions that address the concerns that have \nbeen paramount in this debate that I have been involved in for nearly a \ndecade.\n\n  Specifically, the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997 will insure revenue \nto the Federal Government by imposing fair and equitable fees and a net \nroyalty. It requires payment of fair market value for lands to be \nmined. It assures lands will return to the public sector if they are \nnot developed for mineral production, as is intended in this \nlegislation. Furthermore, to prevent mining interests from using \npatented land for purposes other than mining, the bill limits occupancy \nto that which is only necessary to carry out mining activities.\n  To ensure mining activities do not unnecessarily degrade Federal \nlands,\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\nthe Mining Law Reform Act mandates compliance with all Federal, State \nand local environmental laws with regard to land use and reclamation. \nTo enforce these provisions, the bill includes civil penalties and the \nauthority for compliance orders.\n  Finally, this bill creates a program to address the environmental \nproblems associated with abandoned mines. Working directly with the \nStates, the Mining Law Reform Act directs fees and royalty receipts to \nthe abandoned mine cleanup programs. It is time we have a workable \nmechanism to clean up these relics of the past.\n  The legislation we are proposing today is in the best interest of the \nAmerican people because it provides revenue from public resources, \nassures mines will be developed in an environmentally sensitive manner \nand that abandoned mines from earlier eras will be reclaimed. It is \nfair to mining interests because it imposes reasonable fees and \nroyalties, and it is good for the environment because it assures that \nsound land use and reclamation practices are followed. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this legislation and look forward \nto hearings and Senate legislative action.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Mining and the American Economy\n\n\n                     Everything Begins With Mining\n\n                 (Prepared by George F.

That $523.6 billion total economic \n     benefit was nearly nine times the value of the solid minerals \n     that were mined in the United States that year.\n       Nearly five million Americans had jobs in 1995 as a result \n     of the combined direct and indirect contributions of the \n     mining industry to personal, business, and government income \n     throughout the nation. The total number of jobs created both \n     directly and indirectly in the nation's economy by the \n     domestic mining industry was more than 15 times the number of \n     workers directly involved in mining.\n       The nation's business firms realized the greatest benefits \n     from the mining industry's monetary contributions to the \n     American economy in 1995. The nearly $296 billion in sales \n     revenues obtained by domestic business firms directly and \n     indirectly as a result of the income stream created by mining \n     comprised 56% of the industry's total impact on the nation's \n     economy.\n       Individual Americans and their families also received a \n     significant amount of personal income as a result of mining's \n     direct and indirect monetary contributions to the national \n     economy in 1995. The nearly $144 billion received by \n     residents of the United States in 1995 as a direct or \n     indirect result of the income streams created by the mining \n     industry amounted to more than three percent of all earnings \n     received by the country's workers. It was more than the \n     personal income earned by all of the residents of Georgia and \n     Mississippi combined in 1995, and it was almost as much as \n     the personal income received by the residents of Arkansas, \n     Louisiana, and the District of Columbia from all sources. \n     That $143.7 billion total of personal income from mining was \n     enough to pay the wages of nearly five million American \n     workers, only 6% of whom were actually employed in mining.\n       The federal government also shared in the economic benefit \n     generated by the mining industry in 1995. Almost $57 billion \n     in revenues received by the federal government in 1995 were \n     generated either directly or indirectly from the income \n     streams created by mining in the United States. That amounted \n     to nearly 11% of mining's total contribution to the nation's \n     economy.\n       State and local governments likewise shared in the \n     contributions to the national economy made by the domestic \n     mining industry. More than $27 billion of the revenues \n     received by state and local governments throughout the \n     country in 1995 were provided either directly or indirectly \n     from the income streams that were created by mining. That was \n     equivalent to about 4% of all state and local taxes levied in \n     1995. It represented about 5% of the entire monetary \n     contribution of the nation's mining industry to the national \n     economy. It gave government at all levels (federal, state, \n     and local) a 16% share of mining's total contribution to the \n     nation's economy.\n       Among the 50 states, California received the greatest \n     economic benefit from the mining industry. The state ranked \n     first in combined direct and indirect economic benefit \n     from the mining of solid minerals, even though it ranked \n     only fifth in the value of such minerals produced. The \n     Californai economy gained more than $52 billion and \n     469,000 jobs in 1995 as a result of the combined direct \n     and indirect impacts of mining in the United States. The \n     gain came partly as a result of the state's role as a \n     minerals producer and also as a manufacturing, trade, \n     service, and financial center for much of the western \n     United States as well as its role as a major beneficiary \n     of the redistribution effects of the federal tax system.\n\n\n  Table 1--Combined Direct and Indirect Contributions of the American \n Mining

industry in 1995, with a total boost to its \n     economy of more than $31 billion and more than 227,000 jobs. \n     The impact on New York was partly the result of the state's \n     direct role as a minerals producer but more a result of its \n     role as a major trade, manufacturing, and financial center \n     and as a major beneficiary of the income redistribution \n     effect of federal spending.\n       Texas was not far behind New York in total economic gain \n     from mining in 1995. The state has the nation's eighth \n     largest mining industry, directly providing more than 16,000 \n     jobs. In 1995, the Texas economy gained almost $29 billion \n     and more than 308,000 jobs as a direct and indirect result of \n     mining in the United States.\n       Pennsylvania was very close behind Texas in total economic \n     benefit from the mining industry in 1995. The state has a \n     major mining industry of its own, ranking sixth in value of \n     mine output in 1995, but its bigger gain came as a result of \n     its position as a manufacturing center for the nation, \n     selling products and services to mining and other enterprises \n     in other states. In 1995, the Pennsylvania economy gained \n     almost $29 billion and 246,000 jobs as a direct and indirect \n     result of mining in the United States.\n       Among the top 20 states that gained the most personal, \n     business, and government income directly and indirectly from \n     mining in 1995, 12 of them, including California, New York, \n     Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois,\n\n[[Page S8560]]\n\n     Indiana, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Virginia \n     and Georgia, although they had significant mining industries \n     of their own, actually received more business income from \n     mining in other states. Their biggest gains come from selling \n     products and services to mining enterprises in other states \n     and through the disbursement of government revenues collected \n     from firms that had mining operations in other states.\n       Among the 20 states that gained the most economically from \n     mining in 1995, only two (California and Arizona) were in the \n     public land areas of the West traditionally thought of as \n     being the center of American mining. Six (Ohio, Illinois, \n     Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Missouri) were in the \n     Midwest, while eight (Kentucky, West Virginia, Texas, \n     Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama) were \n     in the South and another four (New York, Pennsylvania, New \n     Jersey, and Massachusetts) were in the Northeast.\n       More than 90% of the total impact of mining on the economy \n     of the United States in 1995 was in the form of indirect \n     personal, business, and government income generated by the \n     circulation and recirculation through the nation's economy of \n     the mining industry's direct payments to persons, other \n     businesses, and governments. Those direct payments, while \n     making up only 9% of the total impact, were themselves \n     substantial, particularly in those states where mining \n     activity took place and in states where manufacturers and \n     other businesses produced products and services for use in \n     mining.\n       Direct payments by mining firms to individuals, other \n     businesses, and governments in the United States in 1995 \n     totalled more than $48 billion. Of that total, the industry \n     paid over $14.5 billion (30%) as personal income \n     to employees, former employees, and stockholders. More \n     than 85% of that amount went to pay the wages and salaries \n     of current employees, while nearly all of the remaining \n     15% went to pay pensions to former employees and dividends \n     to investors.\n\n\n Table 2--Direct Contributions of the American Mining Industry to the \n           Economies of the Individual United States in 1995\n\n\n        State                                       Total direct impact\nAlabama..................................................$1,342,230,000\nAlaska......................................................213,388,000\nArizona...................................................2,299,706,000\nArkansas....................................................334,147,000\nCalifornia................................................2,876,115,000\nColorado....................................................801,267,000\nConnecticut.................................................328,546,000\nDelaware....................................................100,729,000\nDist. of Columbia............................................17,968,000\nFlorida...................................................1,326,928,000\nGeorgia.....................................................829,196,000\nHawaii.......................................................80,974,000\nIdaho.......................................................280,470,000\nIllinois..................................................1,719,495,000\nIndiana...................................................1,103,017,000\nIowa........................................................433,192,000\nKansas......................................................348,926,000\nKentucky..................................................2,662,452,000\nLouisiana...................................................356,075,000\nMaine.......................................................102,133,000\nMaryland....................................................369,080,000\nMassachusetts...............................................581,349,000\nMichigan..................................................1,644,407,000\nMinnesota.................................................1,301,183,000\nMississippi.................................................200,552,000\nMissouri....................................................868,251,000\nMontana.....................................................458,813,000\nNebraska....................................................164,594,000\nNevada....................................................1,728,137,000\nNew Hampshire................................................99,845,000\nNew Jersey..................................................623,148,000\nNew Mexico..................................................638,176,000\nNew York..................................................1,314,774,000\nNorth Carolina..............................................876,359,000\nNorth Dakota................................................150,558,000\nOhio......................................................1,650,231,000\nOklahoma....................................................391,423,000\nOregon......................................................387,101,000\nPennsylvania..............................................2,300,648,000\nRhode Island.................................................68,760,000\nSouth Carolina..............................................423,942,000\nSouth Dakota................................................251,085,000\nTennessee...................................................608,122,000\nTexas.....................................................2,544,266,000\nUtah......................................................1,100,239,000\nVermont......................................................72,397,000\nVirginia..................................................1,019,016,000\nWashington..................................................719,353,000\nWest Virginia.............................................2,815,983,000\nWisconsin...................................................608,016,000\nWyoming...................................................1,361,726,000\nWyoming...................................................1,361,726,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Total..................................................44,898,488,000\n\nTotals do not include contributions to federal government revenues.\n\nSource of data: Western Economic Analysis Center.\n\n       The biggest share (56%) of the mining industry's direct \n     contributions to the national economy in 1995, however, went \n     to other businesses to pay for the products and services used \n     in the search for and production of minerals. Those direct \n     payments to suppliers of materials, equipment, energy, and \n     services used in mining amounted to over $27 billion. They \n     were made to suppliers located in every state of the Union \n     and the District of Columbia.\n       The nation's mining industry also made significant payments \n     directly to state and local governments, largely in the \n     states in which they conducted mining or processing \n     operations. The amount of such direct payments by mining \n     firms to state and local governments in 1995 approached $3.4 \n     billion.\n       The federal government got even more. Direct payments by \n     mining firms to the United States Government in payroll \n     taxes, income taxes, and other taxes and fees surpassed $3.5 \n     billion in 1995. That represented more than 7% of the \n     industry's total direct contribution to the American economy \n     last year.\n       The direct contributions of the mining industry to the \n     economies of the various states in 1995 tended to be the \n     greatest in those states in which the most mining activity \n     was conducted and which had the most suppliers providing \n     goods and services to mining firms in other states. Thus, \n     California, with major metal mining, construction minerals, \n     and industrial minerals mining industries, as well as large \n     manufacturing, trade, services, and financial sectors serving \n     mining firms in other states, led the list with a direct \n     impact from mining of almost $2.9 billion. West Virginia, \n     with the country's biggest coal mining industry (in terms of \n     value), was second with a direct impact in 1995 of more than \n     $2.8 billion.\n       Kentucky, with the nation's second largest coal mining \n     industry, as third in impact with a direct impact on its \n     economy of nearly $2.7 billion. Texas, with major metals, \n     construction minerals, industrial minerals, and coal mining \n     output, was fourth in direct impact with over $2.5 billion. \n     Pennsylvania, the nation's fifth most important source of \n     mined coal and third biggest producer of construction \n     minerals, was fifth in direct impact with more than $2.3 \n     billion.\n       Arizona, with the nation's largest copper mining industry \n     was sixth, receiving a direct impact of nearly $2.3 billion, \n     while Nevada, with the nation's largest gold mining industry, \n     was seventh with a direct economic gain of more than $1.7 \n     billion.

____\n\n\n\nthe impact of the mining industries on the economy of the united states\n\n       In 1995, the mining industries had a combined direct and \n     indirect impact on the economy of the United States of \n     $523.604 billion including combined direct and indirect \n     contributions of $143,742 billion in personal income (equal \n     to 5 million jobs), $295.712 billion in business income, \n     $56.992 billion in federal government revenues, and $27.158 \n     billion in state and local government revenues.\n       As a result of the circulation (and multiplication) of the \n     mining industry's total direct impact of $48.429 billion that \n     included direct payments of $3.373 billion to state and local \n     governments, $3.530 billion to the federal government, \n     $27.023 billion to other American businesses, and $14.503 \n     billion in personal income for Americans, including wages and \n     salaries for the industry's 320,400 employees, who labored to \n     produce minerals with a total value of $60.055 billion.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I stand today to add my strong support \nfor the introduction of this comprehensive package of reforms intended \nto bring this Nation's mining law into the 21st century.\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\n  There are few issues before the Senate that are more complex and \ncontentious than mining law reform. Make no mistake, it is an issue \nwithin which major ideologies compete. The outcome of these debates \nwill define for years to come the role public lands play in the \nNation's ability to maintain a viable strategic mining capability.\n  Across the Nation--from the White House, and from within this very \nchamber we have been regaled with stirring speeches on the short \ncomings of the 1872 mining law: the unfairness it imposes on the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately this rhetoric has served only to inflame \npassions and polarize the American public on this complex issue.\n  It will come as no surprise why, under these circumstances, mining \nlaw reform has been such a difficult undertaking within the Congress. \nThere is one additional circumstance which serves to frustrate \nlegitimate efforts to bring mining reform negotiations to a successful \nculmination. Legitimate reformers within the administration and the \nCongress have been joined by those who see mining reform as the perfect \nvehicle for ending mining on public lands. With these forces there is \nno appeasement. As reform proposals move toward addressing legitimate \nconcerns, the goal line is moved. As you can imagine, this causes a \ngreat deal of frustration among those of us engaged in serious reform \nefforts.\n  Be that as it may, the only unforgivable action this Senator could \ntake would be to abandoned the effort. In the great debate before us I \nwould ask you to look carefully at the issues--if you seek reform which \nbrings a fair return to the public treasury, that protects the \nenvironment, and preserves the Nation's ability to produce strategic \nminerals--then you will find a great deal to support in the legislation \nwe lay before you today.\n  I also take a great deal of pride in the fact that this legislation \ndoes not forget about the Nation's smallest mining operations. It will \nallow them to stay in business and to continue to compete on an even \nplaying field with the larger, better financed operations. And for \nthose of you who might wonder why small miners are important; you need \nonly remember that the great majority of large mining operations across \nthe country started out as a nothing more than a crazy idea inside the \nhead of a prospector simply too stubborn to give up on their dream.\n  On the other hand, if it is your intention to use mining reform as a \nvehicle to end mining on public lands or punish mining companies for \nmaking a profit, then you will find little in my legislation to aid in \nyour cause.\n  There is one resounding note of agreement across the Nation relating \nto mining reform--it is time to bring this piece of historic \nlegislation into the 21st century.\n  However, in our zeal to bring about this necessary modernization, we \nmust not forget what we are tinkering with. Bad decisions clouded with \nemotionally charged rhetoric can have devastating effects on a $5 \nbillion industry. An industry whose products form the muscle and sinew \nof the Nation's entire industrial output. We are taking into our hands \nthe well-being of 50,000 American miners, their families, and their \ncommunities. We will be reaching out and directly affecting the future \nwell-being of thousands who derive their primary source of income \nmanufacturing the goods and services which support this critical \nindustry. We owe it to that industry, those people, their communities, \nand the entire American public to make good decisions. There is simply \ntoo much at stake to let our collective emotions get in the way of good \ndecision making.\n  The Nation's first comprehensive mining laws were negotiated under \ntorchlite miner's courts, over copious amounts of whiskey, and down the \nbarrels of cocked six shooters. These laws literally emerged out of the \nmuck and grime of the gold fields of California, the silver fields of \nNevada, and countless other mining camps scattered across the American \nWest. The initial law was designed to give every miner the opportunity \nto compete on an even playing field without fear of having his hard \nearned gain taken away during the dark of night. The law was also \nintended to give a young nation a self sufficiency in its mineral \nneeds. The industrial revolution was upon us, and our mills and \nfactories were hungry for the raw mineral feed stocks necessary to keep \npace with the growing demand for industrial products.\n  And Mr. President I am here to tell you that we were successful. Due \nin no small part to the mining industry of this Nation and all the hard \nworking miners, the United States moved to the pre-eminent position \nthat enabled us to win two world wars and set a standard of living that \nis still the envy of the world.\n  This package of mining reforms contained in this legislation honors \nthe past, recognizes the present, and sets the stage for a bright \nfuture.\n  This legislation honors the past by refusing to abandon the basic \ntenets of the Nation's mining law. A system that allows for the \nlocation, development and production of mineral resources off the \npublic lands. Resources necessary to keep this country's mills and \nfactories working at full capacity.\n  We recognize the present through the creation of fair reforms which \nrecognize that over one hundred years have passed since the general \nmining laws went onto the books. During that time many changes have \noccurred in this country and the mining industry.\n  We set the stage for the future by placing instruments within the \nlegislation that directs the reclamation of old abandoned mine sites \nand preventing abuses in the exercise of the rights authorized within \nthe law.\n  Mr. President, we recognize that the time has come to reform the \ngeneral mining laws. But it must be reform that fixes the things which \nare wrong without destroying this important industry and the lives and \ncommunities dependent on it.\n  The legislation we offer today does that but in such a way that \ncorrects the problems with the law without killing the mining industry.\n  The legislation advances reforms in 4 general areas; royalty, \npatents, operations, and reclamation.\n  No area within the 1872 mining laws has been so greatly criticized as \nthe failure on the part of that legislation to require royalty to be \npaid for minerals extracted from public land.\n  The legislation that we introduce today corrects this. It requires \nthat 5 percent of the profit made from a mining operation on federal \nlands be paid to the federal government.\n  This legislation seeks a percentage of the profit, not the value of \nthe mineral in place. We do this for very specific reasons. Failure to \ndo so will cause the shutdown of many operations and prevent the \nopening of new mines. It will cause other operators to cast low ore \nconcentrates onto the spoil pile as they seek out only the very highest \ngrade ores.\n  Yes, highly profitable mines do exist and I am sure you are going to \nhear a lot about them from our opponents. But I can also assure you \nthat there is an equal number that operate on the margin. Mines are \nlike people, no two are alike. Through legislation we seek to create a \none-size-fits-all royalty. If that royalty is designed to address \nhighly profitable mines, many marginal mines will go under. That is why \nwe designed our royalty to take a percentage of the profits. If the \nmine makes money, the public gets a share. This approach recognizes \nthat the public benefits from a strong mining industry beyond the \nroyalty it might collect. A continuous and competitive supply of metals \nto the Nation's mills and factories, high paying mining jobs, and \nhealthy, viable communities also contribute to the common good.\n  I fail to see how the public good is served through the creation of a \nroyalty system so intrusive that it must be paid for through the loss \nof jobs, the health of local communities, and the abandonment of lower \ngrade mineral resources. For those of you who would dismiss these \npredictions need only look north of our borders to British Columbia to \nsee living proof of this prediction. In 1974 they put a royalty on \nminerals before cost of production was factored in.\n  Five thousand miners lost their jobs, mining diminished to the point \nwhere only one new mine went into operation in 1976. The industry was \ndevastated. The royalty was removed in 1978. Years later the industry \nstill has not completely recovered.\n  Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it--let us not forget \nthe experience of our neighbors to the north.\n  Patenting or the right to take title to lands containing minerals \nupon\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\ndemonstration that the parcel can support a profitable operation is \nanother area targeted for intense criticisms by opponents to existing \nmining law.\n  There is no doubt that there have been serious abuses of this \nprovision of the 1872 mining law. Unscrupulous individuals have located \nmineral operations for the soul purpose of gaining title and turning \nthe land into a lodge, resort or ski area. These practices are wrong \nand should be corrected. But it should not be done in a way that \npunishes the great majority of miners who patent lands for the sole \npurpose of mining. Punishing everyone to get at the few is absolutely \nwrong and down right un-American.\n  The legislation we introduce today cures the problem without \npunishing the innocent. We would continue to issue patents to operators \nwho are engaged in legitimate mining operations. However, we also \ninclude provisions allowing the Secretary to step in and reclaim lands \nshould it be determined that they are no longer being used for mining.\n  This approach protects the legitimate miner while insuring that \nunscrupulous operators can no longer turn mining operations into other \nactivities.\n  Much criticism has been levied in the past at the 1872 mining laws \nfor what has been called the encouragement of speculative activities on \nmineralized lands. Because no controls were in place, any person could \ngo out and stake lands purely for speculative purposes. This kept \nlegitimate miners from accessing lands for development and burdened the \nbureaucracy with mining claims that had no real mineral potential.\n  The legislation we introduce today addresses this practice. It \nrequires that a $25 filing fee be paid at the time the claim is filed, \nand makes permanent the $100 per year per claim maintenance fee. These \nfees will discourage speculative claim staking while allowing miners \nintent on mining access to lands.\n  The 1872 mining law did not address environmental protection. Our \nrevisions weave a tight environmental safety net to protect the federal \nlands. We include a permit process which requires secretarial approval \nfor all but the most minimal mineral related activities; furthermore, \nwe require that lands disturbed by mining be reclaimed to prevent undue \nand unnecessary environmental degradation. To correct situations where \nmine operations are abandoned, this legislation requires all operations \nbe fully bonded to pay for reclamation. We do this in ways that allow \nindividual miners the opportunity to choose the bonding tool that best \nsuits their individual needs while not losing sight of the overall \nreclamation goal.\n  While bonding assures that no further reclamation responsibilities \nwill fall to the public, what about sites which have been abandoned in \nthe past? I won't be breaking any secrets by telling you that \ndiscretionary funding for new projects around here is about as scarce \nas virtue at a lawyers convention. There is simply too much need with \nnot enough dollars to go around. Does this mean that reclamation is not \nimportant? Not at all--- there is no question that the reclamation of \nthese abandoned sites needs to occur. The only question is where the \ndollars are going to come from and what other priority must fall to the \nside.\n  This legislation addresses this issue through the establishment of a \nmine reclamation fund. This fund is capitalized by the funds collected \nby this legislation. Filing fees, maintenance fees, and royalty \ncollected all goes into the fund to pay for the reclamation work. This \nfund dovetails with other reclamation funds and fills the gaps. It is \nnot duplicative.\n  The Nation's small miners will find that there are exemptions from \nthe payment of fees for the first 25 claims, royalty relief for yearly \nprofits of less than $50,000, authorizations to use state reclamation \nbonding pools, and the ability to maintain exclusive long term land use \ntenure.\n  For those who seek meaningful reform to the nation's general mining \nlaws, this legislation does the job. It fixes past abuses without \npunishing the innocent. It establishes a partnership with miners to \nshare in the profits of mining without putting people out of work. It \nworks with existing environmental legislation to assure that mining \noperations are carried out with the least possible disturbance. It \nmakes sure that the public does not have to pay for the inappropriate \nactions of the few while allowing the many to pursue their activities \nin a ways that do not jeopardize their financial well being. And, it \nsets up a process to pay for existing mine reclamation needs without \ntaking money away from ongoing federal programs.\n  This is good legislation, it fixes existing problems without creating \nnew ones. It establishes partnerships between the Federal and State \ngovernments and treats the mining community with respect and dignity \nwithout turning a blind eye to past indiscretion.\n  I recognize that we have an up-hill battle. Mining reform has been \nshrouded for far too long in a smokey veil of rhetoric and \nsensationalism. The complexity of the issue is such that before we can \nshow any meaningful progress we must separate the voices of those who \nseek meaningful reform from those who are using the debates to prevent \nmining on public lands. I believe this legislation will do that--it \nprovides a platform for reasonable discussion and negotiation without \nthreatening to end mining on public land.\n  What we propose may not be poetic, but it does have a rock solid \nsubstance; it does not lend itself to catchy media blurbs, but it is \ngenuine reform; it does not offer quick fixes; but it does make changes \nthat are needed without punishing the innocent. It may not be pretty \nand it certainly is not easy to understand but I can promise you one \nthing--it will work.\n  Both sides of the mining reform debate have come a long way toward \nachieving meaningful compromise. I am certain that the legislative \nvehicle we launch today will carry us that last mile and finally bring \nus the reform that is needed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997 today. The merits of this \nlegislation have already been outlined by others, so I will not go into \ndetails. I believe that we have come a long way toward reaching a \ncompromise and I congratulate the chairman for his willingness and his \nefforts to reach the middle ground.\n  Mr. President, in this time of economic prosperity, I find it \nworrisome that we must constantly remind the American people that our \nNation's economic prosperity is largely dependent upon our ability to \ncreate wealth. The ability to create wealth depends upon ability to \ntake a raw material that has little or no economic worth and turn it \ninto something of value. The economic prosperity which we have \nexperienced in this decade is due, in part, to the increased ability of \nour Nation's mining industry to create wealth out of our raw materials.\n  In my own State, there are some groups which argue that the mining \nindustry is no longer needed, that it is a relic of the past. I hear \nfrom these same groups how tourism will be the savior of Utah's rural \ncommunities and if the people of rural Utah would only accept this, \nthen everything will work out just fine. The economy will be strong, \nthe environment will be protected and everyone will have a high \nstandard of living.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to diminish in any way the important \ncontribution that tourism provides to the economy of my State. Utahns \nencourage people to come and enjoy our ski slopes, our canyons, and our \nnational parks. But much of the tourism industry is seasonal in nature. \nIn some small communities in southern Utah, it takes two and one-half \nincomes to generate the average income. It is not uncommon to strike up \na conversation with a waitress in the local cafe, and learn that her \nhusband works two jobs to make ends meet. As one County Commissioner \nsummarized recently, ``If tourism was really the answer, making beds, \nfrying hamburgers, and pumping gas would have made us rich a long, long \ntime ago.''\n  In 1995, the values of minerals mined in Utah exceeded $2.4 billion. \nUtah's direct economic gain from mining exceeded $1.1 billion, \nincluding $358 million in personal income gains. The average mining job \nin Utah pays about $36,000 a year. With this in mind, imagine the \ntremendous positive impact\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\nthat a few dozen mining jobs have in these communities. These jobs \nimpact the local auto dealer, the real estate agent, the contractor, \nand the hardware store owner.\n  Mr. President, responsible and reasonable mining law reform should be \nenacted. But as we undertake these efforts, we must also recognize the \nimportant contribution of the mining industry to our Nation's economy. \nIt makes no sense to enact mining law reform in the name of \nenvironmental protection or budgetary concerns, if these reforms in \nturn force industry offshore where environmental restrictions are not a \nconsideration and some other country's government receives tax \nrevenues. I urge my colleagues to keep this in mind.\n  I congratulate the chairman for his efforts and I look forward to \nworking closely with him to enact this legislation.\n\n\n                   the mining law reform act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join many of my colleagues \nfrom the West today in introducing the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997.\n  The mining industry has always played an important role in our \nnational economy, and particularly in the economies of many western \nStates. From the discovery of the Comstock Lode in the 19th century, to \nthe silver boom of the Goldfield-Tonopah area in the early 20th \ncentury, to the record levels of gold and silver production in the last \ndecade, the mineral industry has historically played a vital role in \nNevada's economy. For the fifth year in a row, Nevada's mines have \ncollectively topped the 6 million ounce mark in gold production. In \n1996, there was a total of 7.08 million ounces of gold produced in \nNevada. The State's rich landscape has made Nevada the largest gold \nproducer in the nation with 66.5 percent of all production. In \naddition, it now accounts for 10 percent of all the gold in the world.\n  The most recent information from the State of Nevada indicates that \ndirect mining employment in Nevada exceeds 13,000 jobs. The average \nannual pay for these jobs, the highest of any sector in the state, is \nabout $46,000, compared to the average salary in Nevada of about \n$26,000 per year. In addition to the direct employment in mining, there \nare an estimated 36,000 jobs in the state related to providing goods \nand services needed by the industry.\n  I would also like to note that Nevada mining companies must pay taxes \nlike any other business, and they also pay an additional Nevada tax \ncalled the ``Net Proceeds of Mines Tax.'' The total Net Proceeds tax \npaid to the State in 1995 was approximately $33 million. With the \naddition of sales and property tax, the industry paid approximately \n$141 million in State and local taxes in 1995. In addition, the Nevada \nmining industry paid approximately $95 million in Federal taxes in \n1995.\n  The figures and statistics I have just mentioned are significant not \nonly to emphasize the importance of the mining industry to the State of \nNevada, but also to provide a context for the criticism often leveled \nagainst the industry that they enjoy a free ride for mining activities \non Federal land. The bottom line is that the mining industry pays taxes \njust like any other business, and in Nevada they pay an additional tax \ntargeted specifically to their industry.\n  The issue of reclamation is also central to the mining law reform \ndebate. I should note that Nevada has one of the toughest, if not the \ntoughest, State reclamation programs in the country. Nevada mining \ncompanies are subject to a myriad of Federal and State environmental \nlaws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and \nEndangered Species Act. Mining companies must secure literally dozens \nof environmental permits prior to commencing mining activities, \nincluding a reclamation permit, which must be obtained before a mineral \nexploration project or mining operation can be conducted. Companies \nmust also file a surety or bond with the State or the Federal land \nmanager in an amount sufficient to ensure reclamation of the entire \nsite prior to receiving a reclamation permit.\n  It is in the context of promoting the economic viability of the \nmining industry and of encouraging strong environmental reclamation \nefforts administered by the States that I view the debate over the \nreform of the Mining Law of 1872. As I have stated many times over the \nyears, I feel that certain aspects of the 1872 mining law are in need \nof reform. Specifically, I feel strongly that the patenting provision \nof the current law should be changed to provide for the payment of fair \nmarket value for the surface estate--our legislation does that. All \npatents should also include a reverter clause, which would ensure that \npatented public lands would revert to Federal ownership if no longer \nused for mining purposes--our legislation does that. I believe that \nmining laws reform legislation should ensure that any land used for \nmining purposes must be reclaimed pursuant to applicable Federal and \nState statutes--our legislation does that. And finally, I believe that \nmining law reform legislation should impose a reasonable royalty on \nmineral production from Federal land--our legislation does that.\n  The Mining Law Reform Act of 1997 addresses each of the concerns I \nhave just outlined. It is my hope that this legislation will serve as \nthe starting point for the debate over mining law reform this year.\n  The time has never been more critical for Congress to enact \ncomprehensive mining law reform. The aura of uncertainty that the \nindustry has been forced to operate under for the last decade is \ncausing many companies to look overseas for their future operations. \nThe number of United States and Canadian mining companies exploring or \noperating in Latin America continues to grow dramatically. We must \nenact mining reform this Congress if we hope to secure the economic \nbenefits we derive as a Nation from a healthy mining industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Mikulski, \n        and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 1103. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to authorize \nFederal participation in financing of projects to demonstrate the \nfeasibility of deployment of magnetic levitation transportation \ntechnology, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n the magnetic levitation (maglev) transportation technology deployment \n                              act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with a distinguished group of my \ncolleagues to introduce the Magnetic Levitation Transportation \nTechnology Deployment Act of 1997.\n  Maglev is the first new transportation technology envisioned since \nthe development of aviation in the early 1900's, and its adoption \nrepresents an opportunity for dramatic national gains in transportation \nefficiency and economic growth. This legislation proposes to \ndemonstrate the feasibility of Maglev by authorizing limited Federal \nparticipation in financing one or more Maglev projects in the United \nStates.\n  Maglev is an advanced technology in which magnetic forces lift, \npropel, and guide a vehicle over a guideway. Utilizing state-of-the-art \nelectric power and control systems, this configuration eliminates the \nneed for wheels and many other mechanical parts, thereby minimizing \nfriction and permitting cruising speeds of 300 miles per hour or more--\nthree times the speed of conventional American train technology. \nBecause of its high speeds and relatively modest right-of-way \nrequirements, Maglev offers significant advantages over auto, rail, and \naviation modes in 40- to 600-mile travel markets. Maglev is also a very \nsafe technology since properly designed Maglev is virtually impossible \nto derail.\n  While Maglev was invented by a young American nuclear engineer in the \n1960's, the Germans have developed the technology and have already \nbuilt a demonstration Maglev test facility. They are now proceeding \nwith a public/private project to construct a 181-mile Maglev system to \nconnect Berlin to Hamburg. The German system, which is expected to be \noperational by 2005, will provide 1-hour service between the two \ncities. Not far behind Germany, Japan has its own Maglev system under \ntest. Meanwhile, our Federal Government has done relatively little to \ndevelop this extraordinary technology.\n  In the last few years, however, the Federal Rail Administration has \nidentified the feasibility of deployment of Maglev systems in several \nmajor U.S. transportation corridors. Also, several public/private \npartnerships in the United States have begun to develop\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\nMaglev projects in a number of States, including California, Florida, \nMaryland, and Nevada. However, as with our European and Asian \ncompetitors, developing these Maglev projects will require Federal \nsupport to supplement the private and other public funding sources. Our \nbill would establish a competition for Federal funds, based on economic \nand financial criteria, among the various public/private Maglev project \npartnerships.\n  Because Maglev is a proven technology that offers significant \nbenefits for both passengers and freight, it is in the National \ninterest to demonstrate these benefits by proceeding to construct and \nput into service, at an early date, a project in the United States. \nThis legislation will encourage such a project at minimum public cost.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis and the \ntext of the Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) Transportation Technology \nDeployment Act of 1997 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV) \n     Transportation Technology Deployment Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) new transportation technologies are needed to \n     develop new modes of transportation that are environmentally \n     sound and energy efficient;\n       (B) very high- and super-speed magnetic levitation \n     (referred to in this section as ``MAGLEV'') is the technology \n     that appears to best meet the needs of the traveling public \n     and high-value freight shippers in the 40- to 600-mile \n     distance corridors;\n       (C) MAGLEV is energy efficient, consuming less energy per \n     passenger mile at any given speed than other forms of \n     transportation and reducing dependence on imported oil;\n       (D) since properly designed MAGLEV is virtually impossible \n     to derail, MAGLEV is safe and will prevent accidents and loss \n     of life, and will significantly reduce costs attributable to \n     accidents occurring on highways, freight rail lines, \n     intercity rail passenger service lines, commuter rail lines, \n     and short haul airline routes of the United States;\n       (E) MAGLEV is virtually unaffected by weather conditions, \n     which annually result in delays in other transportation modes \n     employed by freight and passenger carriers; and\n       (F) MAGLEV makes extensive use of existing highway rights-\n     of-way and consumes less land for its guideway infrastructure \n     than a comparable roadway;\n       (2) the commercial feasibility study of high-speed ground \n     transportation conducted under section 1036 of the Intermodal \n     Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law \n     102-240; 105 Stat. 1978)--\n       (A) demonstrates that MAGLEV systems have the potential for \n     a public and private partnership under which the private \n     sector could operate a system without operating subsidies and \n     the total benefits of the system would exceed the total \n     costs; and\n       (B) demonstrates that adding links or corridors to the \n     basic MAGLEV system would enhance the basic system, leading \n     to establishment of high-volume high-speed ground \n     transportation networks; and\n       (3) the study required by section 359(d) of the National \n     Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-59; \n     109 Stat. 627) further demonstrates the potential for MAGLEV \n     systems.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     establish a MAGLEV transportation technology system operating \n     along Federal-aid highway and other rights-of-way as part of \n     a national transportation system of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to make \ncorrections in maps relating to the Coastal Barrier Resources System; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n      CORRECTING THE COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES SYSTEM legislation\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill aimed \nat correcting a mistake in the Coastal Barrier Resource System. Without \nthis correction, a portion of Colleton County, SC, will remain in the \nCoastal Barrier Resources System even though the county never had an \nopportunity to voice their objection to their inclusion.\n  In 1980 Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to study and \npropose a Coastal Barrier Resources System. The aim was to create a \nsystem made up of relatively undeveloped low-lying coastal lands which, \nbecause of their susceptibility to flooding, would not be eligible for \nFederal flood insurance. Practically speaking, to be included in the \nCBRS means you face serious obstacles when selling or developing your \nproperty.\n  Soon after the passage of the 1980 act, the Department of the \nInterior created a study group charged which promulgating an inventory \nof coastal properties--properties to be included in the CBRS. By the \nend of 1988, the study group had completed its work and the Department \nof the Interior submitted the CBRS proposal to Congress.\n  This proposed inventory was the culmination of 8 years work and \nincluded suggestions made during two public comment periods. The first \npublic comments were made following the release of an initial draft \ninventory in 1985. Additional comments were made following the release \nof a second draft in\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\nthe spring of 1987. The Department of the Interior received numerous \ncomments on these draft inventories and incorporated many in their \nfinal report to Congress. This final report was the basis for the \nCoastal Barrier Resources System adopted in 1990.\n  I recite this history because without an understanding of it, Mr. \nPresident, one can't understand the intent of my legislation.\n  While the Department of the Interior was drafting this proposed \nsystem, a strip of coastal South Carolina was being annexed by Colleton \nCounty from Charleston County. Unfortunately, this annexation occurred \nin 1987 in the midst of the 1987 CBRA comment period. Unfortunately, \nthe notice of this second draft inventory was not received by Colleton \nCounty. The county never received any notice. It appears the draft \ninventory was provided to Charleston County, not Colleton County. In \nfact, the maps currently on file at the Department of the Interior, \nstill, incorrectly show this tract in Charleston County--not Colleton \nCounty. Thus, the citizens of Colleton County, never having had an \nopportunity to comment on these proposed changes, now find this tract \nincluded in the CBRS.\n  I proposed legislation in 1995 to correct this mistake, but it was \nnever reported out of committee. It failed to win the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee's support because the Fish and Wildlife Service, \nat the time, felt that the area in question had been mapped properly.\n  Mr. President, since the end of the 104th Congress, I have been \nworking with the Fish and Wildlife Service to address this problem. \nThey have now reevaluated this area and have come to the conclusion, \n``that the unprecedented procedural circumstances in this situation \nraise concerns of equity and fairness that warrant remapping.'' Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a letter \nfrom John Rogers, Acting Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, dated May 1, 1997, that says just that.\n  In short, this bill corrects a mistake made 10 years ago. It rights a \nwrong. It does not drastically redraft the Coastal Barrier Resources \nSystem nor does it withdraw any lands which were included in the 1982 \ndraft. It is narrowly drafted to address Colleton County's unique \nsituation. My staff, working with the Fish and Wildlife Service, has \nnot identified another area in the system which is similarly situated. \nThat is, there are no other areas which changed jurisdictions at the \ntime the Coastal Barrier Resources System boundaries were being \ndeveloped and which never received notice of these changes, thus this \nbill would not prove a precedent for those seeking wholesale changes in \nthe Coastal Barrier Resources System.\n  In conclusion, the bill simply returns a small portion of Edisto \nIsland, SC to its 1982 status. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, in the introduction of the \nOceans Act of 1997. This bill will establish a commission like the \nStratton Commission of 1966 to review the many ocean and coastal issues \nfacing the United States, and to develop a comprehensive, coordinated, \nnational ocean, and coastal policy.\n  Prior to introduction, I raised a few concerns with Senator Hollings \non some provisions of the draft bill. Basically, I had recommended some \nlanguage that made it clear that as we develop a new ocean and coastal \npolicy for the Nation, we keep in mind the facts that our fiscal \nresources are limited, and that our Federal investments in ocean and \ncoastal resources must be spent efficiently and wisely. I also raised \nsome concerns about the fact that the original draft had the President \nappointing all of the members of this important commission.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hollings has graciously agreed to make some \nchanges to the bill pursuant to my recommendations. For instance, the \nbill now authorizes the Congress to appoint more than half of the \nCommission members, and the Commission is directed to identify \nopportunities to reform Federal ocean programs to improve efficiency \nand effectiveness. I commend Senator Hollings for his willingness to \nwork with me and other Republican Senators before introduction of the \nbill. After introduction, I look forward to working with the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, a Senator who worked on the \noriginal Stratton Commission bill 30 years ago and who is a true \nchampion of ocean protection, in the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee \non any further refinements along these lines that might be \nconstructive.\n  Again, I thank Senator Hollings and commend him upon introduction of \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1105. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na sound budgetary mechanism for financing health and death benefits of \nretired coal miners while ensuring the long-term fiscal health and \nsolvency of such benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                 the comprehensive coal act reform act\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwill correct the abuses of Federal tax policy associated with the \nReachback Tax provisions of the Coal Industry Health Benefit Act of \n1992 (the Coal Act), while guaranteeing the solvency of the Combined \nBenefit Fund established by that Act.\n  The legislation will also guarantee retiree health care benefits to \napproximately 75,000 retired unionized bituminous coal miners, their \nspouses or widows, and dependents. These coal mine retirees have \nreceived uninterrupted health care benefits which are among the best \navailable to any group of retirees.\n  The Coal Act also bestowed a windfall on one class of companies at \nthe expense of another class, by shifting 62 percent of the cost of \nthese retiree health benefits from the companies which had contracted \nto pay for them. Those costs are now shouldered by Federal transfers \nand private employers, who had no contractual obligation for retiree \nhealth care.\n  Since its passage as part of the National Energy Policy Act, the Coal \nAct has been the subject of debate in both houses of Congress and tens \nof millions of dollars has been spent on litigation filed in the \nFederal courts by companies subjected to its retroactive taxation. \nEvery case has been lost, however, as the courts have ruled that \nCongress has the power to tax and that it is up to Congress to make or \nchange tax law.\n  Mr. President, this confiscatory measure is called the Reachback Tax, \nbecause it reached back, over the decades and branded for taxation \nhundreds of companies, or their former owners. Many of those companies \nhad been out of the unionized coal business for decades. Many \nidentified by the Social Security Administration as liable for \nReachback Taxes, are nothing more than skeletons of business entities \nholding the dwindling assets of former small enterprises.\n  Some reachback companies were taxed because they, or a related party, \nhad signed a UMWA multi-employer contract sometime between 1950 and \n1988. When the contracts expired, however, each of the reachback \ncompanies had fulfilled its obligations to the union and the union \nmembers. There were no continuing ties between the reachback companies \nand former employees, and certainly no promises of lifetime benefits to \nthose former employees, much less their dependents. Furthermore, the \nunion had no claims pending against these companies for retiree health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, the Reachback Tax, passed without benefit of hearings \nor debate, has brought economic disaster to hundreds of innocent \nAmerican companies, and hardship for tens of thousands of their \nworkers. It has caused a favored class of companies to receive what \nthey admit is a $130 million annual savings in retiree health benefit \ncosts, and transferred that burden to companies--small and large in \nmore than 30 States.\n  The payment of this Federal tax is an unfair burden on all of the \nreachback companies. For every beneficiary assigned, the reachback \ncompanies have a liability of approximately $2,400 per year, stretching \nto the year 2043. No reachback company was prepared to absorb such an \nexpense, nor should it have been. Obviously, jobs have been lost and \njob-creating projects have been delayed or canceled, and new\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\nproducts and the opening of new markets have been sidetracked because \nof the Reachback Tax.\n  When the 102d Congress passed the Reachback Tax in the fall of 1992, \nit handed the UMWA Combined Fund Trustees the statutory responsibility \nto collect every cent of every premium due from every reachback \ncompany. It also conferred on the Department of Treasury and the \nInternal Revenue Service the statutory responsibility to impose $100 \nper day, per beneficiary penalties on every reachback company which \ndoes not pay those premiums. Furthermore, the Department of Treasury's \nOffice of Tax Policy reports non-paying reachback companies are liable \nfor billions of dollars in penalties.\n  Mr. President, billions of dollars are due the United States \nTreasury, yet the Treasury and IRS have not moved to collect these \npenalties. And, despite this financial threat, some 60 percent of all \nthe reachback companies have ignored their statements, unwilling or \nunable to comply with a Federal law they view as unjust.\n  Mr. President, the Reachback Tax was promoted during the conference \non the Energy Act as an emergency effort to avoid an advertised deficit \nin the UMWA health benefits fund, and as necessary to save the retirees \nfrom an imminent suspension of health care benefits. However, the \ndeficit never materialized. Instead, the General Accounting Office, the \nprivate firms Towers Perrin, Deloitte & Touche, and the UMWA Combined \nBenefit Fund trustees have confirmed a huge surplus in the fund.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will statutorily guarantee \nthat those surpluses continue through the life of the fund, as several \nnew and permanent cost containment measures by the fund managers have \ndramatically lowered its expenses below original projections. \nFurthermore, the number of beneficiaries in the closed pool continues \nto decline because of mortality.\n  Statutory relief is the only relief available to these reachback \ncompanies. It is needed immediately. I urge Senators to join in support \nof this legislation to mitigate an unintended impact of well-intended \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Cochran in \nsponsoring this reachback tax relief bill to alleviate the inequitable \nhardships the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act of 1992 imposed \non certain companies.\n  First, it is important to note that the Coal Act of 1992 assured coal \nminers and their dependents that their health benefits were permanently \nsecured. And, it provided a statutory foundation to implement that \ncommitment. This legislation continues that commitment and maintains \nthe legal foundation to carry it out.\n  However, the funding mechanism of the Act has produced severe \nfinancial hardship for many companies subject to it. Our legislation \nreforms the Coal Act to eliminate this very serious and growing \nproblem. In order to fund the 1992 Coal Act, reachback companies, many \nlong removed from deep coal mining, were subjected to a burdensome tax \nthat in many cases threatens their existence. Many companies are no \nlonger in the coal business, and long ago withdrew from the Bituminous \nCoal Operators Association [BCOA] having met their legal obligations to \nfund retiree health benefits. It is the BCOA that negotiated a series \nof collective bargaining agreements with their employees and at the \nurging of the BCOA, the final contract contribution formula did not \nfully fund the benefits. The solution to this funding shortfall came \ndown to asking others to help pay, even those who had long ago left the \ncoal business.\n  We have now reached a point where reform is essential. As much as $16 \nbillion in penalties have accumulated against companies for delinquent \npremiums. Some of the reachback companies are trying to pay by \ndepleting their assets and thereby jeopardizing their ability to \nsurvive economically. Other companies simply cannot afford to pay. The \nCombined Benefit Fund trustees are currently suing delinquent companies \nto collect all unpaid premiums. These liabilities threaten the \nexistence of many small companies and the jobs of the people employed \nby them. It is increasingly clear that this is a symptom of the serious \nshortcomings in the original legislation. These reachback companies \ndeserve fairer treatment than the Coal Act now provides. Just as \nimportant, coal miners and their dependents deserve a Coal Act that \nwill work in the long-run.\n  To make matters worse, a recent federal court decision has had the \nadverse effect of reducing the Combined Fund revenues by ten percent \nand thus threatening the solvency of the Fund. If the decision is left \nstanding, a shortfall is projected by the year 2002. We must act now to \npreserve the solvency of the miners' fund as well as provide the \nurgently needed reachback relief. This legislation reverses the court's \ndecision and increases BCOA premiums, to preserve the long term \nsolvency of the Fund and provide a modest level of reachback relief. \nFollowing are key reform elements in our legislation:\n  (1) Eliminates premiums for certain reachback companies and \nsignificantly reduces premiums for other reachbacks;\n  (2) Creates a cap on all small company premiums;\n  (3) Creates relief for companies who paid withdrawal fees; and\n  (4) Strengthens the fiscal integrity of the miners' fund by \noverturning the court decision and increasing BCOA premiums.\n  The passage of the Coal Act in 1992 has saved the coal producing \nmembers of the BCOA more than $130 million per year over their prior \nannual benefit payment liabilities. The BCOA companies' $130 million \nannual windfall will need to be reduced in order to provide fiscal \nrelief to the many reachback companies. When this comprehensive bill \nbecomes law, BCOA companies will still benefit from about $100 million \nin annual savings.\n  Mr. President, the problems being caused by the Reachback Tax are \nsevere and require a remedy. Congress should act now to reform the Coal \nAct in order to provide equitable relief for all reachback companies as \nwell as to permanently secure the miners' benefits. We should pass the \nComprehensive Coal Act Reform proposal now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COATS:\n  S. 1106. A bill to provide for the establishment of demonstration \nprojects designed to determine the social, civic, psychological, and \neconomic effects of providing to individuals and families with limited \nmeans an opportunity to accumulate assets, and to determine the extent \nto which an asset-based policy may be used to enable individuals and \nfamilies with limited means to achieve economic self-sufficiency; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     THE ASSETS OF INDEPENDENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce for Independence \nAct, bipartisan legislation designed to help poor and working-poor \nAmericans build the productive assets they need to get out of poverty \nand invest in their future.\n  Just as people can't borrow their way out of debt, they can't spend \ntheir way out of poverty. To move forward, America's struggling \nfamilies need assets. For assets are ``hope in concrete form.'' While \nour Nation has wisely recognized this fact for our middle- and upper-\nincome families by subsidizing, through the Tax Code, the acquisition \nof homes and retirement accounts, we have not extended these very \nsensible policies to our lower-income citizens. In fact, they are often \npenalized if they try to save.\n  My legislation will change that, and set them on a path to economic \nindependence. And, by increasing our national savings rate, it will \nhelp set America on a path to greater productivity and prosperity. I \ntruly believe that IDA's can be to the 21st century what the Homestead \nAct was to the 19th and what the GI Bill was to the 20th--an investment \nin the common genius of the American people. The truth, Mr. President, \nis that we have spent billions on the poor, but we have rarely invested \nin them. And I say emphatically that IDA's are not a give-away--they \nare an investment.\n  The Assets for Independence Act authorizes the Department of Health \nand Human Services to establish community-based Individual Development \nAccount [IDA] programs throughout the country. IDA's are matched \nsavings accounts that can be used by low-income people to acquire a \nfirst home, a small business or post-secondary education or training. \nTo help the poor save and to encourage work, their earned income would \nbe matched by federal,\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\nnon-federal, and private dollars. All payments would go directly to the \nthird-party vendors (for example, directly to the mortgage company for \npeople using their IDA to buy their first home) and, like IRA's, there \nwould be harsh penalties for misuse. Community-based non-profit \norganizations would have to compete and raise money to be an IDA \ndemonstration site. The legislation authorizes $25 million a year for 4 \nyears for the demonstration.\n  Mr. President, IDA's are not new to America. In fact, they're \nspreading rapidly; in part as a result of legislation I proposed, and \nthe Congress passed, last year in connection with the welfare reform \nbill.\n  Over 40 private, community-based IDA's programs are operating around \nthe country. I am pleased to say that one of the oldest and most \nsuccessful IDA programs in the country, at Eastside Community \nInvestments, is located in Indianapolis.\n  Fourteen States have already included IDA's in their State welfare \nreform plans, as permitted by the passage of last year's legislation.\n  Twenty States have sponsored their own IDA programs, some through \nrefundable tax credits, others through direct appropriation. For \nexample, Pennsylvania has allocated $1.25 million for IDA's through a \n``Family Savings Accounts'' program for low-income families.\n  Over 200 community-based groups in 43 States signified their \nintention to develop IDA's in response to a large, privately-funded IDA \ndemonstration, slated to begin later this summer.\n  When I talk about IDA's, people often say to me that the poor cannot \nsave. Well they're wrong. The poor can and do save. As of 1995, some \n171,000 low-income families saved more than $250 million through \ncommunity development credit unions in many of America's poorest \nneighborhoods. Also, I believe that the savings rate of the poor will \nrise tremendously once we start supporting saving, both institutionally \nand culturally. And finally, I doubt that all this IDA activity in the \ncountry would be going on--all the millions of dollars being committed \nby major foundations, corporations, and States to IDA's--if there \nwasn't a core belief in the ability and willingness of the poor to save \nfor long-term, productive assets.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would strongly encourage my colleagues \nto cosponsor this legislation. Just as the private sector and several \nState have invested in America's poor through IDA's, we--the Federal \nGovernment should invest too. Our commitment to IDA's could leverage \nmillions more in private and State contributions--and thereby help move \nmillions of hardworking low-income families from poverty to economic \nindependence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill as introduced be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Economic well-being does not come solely from income, \n     spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, \n     investment, and accumulation of assets because assets can \n     improve economic independence and stability, connect \n     individuals with a viable and hopeful future, stimulate \n     development of human and other capital, and enhance the \n     welfare of offspring.\n       (2) Fully \\1/2\\ of all Americans have either no, \n     negligible, or negative assets available for investment, just \n     as the price of entry to the economic mainstream, the cost of \n     a house, an adequate education, and starting a business, is \n     increasing. Further, the household savings rate of the United \n     States lags far behind other industrial nations presenting a \n     barrier to economic growth.\n       (3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United \n     States should invest existing resources in high-yield \n     initiatives. There is reason to believe that the financial \n     returns, including increased income, tax revenue, and \n     decreased welfare cash assistance, resulting from individual \n     development accounts will far exceed the cost of investment \n     in those accounts.\n       (4) Traditional public assistance programs concentrating on \n     income and consumption have rarely been successful in \n     promoting and supporting the transition to increased economic \n     self-sufficiency. Income-based domestic policy should be \n     complemented with asset-based policy because, while income-\n     based policies ensure that consumption needs (including food, \n     child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, asset-\n     based policies provide the means to achieve greater \n     independence and economic well-being.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to provide for the \n     establishment of demonstration projects designed to \n     determine--\n       (1) the social, civic, psychological, and economic effects \n     of providing to individuals and families with limited means \n     an incentive to accumulate assets by saving a portion of \n     their earned income;\n       (2) the extent to which an asset-based policy that promotes \n     saving for education, homeownership, and microenterprise \n     development may be used to enable individuals and families \n     with limited means to increase their economic self-\n     sufficiency; and\n       (3) the extent to which an asset-based policy stabilizes \n     and improves families and the community in which they live.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to protect consumers by eliminating the double \npostage rule under which the Postal Service requires competitors of the \nPostal Service to charge above market prices; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8533-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DOUBLE POSTAGE RULE ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Double \nPostage Rule Elimination Act of 1997. This legislation will protect \nconsumers by eliminating the double postage rule under which the Postal \nService requires its competitors to charge above market prices.\n  We have in effect today laws known as the Private Express Statutes or \nPES. These laws make it generally unlawful for any person other than \nthe Postal Service to send or carry letters over postal routes for \ncompensation, with some exceptions. Under the PES, private delivery \ncompanies must set their two-day delivery rates at twice those of the \nPostal Service for similarly sized items.\n  In addition, the PES gives the Postal Service the right to impose \nfines on businesses that use private delivery companies to deliver \ntime-sensitive mail rather than using the Postal Service. Current \nregulations permit a business to choose a private carrier--such as UPS, \nFederal Express, or others--if the business feels that the message is \nurgent. The catch is that the Postal Service feels it alone can \ndetermine if a message is truly urgent, not the consumer.\n  Currently, the Postal Service charges $3.00 per item for its Priority \nMail, which is advertised as reaching the recipient in two days, though \nthat isn't guaranteed. This means the lowest price a private competitor \ncan offer for two-day delivery is $6.00. If the Postal Service raised \nits rate by $1.00 to $4.00 an item, a private delivery company offering \n$6.00 service would have no choice but to impose a $2.00 increase, to \n$8.00.\n  As you can see, the law gives the Postal Service great power to \ncontrol the rates charged by its private competitors and limit \ncompetition. Combine that with the Postal Service's ability to second-\nguess a consumer's decision to use a private carrier and you have a \nvery uneven playing field.\n  The Postal Service has displayed a willingness to use its \ngovernmental powers for competitive advantage. In 1993 it was reported \nthat the Postal Service had audited corporations and fined them as much \nas $500,000 in back postage fees for using UPS and Federal Express when \nthe Postal Service inspectors thought those choices were not warranted.\n  More recently, the Postal Service spent over $200 million on an \nadvertising campaign for Priority Mail. The campaign was based on the \nPostal Service's lower price--$3.00 for Priority Mail versus $6.00 for \nUPS and $8.00 for Federal Express. Of course, the ads left out the fact \nthat the private companies were prohibited by law from matching the \nPostal Service price--or charging anything less than $6.00 a letter.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today does one simple thing \nto level the field of competition. It replaces the double postage rule \nwith a ``two-dollar'' rule. Under my bill, private companies will be \nable to legally charge any rate above $2.00 for their second-day \nproducts. If they want to match the Postal Service at $3.00, they may. \nThe law will no longer impose an artificial ``double postage'' rule \nforcing private companies to charge above market rates.\n  This legislation will stop government intrusions into private \nconsumer decisions and will increase competition in the area of \ndelivering urgent letters. I urge support for the Double Postage Rule \nElimination Act of 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1108.

BROWN FEDERAL BUILDING DESIGNATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to honor and \nremember a truly exceptional American, Ronald H. Brown. The bill would \ndesignate the newly constructed Federal\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\nbuilding located at 290 Broadway in the heart of lower Manhattan as the \n``Ronald H. Brown Federal Building.''\n  It is a fitting gesture to recognize the passing of this remarkable \nAmerican, and I would ask for my colleagues' support for this \nlegislation to place one more marker in history on Ron Brown's behalf.\n  Ron Brown had a great love for enterprise and industry as reflected \nin his achievements as the first African-American to hold the office of \nU.S. Secretary of Commerce. His was also a life of outstanding \nachievement and public service: Army captain; vice president of the \nNational Urban League; partner in a prestigious law firm; chairman of \nthe National Democratic Committee; husband and father. And these are \nbut a few of the achievements that demonstrated Ron Brown's spirited \nand sweeping pursuit of life.\n  To have held any one of these posts in the government, and in the \nprivate sector, is extraordinary. To have held all of the positions he \ndid and prevail as he did, is unique. Ron Brown was tragically taken \nfrom us too soon; we are diminished by his loss. I cannot think of a \nmore fitting tribute to this uncommon man.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Ronald H. Brown Federal \nBuilding Designation Act of 1997 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1108\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The Federal building located at 290 Broadway in New York, \n     New York, shall be known and designated as the ``Ronald H. \n     Brown Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in any law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the ``Ronald H.

A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to place a \nlimitation on habeas corpus relief that prevents retrial of an accused; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   THE VICTIM PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce the \nVictim Protection Act of 1997.\n  I commend my colleague, Representative Joseph Pitts, for his \nleadership in preparing this legislation which he is introducing today \nin the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation arises from the case of Commonwealth versus Lisa \nMichelle Lambert where the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania found a violation of the defendant's constitutional \nrights and issued an order barring the defendant from a retrial.\n  The Congress has the authority to legislate under Article V of the \n14th amendment which provides:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate \n     legislation, the provisions of this article.\n\n  This legislation is designed to prevent the U.S. District Courts from \nordering a remedy to bar a new trial.\n  This legislation respects the authority of the Federal courts to \nuphold a defendant's constitutional rights in State court criminal \nproceedings. It may well be that the Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit will act to reverse the order barring a retrial.\n  Whatever action is taken in the case of Commonwealth versus Lisa \nMichelle Lambert, the Federal habeas corpus law should be clear that \nU.S. District Courts do not have the authority to bar a retrial.\n  Under our Federal system, it should be--and this bill will establish \nthe statutory authority--for the district attorney in Lancaster County \nto make the judgment whether the unsuppressed evidence is sufficient \nfor a retrial. It would then be up to the court of Common Pleas of \nLancaster County to make the first judicial judgment on the retrial \nissues with appropriate appellate procedures in the Superior and \nSupreme Courts of Pennsylvania.\n  This principled approach respects judicial independence.\n  When the District Court issued its opinion, there was an immediate \npublic outcry for impeachment. At that time, I said and I repeat today, \nimpeachment is not an appropriate response.\n  The appropropriate response is an appeal to the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Third Circuit which will review the matter. A \nfurther appropriate response is legislation to make the statute \nexplicit that the district court may not impose a remedy to bar a new \ntrial.\n  This bill would not affect the otherwise extensive authority of the \nU.S. District Courts to protect rights where constitutional issues are \nraised. Obviously, a statute could not deal with the defendant's \nconstitutional rights. That would require a constitutional amendment.\n  However, this bill on the issue of retrial is within the purview of \nappropriate legislation pursuant to Article V of the 14th amendment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1111. A bill to establish a youth mentoring program; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         JUMP AHEAD ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, millions of young people in America \nlive in areas where drug use, violent and property crimes are a way of \nlife. Unfortunately, many of these same young people come from one-\nparent homes, or from environments where there is no responsible, \ncaring adult supervision. These at-risk children are on the brink--\ntheir lives could go in either a positive or destructive direction. \nThere is indisputable evidence, however, that at-risk children who have \nresponsible adult mentors choose the right path.\n  Mr. President, that is why today I am introducing legislation, the \nJUMP Ahead Act of 1997, that will take mentoring in this country to the \nnext level to meet the needs of millions of at-risk youths and their \nfamilies.\n  All children and adolescents need caring adults in their lives, and \nmentoring is one effective way to fill this special need for at-risk \nchildren. The special bond of commitment fostered by the mutual respect \ninherent in effective mentoring can be the tie that binds a young \nperson to a better future. Through a mentoring experience, adult \nvolunteers and participating youth make a significant commitment of \ntime and energy to develop relationships devoted to personal, academic, \nor career development and social, artistic, or athletic growth.\n  Although in recent years there has been an increasing understanding \nof the importance and benefits of mentoring, too few at-risk children \nare being reached. It is reported that between 5 and 15 million \nchildren in the U.S. could benefit from being matched with a mentor. \nThe status quo cannot meet this need.\n  As I rise today to talk about the value and importance of mentoring \nto at-risk youth, we are in the midst of a crisis in the form of a \ngrowing tide of juvenile crime. While overall crime rates have been \nstabilizing and even decreasing in some areas, crime among our youth \nhas been on the rise. If trends continue, juvenile arrests for violent \ncrime will double by the year 2010.\n  In addition to juvenile crime, today's youth faces other serious \nproblems. Every day in America 2,795 teens get pregnant, 1,512 \nteenagers drop out of school, and 211 children are arrested for drug \nuse.\n  If we don't act quickly and decisively, we risk losing a whole \ngeneration of young people. We need to save our kids.\n  Mr. President, that is why in 1992 I authored the Juvenile Mentoring \nProgram (JUMP). JUMP is administered by the Department of Justice's \nOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). JUMP is \ntargeted specifically at reducing juvenile delinquency and gang \nparticipation, improving academic performance, and reducing the dropout \nrate by introducing adult mentors as role models, counselors, and \nfriends for at-risk youth. Both local education agencies and public/\nprivate non-profit organizations receive JUMP grants.\n  Since its enactment, JUMP has funded 93 separate mentoring programs \nin over half the States in the Union. The competition for these JUMP \nawards is great: Over 479 communities submitted applications for the \nrecent round of grants. JUMP grantees use a variety of program designs. \nMentors are law enforcement and fire department personnel, college \nstudents, senior citizens, Federal employees, businessmen, and other \nprivate citizens. The mentees are\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\nof all races they come from urban, suburban, and rural communities, and \nrange in age from 5 to 20. Some are incarcerated or on probation, some \nare in school, and some are dropouts. In its first year, JUMP helped to \nkeep thousands of at-risk young people in 25 States in school and off \nthe streets through one-to-one mentoring.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to take mentoring to the next level. \nThe JUMP Ahead Act enhances the basic successful structure of JUMP, and \nincreases awards to up to $200,000. It also increases authorized \nfunding to $50 million per year for 4 years, for a total of $200 \nmillion. This initiative will not only vastly increase the number of \nmentoring programs able to receive grants, but it also creates a new \ncategory of grants that will enable experienced national organizations \nto provide needed technical assistance to emerging mentoring programs \nnationwide. Also, the legislation mandates the Justice Department to \nrigorously evaluate the program to document what is effective, and what \ndoes not produce results. The increased funding allows the DOJ to award \ngrants to a wider group of applicants, allowing for greater diversity \nand creativity. However, the high standards set by the JUMP program \nstill must be met by all grantees.\n  Mr. President, mentoring works. Not only is this confirmed by common \nsense and life experience, but also by scientific study. Perhaps the \nmost well-known mentoring program is the world-renowned Big Brothers/\nBig Sisters of America, a federation of more than 500 agencies that \nserve children and adolescents. About one quarter of all JUMP grantees \nare Big Brothers/Big Sisters affiliates. They have been providing \nmentors to young people for over 90 years with wonderful results. And \nnow those results have been scientifically validated.\n  A carefully designed independent evaluation of mentoring programs \nfound tremendously positive results and that mentoring programs offer \ngreat promise. Most noteworthy among those findings was that mentored \nyouth were 46 percent less likely to initiate drug use. An even \nstronger effect was found for minority Little Brothers and Little \nSisters, who were 70 percent less likely to initiate drug use than \nsimilar minority youth.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, mentored youth were 27 percent less \nlikely to initiate alcohol use, and minority Little Sisters were only \nabout one-half as likely to initiate alcohol use. The study also found \nthat mentored youth skipped half as many days of school, felt more \ncompetent about doing schoolwork, skipped fewer classes, and showed \nmodest gains in their grade point averages. These gains were strongest \namong Little Sisters, particularly minority Little Sisters.\n  Mr. President, effective mentoring programs require agencies that \ntake substantial care in recruiting, screening, matching, and \nsupporting volunteers. These are critical functions for an effective \nmentoring program. The investment in comparison to the benefits to \nindividual kids and society as a whole is minimal; approximately $1,000 \nper child. Such a small price for such an enormous payoff.\n  Mr. President, experience and now research tells us that there is a \ndesperate need for a new, more positive approach to developing youth \npolicy and discouraging juvenile crime and violence. Mentoring has \nproven to be one of the best way to get to kids before they get into \ntrouble. We have been talking for years about the need to provide our \nchildren with a better future, to give our kids something to say \n``yes'' to. JUMP was a great, but small, first step in the right \ndirection. Now it is time to take a giant leap--a JUMP Ahead.\n  In Washington, we talk easily about investing in our kids' future. \nWhenever we want to build a highway or a bridge, we call it an \ninvestment for the future. If we want to ratify trade treaties, we call \nit an investment in our future. The same goes for everything from \ncutting the deficit to building sophisticated defense systems to \nsending probes to Mars.\n  Mr. President, there cannot be a more important investment in the \nfuture of our country and our people than directly investing in saving \nour kids. And that is what mentoring is all about. Mentoring works. \nEffective mentoring programs can significantly reduce and prevent the \nuse of alcohol and drugs by young people, improve school attendance and \nperformance, improve peer and family relationships, and curb violent \nbehavior.\n  Mr. President, what greater investment can we make?\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``JUMP Ahead Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) millions of young people in America live in areas in \n     which drug use and violent and property crimes are pervasive;\n       (2) unfortunately, many of these same young people come \n     from single parent homes, or from environments in which there \n     is no responsible, caring adult supervision;\n       (3) all children and adolescents need caring adults in \n     their lives, and mentoring is an effective way to fill this \n     special need for at-risk children. The special bond of \n     commitment fostered by the mutual respect inherent in \n     effective mentoring can be the tie that binds a young person \n     to a better future;\n       (4) through a mentoring relationship, adult volunteers and \n     participating youth make a significant commitment of time and \n     energy to develop relationships devoted to personal, \n     academic, or career development and social, artistic, or \n     athletic growth;\n       (5) rigorous independent studies have confirmed that \n     effective mentoring programs can significantly reduce and \n     prevent the use of alcohol and drugs by young people, improve \n     school attendance and performance, improve peer and family \n     and peer relationships, and reduce violent behavior;\n       (6) since the inception of the Federal JUMP program, dozens \n     of innovative, effective mentoring programs have received \n     funding grants;\n       (7) unfortunately, despite the recent growth in public and \n     private mentoring initiatives, it is reported that between \n     5,000,000 and 15,000,000 additional children in the United \n     States could benefit from being matched with a mentor; and\n       (8) although great strides have been made in reaching at-\n     risk youth since the inception of the JUMP program, millions \n     of vulnerable American children are not being reached, and \n     without an increased commitment to connect these young people \n     to responsible adult role models, our country risks losing an \n     entire generation to drugs, crime, and unproductive lives.\n\n     SEC. 3. JUVENILE MENTORING GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 288B of the Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5667e-2) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``The \n     Administrator shall'';\n       (2) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) are intended to achieve 1 or more of the following \n     goals:\n       ``(A) Discourage at-risk youth from--\n       ``(i) using illegal drugs and alcohol;\n       ``(ii) engaging in violence;\n       ``(iii) using guns and other dangerous weapons;\n       ``(iv) engaging in other criminal and antisocial behavior; \n     and\n       ``(v) becoming involved in gangs.\n       ``(B) Promote personal and social responsibility among at-\n     risk youth.\n       ``(C) Increase at-risk youth's participation in, and \n     enhance the ability of those youth to benefit from, \n     elementary and secondary education.\n       ``(D) Encourage at-risk youth participation in community \n     service and community activities.\n       ``(E) Provide general guidance to at-risk youth.''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Amount and Duration.--Each grant under this part \n     shall be awarded in an amount not to exceed a total of \n     $200,000 over a period of not more than 3 years.\n       ``(c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1999, \n     2000, 2001, and 2002 to carry out this part.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of native American history and culture; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n           THE BUFFALO NICKEL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it gives me great personal pleasure to \nintroduce the Buffalo Nickel Commemorative Coin Act of 1997. I am also \npleased to add Senators Inouye, Conrad, and Wellstone as cosponsors of \nthis legislation.\n  For those of us old enough to remember or for those who have seen \none, the buffalo nickel holds a special place in history. This coin was \nin general circulation from 1913 to 1938, and it featured an Indian \nhead design on one side with a buffalo design on the reverse.\n  The coin's history is an interesting one, and I would like to share \nit with my colleagues. The artist who designed this coin, James Earle \nFraser, wanted to produce a coin which was truly unique and American. I \nbelieve Mr. Fraser put it best himself when he said,\n\n       In designing the buffalo nickel, my first object was to \n     produce a coin which was truly American, and that could not \n     be confused with the currency of any other country. I made \n     sure, therefore, to use none of the attributes that other \n     nations had used in the past. And, in my search for symbols, \n     I found no motif within the boundaries of the United States \n     so distinctive as the American buffalo or bison.\n\n  According to historical sources, the Indian head on the nickel was \ncreated by Mr. Fraser based upon three models: Iron Tail, an Oglala \nSioux; Two Moons, a Northern Cheyenne; and Big Tree, a Seneca Iroquois. \nSupposedly all three Indians were performers appearing in wild-west \nshows in New York City at the time they posed for Mr. Fraser.\n  As for the buffalo, historians generally agree that the model was \nBlack Diamond, a bull bison residing in the Central Park Zoo. \nUnfortunately, after being immortalized on the buffalo nickel, Black \nDiamond was slaughtered.\n  The end result was a coin which was, indeed, truly unique. It has \nbeen roughly 60 years since the U.S. Bureau of the Mint ended \nproduction of the buffalo nickel. The bill I am offering today would \ndirect the Secretary of the Treasury to mint a limited-edition \ncommemorative buffalo nickel coin to begin in the year 2000. I believe \nit is fitting to reintroduce this beloved coin to new generations of \nAmericans.\n  These coins will also serve another important purpose appropriate to \nits heritage. Profits from the sale of the coins will go to the \nendowment and educational funds of the National Museum of the American \nIndian. Authorized in 1989 by the National Museum of the American \nIndian Act, Public Law 101-185, the museum is set to begin construction \nin order to meet its scheduled opening date in the year 2002. The \nfacility, to be located on the Mall here in Washington, DC, will house \nover 1 million artifacts and is expected to draw millions of visitors \neach year. By contributing funds to the endowment and educational \nprograms of the museum, the buffalo nickel will be assisting with the \npreservation of native artifacts and offer visitors to the museum the \nopportunity to appreciate and learn more about native cultures.\n  The origins of this bill actually began some time ago when an \nindividual contacted my office with this idea. Following that, my \nfriend and former colleague, Tim Wirth, sent me a note saying he \nthought it was a great idea, and since then I have received hundreds of \npostcards from people across the country expressing their desire to see \nthe return of the buffalo nickel. With that, I am pleased to be able to \nintroduce this legislation, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues, the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee, and the \nU.S. Treasury in order to make the buffalo nickel a success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend certain temporary judgeships in the Federal \njudiciary; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    TEMPORARY JUDGESHIP LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I have studied \nthe recommendations of the Judicial Conference regarding the extension \nof a number of temporary article III judgeships. I am offering this \nbill along with Senators Durbin, Hatch, DeWine, Warner, and Hagel in \nresponse to the Judicial Conference's recommendations.\n  Much anecdotal evidence and rhetorical commentary have been given, in \nboth the press and from this body, regarding the burdened and \noverworked state of the Federal judiciary. My experiences do not bear \nthis out. I have been a member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts for a number of years. In past \nyears, this committee was likely to take the Judicial Conference's \nrecommendations as given. Recently, in my role as chairman, I have \ntaken a more hands on approach to the appointment and extension of \njudgeships in the Federal system. As part of this approach, I have held \nhearings on this subject and I have made suggestions to the Judicial \nConference on ways to improve their surveys. In part, as a result of my \ninput, the Judicial Conference added a question to its Biennial \nJudicial Survey that asks not only if the circuit or district has need \nof additional judgeships, but also whether the circuit or district \nmight have too many judgeships for its current caseload. Because \ncaseloads in some districts will inevitably decline, this question \naddresses a problem not previously considered. The purpose of the \nquestion is to help the Judicial Conference decide, when faced with a \ndistrict that has a declining caseload, whether to reallocate resources \nto another district or eliminate an unnecessary judgeship.\n  As I noted, I have studied various judiciary issues and have worked \nwith the judiciary to address some of these issues. From my studies and \nfrom conversations I've had with those on the bench, it is obvious that \nthere is no judicial crisis looming on the horizon. However, changing \ncircumstances in some judicial districts do need to be addressed. That \nis why I am proposing this bill. It addresses the needs of some of \nthese districts in a substantive, rational manner.\n  Biennially, the Judicial Conference makes judgeship recommendations \nto Congress regarding the needs of the Federal courts. The Conference \nsends the chief judge of each district a Biennial Judicial Survey that \nthey are to submit with the caseloads and weighted caseloads of the \ndistrict and report on the status of the district. This survey includes \ninformation on how the district makes use of its senior and magistrate \njudges and any recommendations that the chief judge may have regarding \nadditional judgeships or extension of judgeships in their district. The \nJudicial Conference reviews this information and passes its \nrecommendations on to Congress for review.\n  For the 1996 survey, the Judicial Conference recommended that 12 \ndistricts with current or expired temporary judgeships either make or \nadd permanent positions or extend the temporary judgeships for an \nadditional 5 years. The Judicial Conference only made recommendations \nfor those districts which would have weighted caseloads in excess of \nthe 430 maximum recommended caseload per article III judge, should the \ntemporary position expire.\n  Weighted caseloads are the actual caseloads per district, weighted or \naltered to reflect the difference in time and attention needed for \ncertain types of cases. For example, criminal cases, in general, are \nmore time consuming and thus are more heavily weighted. However, \nprisoner petitions are generally easier to resolve because the petition \nusually addresses issues previously addressed and resolved by the \ncourt.\n  Based on this survey, the Judicial Conference recommended a permanent \njudgeship position be added to the northern district of Alabama to \nreplace the temporary judgeship Congress allowed to expire last year. \nIn addition, the Conference would like to make the temporary judgeships \nin the eastern district of California, northern district of New York, \neastern district of Virginia, and the southern district of Illinois \npermanent. The survey indicated that the weighted caseload per article \nIII judge exceeded the recommended 430 maximum caseload per judge. The \nJudicial Conference also recommended, based on this survey, that the \ntemporary judgeships in the districts of Hawaii, Kansas, Nebraska, \neastern Missouri, central Illinois, and southern Ohio be extended for \nanother 5 years. The Biennial Judicial Survey indicated that these \ndistricts would be above the recommended 430 weighted cases per article \nIII judge if the temporary judgeships were eliminated.\n  Based on my studies, most of the districts that currently have \ntemporary judgeships are able to show the need for the extension of \nthese judgeships. I used additional factors, not used in the Biennial \nJudicial Survey, to arrive at my recommendations for the districts. My \ninvestigation takes into consideration the cases handled by magistrate \nand senior judges. These studies show that when these cases are \nfactored out, some districts fall below the recommended maximum \ncaseload of 430 cases per article III judge, even after expiration of \nthe temporary judgeships. In deference to the Judicial Conference, I \nhave given those districts the\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\nbenefit of the doubt on their need for an extension and have \nrecommended an extension of their temporary judgeships. My willingness \nto accommodate the Judicial Conference recommendations underlines my \nwillingness to work with the judiciary to reach a reasonable compromise \nwhen possible.\n  The Judicial Conference's recommendation for permanent status in the \ndistricts of eastern California, northern New York, eastern Virginia, \nand southern Illinois differs from my recommendation. After my review, \nI do not believe the Conference's recommendation can be justified. \nAmong the factors I considered for extending permanent status for these \ndistricts is whether the district showed a consistent increase in its \nper judge caseload over the past several years. When plotted, caseloads \nfrom most of these districts, show a roller coaster ride regarding the \nnumber of cases filed per article III judge. Over the period tracked, \ncaseload increases were inconsistent and filings frequently decreased \ncompared to previous years. Additionally, the Judicial Conference does \nnot take into consideration, in the caseload statistics of each article \nIII judge, how many cases are performed or could be performed by \nmagistrate judges or senior judges. Cases, such as prisoner petitions \nand Social Security cases could, in most instances, be performed by \nmagistrate judges. When prisoner petitions and Social Security cases \nare weighted and removed from the weighted caseload total per article \nIII judge, the districts have a lower and much more representative \ncalculation of the actual caseload per article III judge. And these \nfigures don't even adjust for the consent cases the magistrate's \nhandle.\n\n  The data I have indicates that prisoner petitions and Social Security \ncases are included in computing the judicial caseload figures used by \nthe Judicial Conference to calculate each article III judge's caseload. \nFor example, the eastern district of California commenced 1,747 cases \ndealing purely with prisoner petitions in the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1996. In that district, magistrate judges resolved 1828 \nprisoner petition cases during that period. The difference in the \nnumber of cases resolved during that period would be those cases \ncommenced in the prior year, but resolved in the current year.\n  Additionally, my study indicates that some of the district's surveyed \nare not utilizing magistrate judges as effectively or efficiently as \nother districts in the survey. This factor needs to be taken into \naccount prior to granting any additional or permanent article III \njudgeships to these districts. It is, in part, such considerations that \nled me not to recommend an additional permanent judgeship in Alabama, \ncontrary to the recommendation of the Judicial Conference. In addition, \nCongress chose not to extend the temporary judgeship in that district \nbefore it expired last year.\n  In calculating if districts are overburdened, weight must also be \ngiven to the effective use of senior judges in those districts. My \nstudies took into consideration the district's use of senior judges. \nSeveral districts surveyed make effective use of their senior judges \nand this was taken into account when drafting this bill. Based on all \nof the factors I have outlined, I believe this bill will keep the \njudges in these districts from being overburdened and makes effective \nuse of the taxpayer's money.\n  Therefore, I recommend that the temporary judgeships in the eastern \ndistrict of California, the northern district of New York, the eastern \ndistrict of Virginia, the southern and central districts of Illinois, \nthe eastern district of Missouri, the northern district of Ohio, and \nthe districts of Hawaii, Nebraska, and Kansas be extended for another \n5-year period.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF CERTAIN TEMPORARY JUDGESHIPS.\n\n       Section 203(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 \n     (Public Law 101-650; 104 Stat. 5101; 28 U.S.C. 133 note), as \n     amended by Public Law 104-60 (109 Stat. 635; 28 U.S.C. 133 \n     note), is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (1); and\n       (2) by striking the last 2 sentences and inserting ``Except \n     with respect to the western district of Michigan and the \n     eastern district of Pennsylvania, the first vacancy in the \n     office of district judge in each of the judicial districts \n     named in this subsection, occurring 10 years or more after \n     the confirmation date of the judge named to fill the \n     temporary judgeship created by this subsection, shall not be \n     filled.

A bill to impose a limitation on lifetime aggregate limits \nimposed by health plans; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            THE LIFETIME CAPS DISCRIMINATION PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nwith Senator Rockefeller that will ensure that health insurance \npolicies cover at least $10 million in lifetime benefits. This bill, \nthe Lifetime Caps Discrimination Prevention Act, will help fulfill the \npromise of real health security and is an appropriate sequel to last \nyear's Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform legislation. Through \nour reform legislation, families can be spared the loss of their health \ninsurance when they need it the most.\n  All of us are at risk of incurring high-cost injuries or illnesses--\nthe very kind of situations that most people want covered by their \nhealth insurance polices. A $1 million cap was adequate when it was \nestablished by the insurance industry in the early 1970's. Since then, \nhowever, inflation has sent medical costs skyrocketing, and today, \nthousands of Americans have hit their payment ceiling. A majority of \nthose who exceed their lifetime limits must turn to public assistance. \nWhile waiting for a determination of eligibility, many individuals are \nforced to go without medical treatment. This legislation would keep \nwithin the private sector those who most need health coverage and would \nkeep them off Medicaid.\n  Most of us assume that our health insurance will be there when we \nneed it most--when we are very sick. Unfortunately, many people do not \nread the fine print in their insurance policies. The average lifetime \ncost of care for a person who has a spinal cord injury and is \nventilator dependent--just like Christopher Reeve--is over $5 million. \nFor someone like Jim Brady, who had a severe head trauma injury, the \naverage cost is about $4 million, and that is in 1990 dollars. As \nChristopher Reeve said, ``I didn't think it could happen to Superman.''\n  The Lifetime Caps Discrimination Prevention Act fulfills a promise of \nreal health security by raising the lifetime cap from the typical limit \nof $1 million--a dollar figure selected in the 1970's--to $5 million in \n1998, and then in 2002 to $10 million, which is the real dollar \nequivalent today. Currently, the vast majority of health maintenance \norganizations and approximately one-quarter of employer-sponsored \nhealth plans have no aggregate lifetime limit. The Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit plans removed lifetime maximums in 1995. According to a \nPrice Waterhouse study, employers with a workforce of 250 employees \nwould experience a mere 1 percent increase in premiums. This is a small \nprice to pay for real health insurance security for people covered in \nthe group market. Our legislation excludes employers with fewer than 20 \nemployees.\n  The Lifetime Caps Discrimination Prevention Act was originally \nintroduced as an amendment to the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance \nlegislation passed during the 104th Congress. The amendment enjoyed \nstrong bipartisan support, but it was defeated due to the strategy of \nopposing amendments to that bill. We believe that this legislation is \nworthy of reintroduction in the 105th Congress, and we are hopeful that \nit will attract even broader\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nsupport as another step that can be taken in strengthening Americans' \nhealth security. Over 150 national health-related groups, including the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the United \nCerebral Palsy Association, and the National Association of \nProfessional Insurance Agents, have expressed their support for our \nefforts to increase lifetime limits on health insurance benefits.\n  The insurance industry standard of $1 million, adopted in 1970, was \nright for those times but today is financially unrealistic. Today, the \ntime has come to protect thousands of individuals from suffering the \nemotional, medical, and financial consequences of exceeding their caps \nby adopting a new lifetime limit for health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend, Senator \nJim Jeffords, of Vermont to introduce a bill that will help families \navoid an additional tragedy in their already traumatized lives. We are \nintroducing a bill to raise lifetime limits on insurance policies to \n$10 million. But, first, I want to recognize and applaud Chairman \nJeffords' extraordinary leadership on this issue--last Congress and \nthis year. With his leadership, we will succeed in raising the lifetime \ncap on health benefits to $10 million.\n  People buy health insurance to protect themselves and their families \nwhen they get sick. They spend their lives paying for it. They count on \nit. But each year, 1,500 people have their insurance taken away, just \nwhen they need it most and for the very reason why they bought the \ninsurance in the first place, because they are gravely ill or in need \nto extensive medical care or some other extraordinary reason.\n  These 1,500 people run into the lifetime limit on their health \ninsurance policy. When that happens, the insurance company won't spend \na single cent to help that person cope with his or her health care \ncosts. But the need for medical care continues. And the bills keep \ncoming.\n  The $1 million limit, first used by insurance companies to give their \ncustomers peace of mind and security in the 1970's, is widely out-of-\ndate and hugely insufficient. According to Price Waterhouse, had the \nlimit kept pace with medical inflation, it would be more than $10 \nmillion today. In fact, a $1 million health insurance policy in 1970 \nwould buy you about $100,000 in health benefits in 1997.\n  When a family runs into the lifetime limit, they have no choice but \nto spend themselves into poverty in order to qualify for Medicaid. This \ndrains families of their assets, their self-esteem and costs Medicaid \nseveral billion dollars in additional health care costs. Many people \nhave to give up everything--their house, their savings, and their kids' \neducation in order to get the medical care they need through Medicaid.\n  In my home State of West Virginia, Mike Davis hit his $1 million \nlifetime cap in 1994. That was 14 years after his son Todd was hit by a \ndrunk driver, causing severe brain injury. Before Todd qualified for \nMedicaid, his father received a $90,000 bill for his son's care--a bill \nhe's still struggling to pay.\n  This can happen to anyone. Catastrophic injury, chronic illness or \nsignificant disability are arbitrary. They hit young and old, rich and \npoor. You plan for routine illness, but no one plans for this kind of \nillness or injury. At least if you have a health insurance policy \nwithout a $1 million cap, you can get the medical treatment you need.\n  Most people don't even know if their insurance policy has a lifetime \ncap. The insurance companies don't talk about them. The caps are stuck \nin the fine print. People assume that if you buy insurance, you're \ncovered. Unfortunately, that's not the case. About 60 percent of \nemployer-sponsored health plans have lifetime caps.\n  Several modifications were made to this year's bill. We include an \nexemption for small businesses. We give all businesses 2 years to \ncomply. We phase the cap in--first raising it to $5 million and then \nlifting it to $10 million by the year 2002. We're talking about a \nroughly 1 percent increase in premiums, according to Price-Waterhouse. \nThat's it.\n  The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program doesn't allow \nparticipating insurers to set lifetime limits on their basic health \ninsurance polices for Federal employees. Members of Congress don't have \nlifetime caps. We know our health insurance will be there when we need \nit. All Americans should have that same security.\n  Raising the cap is something we can and should do. It's the right \nthing to do. It's good policy and it can save Medicaid up to $7 billion \nover the next 7 years. Mr. President, the idea behind insurance is \nsimple: no matter how sick you are, you're covered. It's about basic \ndecency and fairness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Warner, Mr. Robb, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Cochran, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1115. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to improve \none-call notification process, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                COMPREHENSIVE ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I stand here today with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Daschle, the minority leader, to introduce an \nimportant public safety bill. I am also joined by initial cosponsors \nSenators Shelby, Rockefeller, Warner, Robb, Inhofe, Inouye, Cochran, \nand Conrad.\n  The Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act is designed to protect a \nvery important component of America's infrastructure--our underground \ninfrastructure. With roots going back several Congresses, this \nlegislation enjoys widespread bipartisan support and is supported by \nseveral members of the Senate's Committee for Commerce, Science and \nTransportation--the committee of jurisdiction. This legislation \nprovides a public policy statement which is long overdue. The \nlegislation is still a work in progress and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues across the aisle and on the Commerce Committee to \nfurther fine-tune this bill as the process moves forward.\n  America's underground infrastructures contain many buried \ncommunication and fiber optic cables, water and sewer pipes, electric \nlines, and oil and gas pipelines. All too often people inadvertently \ndamage these facilities causing harmful consequences. Often a nick or a \nbump which goes unreported can, over time, become a problem and have a \ndelayed harmful effect.\n  Mr. President, this bill is important because it will prevent some of \nthe damage to underground facilities that causes accidents across \nAmerica. These accidents often are caused by excavation without notice \nor by inaccurate markings of our underground facilities. This damage to \nthe infrastructure may cause environmental harm and disrupt essential \nservices and even cause injuries and fatalities.\n  I am not here today to condemn those who excavate. I am here today to \nsay that one-call safety legislation is necessary because many \nexcavation accidents are preventable.\n  Mr. President, America needs a single, nationwide system to forward \nexcavators' toll free calls to the appropriate State or local one-call \ncenter. To delay further is to unnecessarily jeopardize America's \nunderground infrastructure.\n  Let me make it clear this is not a new idea. It is a concept that has \nbeen embraced by many States. Already 49 States have some form of a \none-call system on the State level. I am proud to say my State of \nMississippi has a one-call system; however, many of these systems can \nbe improved with Federal assistance. Our bill does that.\n  This bill uses an approach that will create uniform national \nstandards and provide grants to establish or improve State one-call \nsystems. This bill does not dictate how a one-call system should \noperate or how a State's law should be written. On the contrary, it \nrequires input from States and stakeholders before developing \noperational best practices and gives States the latitude to continue to \ndetermine the details of its one-call statute. This analysis will serve \nas the catalyst for a national effort to improve State one-call \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, the administration also recognizes the necessity for a \none-call safety statute. When the President introduced his method for \nthe reauthorization of America's Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act, he included a one-call provision. Our bill is \ndifferent, but it is compatible. In addition to working with my initial \ncosponsors during the drafting phase, I\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\nhave worked with the administration to address their concerns. We are \nnot done yet, but we are committed to continuing the dialog. The \nintroduction of our bill is the Senate's first step.\n  By introducing the legislation today, we hope the congressional \nrecess will be used by organizations and stakeholders who have an \ninterest in this policy to enter into the discussion. It is the desire \nof the initial sponsors to include those with an interest in this \npublic safety policy in preparing the legislation for a committee \nhearing.\n  This bill sets out broad minimum standards for State one-call \nprograms. There is flexibility for States to determine who will \nparticipate and how enforcement will occur. The legislation is not \nproscriptive. Rather, it identifies the goals. The foundation for our \napproach is the understanding that the level of risk varies with each \ntype of excavation activity as well as the type of organization which \nconducts the excavation work. The bill will offer State grants for \nthose States who want to participate. A study will also be conducted to \nidentify the best practices for one-call centers and to promote \nadoption of the most successful solutions.\n  Mr. President, this bill is neither a mandate nor unfunded. I want to \nrepeat this. There is no mandate that every State must participate. We \nare simply proposing the authorization of sufficient funds to study \nState activities and to administer assistance to States wanting to \nparticipate.\n  I expect those industries which place a premium on operational \nconvenience will recognize that one-call is responsible and a small \nprice to pay for ensuring safety of the public and environment. I am \noptimistic that all affected parties will work in genuine partnership \nwith us to finalize the legislation rather than sit on the sidelines \nand criticize.\n  Mr. President, the information highway offers many opportunities and \nchallenges for our society and culture but, it too can be put in a \nperil by simple events. Just 2 weeks ago an article in the Washington \nPost reported that for half a day the Internet and long distance \ncommunications on one carrier were disrupted by a backhoe cutting \nthrough a fiber optic cable.\n  Let us also not forget the death of an 84-year-old woman in \nIndianapolis, IN last week where a blast leveled seven homes. The \nIndianapolis Star/News said the explosion turned the quiet subdivision \n``into a living Hell. The blast turned trees and utility poles into \nimpromptu candles and sent chunks of earth raining down as people ran \nfor their lives.'' I believe our legislation will play a part in \npreventing this type of disaster.\n  Finally let's not forget the 1994 accident in Edison, NJ where there \nwas a much larger explosion. Significant property damage occurred and \nagain there was loss of life. This event prompted one of our former \ncolleagues and the senior Senator from New Jersey to actively work for \ntougher laws governing America's infrastructure. Former New Jersey \nSenator, Bill Bradley and Senator Frank Lautenberg were actively \ninvolved in seeking a legislative solution and today's bill is a direct \nresult of their efforts.\n  I am convinced that this Congress will champion meaningful safety \nreforms and leadership for America's underground infrastructure. It \nwill not be a traditional big government approach. It will help provide \nadaptable, convenient, accountable, meaningful and overdue protection \nfor citizens.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their attention, and I hope they \nwill join us as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text and summary \nof the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act be entered into the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill and summary were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive One-Call \n     Notification Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) unintentional damage to underground facilities during \n     excavation is a significant cause of disruptions in \n     telecommunications, water supply, electric power, and other \n     vital public services, such as hospital and air traffic \n     control operations, and is a leading cause of natural gas and \n     hazardous liquid pipeline accidents;\n       (2) excavation that is performed without prior notification \n     to an underground facility operator or with inaccurate \n     marking of such a facility prior to excavation can cause \n     damage that results in fatalities, serious injuries, harm to \n     the environment, and disruption of vital services to the \n     public; and\n       (3) protection of the public and the environment from the \n     consequences of underground facility damage caused by \n     excavations will be enhanced by a coordinated national effort \n     to improve one-call notification programs in each State and \n     the effectiveness and efficiency of one-call notification \n     systems that operate under such programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ONE-CALL PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subtitle III of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n\n              ``CHAPTER 61.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for education; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         education legislation\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the budget reconciliation package we have \npassed--and again, I congratulate my colleagues on such a tremendous \nbipartisan effort--that reconciliation package contains important \nmeasures to promote education. A full 80 percent of the tax relief we \noffered goes to a $500 credit for children and provisions that will \npromote education.\n  As I mentioned in my statement, I strongly supported those measures \nto help our young people--to help our families--pay for college. These \nyouth are our future, and investing in them is fundamental to keeping \nthat future bright and prosperous.\n  However, as I also mentioned earlier, I had hoped that we could have \ngone further in promoting the educational aspects of the tax relief \nbill.\n  There were a number of very innovative and very effective provisions \nthat were contained in the Senate Finance Committee bill, but that were \nexcluded during the conference.\n  For example, there was a provision to offer tax-free treatment for \nState-sponsored prepaid tuition plans. There was a provision for a \npermanent extension of employer provided education assistance. And \nthere was also a comprehensive education IRA. Unfortunately, these were \nknocked out of the reconciliation package by the White House.\n  What I want to do now, Mr. President, is introduce these measures as \na bill--a bill that will expand education IRA's to permit families to \ninvest up to $2,000 per year toward education. These IRA's would permit \nwithdrawals for expenses incurred during elementary and secondary \nschool.\n  Second, this bill will allow employers to assist their employees' in \ntheir graduate and undergraduate education without the employees having \nthat assistance taxed as income.\n  It will expand State-sponsored prepaid tuition and savings programs \nto permit tax-free savings for educational needs. And finally, this \nbill will allow universities to develop prepaid tuition and savings \nprograms that will permit tax-free savings for tuition, fees, book, \nschool, supplies, room, and board.\n  These are much needed tools to promote education. Over the past 15 \nyears, tuition at a 4-year college has increased by 234 percent. The \naverage student loan has increased by 367 percent. In contrast, median \nhousehold income rose only 82 percent during this period, and the \nconsumer price index only rose 74 percent.\n  Our students--our families--need these resources to help them meet \nthe costs and realize the opportunities of quality education. And I \nencourage my colleagues to support this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1117. A bill to amend Federal elections law to provide for \ncampaign finance reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n\n\n                  campaign finance reform legislation\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the American people are suffering a crisis \nof confidence when it comes to the way in which campaigns for Federal \noffice are financed. They no longer feel that they are in control of \nwho gets elected, or that those who do get elected are fully \naccountable. Today, I am introducing a bill that will restore \nAmericans' confidence in their elected officials, and put elections \nback into the hands of average citizens.\n  Last year, for the first time since coming to Congress, I had the \nopportunity to watch Federal elections not as a candidate, but as a \ncitizen and a voter. And what I saw confirmed all the reasons I have \nbeen a longtime proponent of campaign finance reform. What I saw was \nvast sums of money and very little accountability. I saw attack ads \npaid for with unlimited funds by out-of-State groups. And I saw \ncontributions from PAC's to Federal candidates climb 12 percent higher \nthan the record levels reached in the 1993-1994 election cycle.\n  And the 1996 elections were barely over when allegations of illegal \nand improper activities began flying, centered around the issues of so-\ncalled soft money and foreign influence peddling through campaign \ncontributions. Subpoenas are being issued at a faster pace than Ken \nGriffey, Jr., hits home runs, and while it remains to be seen what the \nresults of congressional investigations will yield, it is clear that \nthese latest scandals only serve to further undermine public confidence \nand underscore the importance of enacting meaningful and achievable \ncampaign finance reform this year.\n  It has often been said that perception is nine-tenths of reality, and \nI believe this is the case with campaign financing. I happen to believe \nthat most elected officials are good people trying to do the people's \nbusiness with America's interests at heart. At the same time, as in any \nwalk of life, there are some people who abuse the system. And if there \nis even the perception that elections are being bought and sold, then \nthe problem is serious and real--and the solution must be likewise.\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\n  And make no mistake, there is a pervasive perception that the system \nis out of hand and in need of fixing. A poll taken last year by a major \nnewspaper in my home State, the Maine Sunday Telegram, showed that over \n70 percent of respondents believe politicians listen more to special \ninterests than to individual voters. Findings like this are endemic of \na deep systemic problem, one that we cannot afford to ignore any \nlonger.\n  I have voted for major changes in the campaign finance system \nthroughout my career and introduced measures that I felt would make \nreal and positive changes. Today, I am introducing the Restoration of \nAmerica's Confidence in Elections Act, a comprehensive but realistic \napproach to fixing our broken system.\n  One of the chief aims of my bill is to increase the impact of the \nsmall, individual contributor in election campaigns so that we place \nthe campaign process in the hands of average Americans--rather than in \nthe hands of special interests. My bill will lower the amount of money \na PAC could contribute from $5,000 to the limit for individual \ncontributors, $1,000--a change which 70 percent of respondents to a \nrecent New York Times poll say they support. It will also encourage \nsmall, individual contributors from a candidate's home State to \nparticipate by providing the incentive of a tax credit in the amount of \nthe contribution, up to $100 for an individual or $200 in the case of a \njoint return.\n  Soft money has also become a major issue, and for good reason. It is \nmoney that skirts the intent of the law, and unaccounted for money \nwhich influences Federal campaigns above and beyond legal limits. My \nbill will close the soft money loophole by prohibiting national parties \nfrom raising or spending any soft money on behalf of any Federal \ncandidates--and State parties could only spend hard money on behalf of \nFederal candidates. In order to keep parties healthy, individuals could \ncontribute up to an aggregate amount of $20,000 to State party \ngrassroots funds, and the existing limits on aggregate contributions to \nnational parties by individuals and PAC's would be raised by $5,000 \neach. In that way, money is accounted for, parties can remain viable, \nand the soft money chase is ended.\n  My bill also addresses the issue of candidates facing independently \nwealthy opponents. As we all know, the amount of personal funds a \ncandidate spends on his or her campaign cannot be constitutionally \nlimited, but the playing field can and should be leveled. The \nperception that an individual of means can buy their way to the top of \nthe American political arena certainly does nothing to inspire \nconfidence in our Government.\n  My bill would make it easier for a candidate facing a wealthy \nopponent to compete by allowing that candidate to raise the necessary \nfunding through increased contribution limits, depending on the amount \nthe wealthy candidate spends of his or her own money. It would also \nrequire candidates to declare the amount of personal money they intend \nto spend, and encourage them to stick to their pledge by requiring \ndisclosure should they violate that pledge.\n  Any successful campaign finance reform bill must address the \nrealities of elections as we approach the new millennium. One of those \nrealities is the so-called issue advocacy or voter education ads. We \nhave all seen these ads: threatening music over provocative images \nblatantly designed to influence voters to vote against a candidate. But \nbecause these ads don't specifically say ``vote against candidate X'' \nthere is currently no limit on how much can be spent on them, and no \naccountability.\n  It is obvious to anyone the purpose of these ads: to skirt current \ncampaign finance laws that require that ads designed to influence \nFederal elections be paid for with hard money, and disclosed to, and \nregulated by, the Federal Election Commission. Under my bill, the law \nwould be changed in such a way to include these types of ads under hard \nmoney limits and disclosure requirements. This would help limit the \nattack ads and give the public the information they need about who is \npaying for these ads and how much they are spending. An informed \nelectorate is the key to any democratic system of government, and my \nbill will give people the information they need to make up their own \nminds.\n  My bill also includes provisions to protect individuals from having \ntheir money involuntarily collected and used for politics by a \ncorporation or labor organization. These provisions mirror those of \nSenator Nickles' Paycheck Protection Act. This measure will require \nprior authorization from workers before a corporation, national bank, \nor labor union finances political activities with any money from dues \nor from payments made as a condition of employment.\n  The legislation I am introducing will also close a conduit for \ncampaign money that should have been closed a long time ago. It will \nban contributions from all individuals not eligible to vote in U.S. \nelections. After all, if a person cannot legally participate in a \nFederal election by voting, why should they be able to participate with \ntheir wallet?\n  And finally, my bill will close the loopholes and ambiguities that \nexist about soliciting Federal soft money from Federal buildings or \nwith Federal equipment. Because I think everyone agrees that it is not \nappropriate to raise political funds with taxpayer-financed equipment, \nor from the very office that might have influence over the interests of \nthe potential donor.\n  These are all commonsense approaches to the problem--measures which I \nbelieve the majority of Americans feel are sensible and long overdue. \nThe Restoration of Americans' Confidence in Elections Act addresses a \nrange of issues and does so in a way that does not single out any one \ngroup, or any particular political affiliation. Because if we are to \npass meaningful reform, it will require that we all take our hits.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill, and making a \nhistoric statement that the old ways of doing business must be \nrelegated to the annals of history. Let's return elections to the \nAmerican people--and let's restore confidence in our Government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1118. A bill to amend the Land and Water Conservation Fund for \npurposes of establishing a Community Recreation and Conservation \nEndowment with certain escrowed oil and gas revenues; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    THE COMMUNITY RECREATION AND CONSERVATION ENDOWMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Community \nRecreation and Conservation Endowment Act of 1997. My bill provides a \nlong-term funding source for the State-side matching grant program of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund Act.\n  Thank you to Senate appropriators for honoring my request to fund the \nLWCF matching grants. The 1998 Interior appropriation bill ensures the \nprograms's short-term viability. I wish we could have earmarked more, \nbut I understand the challenges members face and thank them for their \naccomplishment. Special thanks to Senators Ted Stevens and Slade \nGorton.\n  I am confident we can win on the Senate floor, in conference and with \nthe administration because the program is truly worthy.\n  The LWCF matching grants have helped build thousands of miles of \ntrails, protect thousands of acres of open space, and develop parks, \ncampgrounds, and recreation facilities in every State.\n  Every Federal dollar has been matched--we get two for the price of \none. Unfortunately, Congress and the administration defunded the \nprogram 2 years ago.\n  That's too bad, given what candidate Bill Clinton said: ``I would \nincrease funding for several programs * * * and reinvigorate the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund to make more funds available for the \nacquisition of public outdoor open spaces''.\n  He also said, ``I would also make funds available from the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund to help address critical infrastructure needs \nin state and local facilities.''\n  The millions of Americans who benefit from the matching grants need \nmore than promises. Thankfully, the Interior appropriations bill saves \nthe program for the short term. I am here today to offer a long-term \nsolution.\n  At a recent hearing before the Senate parks subcommittee, former Park \nService Director Roger Kennedy said\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\nthat as long as there is competition between Federal and State programs \nfor LWCF appropriations, the State matching grants will lose. He \nsuggested a separate source of funds.\n  I am taking his advice to heart, and calling upon Congress to \nestablish a separate and permanent fund for State matching grants.\n  My legislation creates an $800 million permanent endowment to provide \nLWCF matching grants to the States. Interest from that account will \nhelp provide parks, campgrounds, trails, and recreation facilities for \nmillions of Americans. It will also help preserve open spaces for the \nfuture.\n  Where does that money come from? On June 19, 1997, the Supreme Court \nruled the Federal Government retains title to lands underlying tidal \nwaters off Alaska's North Slope. As the result, the government will \nreceive $1.6 billion in escrowed oil and gas lease revenues.\n  This sum is twice the amount the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated for the concurrent budget resolution. My bill places this \nbonus $800 million in a permanent endowment account.\n  This new approach is consistent with the vision of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act and a promise made to the American people 30 \nyears ago.\n  Our Government promised us that a portion of proceeds from offshore \noil and gas leases would fund outdoor recreation and conservation. My \nbill makes good on that promise--permanently. It makes sure the State \ngrants are never forgotten again.\n  That sound we hear on the doors to this Chamber is opportunity \nknocking. We must seize the opportunity and use those funds to renew \nand reinvigorate the bipartisan vision of the LWCF.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this endeavor and support the \nCommunity Recreation and Conservation Endowment Act of 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 1119. A bill to amend the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, \n1930 to increase the penalty under certain circumstances for commission \nmerchants, dealers, or brokers who misrepresent the country of origin \nor other characteristics of perishable agricultural commodities; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                        FOOD SAFETY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in March of this year, over 200 \nschoolchildren in my State contracted the hepatitis A virus from food \nserved by the school lunch program. As news of the outbreak began to \npour in, the Michigan Department of Community Health and the Centers \nfor Disease Control went into action to determine the cause. They soon \nfound the culprit: Frozen strawberries sold to the school lunch program \nby a San Diego company named Andrews and Williamson. Investigators also \ndiscovered that some of the strawberries sold to the school lunch \nprogram had been illegally certified as domestically grown when, in \nfact, they had been grown in Mexico.\n  There does not currently exist a method for testing strawberries for \nthe hepatitis A virus. Thus, we may never know whether the strawberries \nbrought in from Mexico were the source of this pathogen. Given the \ngrowing conditions that USDA investigators found at the farm, however, \nthe likelihood is strong.\n  And one thing we do know, Mr. President, is that these strawberries \nshould never have been served in the school lunch program in the first \nplace. By law, products sold to the school lunch program must be \ncertified as being domestically grown. Unfortunately, because the USDA \nlacks the resources to effectively enforce this requirement, companies \nhave typically been trusted to do the right thing. Andrews and \nWilliamson chose to do something else. They chose to break the law by \nmisrepresenting their product's country-of-origin, and over 200 people \nwere poisoned as a result.\n  This dangerous incident, the poisoning of Michigan children by their \nown school lunch program, compelled and received my immediate \ninvolvement. Shortly after the outbreak, I called for, and was granted, \na hearing on the matter. I arranged to have officials from the CDC come \nto my state to brief the families of those affected. During this \nprocess I learned of the similar efforts being made by a private \norganization called Safe Tables Our Priority [STOP]. Their assistance \nthroughout this process has been invaluable.\n  One of the first things I learned while studying this issue was that \na specific statute exists which states that misrepresenting the \ncountry-of-origin of a perishable good is a crime. Unfortunately, the \npenalty for such fraud is a $2,000 fine and possible loss of license; a \nrather small price to pay for poisoning over 200 people.\n  Of course, this does not mean that A will walk away from this \nincident without paying a price. After reviewing the case made by \ninvestigators from the USDA, the U.S. Attorneys Office filed 47 charges \nagainst A The first charge is conspiracy to defraud the United \nStates. Counts two, three and four are for making false statements, and \ncounts five through forty-seven are for making false claims. For each \nof these counts, the maximum penalty is 5 years and/or $250,000 per \ncount or $500,000 for a corporation.\n  I state these charges because they do not include any mention of the \nspecific crime which A is accused of violating, namely, \nmisrepresenting the country-of-origin for a perishable food. Well, Mr. \nPresident, I intend to rectify this oversight. Today I am introducing \nlegislation which modifies current law such that an intentional \nmisrepresentation of the origin, kind or character of any perishable \ncommodity, the reckless disregard of the effects on the public safety \nof such action, or violations which result in serious injury, illness \nor death will constitute a felony with a maximum penalty of five years \nimprisonment and/or a fine of $250,000 per count.\n  This change in law will ensure that individuals who intentionally \nmisrepresent their goods will now suffer the appropriate consequences \nof their actions. The recent outbreaks of hepatitis A, Cyclospora and E \nColi demonstrate that a new commitment to food safety is sorely needed \nin this country. I will continue working to see that Congress takes the \nappropriate measures to assist the USDA, FDA and Centers for Disease \nControl in their efforts to keep America's food supply the safest in \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that the full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend Title 17 to implement the WIPO Copyright \nTreaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nthe wipo copyright and performance and phonograms treaty implementation \n                              act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation proposed \nby the Clinton administration to implement two important treaties that \nwere adopted last December by the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization (WIPO). The distinguished Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Sen. Leahy, the distinguished Senator for Tennessee, Sen. \nThompson, and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Sen. Kohl, join \nme as original cosponsors. I strongly support adoption of the treaties, \nand I am introducing this bill on behalf of the Administration as an \nessential step in that process. I believe that the Administration's \nbill provides an excellent starting point for the debate on exactly \nwhat must be changed in U.S. law in order to comply with the treaties.\n  The WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO performances and Phonograms\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\nTreaty--completed after years of intense lobbying by the United States \ngovernment--will update international copyright law for the digital age \nand ensure the protection of American creative products abroad. I want \nto commend Secretary of Commerce Bill Daley, Commissioner of Patents \nand Trademarks Bruce Lehman, and their staffs for their efforts in \nmoving this important issue forward, and I welcome the opportunity to \nwork with them during the legislative process.\n  The United States leads the world in the production of creative works \nand high-technology products--including software, movies, recordings, \nmusic, books, video games, and information. Copyright industries \nrepresent nearly 6% of the U.S. gross domestic product, and nearly 5% \nof U.S. employment. Yet American companies lose $18-20 billion every \nyear due to international piracy of copyrighted works. The film \nindustry alone estimates its annual losses due to counterfeiting in \nexcess of $2.3 billion, even though full-length motion pictures are not \nyet available on the Internet. The recording industry estimates that it \nlooses more than $1.2 billion each year due to piracy, with seizures of \nbootleg CDS up some 1,300 percent in 1995. These figures will only \ncontinue to grow with the recent technological developments that permit \ncreative products to be pirated and distributed globally with the touch \nof a button, significantly weakening international protection for the \ncopyrighted works that are such a critical part of this country's \neconomic backbone and costing the U.S. economy exports and jobs.\n  The WIPO treaties will raise the minimum standards for copyright \nprotection worldwide, providing the U.S. with the tools it needs to \ncombat international piracy. But the treaties will be meaningless \nunless they are ratified by a large number of countries. It is \ntherefore up to the United States to demonstrate leadership on this \nissue by ratifying and implementing the treaties promptly. Swift U.S. \naction will encourage global implementation of the WIPO treaties, and \nwill signal U.S. determination to curb the threat that international \npiracy poses to U.S. jobs and the economy.\n  This bill takes the approach that the substantive protections in U.S. \ncopyright law already meet the standards of the new WIPO treaties, and \ntherefore very few changes to U.S. law are necessary in order to \nimplement the treaties. In addition to minimal technical amendments, \nthe treaties require signatory countries to provide legal protections \nagainst the circumvention of certain technologies that copyright owners \nuse to protect their works and to guard against the alteration or \nfalsification of identifying data known as copyright management \ninformation (CMI).\n  This ``minimalist'' bill is the product of much hard work by the \nAdministration, and represents many months of negotiations among \ninterested parties, including software companies, computer \nmanufacturers, and the copyright community. This bill is a compromise; \nit does not represent any group's ``wish list'' for WIPO implementing \nlegislation. The Administration has tried to craft a bill that \naddresses only those issues required by the treaties without altering \nthe substantive protections and exceptions provided under U.S. \ncopyright law or injecting extraneous issues into the treaty process. \nThe Administration has tried to preserve the delicate balance that U.S. \nlaw already strikes between copyright owners and users, since the WIPO \ntreaties were not intended to upset that balance.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this legislation serious consideration. \nThe Judiciary Committee will begin hearings on this bill shortly. I \nwould like to see the treaties go into effect this year, and I will try \nhard to meet this goal. However, the late date on which the \nAdministration has submitted the legislation may render this goal \nunachievable.\n  In any event, we must act promptly to ratify and implement the WIPO \ntreaties in order to demonstrate leadership on international copyright \nprotection, so that the WIPO treaties can be implemented globally and \nso that further theft of our nation's most valuable creative products \nmay be prevented.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1121\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the successful adoption by the World \nIntellectual Property Organization [WIPO] of two new copyright \ntreaties--one on written material and one on sound recordings--in \nGeneva last December was appropriately lauded in the United States. The \nWIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty \nwill give a significant boost to the protection of intellectual \nproperty rights around the world, and stand to benefit important \nAmerican creative industries--from movies, recordings, computer \nsoftware and many other copyrighted materials that are subject to \npiracy on-line.\n  According to Secretary Daley of the Department of Commerce, for the \nmost part, ``the treaties largely incorporate intellectual property \nnorms that are already part of U.S. law.'' What the treaties will do is \ngive American owners of copyrighted material an important tool to \nprotect their intellectual property in those countries that become a \nparty to the treaties. With an ever-expanding global marketplace, such \ninternational protection is critical to protect American companies and, \nultimately, American jobs and the U.S. economy.\n  Over the past few months, I spoke and wrote to Secretary Daley urging \nhim to transmit without delay the administration's proposal for \nimplementing legislation. I am very pleased that earlier this week, the \nadministration did so. The legislative package we received is an \nexcellent start for moving forward, and I commend the administration, \nSecretary Daley and, in particular, Assistant Secretary Bruce Lehman of \nthe Patent and Trademark Office for their hard work on this proposal.\n  I am glad to introduce this legislation, with Senator Hatch, on \nbehalf of the administration. I hope we will take this matter up for \nhearings and further deliberation and action promptly after the recess.\n  In sum, this bill makes certain technical changes to conform our \ncopyright laws to the treaties and substantive amendments to comply \nwith two new Treaty obligations. Specifically, the treaties oblige the \nsignatories to provide legal protections against circumvention of \ntechnological measures used by copyright owners to protect their works, \nand against violations of the integrity of copyright management \ninformation [CMI], which identifies a work, its author, the copyright \nowners and any information about the terms and conditions of use of the \nwork. The bill adds a new chapter to U.S. copyright law to implement \nthe anti-circumvention and CMI provisions, along with corresponding \ncivil and criminal penalties.\n  Technological developments, such as the development of the Internet \nand remote computer information data bases, are leading to important \nadvancements in accessibility and affordability of art, literature, \nmusic, film and information and services for all Americans. As Vinton \nCerf, the coinventor of the computer networking protocol for the \nInternet, recently stated in The New York Times:\n\n       The Internet is now perhaps the most global and democratic \n     form of communications. No other medium can so easily render \n     outdated our traditional distinctions among localities, \n     regions and nations.\n\n  We see opportunities to break through barriers previously facing \nthose living in rural settings and those with physical disabilities. \nDemocratic values can be served by making more information and services \navailable.\n  These methods of distribution also dramatically affect the role of \ncopyright. Properly balancing copyright interests to encourage and \nreward creativity, while serving the needs of public access to works, \ncan be a challenge. The public interest requires the consideration and \nbalancing of such interests. In the area of creative rights that \nbalance has rested on encouraging creativity by ensuring rights that \nreward it while encouraging its public performance, distribution and \ndisplay.\n  I was glad to have played a role in the development and enactment of \nthe Digital Performance Right in Sound Recording Act, Public Law 104-\n39. That legislation served in many respects as the precursor to the \nWIPO Treaty on performance rights adopted last December. Performance \nrights for sound recordings is an issue that has been in dispute for \nover 20 years. I was delighted in 1995 when we were finally able to \nenact a U.S. law establishing that right.\n  I believe that musicians, singers and featured performers on \nrecordings ought to be compensated like other creative artists for the \npublic performances of works that they create and that we all enjoy. I \nwanted companies that export American music not to be disadvantaged \ninternationally by the lack of U.S. recognition of such a performance \nright. Most of all, I wanted to be sure that our laws be fair to all \nparties--to performers, musicians, songwriters, music publishers, \nperforming rights societies, emerging companies expanding new \ntechnologies, and, in particular, consumers and the public.\n  I am glad to have been able to play a role in redesigning the \nperformance right in sound recording law to meet these objectives. Our \nsubstitute, which was ultimately enacted, preserved existing rights, \nencouraged the development of new technologies, and promoted \ncompetition as the best protection for consumers. Working with Senator \nThurmond, then chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, and with the\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\nhelp of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, we were \nable to strengthen the bill in significant regard. I was pleased to \ncosponsor the substitute and to work for its passage.\n  I have also been supportive of copyright protection and \nanticircumvention legislation over the past several years and been \nworking on ways to utilize copyright management information to protect \nand inform consumers.\n  I anticipate that at Judiciary Committee hearings on this important \nmeasure, we will examine the impact of the treaties and this \nimplementing legislation, both domestically and internationally, on the \ncareful balance we always strive to maintain between the authors' \ninterest in protection along with the public's interest in the \naccessibility of information.\n  Ours is a time of unprecedented challenge to copyright protection. \nCopyright has been the engine that has traditionally converted the \nenergy of artistic creativity into publicly available arts and \nentertainment. Historically, the Government's role has been to \nencourage creativity and innovation by protecting copyrights that \ncreate incentives for the dissemination to the public of new works and \nforms of expression. That is the tradition which I intend to continue.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators Hatch and \nLeahy, I rise in support in the WIPO Copyright and Performances and \nPhonograms Treaty Implementation Act of 1997. This proposal, while \nclearly not a final product, is nevertheless an important step forward \nin our ongoing battle against illegal copying of protected works--such \nas movies, books, musical recordings, and software. Let me also commend \nthe administration, especially the Commerce Department and the Patent \nand Trademark Office, for their hard work in pushing for the underlying \ntreaty and assembling a workable proposal to ensure the value of \nintellectual property.\n  What makes this legislation so important to our economy? Consider \nthat the copyright industries had over $53 billion in foreign sales in \n1995, surpassing every other export industry except automobiles and \nagriculture. Also consider that the copyright industries employ nearly \n6 million people in the United States, or about 4.8 percent of our work \nforce. But despite the tremendous contribution these businesses make to \nour economy, we still lose more than $15 billion each year due to \nforeign copyright piracy, according to some estimates. That is not only \nwrong; it is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, we need to maintain our status as an international \nleader in the fight against illegal copying because many nations look \nto us for guidance in setting their own standards for copyright \nprotection. And we need to show strong leadership in this area because, \notherwise, some nations with troubling histories of copyright piracy \nwill be even less likely to improve their records. This proposal moves \nus in the right direction.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember back in 1991 when I introduced \nsimilar legislation, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act, to deal with \nthe problem of video bootlegging. Although today's technology is more \nadvanced than in 1991, the problem of unauthorized copying remains. \nIndeed, it has in some respects grown even worse. The spread of copying \ntechnology worldwide, including piracy that takes place with the touch \nof a button over the Internet, begins to explain the scope of this \nproblem. And because the piracy problem extends across national \nborders, the best way to address unauthorized copying is through \ninternational agreements that go after devices deliberately designed to \ncircumvent technological protection measures.\n  Mr. President, this bill generally takes the right approach. It makes \nit illegal to circumvent various copyright protection systems, it \nprotects the integrity of copyright management information, and it \nprovides for both civil and criminal penalties to deter potential \nviolators. Some have suggested that it goes too far, while others argue \nthat the bill does not go far enough. In any event, we should view this \nproposal as a point of departure rather than a final product. And we \nshould make certain, as the measure moves forward, that it doesn't \nrestrict products that have other beneficial uses.\n  Mr. President, let me make one additional point. The bill does not \naddress the issue of online service provider liability. This issue \nneeds to be discussed and resolved, whether as part of this legislation \nor separately. But it shouldn't slow down the consideration of the bill \nwe have before us. The WIPO Implementation Act is a significant step in \ncurbing illegal copying, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1122. A bill to establish a national registry of abusive and \ncriminal patient care workers and to require criminal background checks \nof patient care workers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    THE PATIENT ABUSE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Patient Abuse \nPrevention Act, a bill to establish greater safeguards in our health \ncare system for vulnerable Americans. I am pleased to be joined in \noffering this bill by Senate Committee on Aging Chairman Charles \nGrassley and Senator Harry Reid.\n  One of the most difficult times for any family is when a senior or \ndisabled member enters a long-term care arrangement. That family should \nnot also be faced with the worry that the long-term care facility or \nits staff may pose a threat.\n  Whatever health care setting a family chooses, whether institutional \nor community-based, there should be assurances that care will be \nprovided by trained and compassionate professionals.\n  Thankfully, that is the case in most facilities. But in a few cases--\nand that is a few cases too many--a long-term care facility hires \nsomeone who doesn't have the best interests of the patient in mind.\n  A disturbing number of cases have been reported where health care \nworkers with criminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in a long-\nterm care facility and have abused patients in their care. If only \ngreater attention was given to discovering the background of these \napplicants, the abuses may have been prevented.\n  A recent report from the Nation's long-term care ombudsmen indicates \nthat, in 29 States surveyed, 7,043 cases of abuse, gross neglect or \nexploitation occurred in nursing homes and board and care facilities.\n  According to a random-sample survey of nursing home staff, 10 percent \nadmitted committing at least one act of physical abuse in the preceding \nyear, and 40 percent committed psychological abuse. Thirty-six percent \nof the sample had seen at least one incident of physical abuse in the \npreceding year by other staff members.\n  These statistics may only scratch the surface of the problem. It's \nquite likely that the incidence of abuse is far more prevalent. In \nfact, the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services has reported that 46 percent of respondents questioned \nbelieved abuse is only sometimes or rarely reported.\n  Mr. President, the vast majority of health care facilities and their \nemployees are dedicated and work hard under stressful conditions to \nprovide the best care possible. But it only takes a few abusive staff \nto cast a dark shadow over what should be a healing environment.\n  Although some facilities run thorough background checks on \nprospective employees, most do not. And even if they wanted to run more \ncomplete checks, facilities are prevented due to a fractured and \ninefficient system.\n  It is far too easy for a health care worker with a criminal or \nabusive background to gain employment and prey on the most vulnerable \npatients.\n  Why is this? Because current State and national safeguards are \ninadequate to screen out abusive workers. All States are required to \nmaintain nurse aide registries, but these registries are not \ncomprehensive or efficiently maintained.\n  Many States limit their registries to nursing home aides, failing to \ncover home health aides, assisted living workers and hospital aides. \nMost States don't require criminal background checks of long-term care \nworkers. Further, due to hit and miss investigations, many reports of \nabuse fall through the cracks.\n  The problem I find most troubling is the lack of information sharing \nbetween States about known criminal\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nand abusive workers. There are no Federal requirements or guidelines on \ninformation sharing about abusive workers--even those who have been \nconvicted in a court of law.\n  Because no national registry of abusive health care workers exists, \npeople with histories of abuse or serious crimes in one State can \nsimply travel to another State to find work. These workers can also \nmove from a nursing home to home health agencies or to hospitals \nwithout ever undergoing a complete background check.\n  Problems also exist with reporting abuse. Rather than going through \nthe trouble of making a report and drawing possible unwanted attention, \na facility often will dismiss a worker without a report ever filed. \nFurther, States hesitate to document problem workers due to the fact \nthat a listing means barring a worker from nursing homes for life.\n  Much of the public scrutiny on patient abuse has focused on nursing \nhomes. But this is not the only care setting that should have increased \nprotections. Home health care has been dramatically growing as a \npreferred long-term care option. Yet, protections for home care \nrecipients are even more lax than those for nursing home residents.\n  While I am pleased to report that some States, including Wisconsin, \nhave begun working to establish criminal background checks and improve \ntheir registries, it is clear that effective national protections must \nbe in place to fill the gaps in the system.\n  The legislation I offer today builds on recommendations by State \nombudsmen programs who are the watch guards for long-term care \nresidents. This effort is also in response to calls from consumer \ngroups and the long-term care industry for a streamlined, accurate way \nto screen potential workers for abusive or criminal histories.\n  The Patient Abuse Prevention Act creates a national registry of \nabusive health care workers and requires criminal background checks for \nthose entrusted to care for vulnerable patients.\n  This would enable States and employers--either by computer or by \nphone--to check if a potential employee has a criminal record or other \nproblem in their past that should preclude them from caring for the \ninfirm.\n  The national registry would also create a coordinated information \nnetwork between States so that violators could not simply travel to \nanother state to find work in a nursing home or other setting.\n  By far, the best way to stop abuse is to address the situations that \nlead to problem behaviors. Most studies that have looked into patient \nabuse indicate that better training would make a big difference. \nTherefore, this bill creates a demonstration program to investigate \nbest practices in patient abuse prevention. What we learn from this \nprogram can then be disseminated by the Department of Health and Human \nServices and made available to all health care settings.\n  Mr. President, when a patient moves into a nursing home, or hires a \nhome health care agency, they are entrusting that company with an \nenormous responsibility.\n  Any instance of patient abuse is intolerable and inadequate \nbackground checks of health care workers is inexcusable.\n  I believe that protecting our Nation's elderly and infirm Americans \nfrom abuse, neglect, and mistreatment should be a national priority. \nWhen senior citizens and disabled Americans check into a nursing home \nor other care setting, they should not have to check their right to a \nsafe environment at the door.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this effort so that all Americans can \nrest more comfortably knowing that their loved ones are receiving the \nbest and safest care possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the Patient Abuse Prevention \nAct, along with a comprehensive summary now appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL REGISTRY OF ABUSIVE \n                   WORKERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish, under the \n     health care fraud and abuse data collection program \n     established under section 1128E of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7e), a registry to be known as the \n     ``National Registry of Abusive Workers'' (hereafter referred \n     to in this section as the ``Registry'') to collect and \n     maintain data on covered health care workers (as defined in \n     subsection (e)) who have been the subject of reports of \n     patient abuse.\n       (b) Submission of Information By State Registries.--Each \n     State registry under sections 1819(e)(2) and 1919(e)(2) of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i-3(e)(2) and \n     1396r(e)(2)) shall submit to the Registry any existing or \n     newly acquired information contained in the State registry \n     concerning covered health care workers who have been the \n     subject of confirmed findings of patient abuse.\n       (c) Submission of Information By State.--Each State shall \n     report to the Registry any existing or newly acquired \n     information concerning the identity of any covered health \n     care worker who has been found to have committed an abusive \n     act involving a patient, including the identity of any such \n     worker who has been convicted of a Federal or State crime as \n     described in section 1128(a)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a)(2)(A)). The State shall provide such \n     workers with a right to issue a statement concerning the \n     submission of information to the Registry under this \n     subsection. Any information disclosed concerning a finding of \n     an abusive act shall also include disclosure of any statement \n     submitted by a worker in the registry relating to the finding \n     or a clear and accurate summary of such a statement.\n       (d) Submission of Information by Facilities.--Each covered \n     health care facility shall report to the State concerning a \n     covered health care worker who has been found to have engaged \n     in an act of patient abuse. The State shall, in accordance \n     with the procedures described in part 483 of title 42, Code \n     of Federal Regulations (as in effect on July 1, 1995), \n     conduct an investigation with respect to a report under this \n     subsection to determine the validity of such a report.\n       (e) Background Check.--\n       (1) Requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--Each covered health care facility (as \n     defined in subsection (f)), prior to employing a covered \n     health care worker, shall--\n       (i) in the case of a covered health care worker who has not \n     otherwise undergone a criminal background check as part of \n     the licensing requirements of a State, as determined under \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary, provide for the \n     conduct by the State of a criminal background check (through \n     an existing State database (if any) and through the \n     Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System) \n     concerning such worker, and provide the worker with prior \n     written notice of the requirement for such a background \n     check;\n       (ii) obtain from a covered health care worker prior to \n     employment a written certification that such worker does not \n     have a criminal record, and that a finding of abuse has not \n     been made relating to such worker, that would preclude such \n     worker from carrying out duties that require direct patient \n     care; and\n       (iii) in the case of all such workers, contact the State \n     health care worker registries established under sections \n     1819(e)(2) and 1919(e)(2) which shall also contact the \n     Registry for information concerning the worker.\n       (B) Imposition of fees.--A State may assess a covered \n     health care facility a fee for the conduct of a criminal \n     background check under subparagraph (A)(i) in an amount that \n     does not exceed the actual cost of the conduct of the \n     background check. Such a facility may recover from the \n     covered health care worker involved a fee in an amount equal \n     to not more than 50 percent of the amount of the fee assessed \n     by the State for the criminal background check.\n       (C) Effective date.--The requirement in subparagraph (A)(i) \n     shall become applicable on January 1, 1999, or on such \n     earlier date as the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation determines that the Integrated Automated \n     Fingerprint Identification System has become operational.\n       (2) Probationary employment.--Each covered health care \n     facility shall provide a probationary period of employment \n     for a covered health care worker pending the completion of \n     the background checks required under paragraph (1)(A). Such \n     facility shall maintain direct supervision of the covered \n     health care worker during the worker's probationary period of \n     employment.\n       (3) Penalty.--\n       (A) In general.--A covered health care facility that \n     violates paragraph (1) or (2) shall be subject to a civil \n     penalty in an amount not to exceed--\n       (i) for the first such violation, $2,000; and\n       (ii) for the second and each subsequent violation within \n     any 5-year period, $5,000.\n       (B) Knowing retention of worker.--In addition to any civil \n     penalty under subparagraph (A), a covered health care \n     facility that--\n       (i) knowingly continues to employ a covered health care \n     worker in violation of paragraph (1) or (2) in a position \n     involving direct patient care; or\n       (ii) knowingly fails to report a covered health care worker \n     who has been determined to have committed patient abuse;\n     shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to \n     exceed $5,000 for the first such\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\n     violation, and $10,000 for the second and each subsequent \n     violation within any 5-year period.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Covered health care facility.--The term ``covered \n     health care facility'' means--\n       (A) with respect to application under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.), a provider of services, as defined in section \n     1861(u) of such Act (other than a fund for purposes of \n     sections 1814(g) and 1835(e));\n       (B) with respect to application under the medicaid program \n     under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et \n     seq.), any nursing facility, home health agency, community-\n     based residential facility, adult day care center, adult \n     family home, assisted living facility, hospice program, \n     hospital, treatment facility, personal care worker agency, \n     supportive home care worker agency, board and care facility, \n     or any other entity that receives assistance or benefits \n     under the medicaid program under that title;\n       (C) a facility of the National Institutes of Health;\n       (D) a facility of the Indian Health Service;\n       (F) a health center under section 330 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b);\n       (G) a hospital or other patient care facility owned or \n     operated under the authority of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs or the Department of Defense.\n       (2) Covered health care worker.--The term ``covered health \n     care worker'' means any individual that has direct contact \n     with a patient of a covered health care facility under an \n     employment or other contract, or under a volunteer agreement, \n     with such facility. Such term includes individuals who are \n     licensed or certified by the State to provide such services, \n     and non-licensed individuals providing such services as \n     defined by the Secretary including nurse assistants, nurses \n     aides, home health aides, and personal care workers and \n     attendants.\n       (3) Patient abuse.--The term ``patient abuse'' means any \n     incidence of abuse, neglect, mistreatment, or \n     misappropriation of property of a patient of a covered health \n     care facility. The terms ``abuse'', ``neglect'', \n     ``mistreatment'', and ``misappropriation of property'' shall \n     have the meanings given such terms in part 483 of title 42, \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       (g) Consultation.--In carrying out this section the \n     Secretary shall consult with the Director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation.\n       (h) Regulations.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations to carry out this section. With respect to \n     subsections (b) and (c), the regulations shall call for the \n     submission of information to the Registry not later than 30 \n     days after the date of a conviction or on which a finding is \n     made.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PARTICIPATION \n                   IN PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Mandatory Lifetime Exclusion.--Section 1128(a) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Criminal conviction.--Any individual or entity that \n     has been--\n       ``(A) convicted, under Federal or State law, of a criminal \n     offense involving a crime against bodily security, including \n     homicide, battery, endangerment of safety, sexual assault, \n     child or elder abuse, and spousal abuse; or\n       ``(B) found to have--\n       ``(i) knowingly continued to employ an individual described \n     in subparagraph (A) in a position involving direct patient \n     care; or\n       ``(ii) knowingly failed to report an individual who has \n     been determined to have committed a crime described in \n     subparagraph (A).''.\n       (b) Permissive Exclusion.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)) is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(16) Finding relating to patient abuse.--Any individual \n     or entity that--\n       ``(A) is or has been the subject of a specific documented \n     finding of patient abuse by a State (as determined under \n     procedures utilized by a State under section 1819(e)(2) or \n     1919(e)(2)); or\n       ``(B) has been found to have--\n       ``(i) knowingly continued to employ an individual described \n     in subparagraph (A) in a position involving direct patient \n     care; or\n       ``(ii) knowingly failed to report an individual who has \n     been determined to have committed patient abuse as described \n     in subparagraph (A).''; and\n       (B) in subsection (c)(3), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(G) In the case of an exclusion of an individual or \n     entity under subsection (b)(16), the period of exclusion \n     shall be determined in accordance with regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary based on the severity of the \n     conduct that is the subject of the exclusion.''.\n       (2) Regulations.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall promulgate regulations to establish periods of \n     exclusion for purposes of section 1128(c)(3)(G) of the Social \n     Security Act.\n       (c) Exclusions Apply to Any Entity Eligible for Federal \n     Reimbursement.--Section 1128 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1320a-7) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(j) Applicability of certain exclusions.--The exclusion \n     (or direction to exclude) an individual or entity under \n     subsections (a)(2) and (b)(16) shall provide that such \n     individual or entity is excluded from working for or on \n     behalf of any entity that is eligible for reimbursement under \n     a Federal health care program, as defined in section \n     1128B(f).''.\n\n     SEC. 4. PREVENTION AND TRAINING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall establish a demonstration program to provide \n     grants to develop information on best practices in patient \n     abuse prevention training (including behavior training and \n     interventions) for managers and staff of hospital and health \n     care facilities.\n       (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     subsection (a), an entity shall be a public or private \n     nonprofit entity and prepare and submit to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services an application at such time, in \n     such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--Amounts received under a grant under \n     this section shall be used to--\n       (1) examine ways to improve collaboration between State \n     health care survey and provider certification agencies, long-\n     term care ombudsman programs, the long-term care industry, \n     and local community members;\n       (2) examine patient care issues relating to regulatory \n     oversight, community involvement, and facility staffing and \n     management with a focus on staff training, staff stress \n     management and staff supervision;\n       (3) examine the use of patient abuse prevention training \n     programs by long-term care entities, including the training \n     program developed by the National Association of Attorneys \n     General, and the extent to which such programs are used; and\n       (4) identify and disseminate best practices for preventing \n     and reducing patient abuse.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Patient Abuse Prevention Act\n\n\n        section 1. short title: ``patient abuse prevention act''\n\n      section 2. creation of national registry of abusive workers\n\n       The National Registry will be established and maintained by \n     the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of \n     Inspector General. HHS is currently setting up a health care \n     fraud and abuse data bank pursuant to the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act. This bill would increase \n     the scope of that data bank and require active use of the \n     registry. HHS will coordinate criminal findings and listings \n     with the FBI.\n       Timeline--Within six months after the bill is enacted, HHS \n     will establish the National Abuse Registry and publish \n     regulations regarding submission of information from state \n     abuse registries to the National Registry. Abuse findings \n     will be reported to the Registry no later than 30 days \n     following confirmation.\n\n\n                        contents/use of registry\n\n       States will submit current nurse aide abuse registries to \n     HHS following issuance of regulations on standard formats for \n     submission.\n       States will expand nurse aide abuse registries to include \n     other health care workers and personnel that have direct \n     contact with vulnerable patients. Current state registries \n     are limited to nurse aides, and in some states, home health \n     aides.\n       The National Registry will also include all health care \n     workers who have been convicted of an abuse, who have been \n     subject to an abuse finding or who have a criminal record \n     that has a bearing on the care of vulnerable patients.\n       Any provider hiring or employing a direct care worker would \n     contact the state for a check on the state registry and a \n     check of the National Registry. In addition, a criminal \n     background check will be initiated (described below).\n\n\n                            reports of abuse\n\n       Current HHS regulations require long-term care facilities \n     to investigate and report abuses for further investigations \n     to the appropriate state agency. This codifies that \n     requirement.\n       Similarly, states must investigate patient abuse reports \n     and contact the National Registry with any confirmed abuses.\n       Any finding of abuse will be submitted to the National \n     Registry along with a statement of the person subject to the \n     finding. Any abuse disclosure shall be accompanied by the \n     statement.\n       States will also report known serious criminal convictions \n     of health care workers outside of the health care setting to \n     the national abuse registry. HHS will consult with the \n     Department of Justice to address privacy concerns and to \n     ensure coordination of the health care registry with national \n     criminal data bank maintained by the FBI.\n\n\n                  mandatory criminal background checks\n\n       FBI criminal background checks will be required for those \n     direct patient care workers who have not been subject to a \n     criminal background check under state licensing requirements. \n     This includes licensed practitioners who have not undergone a \n     background check, nurse aides, home health aides\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\n     and other workers that will have unsupervised contact with a \n     vulnerable patient.\n       States will submit check requests to the FBI national \n     criminal background check system (fingerprint checks). \n     Because of the current backlog at FBI for fingerprint checks, \n     the provision is delayed until no later than January 1, 1999. \n     At that time, FBI should have the Integrated Automated \n     Fingerprint Identification System fully operational. That \n     system should operate within a two-day turn around and at \n     less cost than the current manual system.\n       Fees: States may charge fees to cover cost of FBI check, \n     not to exceed their cost. Facilities may split the cost of \n     the fees with the applicant.\n\n\n                      penalties for non-compliance\n\n       If a provider fails to inquire with the state and hires a \n     known abuser, the provider is subject to a fine of $2,000 for \n     the first violation and $5,000 for subsequent violations. If \n     there is willful disregard of the background check and \n     reporting requirements, the fines increase up to $10,000.\n\n\n  section 3. changes to current law exclusions and obra '87 provisions\n\n       Current law requires that only nurse aides are listed on \n     state registries. This requirement will be expanded to cover \n     all direct case workers.\n       Current law already mandates exclusion for those convicted \n     of patient abuse or other crimes within the health care \n     setting. This adds a prohibition to health care workers who \n     have been convicted of the most serious crimes outside of the \n     health care setting, including homicide, battery, sexual \n     assault, and child, elder or spousal abuse.\n       Varying degrees of abuse ``findings'' will be allowed on \n     state and national registry. One of the main complaints of \n     providers and state ombudsman programs is that a ``finding'' \n     of abuse equates to a ``death sentence'' by banning an \n     individual from working as a nurse aide for life. Due to the \n     severity of the ban, facilities may avoid pursuing a case and \n     States may hesitate to aggressively pursue abuse reports that \n     may or may not lead to a ``finding.'' Therefore, other health \n     facilities may be unaware of instances of abuse or \n     mistreatment. This bill will allow HHS to issue regulations \n     on varying degree's of findings and exclusions so that those \n     who have had problems will be listed, but not necessarily \n     prohibited from working for life.\n\n\n                              definitions\n\n       Covered Care Workers--Patient care workers who have direct \n     assess to vulnerable patients.\n       Covered Health Care Facilities--those receiving Medicare or \n     Medicaid reimbursement, such as: nursing homes, skilled \n     nursing facilities, home health agencies, community-based \n     residential facilities, board and care facilities, adult day \n     care centers, adult family homes, assisted living facilities, \n     hospice programs, and hospitals. Federal health care \n     facilities are also subject to the requirements.\n       Abuse--Any finding of abuse, neglect, mistreatment of \n     residents or misappropriation of their property as defined in \n     current Federal regulations relating to nurse aides (CFR, \n     Sect. 483.13 (c)(ii).\n       Crime--those that reflect a clear disregard for the health, \n     well-being, safety and general welfare of other people must \n     be prohibited from working in direct contact with vulnerable \n     long term care residents or consumers. Current law already \n     requires exclusion of those convicted of health care fraud \n     and acts of abuse in the health care setting. Other crimes \n     may be cause for exclusion under current law at the \n     discretion of the Secretary of HHS. This bill adds a \n     mandatory exclusion of those convicted of serious crimes that \n     occur outside of the health care setting.\n\n\n           section 4. abuse prevention/training demonstration\n\n       Because the best way to combat patient abuse is to prevent \n     it from occurring, a new demonstration program is created to \n     compile information on best practices in abuse prevention \n     training for managers and staff of health care facilities. \n     The demonstration will focus on ways to improve collaboration \n     between state health care survey and certification agencies, \n     long-term care ombudsman programs, the long term care \n     industry and community members. Current patient abuse \n     prevention training programs will be studied for \n     effectiveness and application to other health care settings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. D'Amato, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 1123. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating \nto the unemployment tax for individuals employed in the entertainment \nindustry; to the Committee on Finance\n\n\n                    unemployment offset legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncorrect a problem with the way unemployment benefits are currently \noffset when received by participants in a multiemployer pension plan.\n  Under our current Unemployment Compensation [UC] system States pay \nand administer UC benefits. The federal government shares in the cost \nof these benefits. Since 1980, the Federal Government has required that \nUC benefits be offset or reduced by any pension benefits that an \nindividual receives from a base-period employer. A base period employer \nis any employer of the recipient during the 52-week period before the \nloss of a job.\n  Here is how it works. If you are involuntarily separated from the \nsame employer that is paying your retirement benefits and your \nemployment caused your retirement benefits to increase any unemployment \ncompensation you may qualify for will be offset by any retirement \nincome received for this same employer. Thus, retirement benefits \nreceived could significantly reduce or eliminate any unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, this policy was implemented, in part, to prevent \nemployees from receiving pension benefits and qualifying for \nunemployment compensation from the same employment.\n  Unfortunately, the application of the offset requirement to \nparticipants in multiemployer pension plans can unfairly penalize some \ntaxpayers. Under current law, all employers in a multiemployer plan \ngroup are considered base-period employers for unemployment \ncompensation purposes. Because of this, members of a multiemployer \npension plan, such as actors and actresses that return to work, even \nthrough it may be for another employer (i.e., studio), are treated as \nreturning to work for the same employer because all entertainment \nindustry employers are part of the same multiemployer pension plan. \nThus, when they return to work in their later years and their pension \nis increased by a nominal amount their unemployment compensation \nbenefits are offset by their full pension amount. This can leave some \nwith the little or no unemployment compensation benefits.\n  Mr. President, to correct this, I am introducing legislation that \nwould simply limit the unemployment benefit offset to the amount of the \npension increase rather than the full pension amount received.

A bill to amend Title 17 to implement the WIPO Copyright \nTreaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nthe wipo copyright and performance and phonograms treaty implementation \n                              act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation proposed \nby the Clinton administration to implement two important treaties that \nwere adopted last December by the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization (WIPO). The distinguished Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Sen. Leahy, the distinguished Senator for Tennessee, Sen. \nThompson, and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Sen. Kohl, join \nme as original cosponsors. I strongly support adoption of the treaties, \nand I am introducing this bill on behalf of the Administration as an \nessential step in that process. I believe that the Administration's \nbill provides an excellent starting point for the debate on exactly \nwhat must be changed in U.S. law in order to comply with the treaties.\n  The WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO performances and Phonograms\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\nTreaty--completed after years of intense lobbying by the United States \ngovernment--will update international copyright law for the digital age \nand ensure the protection of American creative products abroad. I want \nto commend Secretary of Commerce Bill Daley, Commissioner of Patents \nand Trademarks Bruce Lehman, and their staffs for their efforts in \nmoving this important issue forward, and I welcome the opportunity to \nwork with them during the legislative process.\n  The United States leads the world in the production of creative works \nand high-technology products--including software, movies, recordings, \nmusic, books, video games, and information. Copyright industries \nrepresent nearly 6% of the U.S. gross domestic product, and nearly 5% \nof U.S. employment. Yet American companies lose $18-20 billion every \nyear due to international piracy of copyrighted works. The film \nindustry alone estimates its annual losses due to counterfeiting in \nexcess of $2.3 billion, even though full-length motion pictures are not \nyet available on the Internet. The recording industry estimates that it \nlooses more than $1.2 billion each year due to piracy, with seizures of \nbootleg CDS up some 1,300 percent in 1995. These figures will only \ncontinue to grow with the recent technological developments that permit \ncreative products to be pirated and distributed globally with the touch \nof a button, significantly weakening international protection for the \ncopyrighted works that are such a critical part of this country's \neconomic backbone and costing the U.S. economy exports and jobs.\n  The WIPO treaties will raise the minimum standards for copyright \nprotection worldwide, providing the U.S. with the tools it needs to \ncombat international piracy. But the treaties will be meaningless \nunless they are ratified by a large number of countries. It is \ntherefore up to the United States to demonstrate leadership on this \nissue by ratifying and implementing the treaties promptly. Swift U.S. \naction will encourage global implementation of the WIPO treaties, and \nwill signal U.S. determination to curb the threat that international \npiracy poses to U.S. jobs and the economy.\n  This bill takes the approach that the substantive protections in U.S. \ncopyright law already meet the standards of the new WIPO treaties, and \ntherefore very few changes to U.S. law are necessary in order to \nimplement the treaties. In addition to minimal technical amendments, \nthe treaties require signatory countries to provide legal protections \nagainst the circumvention of certain technologies that copyright owners \nuse to protect their works and to guard against the alteration or \nfalsification of identifying data known as copyright management \ninformation (CMI).\n  This ``minimalist'' bill is the product of much hard work by the \nAdministration, and represents many months of negotiations among \ninterested parties, including software companies, computer \nmanufacturers, and the copyright community. This bill is a compromise; \nit does not represent any group's ``wish list'' for WIPO implementing \nlegislation. The Administration has tried to craft a bill that \naddresses only those issues required by the treaties without altering \nthe substantive protections and exceptions provided under U.S. \ncopyright law or injecting extraneous issues into the treaty process. \nThe Administration has tried to preserve the delicate balance that U.S. \nlaw already strikes between copyright owners and users, since the WIPO \ntreaties were not intended to upset that balance.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this legislation serious consideration. \nThe Judiciary Committee will begin hearings on this bill shortly. I \nwould like to see the treaties go into effect this year, and I will try \nhard to meet this goal. However, the late date on which the \nAdministration has submitted the legislation may render this goal \nunachievable.\n  In any event, we must act promptly to ratify and implement the WIPO \ntreaties in order to demonstrate leadership on international copyright \nprotection, so that the WIPO treaties can be implemented globally and \nso that further theft of our nation's most valuable creative products \nmay be prevented.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1121\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the successful adoption by the World \nIntellectual Property Organization [WIPO] of two new copyright \ntreaties--one on written material and one on sound recordings--in \nGeneva last December was appropriately lauded in the United States. The \nWIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty \nwill give a significant boost to the protection of intellectual \nproperty rights around the world, and stand to benefit important \nAmerican creative industries--from movies, recordings, computer \nsoftware and many other copyrighted materials that are subject to \npiracy on-line.\n  According to Secretary Daley of the Department of Commerce, for the \nmost part, ``the treaties largely incorporate intellectual property \nnorms that are already part of U.S. law.'' What the treaties will do is \ngive American owners of copyrighted material an important tool to \nprotect their intellectual property in those countries that become a \nparty to the treaties. With an ever-expanding global marketplace, such \ninternational protection is critical to protect American companies and, \nultimately, American jobs and the U.S. economy.\n  Over the past few months, I spoke and wrote to Secretary Daley urging \nhim to transmit without delay the administration's proposal for \nimplementing legislation. I am very pleased that earlier this week, the \nadministration did so. The legislative package we received is an \nexcellent start for moving forward, and I commend the administration, \nSecretary Daley and, in particular, Assistant Secretary Bruce Lehman of \nthe Patent and Trademark Office for their hard work on this proposal.\n  I am glad to introduce this legislation, with Senator Hatch, on \nbehalf of the administration. I hope we will take this matter up for \nhearings and further deliberation and action promptly after the recess.\n  In sum, this bill makes certain technical changes to conform our \ncopyright laws to the treaties and substantive amendments to comply \nwith two new Treaty obligations. Specifically, the treaties oblige the \nsignatories to provide legal protections against circumvention of \ntechnological measures used by copyright owners to protect their works, \nand against violations of the integrity of copyright management \ninformation [CMI], which identifies a work, its author, the copyright \nowners and any information about the terms and conditions of use of the \nwork. The bill adds a new chapter to U.S. copyright law to implement \nthe anti-circumvention and CMI provisions, along with corresponding \ncivil and criminal penalties.\n  Technological developments, such as the development of the Internet \nand remote computer information data bases, are leading to important \nadvancements in accessibility and affordability of art, literature, \nmusic, film and information and services for all Americans. As Vinton \nCerf, the coinventor of the computer networking protocol for the \nInternet, recently stated in The New York Times:\n\n       The Internet is now perhaps the most global and democratic \n     form of communications. No other medium can so easily render \n     outdated our traditional distinctions among localities, \n     regions and nations.\n\n  We see opportunities to break through barriers previously facing \nthose living in rural settings and those with physical disabilities. \nDemocratic values can be served by making more information and services \navailable.\n  These methods of distribution also dramatically affect the role of \ncopyright. Properly balancing copyright interests to encourage and \nreward creativity, while serving the needs of public access to works, \ncan be a challenge. The public interest requires the consideration and \nbalancing of such interests. In the area of creative rights that \nbalance has rested on encouraging creativity by ensuring rights that \nreward it while encouraging its public performance, distribution and \ndisplay.\n  I was glad to have played a role in the development and enactment of \nthe Digital Performance Right in Sound Recording Act, Public Law 104-\n39. That legislation served in many respects as the precursor to the \nWIPO Treaty on performance rights adopted last December. Performance \nrights for sound recordings is an issue that has been in dispute for \nover 20 years. I was delighted in 1995 when we were finally able to \nenact a U.S. law establishing that right.\n  I believe that musicians, singers and featured performers on \nrecordings ought to be compensated like other creative artists for the \npublic performances of works that they create and that we all enjoy. I \nwanted companies that export American music not to be disadvantaged \ninternationally by the lack of U.S. recognition of such a performance \nright. Most of all, I wanted to be sure that our laws be fair to all \nparties--to performers, musicians, songwriters, music publishers, \nperforming rights societies, emerging companies expanding new \ntechnologies, and, in particular, consumers and the public.\n  I am glad to have been able to play a role in redesigning the \nperformance right in sound recording law to meet these objectives. Our \nsubstitute, which was ultimately enacted, preserved existing rights, \nencouraged the development of new technologies, and promoted \ncompetition as the best protection for consumers. Working with Senator \nThurmond, then chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, and with the\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\nhelp of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, we were \nable to strengthen the bill in significant regard. I was pleased to \ncosponsor the substitute and to work for its passage.\n  I have also been supportive of copyright protection and \nanticircumvention legislation over the past several years and been \nworking on ways to utilize copyright management information to protect \nand inform consumers.\n  I anticipate that at Judiciary Committee hearings on this important \nmeasure, we will examine the impact of the treaties and this \nimplementing legislation, both domestically and internationally, on the \ncareful balance we always strive to maintain between the authors' \ninterest in protection along with the public's interest in the \naccessibility of information.\n  Ours is a time of unprecedented challenge to copyright protection. \nCopyright has been the engine that has traditionally converted the \nenergy of artistic creativity into publicly available arts and \nentertainment. Historically, the Government's role has been to \nencourage creativity and innovation by protecting copyrights that \ncreate incentives for the dissemination to the public of new works and \nforms of expression. That is the tradition which I intend to continue.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators Hatch and \nLeahy, I rise in support in the WIPO Copyright and Performances and \nPhonograms Treaty Implementation Act of 1997. This proposal, while \nclearly not a final product, is nevertheless an important step forward \nin our ongoing battle against illegal copying of protected works--such \nas movies, books, musical recordings, and software. Let me also commend \nthe administration, especially the Commerce Department and the Patent \nand Trademark Office, for their hard work in pushing for the underlying \ntreaty and assembling a workable proposal to ensure the value of \nintellectual property.\n  What makes this legislation so important to our economy? Consider \nthat the copyright industries had over $53 billion in foreign sales in \n1995, surpassing every other export industry except automobiles and \nagriculture. Also consider that the copyright industries employ nearly \n6 million people in the United States, or about 4.8 percent of our work \nforce. But despite the tremendous contribution these businesses make to \nour economy, we still lose more than $15 billion each year due to \nforeign copyright piracy, according to some estimates. That is not only \nwrong; it is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, we need to maintain our status as an international \nleader in the fight against illegal copying because many nations look \nto us for guidance in setting their own standards for copyright \nprotection. And we need to show strong leadership in this area because, \notherwise, some nations with troubling histories of copyright piracy \nwill be even less likely to improve their records. This proposal moves \nus in the right direction.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember back in 1991 when I introduced \nsimilar legislation, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act, to deal with \nthe problem of video bootlegging. Although today's technology is more \nadvanced than in 1991, the problem of unauthorized copying remains. \nIndeed, it has in some respects grown even worse. The spread of copying \ntechnology worldwide, including piracy that takes place with the touch \nof a button over the Internet, begins to explain the scope of this \nproblem. And because the piracy problem extends across national \nborders, the best way to address unauthorized copying is through \ninternational agreements that go after devices deliberately designed to \ncircumvent technological protection measures.\n  Mr. President, this bill generally takes the right approach. It makes \nit illegal to circumvent various copyright protection systems, it \nprotects the integrity of copyright management information, and it \nprovides for both civil and criminal penalties to deter potential \nviolators. Some have suggested that it goes too far, while others argue \nthat the bill does not go far enough. In any event, we should view this \nproposal as a point of departure rather than a final product. And we \nshould make certain, as the measure moves forward, that it doesn't \nrestrict products that have other beneficial uses.\n  Mr. President, let me make one additional point. The bill does not \naddress the issue of online service provider liability. This issue \nneeds to be discussed and resolved, whether as part of this legislation \nor separately. But it shouldn't slow down the consideration of the bill \nwe have before us. The WIPO Implementation Act is a significant step in \ncurbing illegal copying, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1122. A bill to establish a national registry of abusive and \ncriminal patient care workers and to require criminal background checks \nof patient care workers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    THE PATIENT ABUSE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Patient Abuse \nPrevention Act, a bill to establish greater safeguards in our health \ncare system for vulnerable Americans. I am pleased to be joined in \noffering this bill by Senate Committee on Aging Chairman Charles \nGrassley and Senator Harry Reid.\n  One of the most difficult times for any family is when a senior or \ndisabled member enters a long-term care arrangement. That family should \nnot also be faced with the worry that the long-term care facility or \nits staff may pose a threat.\n  Whatever health care setting a family chooses, whether institutional \nor community-based, there should be assurances that care will be \nprovided by trained and compassionate professionals.\n  Thankfully, that is the case in most facilities. But in a few cases--\nand that is a few cases too many--a long-term care facility hires \nsomeone who doesn't have the best interests of the patient in mind.\n  A disturbing number of cases have been reported where health care \nworkers with criminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in a long-\nterm care facility and have abused patients in their care. If only \ngreater attention was given to discovering the background of these \napplicants, the abuses may have been prevented.\n  A recent report from the Nation's long-term care ombudsmen indicates \nthat, in 29 States surveyed, 7,043 cases of abuse, gross neglect or \nexploitation occurred in nursing homes and board and care facilities.\n  According to a random-sample survey of nursing home staff, 10 percent \nadmitted committing at least one act of physical abuse in the preceding \nyear, and 40 percent committed psychological abuse. Thirty-six percent \nof the sample had seen at least one incident of physical abuse in the \npreceding year by other staff members.\n  These statistics may only scratch the surface of the problem. It's \nquite likely that the incidence of abuse is far more prevalent. In \nfact, the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services has reported that 46 percent of respondents questioned \nbelieved abuse is only sometimes or rarely reported.\n  Mr. President, the vast majority of health care facilities and their \nemployees are dedicated and work hard under stressful conditions to \nprovide the best care possible. But it only takes a few abusive staff \nto cast a dark shadow over what should be a healing environment.\n  Although some facilities run thorough background checks on \nprospective employees, most do not. And even if they wanted to run more \ncomplete checks, facilities are prevented due to a fractured and \ninefficient system.\n  It is far too easy for a health care worker with a criminal or \nabusive background to gain employment and prey on the most vulnerable \npatients.\n  Why is this? Because current State and national safeguards are \ninadequate to screen out abusive workers. All States are required to \nmaintain nurse aide registries, but these registries are not \ncomprehensive or efficiently maintained.\n  Many States limit their registries to nursing home aides, failing to \ncover home health aides, assisted living workers and hospital aides. \nMost States don't require criminal background checks of long-term care \nworkers. Further, due to hit and miss investigations, many reports of \nabuse fall through the cracks.\n  The problem I find most troubling is the lack of information sharing \nbetween States about known criminal\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nand abusive workers. There are no Federal requirements or guidelines on \ninformation sharing about abusive workers--even those who have been \nconvicted in a court of law.\n  Because no national registry of abusive health care workers exists, \npeople with histories of abuse or serious crimes in one State can \nsimply travel to another State to find work. These workers can also \nmove from a nursing home to home health agencies or to hospitals \nwithout ever undergoing a complete background check.\n  Problems also exist with reporting abuse. Rather than going through \nthe trouble of making a report and drawing possible unwanted attention, \na facility often will dismiss a worker without a report ever filed. \nFurther, States hesitate to document problem workers due to the fact \nthat a listing means barring a worker from nursing homes for life.\n  Much of the public scrutiny on patient abuse has focused on nursing \nhomes. But this is not the only care setting that should have increased \nprotections. Home health care has been dramatically growing as a \npreferred long-term care option. Yet, protections for home care \nrecipients are even more lax than those for nursing home residents.\n  While I am pleased to report that some States, including Wisconsin, \nhave begun working to establish criminal background checks and improve \ntheir registries, it is clear that effective national protections must \nbe in place to fill the gaps in the system.\n  The legislation I offer today builds on recommendations by State \nombudsmen programs who are the watch guards for long-term care \nresidents. This effort is also in response to calls from consumer \ngroups and the long-term care industry for a streamlined, accurate way \nto screen potential workers for abusive or criminal histories.\n  The Patient Abuse Prevention Act creates a national registry of \nabusive health care workers and requires criminal background checks for \nthose entrusted to care for vulnerable patients.\n  This would enable States and employers--either by computer or by \nphone--to check if a potential employee has a criminal record or other \nproblem in their past that should preclude them from caring for the \ninfirm.\n  The national registry would also create a coordinated information \nnetwork between States so that violators could not simply travel to \nanother state to find work in a nursing home or other setting.\n  By far, the best way to stop abuse is to address the situations that \nlead to problem behaviors. Most studies that have looked into patient \nabuse indicate that better training would make a big difference. \nTherefore, this bill creates a demonstration program to investigate \nbest practices in patient abuse prevention. What we learn from this \nprogram can then be disseminated by the Department of Health and Human \nServices and made available to all health care settings.\n  Mr. President, when a patient moves into a nursing home, or hires a \nhome health care agency, they are entrusting that company with an \nenormous responsibility.\n  Any instance of patient abuse is intolerable and inadequate \nbackground checks of health care workers is inexcusable.\n  I believe that protecting our Nation's elderly and infirm Americans \nfrom abuse, neglect, and mistreatment should be a national priority. \nWhen senior citizens and disabled Americans check into a nursing home \nor other care setting, they should not have to check their right to a \nsafe environment at the door.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this effort so that all Americans can \nrest more comfortably knowing that their loved ones are receiving the \nbest and safest care possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the Patient Abuse Prevention \nAct, along with a comprehensive summary now appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL REGISTRY OF ABUSIVE \n                   WORKERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish, under the \n     health care fraud and abuse data collection program \n     established under section 1128E of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7e), a registry to be known as the \n     ``National Registry of Abusive Workers'' (hereafter referred \n     to in this section as the ``Registry'') to collect and \n     maintain data on covered health care workers (as defined in \n     subsection (e)) who have been the subject of reports of \n     patient abuse.\n       (b) Submission of Information By State Registries.--Each \n     State registry under sections 1819(e)(2) and 1919(e)(2) of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i-3(e)(2) and \n     1396r(e)(2)) shall submit to the Registry any existing or \n     newly acquired information contained in the State registry \n     concerning covered health care workers who have been the \n     subject of confirmed findings of patient abuse.\n       (c) Submission of Information By State.--Each State shall \n     report to the Registry any existing or newly acquired \n     information concerning the identity of any covered health \n     care worker who has been found to have committed an abusive \n     act involving a patient, including the identity of any such \n     worker who has been convicted of a Federal or State crime as \n     described in section 1128(a)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a)(2)(A)). The State shall provide such \n     workers with a right to issue a statement concerning the \n     submission of information to the Registry under this \n     subsection. Any information disclosed concerning a finding of \n     an abusive act shall also include disclosure of any statement \n     submitted by a worker in the registry relating to the finding \n     or a clear and accurate summary of such a statement.\n       (d) Submission of Information by Facilities.--Each covered \n     health care facility shall report to the State concerning a \n     covered health care worker who has been found to have engaged \n     in an act of patient abuse. The State shall, in accordance \n     with the procedures described in part 483 of title 42, Code \n     of Federal Regulations (as in effect on July 1, 1995), \n     conduct an investigation with respect to a report under this \n     subsection to determine the validity of such a report.\n       (e) Background Check.--\n       (1) Requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--Each covered health care facility (as \n     defined in subsection (f)), prior to employing a covered \n     health care worker, shall--\n       (i) in the case of a covered health care worker who has not \n     otherwise undergone a criminal background check as part of \n     the licensing requirements of a State, as determined under \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary, provide for the \n     conduct by the State of a criminal background check (through \n     an existing State database (if any) and through the \n     Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System) \n     concerning such worker, and provide the worker with prior \n     written notice of the requirement for such a background \n     check;\n       (ii) obtain from a covered health care worker prior to \n     employment a written certification that such worker does not \n     have a criminal record, and that a finding of abuse has not \n     been made relating to such worker, that would preclude such \n     worker from carrying out duties that require direct patient \n     care; and\n       (iii) in the case of all such workers, contact the State \n     health care worker registries established under sections \n     1819(e)(2) and 1919(e)(2) which shall also contact the \n     Registry for information concerning the worker.\n       (B) Imposition of fees.--A State may assess a covered \n     health care facility a fee for the conduct of a criminal \n     background check under subparagraph (A)(i) in an amount that \n     does not exceed the actual cost of the conduct of the \n     background check. Such a facility may recover from the \n     covered health care worker involved a fee in an amount equal \n     to not more than 50 percent of the amount of the fee assessed \n     by the State for the criminal background check.\n       (C) Effective date.--The requirement in subparagraph (A)(i) \n     shall become applicable on January 1, 1999, or on such \n     earlier date as the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation determines that the Integrated Automated \n     Fingerprint Identification System has become operational.\n       (2) Probationary employment.--Each covered health care \n     facility shall provide a probationary period of employment \n     for a covered health care worker pending the completion of \n     the background checks required under paragraph (1)(A). Such \n     facility shall maintain direct supervision of the covered \n     health care worker during the worker's probationary period of \n     employment.\n       (3) Penalty.--\n       (A) In general.--A covered health care facility that \n     violates paragraph (1) or (2) shall be subject to a civil \n     penalty in an amount not to exceed--\n       (i) for the first such violation, $2,000; and\n       (ii) for the second and each subsequent violation within \n     any 5-year period, $5,000.\n       (B) Knowing retention of worker.--In addition to any civil \n     penalty under subparagraph (A), a covered health care \n     facility that--\n       (i) knowingly continues to employ a covered health care \n     worker in violation of paragraph (1) or (2) in a position \n     involving direct patient care; or\n       (ii) knowingly fails to report a covered health care worker \n     who has been determined to have committed patient abuse;\n     shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to \n     exceed $5,000 for the first such\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\n     violation, and $10,000 for the second and each subsequent \n     violation within any 5-year period.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Covered health care facility.--The term ``covered \n     health care facility'' means--\n       (A) with respect to application under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.), a provider of services, as defined in section \n     1861(u) of such Act (other than a fund for purposes of \n     sections 1814(g) and 1835(e));\n       (B) with respect to application under the medicaid program \n     under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et \n     seq.), any nursing facility, home health agency, community-\n     based residential facility, adult day care center, adult \n     family home, assisted living facility, hospice program, \n     hospital, treatment facility, personal care worker agency, \n     supportive home care worker agency, board and care facility, \n     or any other entity that receives assistance or benefits \n     under the medicaid program under that title;\n       (C) a facility of the National Institutes of Health;\n       (D) a facility of the Indian Health Service;\n       (F) a health center under section 330 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b);\n       (G) a hospital or other patient care facility owned or \n     operated under the authority of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs or the Department of Defense.\n       (2) Covered health care worker.--The term ``covered health \n     care worker'' means any individual that has direct contact \n     with a patient of a covered health care facility under an \n     employment or other contract, or under a volunteer agreement, \n     with such facility. Such term includes individuals who are \n     licensed or certified by the State to provide such services, \n     and non-licensed individuals providing such services as \n     defined by the Secretary including nurse assistants, nurses \n     aides, home health aides, and personal care workers and \n     attendants.\n       (3) Patient abuse.--The term ``patient abuse'' means any \n     incidence of abuse, neglect, mistreatment, or \n     misappropriation of property of a patient of a covered health \n     care facility. The terms ``abuse'', ``neglect'', \n     ``mistreatment'', and ``misappropriation of property'' shall \n     have the meanings given such terms in part 483 of title 42, \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       (g) Consultation.--In carrying out this section the \n     Secretary shall consult with the Director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation.\n       (h) Regulations.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations to carry out this section. With respect to \n     subsections (b) and (c), the regulations shall call for the \n     submission of information to the Registry not later than 30 \n     days after the date of a conviction or on which a finding is \n     made.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PARTICIPATION \n                   IN PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Mandatory Lifetime Exclusion.--Section 1128(a) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Criminal conviction.--Any individual or entity that \n     has been--\n       ``(A) convicted, under Federal or State law, of a criminal \n     offense involving a crime against bodily security, including \n     homicide, battery, endangerment of safety, sexual assault, \n     child or elder abuse, and spousal abuse; or\n       ``(B) found to have--\n       ``(i) knowingly continued to employ an individual described \n     in subparagraph (A) in a position involving direct patient \n     care; or\n       ``(ii) knowingly failed to report an individual who has \n     been determined to have committed a crime described in \n     subparagraph (A).''.\n       (b) Permissive Exclusion.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)) is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(16) Finding relating to patient abuse.--Any individual \n     or entity that--\n       ``(A) is or has been the subject of a specific documented \n     finding of patient abuse by a State (as determined under \n     procedures utilized by a State under section 1819(e)(2) or \n     1919(e)(2)); or\n       ``(B) has been found to have--\n       ``(i) knowingly continued to employ an individual described \n     in subparagraph (A) in a position involving direct patient \n     care; or\n       ``(ii) knowingly failed to report an individual who has \n     been determined to have committed patient abuse as described \n     in subparagraph (A).''; and\n       (B) in subsection (c)(3), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(G) In the case of an exclusion of an individual or \n     entity under subsection (b)(16), the period of exclusion \n     shall be determined in accordance with regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary based on the severity of the \n     conduct that is the subject of the exclusion.''.\n       (2) Regulations.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall promulgate regulations to establish periods of \n     exclusion for purposes of section 1128(c)(3)(G) of the Social \n     Security Act.\n       (c) Exclusions Apply to Any Entity Eligible for Federal \n     Reimbursement.--Section 1128 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1320a-7) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(j) Applicability of certain exclusions.--The exclusion \n     (or direction to exclude) an individual or entity under \n     subsections (a)(2) and (b)(16) shall provide that such \n     individual or entity is excluded from working for or on \n     behalf of any entity that is eligible for reimbursement under \n     a Federal health care program, as defined in section \n     1128B(f).''.\n\n     SEC. 4. PREVENTION AND TRAINING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall establish a demonstration program to provide \n     grants to develop information on best practices in patient \n     abuse prevention training (including behavior training and \n     interventions) for managers and staff of hospital and health \n     care facilities.\n       (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     subsection (a), an entity shall be a public or private \n     nonprofit entity and prepare and submit to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services an application at such time, in \n     such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--Amounts received under a grant under \n     this section shall be used to--\n       (1) examine ways to improve collaboration between State \n     health care survey and provider certification agencies, long-\n     term care ombudsman programs, the long-term care industry, \n     and local community members;\n       (2) examine patient care issues relating to regulatory \n     oversight, community involvement, and facility staffing and \n     management with a focus on staff training, staff stress \n     management and staff supervision;\n       (3) examine the use of patient abuse prevention training \n     programs by long-term care entities, including the training \n     program developed by the National Association of Attorneys \n     General, and the extent to which such programs are used; and\n       (4) identify and disseminate best practices for preventing \n     and reducing patient abuse.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Patient Abuse Prevention Act\n\n\n        section 1. short title: ``patient abuse prevention act''\n\n      section 2. creation of national registry of abusive workers\n\n       The National Registry will be established and maintained by \n     the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of \n     Inspector General. HHS is currently setting up a health care \n     fraud and abuse data bank pursuant to the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act. This bill would increase \n     the scope of that data bank and require active use of the \n     registry. HHS will coordinate criminal findings and listings \n     with the FBI.\n       Timeline--Within six months after the bill is enacted, HHS \n     will establish the National Abuse Registry and publish \n     regulations regarding submission of information from state \n     abuse registries to the National Registry. Abuse findings \n     will be reported to the Registry no later than 30 days \n     following confirmation.\n\n\n                        contents/use of registry\n\n       States will submit current nurse aide abuse registries to \n     HHS following issuance of regulations on standard formats for \n     submission.\n       States will expand nurse aide abuse registries to include \n     other health care workers and personnel that have direct \n     contact with vulnerable patients. Current state registries \n     are limited to nurse aides, and in some states, home health \n     aides.\n       The National Registry will also include all health care \n     workers who have been convicted of an abuse, who have been \n     subject to an abuse finding or who have a criminal record \n     that has a bearing on the care of vulnerable patients.\n       Any provider hiring or employing a direct care worker would \n     contact the state for a check on the state registry and a \n     check of the National Registry. In addition, a criminal \n     background check will be initiated (described below).\n\n\n                            reports of abuse\n\n       Current HHS regulations require long-term care facilities \n     to investigate and report abuses for further investigations \n     to the appropriate state agency. This codifies that \n     requirement.\n       Similarly, states must investigate patient abuse reports \n     and contact the National Registry with any confirmed abuses.\n       Any finding of abuse will be submitted to the National \n     Registry along with a statement of the person subject to the \n     finding. Any abuse disclosure shall be accompanied by the \n     statement.\n       States will also report known serious criminal convictions \n     of health care workers outside of the health care setting to \n     the national abuse registry. HHS will consult with the \n     Department of Justice to address privacy concerns and to \n     ensure coordination of the health care registry with national \n     criminal data bank maintained by the FBI.\n\n\n                  mandatory criminal background checks\n\n       FBI criminal background checks will be required for those \n     direct patient care workers who have not been subject to a \n     criminal background check under state licensing requirements. \n     This includes licensed practitioners who have not undergone a \n     background check, nurse aides, home health aides\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\n     and other workers that will have unsupervised contact with a \n     vulnerable patient.\n       States will submit check requests to the FBI national \n     criminal background check system (fingerprint checks). \n     Because of the current backlog at FBI for fingerprint checks, \n     the provision is delayed until no later than January 1, 1999. \n     At that time, FBI should have the Integrated Automated \n     Fingerprint Identification System fully operational. That \n     system should operate within a two-day turn around and at \n     less cost than the current manual system.\n       Fees: States may charge fees to cover cost of FBI check, \n     not to exceed their cost. Facilities may split the cost of \n     the fees with the applicant.\n\n\n                      penalties for non-compliance\n\n       If a provider fails to inquire with the state and hires a \n     known abuser, the provider is subject to a fine of $2,000 for \n     the first violation and $5,000 for subsequent violations. If \n     there is willful disregard of the background check and \n     reporting requirements, the fines increase up to $10,000.\n\n\n  section 3. changes to current law exclusions and obra '87 provisions\n\n       Current law requires that only nurse aides are listed on \n     state registries. This requirement will be expanded to cover \n     all direct case workers.\n       Current law already mandates exclusion for those convicted \n     of patient abuse or other crimes within the health care \n     setting. This adds a prohibition to health care workers who \n     have been convicted of the most serious crimes outside of the \n     health care setting, including homicide, battery, sexual \n     assault, and child, elder or spousal abuse.\n       Varying degrees of abuse ``findings'' will be allowed on \n     state and national registry. One of the main complaints of \n     providers and state ombudsman programs is that a ``finding'' \n     of abuse equates to a ``death sentence'' by banning an \n     individual from working as a nurse aide for life. Due to the \n     severity of the ban, facilities may avoid pursuing a case and \n     States may hesitate to aggressively pursue abuse reports that \n     may or may not lead to a ``finding.'' Therefore, other health \n     facilities may be unaware of instances of abuse or \n     mistreatment. This bill will allow HHS to issue regulations \n     on varying degree's of findings and exclusions so that those \n     who have had problems will be listed, but not necessarily \n     prohibited from working for life.\n\n\n                              definitions\n\n       Covered Care Workers--Patient care workers who have direct \n     assess to vulnerable patients.\n       Covered Health Care Facilities--those receiving Medicare or \n     Medicaid reimbursement, such as: nursing homes, skilled \n     nursing facilities, home health agencies, community-based \n     residential facilities, board and care facilities, adult day \n     care centers, adult family homes, assisted living facilities, \n     hospice programs, and hospitals. Federal health care \n     facilities are also subject to the requirements.\n       Abuse--Any finding of abuse, neglect, mistreatment of \n     residents or misappropriation of their property as defined in \n     current Federal regulations relating to nurse aides (CFR, \n     Sect. 483.13 (c)(ii).\n       Crime--those that reflect a clear disregard for the health, \n     well-being, safety and general welfare of other people must \n     be prohibited from working in direct contact with vulnerable \n     long term care residents or consumers. Current law already \n     requires exclusion of those convicted of health care fraud \n     and acts of abuse in the health care setting. Other crimes \n     may be cause for exclusion under current law at the \n     discretion of the Secretary of HHS. This bill adds a \n     mandatory exclusion of those convicted of serious crimes that \n     occur outside of the health care setting.\n\n\n           section 4. abuse prevention/training demonstration\n\n       Because the best way to combat patient abuse is to prevent \n     it from occurring, a new demonstration program is created to \n     compile information on best practices in abuse prevention \n     training for managers and staff of health care facilities. \n     The demonstration will focus on ways to improve collaboration \n     between state health care survey and certification agencies, \n     long-term care ombudsman programs, the long term care \n     industry and community members. Current patient abuse \n     prevention training programs will be studied for \n     effectiveness and application to other health care settings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. D'Amato, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 1123. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating \nto the unemployment tax for individuals employed in the entertainment \nindustry; to the Committee on Finance\n\n\n                    unemployment offset legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncorrect a problem with the way unemployment benefits are currently \noffset when received by participants in a multiemployer pension plan.\n  Under our current Unemployment Compensation [UC] system States pay \nand administer UC benefits. The federal government shares in the cost \nof these benefits. Since 1980, the Federal Government has required that \nUC benefits be offset or reduced by any pension benefits that an \nindividual receives from a base-period employer. A base period employer \nis any employer of the recipient during the 52-week period before the \nloss of a job.\n  Here is how it works. If you are involuntarily separated from the \nsame employer that is paying your retirement benefits and your \nemployment caused your retirement benefits to increase any unemployment \ncompensation you may qualify for will be offset by any retirement \nincome received for this same employer. Thus, retirement benefits \nreceived could significantly reduce or eliminate any unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, this policy was implemented, in part, to prevent \nemployees from receiving pension benefits and qualifying for \nunemployment compensation from the same employment.\n  Unfortunately, the application of the offset requirement to \nparticipants in multiemployer pension plans can unfairly penalize some \ntaxpayers. Under current law, all employers in a multiemployer plan \ngroup are considered base-period employers for unemployment \ncompensation purposes. Because of this, members of a multiemployer \npension plan, such as actors and actresses that return to work, even \nthrough it may be for another employer (i.e., studio), are treated as \nreturning to work for the same employer because all entertainment \nindustry employers are part of the same multiemployer pension plan. \nThus, when they return to work in their later years and their pension \nis increased by a nominal amount their unemployment compensation \nbenefits are offset by their full pension amount. This can leave some \nwith the little or no unemployment compensation benefits.\n  Mr. President, to correct this, I am introducing legislation that \nwould simply limit the unemployment benefit offset to the amount of the \npension increase rather than the full pension amount received.

Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and I ask for its \nappropriate referral.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing today a bipartisan bill, together \nwith Senator Coats of Indiana. This is the Workplace Religious Freedom \nAct of 1997.\n  This bill would protect workers from on-the-job discrimination \nrelated to religious beliefs and practices. It represents a milestone \nin the protection of the religious liberties of all workers. Senator \nCoats and I developed this new bill based on a similar bill I \nintroduced earlier this session.\n  In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require \nemployers to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice or \nobservance unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the \nemployer. This 1972 amendment, although completely appropriate, has \nbeen interpreted by the courts so narrowly as to place little restraint \non an employer's refusal to provide religious accommodation. The \nWorkplace Religious Freedom Act will restore to the religious \naccommodation provision the weight that Congress originally intended \nand help assure that employers have a meaningful obligation to \nreasonably accommodate their employees' religious practices.\n  The restoration of this protection is no small matter. For many \nreligiously observant Americans the greatest peril to their ability to \ncarry out their religious faiths on a day-to-day basis may come from \nemployers. I have heard accounts from around the country about a small \nminority of employers who will not make reasonable accommodation for \nemployees to observe the Sabbath and other holy days or for employees \nwho must wear religiously-required garb, such as a yarmulke, or for \nemployees to wear clothing that meets religion-based modesty \nrequirements.\n  The refusal of an employer, absent undue hardship, to provide \nreasonable accommodation of a religious practice should be seen as a \nform of religious discrimination, as originally intended by Congress in \n1972. And religious discrimination should be treated fully as seriously \nas any other form of discrimination that stands between Americans and \nequal employment opportunities. Enactment of the Workplace Religious \nFreedom Act will constitute an important step toward ensuring that all \nmembers of society, whatever their religious beliefs and practices, \nwill be protected from an invidious form of discrimination.\n  It is important to recognize that, in addition to protecting the \nreligious freedom of employees, this legislation protects employers \nfrom an undue burden. Employees would be allowed to take time off only \nif their doing so does not pose a significant difficulty or expense for \nthe employer. This common sense definition of undue hardship is used in \nthe ``Americans with Disabilities Act'' and has worked well in that \ncontext.\n  We have little doubt that this bill is constitutional because it \nsimply clarifies existing law on discrimination by private employers, \nstrengthening the required standard for employers. Unlike the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act [RFRA], which was declared unconstitutional \nrecently by the Supreme Court, the bill does not deal with behavior by \nState or Federal Governments or substantively expand 14th amendment \nrights.\n  I believe this bill should receive bipartisan support. This bill is \nendorsed by a wide range of organizations including the American Jewish \nCommittee, Baptist Joint Committee, Christian Legal Society, Seventh-\nday Adventists, National Association of Evangelicals, National Council \nof the Churches, National Sikh Center, and Presbyterian Churches. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter from the Coalition for Religious \nFreedom in the Workplace, which represents all of these groups, be \nincluded in the Record.\n  I want to thank Senator Coats for joining me in this effort. I look \nforward to working with him to pass this legislation so that all \nAmerican workers can be assured of both equal employment opportunities \nand the ability to practice their religion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1124\n\n     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We applaud Senators Dan \n     Coats and John Kerry for their action today in introducing \n     the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1997.\n       Current civil rights law defines the refusal of an employer \n     to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice, \n     unless such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on \n     the employer, as a form of religious discrimination. But this \n     standard has been interpreted far too narrowly by the courts, \n     placing little restraint on an employer's ability to refuse \n     to provide religious accommodation.\n       It is time to correct an interpretation of the law that \n     needlessly forces upon religiously observant employees a \n     conflict between the dictates of religious observance and the \n     requirements of the workplace. The bipartisan effort of \n     Senators Coats and Kerry in crafting and introducing the \n     Workplace Religious Freedom Act sends exactly the right \n     signal; as was the case with the Religious Freedom \n     Restoration Act, the effort to safeguard religious liberty \n     and fight against religious discrimination is one that \n     should, and must, bring together Americans from a broad range \n     of political and religious persuasions.\n       The Coalition for Religious Freedom in the Workplace \n     welcomes today's introduction of the Workplace Religious \n     Freedom Act. We look forward to working with Senators Coats, \n     Kerry and other Members on this crucial issue as this \n     legislation moves forward.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, to privatize religious belief is to \ntrivialize it. When we treat religion as purely personal--irrelevant to \nthe way we live our lives and write our laws--this is not neutrality to \nreligion, it is hostility to religion. The reason is simple: because \nfaith is more than an internal belief, it is a guide to external \nconduct. And for religious liberty to have any meaning, government and \nbusiness must accommodate that conduct, within the bounds of reason and \norder. Consider one case:\n  Ms. Jones, a line worker at Bigco Enterprises approaches her \nsupervisor with a problem: According to her religion, she may not work \non Sunday. Ms. Jones will work any other day--including Saturday \nevenings--without extra pay. But the mandate of her religion is \nabsolute. If given the choice of working on Sunday or losing her job, \nMs. Jones will have to resign or risk being fired. The supervisor \nexplains that Bigco has a random shift-assignment policy which requires \nthat every employee work the assigned shift or find a replacement \nworker. Unable to find a replacement worker, Ms. Jones misses two \nSundays, and is fired.\n  Mr. President, presumably, title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nwhich prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee on \nthe basis of her religion, would provide Ms. Jones some recourse. But \nthat is not necessarily the case.\n  Since 1972, title VII has required an employer to make an \naccommodation ``unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to \nreasonably accommodate an employee's religious observance or practice \nwithout undue hardship.'' In a case such as the one described above, \nMr. Jones' religious practice would not have to be accommodated, and \nBigco would likely not be liable since attempting to find a replacement \nworker for Jones would cause Bigco to ``bear more than a de minimis \ncost''.\n  Under current law, Ms. Jones' religious observance would constitute \nan undue hardship, and Bigco would have no further obligation to Ms. \nJones.\n  Over 60 percent of Americans consider themselves to be religious, \nyet, Ms. Jones' predicament is all too common in the United States. \nEmployees who engage in seemingly common religious observances such as \nthe Sabbath are often faced with the difficulty of breaking an \nemployer's rule or violating a religious tenet.\n  As Justice Marshall explained in his dissent in the Hardison case, \nunder the de minimis standard which the courts have adopted in \nreligious accommodation cases, an employer ``need not grant even the \nmost minor special privilege to religious observers to enable them to \nfollow their faith.'' He continues: ``As a question of social policy, \nthis result is deeply troubling, for a society that truly values \npluralism cannot compel aderents of minority religions to make the \ncruel choice of surrendering their religion or their job.''\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kerry in introducing the \nWorkplace Religious Freedom Act to addresses this issue head-on. The \ngoal of the act is to restore the original intent of title VII by \nextending to religious observers the same level of protection afforded \nothers under Federal civil rights laws.\n  The act accomplishes this goal principally by applying the same \nstandard for undue hardship to religious observance cases as are \nalready applied in other Federal civil rights actions, such as those \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. \nThus under this legislation, the term undue hardship is defined as an \naction requiring ``significant difficulty or expense''.\n  Our bill takes into account a number of factors, including: First the \ncost of the accommodation as determined by the costs of lost \nproductivity and of retraining or hiring employees or transferring \nemployees from one facility to another; second the size of the \nemployer; third the number of employees who require the accommodation \nand; fourth for an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to \nwhich the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal \nrelationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more \ndifficult or expensive.\n  The bill also provides a number of safeguards for the employer. For \nexample, an employer is not required to provide an accommodation which \nwill result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential \nfunctions of the job nor is an employer required to pay premium wages \nor additional benefits to employees requesting the accommodation if the \nchange in schedule is instituted specifically to accommodate an \nemployee's religious observance or practice.\n\n  The Workplace Religious Freedom Act is an important step toward \nrestoring the original intent of title VII. Though we know that only a \nminority of employers refuse to make reasonable accommodations for \nemployees to observe the Sabbath or other Holy days, the fact of the \nmatter is that no worker in America should be forced to choose between \na job and violating deeply held religious tenets. Religious \ndiscrimination in America must not be tolerated. It should be treated \nas seriously as any other form of discrimination.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by reminding us that the best and \noldest tradition of America is religious accommodation without \ncoercion. We have no established religion in this country, and do not \nwant one. But we must recognize and respect the important role of \nreligion in our society. Values that come from religious faith enrich \nour common life. As a society, we must continue to guarantee that \nreligious liberty. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n\n            COALITION FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE WORKPLACE\n\n       Agudath Israel of America\n       America Jewish Committee\n       American Jewish Congress\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\n       Americans for Democratic Action\n       Anti-Defamation League\n       Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs\n       Central Conference of American Rabbis\n       Christian Legal Society\n       Church of Scientology International\n       Council on Religious Freedom\n       General Board on Church and Society\n       The United Methodist Church\n       General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists\n       Guru Gobind Singh Foundation\n       Hadassah-WZOA\n       International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists\n       Jewish Council for Public Affairs\n       National Association of Evangelicals\n       NationalCouncil of Churches\n       National Council of Jewish Women\n       National Sikh Center\n       North American Council for Muslim Women\n       People for the American Way\n       Presbyterian Church (USA), Washington Office\n       Rabbinical Council of America\n       Traditional Values Coalition\n       Union of American Hebrew Congregations\n       Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations\n       United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1125.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nHighway Bridge Improvement Act of 1997 with my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin.\n  This legislation would increase the authorization for the \nDiscretionary Bridge Program from its current level of around $60 \nmillion annually to $800 million annually. This change would allow \nStates with large bridge improvement projects to compete for \ndiscretionary grants at the Federal level.\n  Mr. President, in 1995 approximately 25 percent of the Nation's \nInterstate bridges were classified as deficient. In addition, 28 \npercent of the 130,000 bridges on all other arterial systems were \ndeficient. As the Congress considers ISTEA reauthorization legislation \nlater this year, it is vitally important that we continue the \nsuccessful Highway Bridge Repair and Rehabilitation Program, and \nsubstantially increase the authorization level of the Discretionary \nBridge Program.\n  Since its creation in 1978, the Discretionary Bridge Program has been \na valuable source of funds for many States. Demand for funding under \nthe program has vastly exceeded available resources. In 1996 alone, \nStates submitted 29 requests totaling $650 million. The program was \nauthorized at less than one-tenth that level.\n  The Highway Bridge Improvement Act would increase the authorization \nfor the Discretionary Bridge Program to $800 million annually, allowing \nStates to compete for discretionary bridge repair grants above and \nbeyond their formula allocation for bridge repairs.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not include a set-aside for the Highway \nTimber Bridge Research and Demonstration Program, nor does it include a \nnew proposal I support to create a Steel Bridge Research and \nConstruction Program. Our legislation is a very simple statement about \nthe importance of increasing the authorization for the Discretionary \nBridge Program.\n  As my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee draft \nlegislation to reauthorization the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nand Efficiency Act, I hope they will include the timber and steel \nbridge set-asides, and I hope they will include the Highway Bridge \nImprovement Act.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to consider the needs of the bridges in \ntheir States, and to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n\n  S. 1126. A bill to repeal the provision in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 relating to base periods for Federal unemployment tax purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n  LEGISLATION TO REPEAL CERTAIN SECTION OF THE BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF \n                                  1997\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to repeal \nsection 5401 of the conference report to H.R. 2015, the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997. This provision, entitled ``Clarifying provision relating \nto base periods,'' will have a devastating impact on hundreds of \nthousands of unemployed workers in California and throughout the \ncountry.\n  This provision, although labeled ``clarifying,'' actually overturns a \nvery important 3-year-old Federal court decision. A provision with such \nfar-reaching implications for all of the working men and women in our \ncountry who are currently unemployed, or, in this era of downsizing, \nmay become unemployed, should not be tucked away in a 1,000-plus page \nbill.\n  Let me briefly explain to my colleagues why this provision has such a \ndevastating impact on unemployed workers. On February 21, 1997, a \nstatewide class action suit was filed on behalf of more than 120,000 \nCalifornians who have earned sufficient wages to qualify for \nunemployment insurance but nevertheless must wait up to 7 months to \nreceive their unemployment benefits. There is no question that these \nworkers are entitled to unemployment benefits; the only issue is when \nthe State will pay the benefits.\n  In order to receive unemployment benefits a worker must have earned a \nprescribed amount in the 12-month period prior to his unemployment. \nHowever, because many States, including my home State of California, \nare slow to obtain and process wage data, a worker's unemployment \ncompensation is often not calculated based upon his most recent wages. \nRather, it is often calculated based upon wages which were earned up to \n7 months prior to the date the worker files a claim. For example, if a \nworker files a claim for benefits in January 1997, any amounts he \nearned after July 1996, will be disregarded because it is outside of \nthe ``base period.''\n  This policy of delaying payment of unemployment benefits causes \nsevere hardship to unemployed workers, pushing many of these workers on \nto the welfare roles. The bill I have introduced today will help enable \nthese unemployed workers get the benefits they are due in a timely \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1126\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF SECTION 5401 OF BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF \n                   1997.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5401 of the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 is hereby repealed.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply for purposes of any period beginning before, on, \n     or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1128. A bill to provide rental assistance under section 8 of the \nUnited States Housing Act of 1937 for victims of domestic violence to \nenable such victims to relocate; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n               the domestic violence victims housing act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will ensure that battered women have increased access to \naffordable housing through tenant-based rental assistance. The lack of \nsafe, affordable housing is a major factor in forcing women to return \nto their violent partners, either directly from a shelter or after \nattempting to set up an independent home. This bill would address that \nimportant problem by providing section 8 housing certificates to low-\nincome women who are victims of domestic violence.\n  Domestic violence in our society is a staggering problem. An \nestimated 4 million American women experience a serious assault by a \nhusband or boyfriend each year. In 1993 alone, over 1,300 women were \nreportedly killed by abusive partners or former partners. Battered \nwomen are confronted with numerous obstacles in their efforts to \nsurvive and escape domestic violence. Some obstacles arise from the \ndynamics of abusive relationships--dependency, isolation, and fear. \nEconomic obstacles, however, create some of the must difficult problems \nfor women trying to leave a violent partner, including child and health \ncare costs, and the lack of safe, affordable housing. Battered women \nand their children are a large proportion of the emergency shelter \npopulation. Even if shelter space is available, access to affordable \nhousing,\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\nhousing subsidies and services are needed to keep women from having to \nreturn to a violent home. A study in Michigan found that 60 percent of \nthose who left shelters and returned to their violent partners did so \nbecause of too little affordable housing. Equally as disturbing is the \nfact that 50 percent of all homeless women and children in this country \nare fleeing domestic violence.\n  There have been cases brought to my attention in my home State of \nMinnesota where women trying to escape abusive relations could have \nbenefited from this legislation, and we know that sadly there are many \nmore stories from around the country.\n  One case involves a young mother from a small town in central \nMinnesota. Rachel left her child's father after suffering 2 years of \nabuse at his hands. She and her baby stayed in a battered women's \nshelter for a month until she found an apartment. After paying her rent \neach month, Rachel was unable to provide for her family. Seeing no \nother options, she returned to the home of her abuser; after a 2 month \nrespite, he began to batter her again.\n  This legislation would assist women, like Rachel, fleeing abuse to \nget affordable housing by authorizing $50 million in funding for \nsection 8 housing certificates. The Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD] would allocate the resources to public housing \nauthorities which would issue the housing certificates to domestic \nviolence victims. Only those victims who met the other requirements of \nthe section 8 program would be eligible. HUD estimates that this \nprogram would provide 7,500 housing units nationwide for victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will go a long way in removing a \nmajor road-block for battered women who are trying to escape domestic \nviolence--the lack of affordable housing. We need to give these women \nan opportunity other than living on the streets, in shelters, returning \nto their batterers. This legislation would provide battered women and \ntheir children an opportunity to rebuild their lives in a stable home. \nFurthermore, this legislation conveys the message to abusers that we \nwill not tolerate their violence, that we will not continue to allow \nthem to drive their victims into the shelters and the street.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide grants to States for supervised visitation \ncenters; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                THE SAFE HAVENS FOR CHILDREN ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will provide safe havens for children who are members of families \nin which violence is a problem. I am pleased to have my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, join me in this effort.\n  The prevalence of family violence in our society is staggering. \nStudies show that 25 percent of all violence occurs among people who \nare related to one another. Data also indicate that the incidence of \nviolence in families escalates during separation and divorce. In\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\nfact, over 70 percent of women who are treated for domestic violence in \nemergency departments have already separated from the person who has \ninflicted their injuries. Many of these assaults occur in the context \nof child visitation. This clearly places children at risk not only of \nwitnessing violence, but also of becoming victims of violence within \ntheir own families. Children who are exposed to violence suffer many \nlong term effects of this exposure.\n  In addition to the obvious physical consequences of violence, there \nare innumerable psychosocial effects. For example, a child who learns \nfrom his parents, his role models, that violence is a way of resolving \ndifferences, or controlling another person, will grow up believing that \nit is normal to use violence in everyday interpersonal relationships. \nAs a consequence, he will grow up believing that it is acceptable to \nphysically hurt those people he loves the most. A young girl who \nwatches her mother being beaten up by her father may come to understand \nthat physical injury is just one aspect of a ``normal\" relationship. \nChildren who are exposed to violence are at risk for mental health \nproblems and substance abuse problems as they grow up. When we allow \nchildren to grow up believing that violence is normal and acceptable, \nwe do a great deal of damage to their lives and decrease their chances \nfor healthy futures.\n  In order to prevent the risk of exposure to violence, I am \nintroducing this legislation, to provide funding for the creation of \nchild safety centers. These centers will provide a safe environment in \nwhich children can visit with their parents without risk of being \nexposed to violence in the context of their family relationships. This \nbill will protect children from the trauma of witnessing or \nexperiencing violence, sexual abuse, neglect, abduction, rape, or death \nduring parent-child visitation or visitation exchanges; protect victims \nof violence from experiencing further violence during child visitation \nor visitation exchanges and will provide safe havens for children and \ntheir parents during visitation or visitation exchanges.\n  This act will provide grants to States to enable the states to enter \ninto contract and cooperative agreements with public or private \nnonprofit entities in order to establish child safety centers. These \ncenters will operate for the purpose of facilitating supervised \nvisitation and visitation exchange. The services provided by the \ncenters will be evaluated each year, so that we will learn how many \npeople are served by the centers and what types of problems are \nencountered by the clients of the centers. The act will authorize \nappropriations of $65,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1998 through \n2000.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will go a long way in protecting \nchildren from family violence and in providing support for families \nthat are experiencing violence. We need to do this to protect our \nchildren and give them the chance to grow up without believing that \nviolence is normal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Havens for Children Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect children from the trauma of witnessing or \n     experiencing violence, sexual abuse, neglect, abduction, \n     rape, or death during parent-child visitation and visitation \n     exchanges;\n       (2) to protect victims of domestic violence from \n     experiencing further violence during child visitation and \n     visitation exchanges; and\n       (3) to provide safe havens for parents and children during \n     visitation and visitation exchanges, to promote continuity \n     and stability.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Family violence does not necessarily cease when family \n     victims are legally separated by divorce or otherwise not \n     sharing a household.\n       (2) According to a 1996 report by the American \n     Psychological Association, custody and visitation disputes \n     are more frequent when there is a history of domestic \n     violence.\n       (3) Family violence often escalates following separation \n     and divorce, and child custody and visitation arrangements \n     become the new forum for the continuation of abuse.\n       (4) According to a 1996 report by the American \n     Psychological Association, fathers who batter mothers are \n     twice as likely to seek sole custody of their children. In \n     these circumstances, if the abusive father loses custody he \n     is more likely to continue the threats to the mother through \n     other legal actions.\n       (5) Some perpetrators of violence use the children as pawns \n     to control the abused party and to commit more violence \n     during separation or divorce. In one study, 34 percent of \n     women in shelters and callers to hotlines reported threats of \n     kidnapping, 11 percent reported that the batterer had \n     kidnapped the child for some period, and 21 percent reported \n     that threats of kidnapping forced the victim to return to the \n     batterer.\n       (6) Approximately 90 percent of children in homes in which \n     their mothers are abused witness the abuse. Children who \n     witness domestic violence may themselves become victims and \n     exhibit more aggressive, antisocial, fearful, and inhibited \n     behaviors. Such children display more anxiety, aggression and \n     temperamental problems.\n       (7) Women and children are at an elevated risk of violence \n     during the process of separation or divorce.\n       (8) Fifty to 70 percent of men who abuse their spouses or \n     partners also abuse their children.\n       (9) Up to 75 percent of all domestic assaults reported to \n     law enforcement agencies were inflicted after the separation \n     of the couple.\n       (10) In one study of spousal homicide, over \\1/2\\ of the \n     male defendants were separated from their victims.\n       (11) Seventy-three percent of battered women seeking \n     emergency medical services do so after separation.\n       (12) The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court \n     Judges includes the option of visitation centers in their \n     Model Code on Domestic and Family Violence.\n\n     SEC. 4. GRANTS TO STATES TO PROVIDE FOR SUPERVISED VISITATION \n                   CENTERS\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') is authorized \n     to award grants to States to enable States to enter into \n     contracts and cooperative agreements with public or private \n     nonprofit entities to assist such entities in establishing \n     and operating supervised visitation centers for the purposes \n     of facilitating supervised visitation and visitation \n     exchange.\n       (b) Considerations.--In awarding such grants, contracts, \n     and cooperative agreements under subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall take into account--\n       (1) the number of families to be served by the proposed \n     visitation center to be established under the grant, \n     contract, or agreement;\n       (2) the extent to which the proposed supervised visitation \n     centers serve underserved populations; and\n       (3) the extent to which the applicant demonstrates \n     cooperation and collaboration with advocates in the local \n     community served, including the State domestic violence \n     coalition, State sexual assault coalition, local shelters, \n     and programs for domestic violence and sexual assault \n     victims.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts provided under a grant, contract, \n     or cooperative agreement awarded under this section shall be \n     used to establish supervised visitation centers and for the \n     purposes described in section 2. Individuals shall be \n     permitted to use the services provided by the center on a \n     sliding fee basis.\n       (2) Applicant requirements.--The Secretary shall award \n     grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under this Act \n     in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may \n     promulgate.

A bill to provide for the assessment of fees by the National \nIndian Gaming Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n\n\n            the indian gaming enforcement and integrity act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Indian Gaming \nEnforcement and Integrity Act of 1997. The purpose of this legislation \nis to reform the current regulatory fee structure administered by the \nNational Indian Gaming Commission [NIGC], the regulatory agency \nresponsible for monitoring and regulating Indian tribal government \ngaming. The essence of any regulatory agency is in its ability to \nmonitor activities within its purview and to act decisively in \nenforcing violations of the law. The NIGC is no different and it has \ndepended on regulatory assessments and Federal appropriations to carry \nout these vital roles.\n  When Congress enacted and the President signed into law, the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act [IGRA], two principal goals were sought: To \nprovide a statutory basis for the operation of Indian gaming as a means \nof promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong \ntribal governments; and, second, to provide a statutory basis for the \nregulation of the Indian gaming industry to shield it from corrupting \ninfluences.\n  Since its enactment in 1988, the Indian gaming industry has grown \ntremendously, where today it is a multibillion dollar industry. As a \nresult, the IGRA is beginning to provide many tribal governments with \nthe wherewithal to provide basic services to their members. Where \npoverty once reigned on Indian reservations, economic opportunity now \nabounds. In many cases, tribal governments are able to employ large \nnumbers of their own members, as well as non-Indians from surrounding \ncommunities. Further, it is no coincidence that in many communities \naround the Nation, welfare rolls have dropped and employment has risen \nas a direct result of tribal gaming.\n  The second objective of the IGRA is to provide adequate regulation to \nshield Indian gaming from corruption influences and to ensure the games \nare fair, and conducted in accordance with all applicable laws. IGRA \nestablished the National Indian Gaming Commission and empowered it to \nmonitor Indian gaming and to regulate certain aspects of Indian gaming. \nThe act authorizes the Commission to assess regualtory fees on these \ngaming activities. In addition to these assessed fees, the act \nauthorizes an annual Federal appropriation to complement the funds \navailable for the efficient operation of the Commission.\n  To date, the Commission is responsible for monitoring and regulating \n273 Indian gaming establishments operated by 184 tribes in 28 States. \nWhile it attempts to keep up with this tremendous growth, the \nCommission is currently statutorily constrained from securing the level \nof funding it needs to fulfill its mandates under the law.\n  Current law authorizes the NIGC to assess fees on class II gaming \nactivities at a level not to exceed $1.5 million per year. In addition \nto Federal appropriations of $1 million over the last 3 fiscal years, \nand other fees collected, the NIGC has been operating on a budget that \nslightly exceeds $3 million.\n  To further illustrate the funding dilemma of the NIGC, the Committee \non Indian Affairs conducted an oversight hearing on July 10, 1997 to \nreview the current Indian gaming regulatory fee structure. Testimony \nprovided to the committee indicated that for fiscal year 1997, the \nCommission has an overall operating budget of $4.3 million which \nconsists of, a $1 million direct appropriation, $1.5 million in fees \nassessed on class II tribal gaming revenue, and $1.8 million in \nunobligated funds from prior years. However, for fiscal year 1998 it is \nindicated that funds from prior year unobligated balances would be \nnearly depleted, resulting in a projected operational budget of $2.5 \nmillion to $3.0 million for fiscal year 1998. According to the NIGC, \nwithout additional funding reductions in staff would take place, with a \ncommensurate decrease in its regulatory, compliance and enforcement \nefforts.\n  Further, testimony indicated that greater resources need to be \navailable to the NIGC in order to meet their statutorily mandated \nresponsibilities. To accomplish this the NIGC proposed expanding their \ncollection to class III gaming activities\n  As a result of the hearing, I have developed legislation that \nreflects testimony provided by the NIGC and tribal interest. This \nlegislation will require the NIGC to assess minimum mandatory fees on \neach gaming operation that conducts a gaming activity regulated under \nthe act. In addition to these minimum fees, the Commission is \nauthorized to assess fees on class II gaming and on class III gaming. \nIn order to provide a reasonable fee assessment approach, the \nlegislation provides for maximum rates of not more than 2.5 percent on \nthe gross revenues of class II activities; and not more than .5 percent \non the gross revenues of class III activities.\n  In addition to these maximum rates, the bill provides for a phased in \napproach so that fees collected on class II activities shall not exceed \n$5 million in fiscal year 1998, $8 million in fiscal year 1999, and $10 \nmillion in fiscal year 2000. Similarly, fees collected on class III \nactivities shall not exceed $3 million in fiscal year 1998, $4 million \nin fiscal year 1999, and $5 million in fiscal year 2000.\n  The Commission is required to take into account its duties and the \nservices it provides to Indian tribal gaming in setting the annual fees \nunder the act. The legislation creates a special fund in the U.S. \nTreasury for amounts equal to the fees paid by the gaming operations, \nand requires that all amounts deposited into the special fund shall be \nused only to fund the activities of the Commission under the IGRA. \nBecause the United States maintains a special relationship with the \nIndian tribes, and given its legitimate role in providing services to \nthe tribes, the bill I am introducing retains a Federal appropriation \nto defray the costs incurred by the Commission in carrying out its \nduties under the IGRA.\n  As I have stated before, it is our obligation to make sure that we \nprotect the interests of Native Americans and, at the same time, \nprotect the interest of those who participate in Indian Gaming.\n  This legislation seeks to ensure the integrity of the Indian gaming \nindustry by providing the tools necessary to the agency responsible for \nregulating this industry. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1130\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my chairman today, \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, as a cosponsor of legislation to \nprovide for an amendment in authorizing legislation that will enable \nthe National Indian Gaming Commission to adjust the manner in which \nfees are imposed on the gaming operations that are subject to \nregulation under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988.\n  Mr. President, it has been 9 years since the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct was enacted into law. In the ensuing years, there has been a \nsubstantial increase in the number of tribal government-sponsored \ngaming operations, as well as a significant shift in the number of \noperations that are engaged in the conduct of class III gaming \noperations.\n  The bill we introduce today might be considered as companion \nlegislation to a bill introduced earlier this week by Senator John \nMcCain, and a bill that Senator Campbell is developing for introduction \nin the fall. All three measures are intended to reflect the \ncontemporary realities of tribal gaming and the need for a regulatory \nframework that can respond to the growth in Indian gaming.\n  Mr. President, we proceed with this separate legislation because of \nthe pressing need to assure that the Commission is adequately funded, \nand that the Commission has the capacity, independent of Federal \nappropriations, to address a far wider array of regulatory demands than \nwe could have anticipated in 1988.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                              By Mr. MACK:\n\n  S. 1131. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the research credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          research and experimentation tax credit legislation\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, we have good reason to celebrate what we \nhave just accomplished by passing the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  We set out to help families pay for the education of their kids. It's \ndone. We set out to provide a $500 credit for children. It's done. We \nset out to provide meaningful death tax relief. It's done. We set out \nto expand IRA's to encourage savings. It's done. We set out to provide \nsignificant capital gains relief. And it's done, too.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act is a great victory for the American people. \nBut we cannot rest on this accomplishment, when there is much else that \nneeds to be done. I am today introducing legislation to permanently \nextend the research and experimentation tax credit. In the tax bill we \njust passed, the research and experimentation tax credit is extended a \nmere 13 months, to June 30, 1998. This extension is disappointing.\n  The research credit has provided a valuable economic incentive for \nU.S. companies to increase their investment in research and development \nin order to maintain their competitive edge in the global marketplace. \nA permanent extension of the research credit is critical to fast-\ngrowing research-intensive companies such as those in the computer, \ntelecommunications, and biotechnology industries.\n  For these companies, an incentive to increase investment in research \nplays a critical role in determining whether future research projects, \nmany of which span many years in length, are started, continued, or \nabandoned. The incentive benefit of the current research credit is \nreduced because of its temporary and uncertain nature. The bill I am \ntoday introducing will correct this problem, and make the research tax \ncredit an incentive that our high-technology companies can count on.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1132. A bill to modify the boundaries of the Bandelier National \nMonument to include the lands within the headwaters of the Upper Alamo \nWatershed which drain into the monument and which are not currently \nwithin the\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\njurisdiction of a Federal land management agency, to authorize purchase \nor donation of those lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    The Bandelier National Monument Administrative Improvement and \n                    Watershed Protection Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nextend the boundaries of the Bandelier National Monument. Since 1916 \nwhen President Wilson created the monument to protect the \n``archeological resources of a vanished people,'' both Congress and the \nPresident have adjusted the monument's boundaries on numerous occasions \nto protect these treasures, and the ecological balance within the \nmonument. The latest example was in 1976, when Congress set aside over \n70 percent of the monument to create the Bandelier Wilderness area. \nBecause we have acted to conserve this valuable land in the past, \ntoday's visitors to the monument, the people of New Mexico and \nAmericans from around the Nation, have a wonderful place to go to. In \nthe same morning you can see varieties of wildlife, including herds of \nelk and deer, and explore the homes of early native American peoples. \nThis bill continues that foresighted tradition of protection.\n  The greatest threat to the monument at this time is potential \ndevelopment in the upper watershed that drains into the park. Not only \ncould this impair the esthetic experience of visitors to the monument, \nit could seriously harm the ecological balance within the monument. The \npotential for soil erosion, flooding, and siltation of streams from \nupstream development is of grave concern, and this bill seeks to \naddress the problem. Under this bill the boundaries of the monument \nwould be extended to include all of the lands which are not currently \nin public ownership in the upper Alamo watershed which drains into the \nmonument.\n  This bill will allow the Park Service to enter into agreements with \nprivate landowners to either purchase their land, or to restrict the \ndevelopment of their land in order to protect the monument. I want to \nnote that the current landowners support this, and have stated that \nthey would like to enter into such agreements that will protect the \nmonument for future generations. Because of this, I have written this \nbill to give the Park Service authority to enter into contracts with \nwilling sellers. This bill does not give the Park Service condemnation \nauthority.\n  Mr. President, because we have a situation where we can protect this \ntreasure for generations to come with the help and cooperation of the \nprivate landowners that neighbor the monument, I am pleased to offer \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bandelier National Monument \n     Administrative Improvement and Watershed Protection Act of \n     1997.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Bandelier National Monument (hereinafter, the Monument) \n     was established by Presidential proclamation on February 11, \n     1916, to preserve the archeological resources of a ``vanished \n     people, with as much land as may be necessary for the proper \n     protection thereof * * *'' (No. 1322; 39 Stat. 1746).\n       (2) At various times since its establishment, the Congress \n     and the President have adjusted the Monument's boundaries and \n     purpose to further preservation of archeological and natural \n     resources within the Monument:\n       (A) On February 25, 1932, the Otowi Section of the Santa Fe \n     National Forest (some 4,699 acres of land) was transferred to \n     the Monument from the Santa Fe National Forest (Presidential \n     Proclamation No. 1191; 17 Stat. 2503);\n       (B) In December 1959, 3,600 acres of Frijoles Mesa were \n     transferred to the National Park Service from the Atomic \n     Energy Committee (hereinafter, AEC) and subsequently added to \n     the Monument on January 9, 1991, because of ``pueblo-type \n     archeological ruins germane to those in the Monument'' \n     (Presidential Proclamation No. 3388);\n       (C) On May 27, 1963, Upper Canyon, 2,882 acres of land \n     previously administered by the AEC, was added to the Monument \n     to preserve ``their unusual scenic character together with \n     geologic and topographic features, the preservation of which \n     would implement the purposes'' of the Monument (Presidential \n     Proclamation No. 3539);\n       (D) In 1976, concerned about upstream land management \n     activities that could result in flooding and erosion in the \n     Monument, Congress included the headwaters of the Rito de los \n     Frijoles and the Canada de Cochiti Grant (a total of 7,310 \n     acres) within the Monument's boundaries (Pub. L. 94-578; 90 \n     Stat. 2732); and\n       (E) In 1976, Congress created the Bandelier Wilderness, a \n     23,267-acre area that covers over 70 percent of the Monument.\n       (3) The Monument still has potential threats from flooding, \n     erosion, and water quality deterioration because of the mixed \n     ownership of the upper watersheds along its western border, \n     particularly in Alamo Canyon.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to modify the \n     boundary of the Monument to allow for acquisition and \n     enhanced protection of the lands within the monument's upper \n     watershed.\n\n     SEC. 3. BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.\n\n       Effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     boundaries of the Monument shall be modified to include \n     approximately 935 acres of land comprised of the Elk Meadows \n     subdivision, the Gardner parcel, the Clark parcel, and the \n     Baca Land & Cattle Co. lands within the Upper Alamo watershed \n     as depicted on the National Park Service map entitled ``Alamo \n     Headwaters Proposed Additions'' dated 06/97. Such map shall \n     be on file and available for public inspection in the offices \n     of the Director of the National Park Service, Department of \n     the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 4. TRANSFER AND ACQUISITION OF LANDS.\n\n       Within the boundaries designated by this Act, the Secretary \n     of the Interior is authorized to acquire lands (or interests \n     in land such as he determines shall adequately protect the \n     Monument from flooding, erosion, and degradation of its \n     drainage waters) by donation, purchase with donated or \n     appropriated funds, exchange, or transfer of lands acquired \n     by other Federal agencies.\n\n     SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director \n     of the National Park Service, shall manage the national \n     monument, including lands added to the Monument by this Act, \n     in accordance with this Act and the provisions of law \n     generally applicable to units of the National Park System, \n     including the Act of August 25, an act to establish a \n     National Park Service (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), \n     and such specific legislation as heretofore has been enacted \n     regarding the Monument.\n\n     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the purpose of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Burns, Mr. Gorton, and \n        Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 1134. A bill granting the consent and approval of Congress to an \ninterstate forest fire protection compact; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                     the northwest wildfire compact\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Northwest \nWildland Fire Protection Agreement. This compact will help our States \nthroughout the Northwest respond more quickly and efficiently to \nwildfires. Senators Craig, Wyden, Murkowski, Kempthorne, Gorton, G. \nSmith, Baucus, and Burns have joined me as original cosponsors because \nthis compact affects all of our States of Washington, Oregon, Alaska, \nIdaho, and Montana. It establishes an agreement with the provinces of \nAlberta, British Columbia, and the Yukon Territory to mutually aid in \nprevention, pre-suppression and control of forest fires.\n  Mr. State's Commissioner of Public Lands, Jennifer Belcher, brought \nthis compact to my attention. She explained how for the State of \nWashington, this means the Department of Natural Resources will have \naccess to the excellent firefighting tools of British Columbia, \nincluding helicopters and other aircraft stationed close to the border. \nThis will increase her ability to quickly mobilize forces to suppress \nwildfires that might otherwise get out of control.\n  The Washington DNR has been fighting wildfires since the early \n1900's. According to a DNR Forest Fire Study, in the past 25 years, the \ndepartment has fought 28,000-plus wildfires involving more than 370,000 \nacres of Washington forest land. In recent years, firefighting budgets \nhave decreased and the intensity of fires has increased, with the \nterrible fire season of 1994 breaking the record at 79,000 acres burned \nin Washington. We need this compact to enable our States to better \nprotect the life and property of our citizens.\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\n  All eight affected States and provinces have agreed to this compact. \nHowever, before the States and Provinces can legally enter this \nagreement, the U.S. Congress must pass enabling legislation. Congress \ndid so in 1952 with the wildfire compact after which this legislation \nwas patterned, which was signed by five northeastern States and eastern \nProvinces, and remains in effect today.\n  I urge my colleagues to help us move this compact through the process \nso our States will be poised to quickly and cost-efficiently suppress \ndangerous wildfires. I would also like to urge colleagues to support \nanother compact introduced by Senator Craig and cosponsored by all \nNorthwest Senators to help us join forces in cases of natural \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide certain immunities from civil liability \nfor trade and professional associations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  THE TRADE AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade and \nProfessional Association Free Flow of Information Act, and ask my \ncolleagues to join me by co-sponsoring this important legislation.\n  Our society is increasingly litigious, especially in the area of \nproduct liability. Unfortunately, complex product liability litigation \nensnares trade and professional associations that do not manufacture, \nbuy, or sell the product. America's litigation maze often traps \nassociations who do nothing more than publish good-faith factual \ninformation for its members regarding various products.\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\n  This service is particularly helpful to small business owners who \nbecome involved in product litigation, but lack the funds to conduct \nexpensive and time-consuming product research. Additionally, trade and \nprofessional associations help their members to avoid litigation by \nalerting them to critical characteristics of different products. This \nresearch and information service is clearly in the best interest of \nboth consumers and small businesses.\n  My bill would acomplish three goals. First, it grants trade and \nprofessional associations limited protection from liability when acting \nin good faith to provide information to their members. The associations \nmay still be held liable for fraudulently or recklessly distributing \nfalse information to their members.\n  Second, before information may be subpoenaed from an association, a \nclear case must be made that the information is vital to the case and \nis unavailable from any other source. Let me point out, however, that \nthis provision does not prevent associations from being served with \nsubpoenas. It merely ensures that the information requested is vital to \na particular action and unavailable from any other source.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a qualified privilege between an \nassociation and its members to ensure that confidential materials can \nbe provided for the benefit of association members. This privilege is \nnot absolute--it may be overcome upon proof that the party seeking the \nmaterials has a compelling need for the information. This provision is \nbased on a joint defense privilege currently recognized by state and \nfederal courts.\n  Additionally, this bill includes an opt-out provision similar to the \none we included in the Volunteer Protection Act, which the President \nrecently signed into law. This provision permits a State to opt-out of \nthe bill's coverage in any civil action in which all parties are \ncitizens of the State.\n  Mr. President, the need for this bill was recently discussed in an \narticle of the Legal Times. I ask unanimous consent that this article \nbe published in the Record.\n  In closing, I would like to emphasize that this bill will allow \nassociations to continue to actively disseminate valuable information \nto their members, while safeguarding current legal protections against \nfraud and abuse. The goal of the Free Flow of Information Act is one \nthat I believe I share with a majority of my colleagues--a decrease in \ncostly litigation coupled with an increase in the flow of information \nbetween associations and their members. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trade and Professional \n     Association Free Flow of Information Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) trade and professional associations serve the public \n     interest by conducting research, collecting and distributing \n     information, and otherwise providing services to their \n     members with regard to products and materials purchased and \n     used by those members;\n       (2) in the decade preceding the date of enactment of this \n     Act, many large class action lawsuits have been filed against \n     manufacturers for allegedly defective products;\n       (3) as a result of the lawsuits referred to in paragraph \n     (2), many members of trade and professional associations who \n     are consumers of those products have relied increasingly on \n     trade and professional associations for information \n     concerning those products, including information concerning--\n       (A) the conditions under which such a product may be used \n     effectively;\n       (B) whether it is necessary to repair or replace such a \n     product, and if such a repair or replacement is necessary, \n     the appropriate means of accomplishing that repair or \n     replacement; and\n       (C) any litigation concerning such a product;\n       (4) trade and professional associations have, with an \n     increasing frequency, been served broad and burdensome third-\n     party subpoenas from litigants in product defect lawsuits, \n     including class action lawsuits;\n       (5) members of trade and professional associations are \n     seeking potentially beneficial information relating to \n     product defects, quality, or performance from the trade and \n     professional associations;\n       (6) trade and professional associations have been subject \n     to lawsuits concerning methods of collection and \n     dissemination of that information;\n       (7) the burden of responding to third-party subpoenas in \n     product defect lawsuits and the threat of litigation have had \n     a substantial chilling effect on the ability and willingness \n     of trade and professional associations to disseminate \n     information described in paragraph (5) to members, and the \n     threat that information provided on a confidential basis to \n     members could be subject to discovery in a civil action also \n     has a chilling effect;\n       (8) because of the national scope of the problems described \n     in paragraphs (1) through (7), it is not possible for States \n     to fully address the problems by enacting State laws; and\n       (9) the Federal Government has the authority under the \n     United States Constitution (including article I, section 8, \n     clause 3 of the Constitution and the 14th amendment to the \n     Constitution) to remove barriers to interstate commerce and \n     protect due process rights.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to promote the \n     free flow of goods and services and lessen burdens on \n     interstate commerce in accordance with the authorities \n     referred to in subsection (a)(9) by ensuring the free flow of \n     information concerning product defects, quality, or \n     performance among trade and professional associations and \n     their members.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Goldman)\n\n       In the fall of 1987, Kenneth Halpern dove into his backyard \n     swimming pool in Mobile, Ala., broke his neck on the pool \n     bottom, and set off a chain of litigation that would send \n     shock waves through the trade association community for \n     years.\n       Halpern was paralyzed in the dive and died less than a year \n     later. The suit seeking restitution for his death named the \n     pool's builder as a defendant. But Halpern's suit went one \n     step further, also naming as a defendant the pool builders' \n     trade group, the National Spa and Pool Institute.\n       Unfortunately for the trade group, the Alabama Supreme \n     Court in 1990 bought Halpern's argument, at least in part. By \n     disseminating standards for pool construction to its members, \n     the court reasoned, the trade group opened itself to \n     potential liability for injuries caused in a pool.\n       While the Pool Institute was not ultimately found liable \n     for Halpern's death, the group spent hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars proving that its standards were in fact sufficient to \n     prevent injury. And the case left behind a menacing state \n     precedent for trade groups of all stripes, leaving them \n     vulnerable to all manner of liability suits.\n       Earlier this year, with the Alabama pool case and others \n     like it in mind, the trade association world called on \n     Capitol Hill for a legislative fix.\n       Their savior, they hope, will be Rep. Sonny Bono, the Palm \n     Springs, Calif., Republican who in May introduced the Trade \n     and Professional Association Free Flow of Information Act.\n       Bono's bill would set a national standard shielding \n     associations from lawsuits when providing information and \n     technical advice to their members. It would also allow \n     associations to refuse to respond to subpoenas--unless the \n     information is available only from the trade group and \n     nowhere else.\n       The bill would also set up a type of privilege between a \n     trade association and its members so that the confidentiality \n     of documents flowing between the two would be assured.\n       That's vitally important, explains General Counsel Daniel \n     Durden of the National Association of Home Builders, because \n     the fear of litigation has a chilling effect on the \n     industrywide mediation efforts trade associations are often \n     ideally situated to oversee.\n       Take, for example, a widget installed in homes across the \n     country. Five years later, the widget fails, due to a design \n     flaw. ``The manufacturer of the widget gets sued, and the \n     people who put them in their homes--our members--get sued,'' \n     Durden says. ``And if it's a widespread problem, our members \n     will call us and say, `What can you do for us?'\n       ``We can play a role in negotiating among the builders, \n     manufacturers, and potentially the insurance companies in \n     coming up with a stopgap measure, so the consumer of the \n     widget doesn't file suit,'' adds Durden, whose group is \n     actively supporting the Bono bill.\n       But if the association gets involved in trying to find a \n     settlement, any information shared with it may no longer be \n     privileged, Durden says. And that, in turn, can dissuade \n     members from sharing information.\n       ``The idea is that by acting in a fashion that forwards a \n     resolution, an association shouldn't get slammed,'' he says.\n       Trial lawyers, of course, are deeply offended by the notion \n     that certain potential defendants should be off-limits, and \n     are vigorously opposed to the Bono bill.\n       ``No association, corporation, or individual should be \n     immunized for responsibility for the injuries they cause,'' \n     Howard Twiggs, outgoing president of the Association of Trial \n     Lawyers of America, said through a spokesman. ``No citizen \n     should be denied the opportunity to hold wrongdoers \n     responsible for their actions.''\n       Traditionally courts have held that a trade group was \n     obligated only to its members, not\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\n     to the general public, for the accuracy and quality of the \n     standards it promulgates for its members. After all, the \n     groups argued, they could not properly be held responsible if \n     a builder failed to follow their guidelines.\n       But the Alabama Supreme Court ruling changed all that, by \n     holding in King v. National Spa and Pool Institute that the \n     trade association did in fact have a ``duty'' to the public--\n     regardless of whether it had control over its members' \n     behavior. (The named plaintiff is Barbara King, the \n     administrator of Halpem's estate.)\n       ``What this case says is that if you put our standards and \n     somebody uses them, then you can be hauled into court and \n     made to show you used due care in producing them,'' complains \n     David Karmol, general counsel and chief lobbyist of the \n     Alexandria, Va.-based Spa and Pool Institute.\n       ``We did use due process. We got comments from outsiders, \n     from the Consumer Product Safety Commission,'' says Karmol, \n     adding that his group has been disseminating pool standards \n     for 40 years. ``The point is, we did all the right things. \n     But if you have to prove that in court that you did all the \n     right things, you've already lost. We spent half a million \n     dollars winning. I don't know how many associations can \n     afford to win many half-million dollar cases on a regular \n     basis.''\n       No shortage of groups have been called upon to try.\n       According to Gerard Jacobs, a co-managing partner in the \n     D.C. office of Chicago's Jenner & Block, trade associations \n     are increasingly being hauled into court as defendants. ``I \n     can tell you that Jenner & Block has a dozen such cases,'' \n     says Jacobs. ``Higher than it's ever been.''\n       Adds James Clarke, chief lobbyist at the American Society \n     of Association Executives, which is actively supporting \n     Bono's legislation: ``Groups are more and more fearful that \n     litigation will tie them up like pretzels.''\n\n\n                               back pain\n\n       Among the hardest hit have been four trade associations \n     that deal with spinal surgery--and are implicated in hundreds \n     of tort claims against the so-called ``pedicle screw,'' an \n     orthopedic device officially approved by the Food and Drug \n     Administration only for use in arm and leg bone \n     operations, though it is widely used in the pedicles of \n     the vertebrae during back surgery as well.\n       According to hundreds of suits filed in recent years, the \n     Illinois-based North American Spine Society allegedly \n     conspired with pedicle screw manufacturers to help them \n     illegally promote their products for uses not approved by the \n     FDA.\n       ``Because we accepted money from exhibitors for exhibit \n     space, charged them with a registration fee, and got some \n     research funding from them--and then turned around and let \n     certain doctors whom [trial lawyers] call product promotors \n     give talks at our annual meeting . . . we allegedly defrauded \n     our own members into thinking these things were safe,'' \n     complains Eric Muehlbauer, executive director of the Spine \n     Society.\n       ``That's ludicrous,'' he argues. ``Why would we defraud our \n     own members? We were a forum provider, that's all.''\n       Muehlbauer says more than 500 individuals have sued the \n     trade group for promoting the use of an ``unreasonably \n     dangerous'' product. ``Plaintiffs attorneys are giving each \n     other seminars on how to promote these lawsuits,'' he says, \n     adding that complaints have also been filed against the \n     American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, the American \n     Association of Neurological Surgeons, and the Scoliosis \n     Research Society.\n       But, counters plaintiffs attorney Arnold Levin, by \n     accepting money from pedicle screw vendors, the Spine Society \n     becomes a legitimate defendant. ``By hosting the \n     manufacturers, by giving comfort to them, aiding and \n     assisting them, they became part of the selling arm, they \n     became part of the manufacturer,'' says Levin, a partner \n     in Philadelphia's Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, which \n     is litigating the issue.\n       ``And they were trading in a product that hadn't been \n     approved for that use by the FDA,'' he adds.\n\n\n                           standard procedure\n\n       Down in Alabama, which has a reputation as one of the most \n     favorable places in America for the plaintiffs' bar, trial \n     lawyer Richard Cunningham of Mobile's Cunningham, Bounds, \n     Yance, Crowder & Brown says trade associations are not always \n     the neutral, consumer-friendly forces they often claim to be.\n       Earlier this month, Cunningham won a potentially \n     multibillion dollar class action in a Mobile County, Ala., \n     circuit court against the Masonite Corp. for installing \n     faculty hard-board siding in more than four million homes. He \n     says many trade associations are not at all interested in \n     consumers, and have nothing more than their members' \n     interests at heart.\n       ``The real problem is when you have a trade association \n     controlled by an industry and they intentionally promulgate \n     minimal standards which do not impose any burden on the \n     industry and do not create a safe product,'' he says.\n       ``The state of the art standard for the industry could be \n     much higher than the minimal standards set, but it will cost \n     them much more money to meet that higher \n     standard,'' Cunningham continues.``But the industry can \n     use the minimal standards to say, `We were not negligent, \n     we met the existing standard of care.' In fact, there may \n     have been a collusive effort between industry on the whole \n     and the trade association to establish ineffective \n     standards.''\n       That wasn't necessarily the case in the Masonite decision, \n     which includes a minimum of $47.5 million in legal fees for \n     the dozen or so law firms that took part in the class action. \n     But during the course of litigation, a subpoena was issued to \n     the Palatine, Ill.-based American Hardboard Association for \n     information about the testing of certain hardboard products.\n       ``It is the practice of trial lawyers to go fishing at \n     trade association folks to see if there's anything negative \n     in the files, or whether the association ever warned about \n     this or that happening,'' says Karmol of the Spa and Pool \n     Institute, making the case for a legislative remedy.\n       ``There's an argument to be made that if associations are \n     to advance the public interest, and allow members to talk \n     about things to avoid similar situations in the future, there \n     ought to be some kind of protection.''\n       In fact, Karmol concedes, the number of times the institute \n     has been named in a lawsuit has not increased over time. \n     ``But I attribute that to our aggressive defense. Most trial \n     lawyers are looking for defendants who will role over and \n     kick in $100,000 to a settlement,'' he says.\n       While it appears that nothing short of legislation will \n     stop associations from being drawn into court, those who have \n     represented such groups in these cases say there are ways to \n     avoid worsening their plight once there, including \n     maintaining a judicious level of discretion.\n       If you don't want the court to construe that you have a \n     duty to the public, and hence can be targeted in a lawsuit, \n     don't brag to them about the information you disseminate, \n     says Jacobs, the Jenner & Block partner. And make sure your \n     standards are more than sufficient.\n       ``Do your due diligence,'' counsels Jacobs. ``and don't \n     crow to consumers about the value of your program if it is \n     designed to assist members. It's much more difficult [to \n     defend yourself] when you make pronouncements at large.''\n       Meanwhile, while the Bono legislation will undoubtedly face \n     stiff opposition in Congress--the trial lawyers remains a \n     formidable foe--supporters are cheered that at least the \n     issue is now getting some attention.\n       ``It's in its infancy,'' acknowledges the ASAE's Clarke, \n     referring to the proposed legislation. ``But there will be \n     lots of work and lots of efforts in this area. We don't want \n     it to be seen as open season on associations.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1136. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to provide that the State preemption rules shall not apply to \ncertain actions under State law to protect health insurance \npolicyholders; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            THE EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Employee \nHealth Insurance Accountability Act of 1997. This measure will hold \nemployer-sponsored health maintenance organizations accountable for \npatient injuries that result from their decisions regarding a patient's \nmedical care.\n  Due to a loophole in the Employer Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974 [ERISA], employer-sponsored health plans can escape responsibility \nfor the effect their treatment decisions have on their patients' \nhealth. Many courts have held that ERISA preempts State lawsuits \nagainst the entities that provide employee benefits and retirement \nplans. This includes medical malpractice suits against an employer-\nsponsored HMO.\n  There are two primary victims under the current system. The first \nvictims are the patients who are injured, because they are wrongfully \ndenied treatment services by their employer-sponsored HMO's. Let me \ntell you just one story:\n  Due to her history of high-risk pregnancies, Ms. Florence Corcoran's \nphysician determined that she should be hospitalized during the waning \nweeks of her pregnancy. Her employer-sponsored HMO disagreed and only \nauthorized 10 hours a day of home nursing care. While the nurse was \noff-duty, Ms. Corcoran's unborn child suffered distress and died. Ms. \nCorcoran sued her employer-sponsored HMO, but the court held that ERISA \npreempted her claim. Ms. Corcoran, therefore, will never obtain proper \nredress for the death of her unborn child and her HMO will never be \nheld accountable. She can only sue her doctor--not her employer-\nsponsored HMO--even though her doctor was not at fault.\n  Ms. Corcoran and others like her cannot bring suit in State court \nwhere they should rightfully receive redress for their losses. Instead, \nthey are forced to sue in Federal court where they can only receive the \ncost of the medical benefit they were denied. In\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\nshort, Ms. Corcoran's unborn child died needlessly, and the only \npenalty to the HMO is the few hundred dollars it would have cost to \nproperly hospitalize her.\n  As Newsweek observed, if ``there's no financial penalty when \n[employer-sponsored] health plans are negligent, what's to stop these \nprofit-driven creatures from delivering inadequate medical care?''\n  The other victims of the current system are the doctors who end up in \ncourt and are left holding the bag for the actions of the employer-\nsponsored HMO's. To quote the Chicage Tribune, ``[HMOs], which care for \nmore than 60 million people, are telling courts across the country that \nthey cannot be held responsible for medical malpractice in cases \ninvolving patients who receive care through an employer-sponsored \nhealth plan* * *. HMOs are shifting virtually all of the risk of \npatient care to physicians, even though the HMO's can force doctors to \nchange their clinical decisions.''\n  Again, let me demonstrate with a real life example:\n  Mr. Basile Pappas was suffering from numbness in his arms and was \nunable to walk, so he sought treatment at a local community hospital at \n11 a.m. The emergency room doctor on staff made a difficult diagnosis \nand determined that Mr. Pappas had a cervical epidural abscess, a \ncondition that was compressing his spinal cord. The emergency room \ndoctor correctly concluded that unless Mr. Papas was treated \nimmediately by a spinal cord trauma unit he could suffer severe \nparalysis.\n  At 12:30 p.m. the emergency room doctor made arrangements to transfer \nMr. Pappas to a local university hospital, the only hospital in the \narea with such a trauma unit. Mr. Pappas' employer-sponsored HMO, \nhowever, would not allow Mr. Pappas to be transferred to the university \nhospital because it was not part of his service plan. Even after the \nemergency room doctor explained to the employer-sponsored HMO the \nurgency of the situation, the HMO refused. Indeed, the employer-\nsponsored HMO's physician who denied the treatment request refused to \neven speak to the emergency room doctor.\n  The emergency room doctor expeditiously made other arrangements to \ntransfer Mr. Pappas to a hospital with the appropriate facilities that \ncould admit Mr. Pappas. Nonetheless, Mr. Pappas was not treated until \n3:30 p.m. and now suffers from permanent quadripliegia resulting from \ncompression of his spine by the abscess. A court determined that the \nemployer-sponsored HMO was immune from liability due to ERISA, but the \nhospital and Mr. Pappas' physicians were left paying for Mr. Pappas' \ninjuries although they had little to no culpability.\n  Congress clearly never intended ERISA to remove all consumer \nprotection nor for it to be used as a tool by employer-sponsored HMO's \nto shirk their responsibilities. My bill, therefore, amends section \n514(b) of ERISA to clarify that State medical malpractice suits against \nan employer-sponsored HMO are not preempted by Federal law.\n  The Employee Health Insurance Accountability Act resolves the current \nproblem by doing three things:\n  First, the measure holds employer-sponsored health insurance plans \naccountable for the consequences of their treatment rules and coverage \ndeterminations. This will increase patient protection, and create a \npowerful incentive for employer-sponsored HMO's to provide necessity \ncare.\n  Second, the measure provides patients with legal redress when their \nemployer-sponsored HMO's treatment rules and coverage determinations \ncause them harm. Victims like Ms. Corcoran will no longer be left \nwithout the opportunity to seek just reparations for their injuries. \nAnd\n  Finally, the measure reduces the likelihood that doctors will be sued \nfor coverage determinations beyond their control. They will no longer \nface lawsuits simply because injured patients cannot properly hold \ntheir employer-sponsored HMO accountable.\n  Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to introduce this \nimportant initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and \nsupport the Employee Health Insurance Accountability Act in order to \nensure that employer-sponsored HMO's can no longer escape liability for \ntheir actions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Employee Health Insurance \n     Accountability Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) employer-sponsored health insurers' treatment rules and \n     coverage determinations affect patients' receipts of health \n     care by restricting the health services that are available to \n     patients;\n       (2) physicians' behavior is affected by employer-sponsored \n     health insurers' treatment and coverage determinations;\n       (3) medical malpractice is almost exclusively within the \n     jurisdiction of the States;\n       (4) section 514(a) of the Employer Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1144(a) (``ERISA'')) \n     generally preempts State lawsuits against the entities that \n     provide employee benefits and retirement plans while allowing \n     lawsuits against physicians;\n       (5) there is a split among the United States Courts of \n     Appeals on whether ERISA preempts medical malpractice suits \n     against employer-sponsored health insurers;\n       (6) in the jurisdictions in which the Courts of Appeals \n     have held that ERISA preempts medical malpractice suits \n     against employer-sponsored health insurers, patients who may \n     have been injured due to their employer-sponsored health \n     insurers' treatment and coverage determinations have been \n     left without a right of action under which to bring a lawsuit \n     to seek just redress for their injuries; and\n       (7) it is, therefore, necessary to amend ERISA to clarify \n     that State medical malpractice suits against an employer-\n     sponsored health insurer are not preempted.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To restore accountability to employer-sponsored health \n     insurers for the impact of their treatment rules and coverage \n     determinations on patients' health.\n       (2) To increase patient protection from adverse effects on \n     their health due to their employer-sponsored health insurers' \n     treatment rules and coverage determinations.\n       (3) To provide patients with legal redress when their \n     employer-sponsored health insurers' treatment rules and \n     coverage determinations cause them harm.\n       (4) To provide more equitable assignment of liability among \n     health care decision-makers so that plaintiffs are not forced \n     to attempt to hold physicians liable for the treatment rules \n     and coverage determinations of employer-sponsored health \n     insurers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend section 258 of the Communications Act of \n1934 to establish additional protections against the unauthorized \nchange of subscribers from one telecommunications carrier to another; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      the slamming protection act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Slamming \nProtection Act of 1997. This measure enables long-distance telephone \nconsumers and the States to strike back against ``slamming,'' the \npractice of changing a telephone customer's long-distance carrier \nwithout the customer's knowledge or consent.\n  Slamming is the Federal Communications Commission's largest source of \nconsumer complaints. In 1995, more than a third of the consumer \ncomplaints filed with the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau involved \nslamming. Last year 16,000 long-distance telephone consumers filed \nslamming complaints with the FCC. Since 1994, the number of slamming \ncomplaints has tripled. Yet, this is only the tip of the iceberg. \nMoreover, the Los Angeles Times reports that more than 1 million\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\nAmerican telephone consumers have been slammed in the last 2 years.\n  Slamming is not merely an inconvenience or a nuisance. It is an act \nof fraud that costs long-distance telephone consumers millions of \ndollars a year.\n  Let me give you an example. This January, Ms. Geryl Kramer, a small \nbusiness owner in Chicago, was surprised to open her phone bill and \nfind it noticeably more expensive than usual. After numerous phone \ncalls she discovered that without her knowledge or consent, her long-\ndistance carrier had been changed--she had been slammed. Her long-\ndistance telephone service became a ping-pong ball bounced among \nvarious long-distance carriers for their profit and at her expense.\n  Ms. Kramer spent countless hours attempting to resolve the situation, \ngoing back and forth between four different long-distance carriers who \nwere involved in the slamming which had quadrupled her small business' \nlong-distance bills. Although she was slammed in November last year, \nshe still has not been able to track down how she was slammed or who \nwas responsible.\n  Ms. Kramer was understandably upset and frustrated. Beyond being \nexasperated by the audacity of the slammer, Ms. Kramer was left feeling \npowerless by her inability to hold the slammer accountable for its \nfraudulent actions. Having explored every other avenue, Ms. Kramer came \nto me seeking a solution to the problem of slamming. I believe the \nSlamming Protection Act is that solution.\n  The current protections against slamming are simply inadequate. \nAlthough long-distance telephone consumers can currently bring an \naction in Federal court or file a complaint with the FCC, these \nmeasures have been largely ineffective in reducing slamming. The \neconomic damages suffered by consumers are often relatively \ninsignificant--it would cost more to sue for recovery than the consumer \nwould ever recover in court.\n  Moreover, if a long-distance telephone consumer files an FCC slamming \ncomplaint, the only redress is to be excused from paying the additional \ncost of the long-distance bill, if the bill is more expensive than it \nwould have been under the original long-distance carrier. Thus, the \nconsumer who is slammed must take the time and effort to file the \ncomplaint and participate in the investigation. Yet, when all is said \nand done, all the consumer can get after being defrauded is to be \nexcused from paying the additional costs. Not surprisingly, slammers \nare undeterred by this system. And, it turns out, they have little to \nfear from broader FCC investigations.\n  The FCC does have administrative enforcement procedures against \nslamming. Although the FCC's efforts are a step in the right direction, \nthey are too slow moving and seldom result in more than a slap on the \nwrist. Last year the FCC processed roughly 13,000 slamming complaints. \nThis is only a fraction of the number of slamming incidents. And only \nrarely do the FCC's efforts result in changes in industry practice.\n  Since the FCC began investigating slamming in 1994, it has only moved \nagainst seven long-distance carriers and has only entered into consent \ndecrees with eight long-distance carriers accused of slamming. \nMoreover, any fine or settlement agreement achieved by the FCC is paid \nto the U.S. Treasury, not the long-distance telephone consumer who was \nslammed--not to the party who was harmed.\n  Mr. President, we need tougher laws on the books. Long-distance \ntelephone consumers should be able to stand up for themselves and fight \nback against slammers to let them know that their actions will not pay.\n  The Slamming Protection Act will help stamp out slamming by providing \nindividual long-distance telephone consumers with the right and the \npower to strike back against individual slammers and by establishing \npenalties that will make slamming too risky and too expensive for the \npractice to remain profitable.\n  This measure will help end slamming in three ways:\n  First, it creates a right of action for long-distance telephone \nconsumers to sue the slammer in State or Federal court. The Slamming \nProtection Act establishes minimum statutory damages of $2,000--or \n$6,000 if the slamming was done willfully and knowingly. These \nsubstantial penalties are designed to have a significant deterrent \neffect and to be large enough to encourage consumers to bring such \nactions;\n  Second, the Slamming Protection Act provides State attorneys general \nwith the right to bring suit against slammers on behalf of the citizens \nof their States. Currently, in some jurisdictions the States are \nvirtually helpless in their fight against interstate slammers. There is \nno existing Federal right of action to allow the States to hold \nslammers accountable. And a number of courts have held that similar \nState laws are preempted by Federal law. Some States, therefore, are \nleft without recourse to prevent their citizens from being injured by \nslammers; and\n  Finally, the Slamming Protection Act creates criminal fines and jail \ntime for repeat and willful slammers. Slamming takes choices away from \nconsumers without their knowledge and distorts the long distance \ncompetitive market by rewarding companies that engage in misleading \nmarketing practices. The Slamming Protection Act's criminal penalties \nwill guarantee that slammers can no longer act with impunity.\n  Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to introduce this \nimportant initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and \nsupport The Slamming Protection Act in order to help long-distance \ntelephone consumers and the States to fight back against deceptive and \nfraudulent slammers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform the coastwise, intercoastal, and \nnoncontiguous trade shipping laws, and for other purposes, to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    the freedom to ship act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, since 1920 there has been a Federal law on \nthe books that, while perhaps well intentioned, nonetheless forbids a \nvast segment of the farming community in North Carolina and other \nStates from obtaining reasonably-priced grain from the Midwest. It has \nlong prevented Midwestern grain producers from delivering much needed \ngrain to grain deficit states which experience difficulty in feeding \ntheir livestock.\n  That is why I am today introducing S. 1138 which I have titled ``The \nFreedom To Ship Act of 1997.'' I am pleased to have Senator Brownback, \nSenator Burns, Senator Hagel, and Senator Roberts as original \ncosponsors.\n  Mr. President, the Jones Act, as it is commonly called, prevents a \nlarge sector of the Agricultural community in North Carolina from \nobtaining grain from the Midwest at reasonable prices. Furthermore, it \nis preventing grain suppliers in the Midwest from supplying grain \ndeficit states, such as North Carolina, with grain needed for their \nlivestock.\n  Under the present system, a few waterborne carriers have a monopoly \non shipping, and my folks in North Carolina tell me that those shippers \nhave no certified Jones Act ships to meet their demands.\n  My poultry and pork farmers tell me they can't get enough grain for \ntheir farms to feed their animals. My State cannot, and will never be \nable, to produce enough grain for the poultry and pork producers in \nNorth Carolina; so, as a result, they must, I repeat, they must have \ngrain shipped in from the Midwest. They tell me the railroads can't \nguarantee enough rail cars to get the supplies of grain needed from the \nMidwest. And the costs of these shipments that are available are very \nhigh. The increase in transportation costs coupled with the price of \ngrain leads to higher overhead for my farmers. This shortage of grains \nand shortage of trains means higher costs and higher prices which \nthreatens the jobs of many farmers.\n  According to the 1996 North Carolina Department of Agriculture \nreport, North Carolina was first in the nation in turkey production \nwith 59.5 million heads; our State was number two in hog production, \nexceeded by Iowa, at 9.8 million heads; and in commercial broilers \nNorth Carolina was fourth with 681 million heads, exceeded by Arkansas, \nGeorgia, and Alabama.\n  While we slightly dropped off in turkey production in 1996, we \nincreased hog production by 1.5 million head and increased commercial \nbroiler production by 37 million heads over the last statistical \nreporting period. That is a tremendous number of poultry and livestock \nto feed, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n  Dependence on one mode of transportation, the railroads, is not good. \nIn times of severe weather, such as heavy snows in Winter and flooding \nfrom heavy rains, many times railroads can't get through mountain \npasses or flooded areas of the country. We've seen quite a few severe \nwinters and floods in the past few years. Even a delay of one day can \nbe critical to farmers.\n  Mr. President, the problem is that the Jones Act restricts shipping \nbetween ports in the United States. It requires that merchandise being \ntransported by water between U.S. points be shipped on U.S.-built, \nU.S.-flagged, U.S.-manned, and U.S.-citizen owned vessels that are \ndocumented by the Coast Guard for such carriage. The problem is that \nthere are not enough Jones Act certified vessels to transport grain to \nNorth Carolina farmers. As a matter of fact, my farmers are now faced \nwith being forced to go to foreign sources of feed grain.\n  According to a report in the September 12, 1995, Journal of Commerce, \nMurphy Family Farms brought in a cargo of 1 million bushels of Canadian \nwheat to the port of Wilmington, North Carolina on Canada Steamship \nLines.\n  Mr. President, the Jones Act is not fair to grain producers in the \nMidwest. It penalizes them for being American farmers.\n  Those that would protest this legislation would say that it would \ndestroy American shipping. If we maintain the status quo, my farmers \nwill have no choice but to buy foreign grain from countries like Canada \nand Argentina and it will be transported on non U.S. flagged vessels.\n  Mr. President, this legislation requires any non-U.S. flag shipping \ncompany that wishes to do regularly scheduled business in the coastwise \ntrades to: set up a United States Corporation, use U.S. Labor, comply \nwith all state and federal law and--for those of us who are worried \nabout the budget deficit--pay state and Federal Taxes. More \nimportantly, it would create more long shore jobs. The more ships you \nhave in the trade the more you have to load and unload, hence you need \nmore workers.\n  According to a report, issued in December of 1995, by the United \nStates International Trade Commission, ``The economy wide effect of \nremoving the Jones Act is a U.S. economic welfare gain of approximately \n$2.8 billion. This figure can also be interpreted as the annual \nreduction in real national income imposed by the Jones Act. A primary \nreason for the large gain in welfare is a decline of approximately 26 \npercent in the price of shipping services formerly restricted by the \nJones Act.''\n  It is strange circumstance where we are the breadbasket of the world \nand there is a lid on the basket of the domestic market placed by the \nJones Act.\n  Mr. President, the Jones Act placing restrictions on shipments of a \nwhole host of other non-agricultural goods and commodities, such as \ncoal, fuel oil, steel, kaolin clay, in the United States. Our \nlegislation would help lower shipping costs for many other industries \nas well.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join us in correcting this inequity to \nallow American grain to be shipped unhindered to those grain deficit \nstates that are in need of it; and all other non-agricultural \ncommodities and goods to be shipped by water at reasonable costs where \nthey are needed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\n                                S. 1138\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Concurrent \nResolution which expresses the sense of the Congress that Russia should \nrefrain from providing additional missile assistance to Iran, and calls \nfor the imposition of sanctions should Russia fail to stop.\n  A broad, bipartisan consensus exists among leaders in the Congress \nand the administration that the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction [WMD] and ballistic missiles used to deliver them is one of \nthe key national security challenges facing the United States today. In \nfact, in 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12938 declaring \nthat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of \ndelivering them constitutes ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates,'' and that he had therefore decided to ``declare a national \nemergency to deal with that threat.'' The President reaffirmed this \nExecutive Order in 1995 and 1996.\n  The Concurrent Resolution that I have submitted today has bipartisan, \nbicameral support. Over the past few weeks I have enjoyed working with \nRepresentative Jane Harman, the principal sponsor of the resolution in \nthe House of Representatives, and I am pleased to announce that \nSenators Feinstein, D'Amato, Inhofe, Allard, and Burns are original \ncosponsors of the legislation.\n  This resolution is important because Iran's ballistic missile \nprogram--in concert with its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \nprograms--poses a grave threat to the United States and our allies in \nthe region.\n  Iran is a state-sponsor of terrorism led by a regime which is hostile \nto the United States.\n  Its chemical and biological weapons programs, which began in the \nearly 1980's, are now capable of producing a wide variety of highly \nlethal chemical and biological agents, and Tehran has an aggressive \nprogram to develop nuclear weapons.\n  In addition, Iran currently possesses Scud-B and Scud-C ballistic \nmissiles, and with Russian assistance, is working to develop longer-\nrange missiles.\n  Russia has stated that it recognizes the danger posed by Iran's \nmissile program. At the Helsinki summit in March 1997, President \nYeltsin reaffirmed that it was not Moscow's policy to assist Iran's \nmissile program, since such missiles could be used to threaten Russia \nin the future. In addition, Russia is a member of the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime [MTCR], which regulates the sale of missile \ntechnology to non-member nations, and has signed a bilateral agreement \nwith the United States pledging not to conclude additional arms \ncontracts with Iran.\n  Despite Russia's assurances and bilateral and international \ncommitments, recent press articles indicate Russian entities have \nengaged in missile cooperation with Iran. On February 12, 1997, the Los \nAngeles Times reported that Russia had recently transferred SS-4 \nmissile technology to Iran. The transfer reportedly involved detailed \ninstructions on how to build the missile and some unspecified \ncomponents. This transfer is of particular concern since the SS-4 has a \nrange of 2,000 km--more than three times greater than any missile \ncurrently in Iran's arsenal.\n  In addition to the transfer of SS-4 technology, Russia appears to be \nselling Iran a wide variety of other equipment and material useful in \nthe design and manufacture of ballistic missiles. According to a \nWashington Times article published on May 22, 1997, Russian entities \nsigned numerous missile-related contracts with Iran's Defense \nIndustries Organization in 1996. The contracts reportedly included \ndeals worth over $100,000 for projects such as the construction of a \nwind tunnel for missile design, manufacture of missile models, and the \nsale of missile design software. Construction of the wind tunnel alone \nis expected to cost several million dollars.\n  These press reports are corroborated by an unclassified report to \nCongress, prepared by the CIA and coordinated throughout the \nIntelligence Community, that was released in June. The report titled, \n``The Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction \nand Advanced Conventional Munitions,'' states that, ``Russia supplied a \nvariety of ballistic missile-related goods to foreign countries [in \n1996], especially Iran.'' The report also noted that Russia and China \ncontinued to be the primary suppliers of missile technology and were \n``key to any future efforts to stem the flow of dual-use goods and \nmodern weapons to countries of concern.''\n  This Concurrent Resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that \nthe President should demand that the Russian government take concrete \nactions to stop governmental and nongovernmental entities from \nproviding missile assistance to Iran. If Russia fails to respond to \nUnited States concerns, the Resolution calls on the President to impose \nsanctions on the responsible Russian entities in accordance with \nexisting United States law. This resolution is a reasonable response to \nan important problem.\n  I am pleased that Russian President Yeltsin has clearly stated that \nit is not Russia's policy to assist Iran's missile\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\nprogram. But unfortunately, there continue to be discrepancies between \nRussian words and deeds. The time has come for Russia's leaders to halt \nthis dangerous missile cooperation with a dangerous regime in Tehran. I \nurge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8609-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 49--AUTHORIZING USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Jeffords) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a \nSenate resolution which authorizes and requests the President to \ndesignate the week beginning September 14, 1997, as ``National \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities Week''.\n  It is my privilege to sponsor this legislation for the 12th time--I \nrepeat, the 12th time--honoring the historically black colleges of our \ncountry.\n  Eight of the one hundred and sixteen historically black colleges, \nnamely Allen University, Benedict College, Claflin College, South \nCarolina State University, Morris College, Voorhees College, Denmark \nTechnical College, and Clinton Junior College, are located in my home \nState. These colleges are vital to the higher education system of South \nCarolina. They have provided thousands of economically disadvantaged \nyoung people with the opportunity to obtain a college education.\n  Mr. President, thousands of young Americans have received quality \neducations at these 116 schools. These institutions have a long and \ndistinguished history of providing the training necessary for \nparticipation in a rapidly changing society.

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk \nconcerning recent fighting in the Republic of Congo. Senator Feingold \nis joining me as an original cosponsor of this resolution, and I \ngreatly appreciate his support in this effort and his help as the \nRanking Member on the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  The Republic of Congo--not to be confused with the neighboring \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire--has been \nembroiled in domestic unrest since early June when hostilities erupted \nbetween the forces of the former military dictator Denis Sassou-Nguesso \nand troops loyal to the current Congolese leader, President Pascal \nLissouba.\n  President Lissouba defeated Sassou in national elections in 1992. \nRecent hostilities between the two leaders pose a threat to the nascent \ndemocracy that the Republic of Congo has tried to cultivate over the \nlast 5 years.\n  The Republic of Congo has made significant steps to embrace democracy \nsince the late 1980's. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the \npeople of the Republic of Congo pressed for democratic change in their \nown country. Their struggle against political repression was rewarded \nwith the convening of a national conference in 1991 and the adoption of \na multiparty constitution in 1992.\n  The first free national elections were held in 1992. Since that time \nthe Congolese people have endured violent\n\n[[Page S8611]]\n\n threats to their emerging democracy. Indeed, factional infighting \nbetween rival political groups has taken the lives of several thousand \npeople since 1993.\n  The most recent outbreak of fighting poses yet another challenge to \nthe people of the Republic of Congo and the liberty they desire for \ntheir country. Thankfully, a ceasefire was signed by the warring \nparties over the weekend of July 12-13, and representatives of \nPresident Lissouba and Sassou-Nguesso have been in Libreville, Gabon \nattempting to negotiate a peace agreement.\n  It is my sincere hope that negotiations are constructive and that the \nRepublic of Congo is able to move forward and hold elections previously \nscheduled for July 27, but now delayed indefinitely.\n  We should make it clear to all parties involved in the conflict in \nthe Republic of Congo that the United States condemns violent attempts \nto overthrow the democratically-elected government of the Republic of \nCongo. There is too much at stake in Central Africa right now for the \nUnited States to remain silent about instability which threatens the \npeaceful transfer of power in a country struggling to embrace \ndemocracy.\n  United States foreign policy in Central Africa has failed miserably \nin restraining the forces of violence which have plagued Rwanda and \nBurundi, the former Zaire, and now the Republic of Congo. The Clinton \nadministration must address more forcefully the chain of events in \nCentral Africa before the region spirals out of control. A good place \nto start would be to speak out forcefully in support of democracy in \nthe Republic of Congo and against the violence which threatens the \ncountry's stability.\n  Mr. President, it is time to take a public stand in support of the \nfragile democracy in the Republic of Congo, which is why I am \nsubmitting this resolution today. I hope at the appropriate time my \ncolleagues will vote to condemn the violence now threatening the \nprospects for constitutional government and the rule of law in the \nRepublic of Congo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8610-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 113--CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF JAMAICA\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n       Whereas on August 6, 1962, the people of Jamaica were \n     granted their independence from Great Britain;\n       Whereas the people of Jamaica will celebrate their 35th \n     anniversary of independence during a four-day ``Emancipation \n     Day'' celebration from August 1 to August 4, 1997;\n       Whereas the people of Jamaica have practiced a \n     representative democracy for 53 years since the establishment \n     of internal self-governance in 1944;\n       Whereas under the Administration of Prime Ministers Michael \n     Manley and PJ Patterson, Jamaica has played a leadership role \n     in stimulating trade-based economic development, promoting \n     democracy, fighting the illicit narcotics trade, and \n     fostering the observance of human rights in the Caribbean \n     region;\n       Whereas more than 2,000,000 Americans are of Jamaican \n     descent, and Jamaican-Americans have made a rich contribution \n     to our society;\n       Whereas Jamaica and the United States benefit from a \n     healthy commercial relationship that, in 1996, exceeded \n     $2,300,000,000; and\n       Whereas Jamaica and the United States enjoy strong cultural \n     and social links: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the people of Jamaica on the occasion of \n     the 35th anniversary of Jamaica's independence from Great \n     Britain;\n       (2) celebrates the strong, entrenched tradition of \n     democratic governance in Jamaica;\n       (3) recognizes the richness of the contribution to United \n     States of economic, political, social, and cultural life by \n     Americans of Jamaican descent;\n       (4) commends the Government of Jamaica for its efforts to \n     promote stability and economic growth in the Caribbean \n     region; and\n       (5) looks forward to the continuance of strong relations \n     and cooperation between the United States and Jamaica.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it will be 35 years ago this coming \nWednesday, August 6, 1997, that the people of Jamaica were granted \ntheir independence from Great Britain. This significant event for the \npeople of Jamaica is cause for great celebration by the citizens of \nJamaica as well as all of us who cherish democracy. The United States \nand Jamaica have been partners working together helping to bring \ndemocracy throughout the world. The government of Jamaica was the first \nof our allies joining our efforts to come to the aid of its neighbor \nHaiti. Jamaican American citizens contribute to the richness of our \nnation's cultural heritage. They strengthen the rich cultural and \nsocial ties between our nations.\n  It is therefore fitting that we take this opportunity to congratulate \nthe people of Jamaica during their four day ``Emancipation Day'' \ncelebration August 1, to August 4, 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8611-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8611-S8612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SENATE RESOLUTION 114--RELATIVE TO TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Brownback, in submitting a Sense of Senate \nResolution on the Current and Future Status of Taiwan.\n  This legislation expresses the sense of the Senate that the recent \ntransfer of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China does not alter \nthe current or future status of Taiwan. The reversion of Hong Kong to \nChina on July 1 has created the impression among some that the \nsituations of Hong Kong and Taiwan are similar. Our resolution makes \nclear that there are deep differences between these two situations.\n  Hong Kong reverted to China after the expiration of a treaty signed \nby China and the United Kingdom in 1898 granting a 99 year lease.\n  No treaties exist which determine the future status of Taiwan, and \nTaiwan has maintained a de facto independence since 1949.\n  The formula of ``one country, two systems'' applied to Hong Kong has \nno relevance to Taiwan.\n  China continues to renounce the use of force against Taiwan and as \nrecently as 1996 held military exercises in the Taiwan Strait in an \nattempt to intimidate the people of Taiwan.\n  The Taiwan Relations Act makes it the policy of the United States to \n``consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than \npeaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the \npeace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to \nthe United States.''\n  Based on these differences, our resolution expresses the sense of the \nSenate that--\n  First, the transfer of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China \ndoes not alter the current and future status of Taiwan;\n  Second, the future of Taiwan should be determined by peaceful means \nthrough a democratic process in accordance with the principle of self-\ndetermination, as outlined in the Charter of the United Nations; and\n  Third, the United States should assist in the defense of Taiwan in \ncase of\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nthreats or military attack by the People's Republic of China against \nTaiwan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8611-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 115--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR A NATIONAL DAY OF UNITY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Johnson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Judiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 115\n\n       Whereas the President has called for a national dialogue on \n     race;\n       Whereas an appropriate way to meet the President's \n     challenge is to establish a National Day of Unity when all \n     Americans can celebrate their common heritage and shared \n     destiny;\n       Whereas such a day would be a means to build a bridge that \n     would finally cross the racial and other divides of our \n     Nation and to achieve the unity our Nation desires and needs; \n     and\n       Whereas no particular day can close all divisions within \n     our Nation, but by coming together on a National Day of \n     Unity, we can focus the dialogue the President seeks, and \n     that the Nation needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That a National Day of Unity should be \n     established in order to facilitate a national dialogue to \n     encourage Americans to renew their commitment to liberty and \n     justice for all and to celebrate our unity.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nexpress my strong support for the Senate Resolution calling for a \nNational Day of Unity submitted by Senator Boxer. This Resolution is a \ndirect response to the President's call for a national dialog on race, \nand I applaud the timeliness and the intent of Senator Boxer's efforts.\n  The challenges associated with race relations that we have faced as a \nnation are apparent throughout our collective history. In my rural \nstate, Native Americans are the largest minority, comprising nearly 8% \nof the population. Spurred by deep-rooted tensions between Native \nAmericans and non-Indians in South Dakota, the late Governor George \nMickelson had the foresight to declare 1990 a Year of Reconciliation on \nrace relations. In his communications with me after this declaration, \nMickelson wrote, ``* * * our successes reached beyond anyone's \nimagination. I do not suggest we have even scraped the surface of all \nthat we have too, but I do suggest that there is a new awareness among \nthe citizens of South Dakota for a need to reconcile, a need to learn \nabout and understand one another's cultures, and a need to put aside \nold prejudices.''\n  At the request of the Governor, South Dakota's tribal leaders, and \nthe people of South Dakota, I introduced legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives in 1992, calling for a National Year of Reconciliation \nto focus on healing the breach between Native Americans and non-indians \nnationwide. That legislation was signed into law by President Bush in \nMay of 1992. Native Americans are a significant, culturally unique and \noften insular racial minority. In order to understand the history and \nthe future of race relations in the U.S., I have long felt that we must \nunderstand the position of Native Americans and the scope of this \ncountry's oldest race relationships. The 1992 National Year of \nReconciliation legislation was dedicated to the type of dialog that \nPresident Clinton has asked for in his broader initiative on race.\n  Today, the President's Advisory Board on Race Relations has been \ncharged with the enormous task of addressing racial tensions and the \nimpact of race relations on every American. The first meeting of the \nRace Relations Board held in San Diego, California, indicated that the \nBoard's task is indeed daunting, and that a dialog on race is \npotentially divisive. It is that very divisiveness which makes the \nPresident's initiative so vital. We are all aware that racism and \nprejudice persist in this country. A national dialog must be \nencouraged, and an opportunity for full participation by every American \nof all ethnicities must be provided.\n  Senator Boxer's Resolution calls on the Congress to follow the \nPresident's lead in expanding the dialog and including every voice. If \nwe are to move forward as a nation, we must address the forces that \ndivide us, not only to recognize these forces honestly for what they \nare, but to strengthen our determination that such forces can be \novercome. The Senate has been given a unique opportunity today to \nexpress our full support for the mission of the Race Relations Board, \nand requests the participation of the entire country.\n  Mr. President, this nation's racial problems cannot be solved by a \nfew people, no matter how well-intentioned. That is why I join Senator \nBoxer today in asking the country to express its dedication to solving \nthose problems by observing a National Day of Unity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8612-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SENATE RESOLUTION 116--DESIGNATING AMERICA RECYCLES DAY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Jeffords) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has an enriched legacy of Hispanic \n     influence in politics, government, economic development, and \n     cultural expression.\n       (2) The Hispanic culture in what is now the United States \n     can be traced to 1528 when a Spanish expedition from Cuba to \n     Florida was shipwrecked on the Texas coast.\n       (3) The Hispanic culture in New Mexico can be traced to \n     1539 when a Spanish Franciscan Friar, Marcos de Niza, and his \n     guide, Estevanico, traveled into present day New Mexico in \n     search of the fabled city of Cibola and made contact with the \n     people of Zuni.\n       (4) The Hispanic influence in New Mexico is particularly \n     dominant and a part of daily living for all the citizens of \n     New Mexico, who are a diverse composite of racial, ethnic, \n     and cultural peoples. Don Juan de Oarte and the first New \n     Mexican families established the first capital in the United \n     States, San Juan de los Cabelleros, in July of 1598.\n       (5) Based on the 1990 census, there are approximately \n     650,000 Hispanics in New Mexico, the majority having roots \n     reaching back ten or more generations.\n       (6) There are an additional 200,000 Hispanics living \n     outside of New Mexico with roots in New Mexico.\n       (7) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center is a living \n     tribute to the Hispanic experience and will provide all \n     citizens of New Mexico, the Southwestern United States, the \n     entire United States, and around the world, an opportunity to \n     learn about, partake in, and enjoy the unique Hispanic \n     culture, and the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will \n     assure that this 400-year old culture is preserved.\n       (8) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will teach, \n     showcase, and share all facets of Hispanic culture, including \n     literature, performing arts, visual arts, culinary arts, and \n     language arts.\n       (9) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will promote a \n     better cross-cultural understanding of the Hispanic culture \n     and the contributions of individuals to the society in which \n     we all live.\n       (10) In 1993, the legislature and Governor of New Mexico \n     created the Hispanic Cultural Division as a division within \n     the Office of Cultural Affairs. One of the principal \n     responsibilities of the Hispanic Cultural Division is to \n     oversee the planning, construction, and operation of the New \n     Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (11) The mission of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     is to create a greater appreciation and understanding of \n     Hispanic culture.\n       (12) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will serve as \n     a local, regional, national, and international site for the \n     study and advancement of Hispanic culture, expressing both \n     the rich history and the forward-looking aspirations of \n     Hispanics throughout the world.\n       (13) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will be a \n     Hispanic arts and humanities showcase to display the works of \n     national and international artists, and to provide a venue \n     for educators, scholars, artists, children, elders, and the \n     general public.\n       (14) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will provide a \n     venue for presenting the historic and contemporary \n     representations and achievements of the Hispanic culture.\n       (15) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will sponsor \n     arts and humanities programs, including programs related to \n     visual arts of all forms (including drama, dance, and \n     traditional and contemporary music), research, literary arts, \n     genealogy, oral history, publications, and special events \n     such as, fiestas, culinary arts demonstrations, film video \n     productions, storytelling presentations and education \n     programs.\n       (16) Phase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     complex is scheduled to be completed by August of 1998 and is \n     planned to consist of an art gallery with exhibition space \n     and a museum, administrative offices, a restaurant, a \n     ballroom, a gift shop, an amphitheater, a research and \n     literary arts center, and other components.\n       (17) Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     complex is planned to include a performing arts center \n     (containing a 700-seat theater, a stage house, and a 300-seat \n     film/video theater), a 150-seat black box theater, an art \n     studio building, a culinary arts building, and a research and \n     literary arts building.\n       (18) It is appropriate for the Federal Government to share \n     in the cost of constructing the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n     Center because Congress recognizes that the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center has the potential to be a premier \n     facility for performing arts and a national repository for \n     Hispanic arts and culture.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Center.--The term ``Center'' means the Center for \n     Performing Arts, within the complex known as the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center, which Center for the Performing \n     Arts is a central facility in Phase II of the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center complex.\n       (2) Hispanic cultural division.--The term ``Hispanic \n     Cultural Division'' means the Hispanic Cultural Division of \n     the Office of Cultural Affairs of the State of New Mexico.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (c) Construction of Center.--The Secretary shall award a \n     grant to New Mexico to pay for the Federal share of the costs \n     of the design, construction, furnishing, and equipping of the \n     Center for Performing Arts that will be located at a site to \n     be determined by the Hispanic Cultural Divison, within the \n     complex known as the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (d) Grant Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--In order to receive a grant awarded under \n     subsection (c), New Mexico, acting through the Director of \n     the Hispanic Cultural Division--\n       (A) shall submit to the Secretary, within 30 days of the \n     date of enactment of this section, a copy of the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center Program document dated January 1996;

and\n       (D) that the contract for the construction of the Center--\n       (i) shall be awarded pursuant to a competitive bidding \n     process; and\n       (ii) shall be awarded not later than 3 months after the \n     solicitation for bids for the construction of the Center.\n       (3) Federal share.--The Federal share of the costs \n     described in subsection (c) shall be 50 percent.\n       (4) Non-federal share.--The non-Federal share of the costs \n     described in subsection (c) shall be in cash or in kind \n     fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. \n     The non-Federal share shall include any contribution received \n     by New Mexico for the design, construction, furnishing, or \n     equipping of Phase I or Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic \n     Cultural Center complex prior to the date of enactment of \n     this section.

Mr. President, I would like to \ncomment briefly on yesterday's unanimous passage of S. 39, the \nInternational Dolphin Conservation Act after the Senate had adopted a \ncompromise amendment.\n  I joined with my colleagues in supporting this effort to bridge the \ngap between the two sides because I believe that it was the result of \nsincere movement by both sides, a true compromise. As originally \nwritten, S. 39 would have permitted tuna caught by chasing dolphins and \nencircling them in purse-seine nets to be labeled dolphin-safe. The \ncompromise amendment adopted by the Senate yesterday preserves the \nexisting dolphin-safe label until the Secretary of Commerce has the \nopportunity to review a study of the effects of encirclement on \nendangered dolphin populations. This means that the label change will \ntake place no sooner than March 1997.\n  I must admit that the need for such a study is not entirely clear to \nme. I think that any method of fishing for tuna that involves chasing \nschools of dolphins through miles of ocean and encircling them--in nets \na mile wide and as deep as a football field is long--cannot honestly be \ndescribed as safe for dolphins. I only hope that the studies that will \nbe conducted will be anchored in common sense. If they are, I am \nconfident that the label change will not take place.\n  Unfortunately, common sense may take a back seat to pressures from \nforeign governments, the same pressures that gave rise to S. 39 in the \nfirst place. It's no secret that the countries that permit dolphin-\ndeadly fishing would like to have access to the American tuna market--\nthe world's largest--even if it means that our consumer standards have \nto be gutted in the process. I regret that too many in Congress and in \nthe administration have failed to resist this pressure and defend our \ncountry's laws.\n  In that connection, I would like to associate myself with the remarks \nof Senator Boxer, a valued colleague but one with whom I do not \ntypically find myself in agreement. Before the Senate voted on this \nissue, Senator Boxer said: ``American laws should be made by Americans \n* * * American laws should not be made by other countries.'' Senator \nBoxer has it exactly right. This issue has aroused the passionate \ninterest of humane groups others concerned with dolphin welfare, but it \nshould also be of concern to anyone concerned about the integrity of \nour governing institutions and the preservation of the sovereign right \nof the American people to make their laws through those institutions. I \ntrust that we will have the opportunity to revisit that question.\n  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to say that Senator \nBoxer has done a tremendous job of standing up for what is right on \nthis issue and I salute her efforts and those of the others who brought \nthe sponsors of S. 39 to the table. Without Senator Boxer's steadfast \nefforts, this compromise and the opportunity to preserve the dolphin-\nsafe label it provides would not have been possible. \n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8615-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n                        STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize two students of Potomac State College in West \nVirginia who have accomplished great feats through the assistance of \nour Federal TRIO programs. These programs have helped students for more \nthan 30 years to overcome financial barriers to education.\n  Paul Kesner was a participant in the student support services program \nat Potomac State from 1977 to 1979. This section of the TRIO programs \nhelps students to stay in college until they earn their baccalaureate \ndegree by providing tutoring, counseling, and financial assistance. Not \nonly was Paul able to earn his BA, he went on to obtain an MS in \ncounseling psychology from Frostburg State University, and is currently \nworking on his dissertation to earn a Ph.D. from West Virginia \nUniversity. Paul is currently the Dean of Student Affairs at Potomac \nState College.\n  Paul was recently elected to be president of the West Virginia \nAssociation of Student Personnel Administrators. Paul is also very \nactive in Rotary International and various other local civic \norganizations in his community. Paul, who grew up on a farm in Mineral \nCounty, WV, notes that, ``I am grateful for the impact and change TRIO \nhad on my life. Without it, I certainly would not be in a situation to \nhelp others progress toward their own educational goals.''\n  Michelle Francis participated in the student support services program \nat Potomac State from 1989 to 1990. This Federal program helped \nMichelle to graduate from college and to make the career choices that \nshe wanted to make. After earning an associate's degree from Potomac \nState, Michelle went on to earn her BA from Frostburg State University.\n  Michelle is presently the day treatment coordinator at the \ndevelopmental center & workshop in Keyser. Like Paul, Michelle is also \nvery active in her community, serving in the Ladies Auxiliary of the \nAmerican Legion, and as a mentor at the Mountaineer Challenge Academy. \nMichelle was also awarded the 1996 West Virginia TRIO achiever award.\n  As the fine results of these two West Virginia citizens demonstrate, \nthe TRIO programs are clearly helping Americans to overcome financial, \nsocial, academic and cultural barriers to earn their college degrees. \nSince 1965, when the Federal TRIO programs began receiving funding \nunder title IV of the Higher Education Act, the facts have shown that \nstudents who participate in the TRIO student support services program \nare more than twice as likely to remain in college than those students \nfrom similar backgrounds who did not participate in the program.\n  Paul and Michelle have joined the ranks of many West Virginians who \nhave achieved outstanding feats after participating in the TRIO \nprograms. Thirty years ago, the TRIO programs were founded on the basis \nthat all Americans deserved the opportunity to achieve a college \neducation regardless of race, ethnic background, or economic \ncircumstances. Today, the town of Keyser is a better place in which to \nlive because of the contributions of Paul Kesner and Michelle Francis \nto the community. Because the TRIO programs were there for Michelle and \nPaul, they have been able to be there for the benefit of other West \nVirginians.\n  I know that the TRIO programs will continue to help future West \nVirginia students to obtain a college degree, and because of this, \nthese future students will be able to benefit their respected \ncommunities in much the same way that Paul and Michelle help the city \nof Keyser, WV. The TRIO programs don't just create a real society of \nopportunity for everyone, they result in better cities and communities \nthroughout the State of West Virginia and nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8616-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8616-S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF ALASKA QUARTERLY REVIEW\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nsignificant achievement for the literary arts in Alaska and for the \nUniversity of Alaska system, in general, and the University of Alaska \nAnchorage, in specific.\n  Last month, on June 8, 1997, the spring and summer 1997 edition of \nthe Alaska Quarterly Review was recognized in the Washington Post book \nreview section, Book World, as ``one of the nation's best literary \nmagazines.'' That is high praise indeed coming from the Eastern press, \nand justified, if not long overdue recognition, of the literary prowess \nof the publication.\n  In the 15 years since its inception at the Anchorage campus of the \nUniversity of Alaska in 1982, the Alaska Quarterly Review (AQR) has \nserved as an instrument to give voice to Alaska writers and poets, \nwhile also publishing the best of material from non-Alaskan authors. \nWhile the AQR is firmly rooted in Alaska, it maintains a national \nperspective--bridging the distance between the literary centers and \nAlaska, while also sharing an Alaskan perspective. This balanced \npresentation of views has earned AQR local, regional and national/\ninternational recognition over the years. It is nice that recognition \nnow also has come from a publication in the Nation's Capital.\n  ``Congratulations for publishing one of the best among the literary \nmagazines,'' said Carl Houck Smith, vice president and editor of W.W. \nNorton, in comments made in May 1994.\n  ``AQR is highly recommended and deserves applause,'' said Bill Katz \nin the Library Journal.\n  ``It is an impressive publication, comprising as diverse and \nrewarding an aggregation of work as a reader is likely to find in any \nliterary journal,'' added Patrick Parks in the Literary Magazine \nReview.\n  ``The Magazine has a wonderful sense of place about it, and it \nconveys Alaska without being parochial. It's not pushing a particular \nagenda. There's no coterie of writers made up of the editor's friends. \nThe work is original and fresh,'' says contributing editor Stuart Dybek \nin explaining the publication's success.\n  The review, for example, won the 1996 Alaska Governor's Award for the \nArts--Alaska's highest award in the arts. Recent works in the review \nhave been selected for or won:\n   1997 Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards (Anchor Books/\nDoubleday).\n   1996 Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards (Anchor Books/\nDoubleday).\n   1996 Best American Poetry (Scribner)\n   1995 Best American Essays (Houghton Mifflin)\n   1995 Andres Berger Award (Northwest Writers Inc.)\n   The Pushcart Prize (1995-96 Pushcart Prize XX and 1996-97 \nPushcart Prize XXI: The Best of the Small Presses).\n   UAA's 1995 Chancellor's Group Award for Excellence in \nresearch and creative activity.\n   1994 Special Recognition Award from the Alaska Center for \nthe Book.\n   And numerous mentions in the Chronicle of Higher Education, \nthe Small Press Review, Best American Essays, Novel and Short Story \nWriters Market, and in a host of other publications.\n  I rise today to honor the publication, not just because of its many \nawards, but because many Alaskans do not understand or appreciate the \nbreadth and scope of the publication and how important it has become as \na gateway for Alaskan authors to winning recognition from a wider \nliterary audience. And also how it has helped to improve the literary \nquality of the works of Alaskan writers. I hope by these words, \nAlaskans will recognize how fortunate the 49th State is to have such a \nquality publication being edited and published from Anchorage.\n  I want to thank the University of Alaska Board of Regents and the \nleadership of the University of Alaska Anchorage for supporting the \npublication. Alaska's university system has been facing difficult \neconomic times because of falling Alaska State revenues. It has taken a \ntremendous commitment to academic excellence to continue the funding \nnecessary to permit the review to be a quality publication and artistic \nsuccess. The University deserves great credit for its efforts at \npromoting the publications in these difficult financial times. It is \nbecause of the need for more revenues for the University to permit it \nto reach the highest level of greatness possible that I have introduced \nlegislation to help the University finally gain the land-grant \nentitlement it should have received at its founding. I hope that this \nCongress will look favorably on my bill, S. 660. The\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nUniversity of Alaska Land grant bill, to help the University gain the \neconomic means to support such important endeavors. But more on that in \nthe future, following committee review of the legislation, likely this \nfall.\n  I also want to thank and publicly recognize the work of Ronald Spatz, \nthe executive editor and founding editor of the review for all of his \nefforts on its behalf. Mr. Spatz, currently professor and chair of the \nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage's Department of Creative Writing and \nLiterary Arts and director of UAA's honors program, has been a member \nof the faculty since 1980. A professor, who has been recognized with \ncommendations for ``Outstanding Leadership'' by the University's Board \nof Regents and the President of the statewide system, Mr. Spatz is the \nformer chair of the University of Alaska Statewide Assembly, president \nof the UAA Assembly and the vice president of the Faculty Senate. He is \nthe winner of two university-wide teaching awards: The Chancellor's \nAward for Excellence in Teaching and the Distinguished Teacher of the \nYear Award presented by the UAA Alumni Association.\n  Mr. Spatz, a film maker and writer, besides editor, has produced, \ndirected, photographed and edited a range of short subject and \nexpressionist documentary films for children and adults. Several of the \nfilms are in national distribution; his film, ``For the Love of Ben,'' \nwas broadcast nationally on public television and his stories and \narticles have appeared in a host of publications. He has received a \ntotal of more than 35 individual and project grants for his works.\n  For the future, due to a grant from the National Endowment for the \nArts, which has provided three major awards (grants) to the \npublication, AQR this fall will be issuing a special anthology. \n``Intimate Voice, Ordinary Lives: Stories of Fact and Fiction.''\n  Mr. President, Alaska, in fact all of America, is far richer \nartistically because of the review's presence over the past 15 years. \nIt truly is a window for Americans to view society in Alaska at the \nclose of the 20th century, and a worthy stage for the serious works of \nall writers. I commend it and its contributors for its many \nachievements, and I know all members of the U.S. Senate join me in \nwishing it continued literary success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8616-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WOMEN'S BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\nMr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Women's \nBusiness Development Center for the vital role it has played in \naccelerating women's business ownership and strengthening the impact \nthat women have made on our economy.\n  The Women's Business Development Center is a nationally-recognized \nnot-for-profit center devoted to providing services and programs that \nsupport and increase women's business ownership. Founded in 1986, more \nthan 30,000 business owners in six States, including my home State of \nIllinois, have benefited from the program. The services range from \ncounseling to workshops to entrepreneurial training.\n  Today, thanks to efforts by organizations such as the Women's \nBusiness Development Center, there are over 7.7 million women-owned \nbusinesses in the United States, generating $2.3 trillion in sales. \nWomen business owners now employ one in every four U.S. company \nworkers. There is no doubt that women in business today are playing a \nprominent role in stimulating economic growth both at home and abroad.\n  On September 12 of this year the Women's Business Development Center \nwill celebrate its 11th anniversary. As the Center moves into its \nsecond decade of service to women business owners, I am proud to \nrecognize its impressive achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8617-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMY SGT.

Sergeant Yarde, who is \ncurrently serving in Bosnia with Operation Joint Guard, was moved by \nthe sadness he saw in the faces of Bosnia's children each time he went \nout on patrol. In response, he appealed to the people of his hometown \nand surrounding areas, asking for donations of school supplies, toys \nand sporting goods that he could give to these children.\n  Local media helped to publicize Sergeant Yarde's plea, and the \ncommunity responded in magnificent fashion. Hundreds of donations have \nalready poured in, and are continuing to arrive at collection bins set \nup at local businesses. Some of the gifts have already been shipped to \nBosnia, and Sergeant Yarde has, on his own time, taken them to \norphanages and refugee centers.\n  Americans are, by their nature, very generous people. The fact that \nwe can not solve every problem in the world should not prevent us from \nsolving at least some of them. I am pleased and proud that Sergeant \nYarde had the foresight to identify a problem that he could help to \nsolve, and had the faith in his community to ask for help in solving \nit. I am equally pleased that the people of Evansville and the \nsurrounding area responded so generously to Sergeant Yarde's plea on \nbehalf of the children of Bosnia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8617-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF SOUTH DAKOTA SOYBEAN GROWERS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF \n                                SOYGOLD\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to recognize the important achievements of SD soybean growers in \ncreating new uses for their agricultural products.\n  Freeman Coop Oil/Fertilizer in Freeman, SD, recently became the first \nretail marketer of petroleum to offer SoyGold, a new lubricity additive \nin premium diesel fuel. SoyGold is a low blend of soybean methyl esters \nmanufactured from 100 percent soybean oil for both on-farm and \ncommercial use. The additive was developed with the use of check-off \ndollars, which allow farmers to work together to develop new uses for \ntheir products. The soybean growers have also worked to test soydiesel \nfor mass transit bus systems, underground mining, and other innovative \npossibilities.\n  SoyGold was developed by Ag Processors, Inc. in Omaha, NE, and will \nbe promoted and marketed throughout seven Midwestern States initially. \nBill Pape, the general manager of Freeman Coop Oil/Fertilizer, is the \nfirst to offer the product to his customers. Dennis Hardy, the chairman \nof the South Dakota Soybean Council, worked hard to bring this new \nproduct to the market. All of these individuals, and many more, deserve \ncredit for their efforts to make SoyGold a reality.\n  SoyGold is an outstanding example of the way that South Dakota's \nsoybean farmers and their various associations can cooperate and \ncommunicate to create an exciting new product which will build demand \nfor soybeans. Such products demonstrate the way that farmers are \nadapting to the changing agricultural marketplace, and I congratulate \nthem on their foresight, their enthusiasm, and, of course, their \naccomplishment. Moreover, SoyGold is not only good for South Dakota \nfarmers, but it also benefits us all by reducing harmful emissions.\n  Mr. President, there are few industries working as hard to create new \nproducts and new markets as agriculture. The South Dakota soybean \ngrowers whose efforts created SoyGold are to be commended, and I ask \nyou to join me in congratulating them on their success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8617-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8617-S8618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DR. EUGENE SHOEMAKER\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to honor the passing \nof one of the world's most renowned scientists. Eugene Shoemaker and \nhis wife Carolyn, both residents of Flagstaff, AZ, were involved in a \ntragic car accident in Central Australia on July 18, 1997. Gene was \nfatally injured; Carolyn survived the accident sustaining broken ribs, \na broken wrist and a dislocated shoulder. They were in the field \npursuing their lifelong passion of geologic studies to help understand \nimpact craters.\n  ``Gene'' is credited with having almost single-handedly created \nplanetary science as a discipline distinct from astronomy. He brought \ntogether and applied geologic principles to the mapping of planets, \nwhich resulted in more than three decades of discoveries about the \nplanets and asteroids of our Solar System. He was the recipient of the \n1992 National Medal of Science, the most prestigious scientific honor \nbestowed by the President of the United States, then George Bush.\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\n  As a resident of Flagstaff, AZ, Gene invented the Branch of \nAstrogeology within the U.S. Geological Survey and established the \nField Center in Flagstaff in 1965. After retiring from the USGS in \n1993, he joined Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. The culmination of his \nwork came in 1993 when Gene was recognized worldwide for discovering, \nwith his wife Carolyn and colleague David Levy, a comet near Jupiter. \nComet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was broken up by tidal forces from Jupiter, and \nfragments collided with the planet in July 1994.\n  Gene and his wife, Carolyn, a planetary astronomer, were a close \ndevout couple. Their work together was recently captured in a 1997 \nNational Geographic documentary ``Asteroids: Deadly Impact.'' As a \nunique team, they initiated the Palomar Planet-crossing Asteroid Survey \nin 1973, and the Palomar Asteroid and Comet Survey in 1983. They were \nthe leading discovers of comets in this century.\n  Dr. Edward Bowell, an astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, \nAZ, said: ``Gene practically single-handedly `invented' our knowledge \nof the impacts of comets and asteroids on Earth and in the solar system \nin general. He was a renaissance man, having one of the broadest grasps \nof any scientist I know, working as a geologist, training to be an \nastronaut, dating the surfaces of the Moon and other satellites, and \nhelping, with his wife Carolyn, discover more interesting comets and \nasteroids than any other person.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nmoment to praise a citizen of West Virginia, Annie Campbell. Annie has \nrecently received the J.C. Penney Golden Rule award for her outstanding \nvolunteer community service.\n  Annie has been volunteering her time for Manna Meal for the past 20 \nyears, and has seen it expand considerably. Even though she is nearing \n80 years old, Annie pursues her service with confidence and generosity. \nShe drives to pick up food at local businesses and hospitals and \nsometimes helps to serve the food to the people who come to Manna Meal. \nShe loves to give a helping hand to those in need. She says, ``You feel \ngood to know you've done something to alleviate hunger.''\n  Annie's life is built around helping people. She is a registered \nnurse at the Charleston Area Medical Center's General Division, and a \nleader in her church, where she is the secretary, a circle leader, on \nthe mission committee, and on the kitchen committee. Annie is a \ncommitted woman to her community.\n  Manna Meal provides food for the hungry. Annie says, ``A lot of \npeople who come to Manna Meal are not food hungry, they are \ncompanionship hungry.'' She helps with both. She provides food and \nfriendship for those who attend the meals. Manna Meal is run by \nvolunteers and donations. Annie has watched Manna Meal expand from a \ntiny soup kitchen serving 40 to large service providing for 300.\n  Volunteer service is vital to West Virginia and America because it is \ndone on a personal and natural level. It is comforting to hear that \nthere are people who willingly dedicate their lives to helping those in \nneed. West Virginia is extremely lucky to have Annie in the State, and \nI am proud to make this statement regarding her award today.\n  The J.C. Penney Golden Rule award had several other recipients in \ndifferent categories. The other local winners included Sue Meadows, \nErnest Matthew Stone, and the Volunteers of PRO-KIDS. They are now \ngoing to step up to the National Golden Rule Awards, and are eligible \nfor a $10,000 donation to their organization. All of these volunteers \nneed to be congratulated for their effort and generosity, and I wish \nthem luck in the next round of competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8618-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8618-S8619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COSPONSORSHIP OF AMENDMENT 885 TO S. 955\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support \nas a cosponsor to Amendment 885 to S. 955, the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Act. This amendment restores the $2.1 billion earmark \nfor assistance to Egypt.\n  Ever since the signing of the Camp David Accords, Egypt has been a \nkey ally of the United States in the Middle East. The first Arab \ncountry to make peace with Israel, Egypt has been a steadfast leader \nand supporter of peace in the Middle East. Indeed, I feel it is safe to \nsay that it is because Egypt signed the peace agreement with Israel in \n1979 that there has not been an Arab-Israeli War since. What is more, \nsince 1979 both Israel and Egypt have experienced significant economic \ngrowth. Peace between these two nations has brought success and \nprosperity that has benefitted the entire region.\n  The chairman of the Subcommittee has stated his reasons for not \nincluding the earmark to Egypt in the Foreign Operations bill in either \nthe subcommittee nor committee. He believed the relationship between \nEgypt and the United States has suffered over the past year. Thus, the \nmessage he wished to send to Egypt was clear disappointment with \nEgypt's actions and policies in connection with the stalled peace \nprocess in the Middle East.\n  I do not believe, however, that it is either productive or \nresponsible to send such a message at this delicate time in the Middle \nEast peace process. The peace process is at its most critical stage. \nAlong with the United States, Egypt is a key player in convincing \nparties to that process to come back to the negotiating table. \nMoreover, Egypt has played a key role in securing agreements reached \nbetween Israel and Jordan and the Palestinians. It is in the best \ninterest of the United States to keep our key allies in the Middle East \nengaged in a process needed to produce a just and lasting peace--a goal \nwhich will benefit America's strategic, economic and political \ninterests.\n  Equally important, Egypt is a strategic ally of the United States \nirrespective of the peace process. We all remember how Egypt provided \nthe leadership needed to form the American/Arab coalition that \nliberated Kuwait. No other country in the Arab World could have done \nthat. Moreover, more than 35,000 Egyptian soldiers fought alongside our \ntroops. Without access to the Suez Canal and to Egyptian airspace and \nfacilities, supporting our troops in the Gulf would have been \nsignificantly more difficult and much more costly.\n  Egypt's strategic importance should not be underestimated. With the \nSuez Canal and its location on both the Red Sea and the Mediterranean \nSea, Egypt is the gateway to Africa, the Near East and Southwest Asia. \nOur strategic interests in all three regions are furthered \nsignificantly by Egypt's willing cooperation.\n  Egypt's cooperation with our military has a global impact. As our \nstrategic ally, Egypt routinely cooperates with our military in \nproviding hundreds of overflight and transit rights for U.S. military \nlogistics aircraft supporting American forces in the region. Our naval \nvessels travel through the Suez Canal--a practice critical to our \nability to protect U.S. vital interests in the region. Without the \nability to use the Suez routinely, an advantage we now enjoy, our \nNavy's operating costs and personnel operating requirements would soon \nrise to unsustainable levels.\n  I agree with the Chairman of the Subcommittee that foreign aid is not \nan entitlement. It is my sincere hope that one day in the near future \nEgypt will find that U.S. aid is not necessary. Signs of this are \nalready apparent within Egypt's booming economy and burgeoning private \nsector. We in the United States should encourage this path of \nindependence, growing capitalism and economic reform. But until Egypt \nbecomes economically self-sufficient, we should continue to live up to \nour promises as dictated in the Camp David Accords. Any future \nreduction of assistance should follow consultations\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\nand discussions with the government of Egypt. Unilateral actions will \nonly harm relationships important to the American national interest.\n  In summary, Egypt has played and continues to play a key role in \nensuring the success of the Middle East Peace Process. Equally \nimportant, Egypt has proven to be a staunch ally, willing to face \ndanger to protect our shared interest in the region and to support us \nas our armed forces contribute to global stability. As such, I am \nsupportive of the Committee's amendment to reinstall the earmark for \nassistance to Egypt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8618-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION AND FLOW OF SOLID WASTE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that the text of a letter from \nthe Governors of Michigan, Ohio, New Jersey, Indiana, and Pennsylvania, \nto the Chairman of the House Commerce Committee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The Governors correctly urge the House Commerce Committee to swiftly \nmove forward on comprehensive legislation to provide states and local \ngovernments with the authority to regulate the interstate \ntransportation and flow of solid waste.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has repeatedly passed such legislation and \nit is my hope that we will do so again before the end of this year. The \nmajority leadership in the House has certainly given the impression \nthat this important matter is not a priority item, despite the pleas \nfor help from state and local governments around the country who are \nbesieged by out-of-state waste or find their local waste management \ninvestments becoming increasingly uneconomical. I join with the \nGovernors in urging the House Commerce Committee and the Congress to \nquickly pass legislation to provide more control over solid waste \nplanning decisions to state and local governments.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                     July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.,\n     Chairman, The House Commerce Committee,\n     Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bliley: We are writing to urge you to move a \n     comprehensive interstate waste and flow control bill this \n     year. In recent conversations with Governor Voinovich, you \n     encouraged our five states to reach an agreement on \n     interstate waste provisions in order to move comprehensive \n     legislation that will help both importing and exporting \n     states.\n       We strongly believe that the lack of federal interstate \n     waste and flow control legislation undermines states' \n     abilities to implement environmentally sound waste disposal \n     plans and to protect our own natural resources. Without \n     federal authority to place reasonable limits on the amount of \n     out-of-state wastes, states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana \n     and Michigan have become dumping grounds for trash from other \n     states. Without flow control, states like New Jersey are \n     limited in their ability to manage effectively the disposal \n     of municipal solid waste within their own borders, and would \n     face an enormous financial liability.\n       In Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, where out-of-\n     state waste imports are continuously and unreasonably high, \n     citizens repeatedly ask why they should recycle in order to \n     conserve disposal space for other states' waste. New Jersey \n     has taken aggressive steps to try to manage all of its trash \n     within its borders by the year 2000. New Jersey communities \n     have acted responsibly to build disposal facilities to help \n     meet that goal. However, if Congress fails to protect \n     existing flow control authorities, repayment of the \n     outstanding $1.6 billion investment will be jeopardized.\n       We are deeply concerned that our efforts to make \n     responsible decisions have been undermined by federal courts, \n     have put potentially large financial burdens on our \n     communities and have encouraged exporting states to pass \n     their trash problems onto the backs of others. Our citizens \n     are making sacrifices and they need assurances that we have \n     the tools necessary to manage our own waste and limit imports \n     from other states so that we have the space to handle our own \n     garbage.\n       You have asked our five states to try to work through \n     regional differences on interstate waste provisiosn that \n     would allow an interstate waste and flow control bill to move \n     forward. Last year, importing states and New Jersey were able \n     to quickly reach a consensus on interstate waste provisions, \n     provided that New Jersey receives flow control authority. We \n     respectfully resubmit that agreement and urge prompt \n     consideration by your committee and the House.\n       We support this package as a fair and reasonable compromise \n     between importing and exporting states. It provides the \n     ability for importing states to reduce the current amount of \n     out-of-state waste and limit future interstate waste flows. \n     States also would be able to place reasonable restrictions on \n     construction and demolition debris. In addition, it gives \n     local communities the ability to decide whether or not they \n     want to accept other states' trash. And, communities would \n     have reasonable ability to implement flow control \n     authorities. While this package does not include everything \n     that we would like, we believe it is a fair package that we \n     can support without amendments.\n       Unfortunately, efforts to place reasonable restrictions on \n     out-of-state waste shipment have been perceived by some as an \n     attempt to ban all out-of-state trash. On the contrary, \n     importing states--like Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and \n     Pennsylvania--are not asking for outright authority to \n     prohibit all out-of-state waste, nor are we seeking to \n     prohibit waste from any one state. We are asking for \n     reasonable tools that will enable state and local governments \n     to act responsibly to manage their own waste and limit \n     unreasonable waste imports from other states. Such measures \n     would give substantial authority to limit imports and plan \n     facilities around our own states' needs.\n       Effective legislation is supported throughout the country. \n     Twenty-four governors and the Western Governors' Association \n     previously have written to you and the House leadership \n     urging passage of effective legislation.\n       Thank you for your personal consideration of our agreement. \n     We urge you to move forward with comprehensive interstate \n     waste and flow control legislation this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     George V. Voinovich,\n       Governor of Ohio.\n     John Engler,\n       Governor of Michigan.\n     Tom Ridge,\n       Governor of Pennsylvania.\n     Christine Todd Whitman,\n       Governor of New Jersey.\n     Frank O'Bannon,\n       Governor of Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8619-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8619-S8620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GENETIC DISCRIMINATION\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to address a critical \nissue that we, as a nation, must face--the fear of discrimination in \nhealth insurance practices based on our increasing ability to gather \ngenetic information about ourselves and our families.\n  The tremendous advances in genetics research spawned by the Human \nGenome project are opening the door to a greater understanding of the \nunderlying causes of human disease. The revolution in genetics is \ngiving hope to millions of Americans that we will see eventual \ntreatments, and ultimately cures, for some of the most devastating \ngenetic diseases. Yet, our ability to predict what diseases individuals \nmay be at risk for in the future has caused great concern that this \npowerful information--the information we all carry in our genes--may be \nused against us.\n  I am deeply troubled when I hear from the Tennessee Breast Cancer \nCoalition that genetic counselors are facing women every day who are \nafraid of the consequences of genetic testing. Women are avoiding \ngenetic testing due to concerns about loss of health insurance coverage \nfor themselves or their families--even though a genetic test might \nreveal that a woman is not at high risk and therefore allow her to make \nmore informed health care choices.\n  As a physician and researcher, I am particularly concerned that the \nfear of discrimination will prevent individuals from participating in \nresearch studies or taking advantage of new genetic technologies to \nimprove their medical care.\n  Scientific advances hold the promise of higher quality medical care, \nyet only Federal legislation can reassure the public that learning this \ninformation is safe. I was encouraged by President Clinton's recent \npress conference on genetic discrimination, July 14, 1997 which \nassisted in elevating this issue to the public's attention. While I am \ncurrently not a cosponsor of any specific legislative proposal, I am \ncommitted to developing a bipartisan legislative solution. I look \nforward to working with Senator Jeffords and my fellow colleagues on \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee--as well as Senators \nMack, Snowe, Domenici, and the many other Members who have been \ndedicated to this issue.\n  In my role as chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health and \nSafety, I strongly support the intent of legislation which would \nprohibit discrimination in health insurance against healthy individuals \nand their families based on their genetic information. We all carry \ngenetic mutations that may place us at risk for future disease--\ntherefore we are all at risk for discrimination. If I receive a genetic \ntest which shows I am at risk for cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, \nshould this\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\npredictive information be used against me or my family? Particularly \nwhen I am currently healthy and, in fact, may never develop the \nillness? I think the American public has answered quite clearly, \n``no.''\n  As a physician I believe in preventive medicine to avert illness for \npatients. Similarly, as a policymaker, I believe in ``preventive \nlegislation'' in this case--to avert widespread discrimination by \nstepping in now--before genetic information is used in certain health \ninsurance practices and before genetic technologies are used in routine \nmedical practice.\n  Finally, I believe that, in order to fully address genetic \ndiscrimination, we must tackle comprehensive legislation on the \nconfidentiality of medical records--legislation that encompasses all of \nour health information. We must examine who should have access to \nsensitive health information and to whom it should be disclosed. As \nthis important debate continues in the 105th Congress, I am committed \nto ensuring that we craft legislation that protects patient \nconfidentiality, fosters medical research, and maintains a dynamic \nhealth care system.\n  Only with these measures can we ensure that knowledge about our \ngenetic heritage will be used to improve our health--and not force us \nto hide in fear that this information will cause us harm.\n  I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in examining these issues \nand moving forward in the coming months on these critical pieces of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8619-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO CAPT. FREDRIC G. LEEDER, USN--PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Capt. \nFrederic G. Leeder, USN, upon his retirement from the United States \nNavy, after 28 years of distinguished and dedicated service to our \nnation.\n  Captain Leeder is a native son of Ohio and graduated from Ohio State \nUniversity with a degree in journalism. Following his graduation from \ncollege, Captain Leeder was commissioned as an Ensign. After his \ngraduation from the officers' program at the Defense Department's \nInformation School, he then assumed a variety of public-affairs \nassignments overseas and stateside. His tours of duty included a North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization staff assignment and four joint-service \nassignments.\n  Most recently, Captain Leeder served as Staff Director for Public \nAffairs at Headquarters, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in Alexandria, \nVirginia. During his three years at DLA as principal spokesperson, \nCaptain Leeder demonstrated unbounded stamina, keen insight, and \nexemplary professionalism. Possessing exceptional skill, foresight and \ncomposure, Captain Leeder dealt with representatives of the print and \nelectronic media, engaging them on his terms. In just one example, last \nfall he competently worked with investigative reporters from a \nprominent news magazine and a major television network to ensure \naccuracy and fairness of nationwide reporting on a sensitive issue \nhaving significant national security implications. With his intelligent \nforesight and strong voice of reason, Captain Leeder, advised three \ndifferent DLA directors, each from a different service I might add, on \nhow to navigate through the often perilous waters of media and \ncommunity relations\n  Captain Leeder succeeded in striking that delicate balance of \nensuring the American public's right to know and protecting the public \ninterest throughout his career. An accomplished communicator, he truly \nhas earned the gratitude of thousands of military families that have \nfound comfort and reassurance in his words when loved ones serving on \ndistant seas and shores have been in harm's way. Captain Leeder has \nserved his country for 28 years with valor, loyalty, and integrity, \nwinning the personal and professional respect of all who come in \ncontact with him. Captain Fred Leeder is a master of his craft.\n  On the occasion of Captain Leeder's retirement from the U.S. Navy, I \noffer my congratulations and thanks to this esteemed son of the Buckeye \nstate, and wish him well in his future pursuits. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8620-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT A. STARR\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRobert A. Starr, Chair of the Vermont House Agriculture Committee and \ntrue Vermonter. I pay this tribute in recognition of Mr. Starr's \nunyielding support for the Northeast Dairy Compact, which on August 20, \n1997, provides the first over-order payments so desperately needed by \nVermont's dairy farmers.\n  ``Bobby'', as he is known far and wide throughout Vermont, has given \nlifelong public service to the Vermont agricultural community. Raised \non a dairy farm during and after the Second World War, knowledge of \nhard times and a capacity for hard-bitten labor were ingrained in \nBobby, traits which continue to distinguish the character of our hill \nfarmers. After schooling at Vermont Technical College, Bobby followed \nthe lead of his grandfather and became a member of the Vermont House of \nRepresentatives in 1979.\n  Bobby became a member of the House Agriculture Committee his first \nyear, and has been there ever since. He became Chair in 1987, and has \nsponsored and provided leadership on a host of initiatives to promote \nthe interests of Vermont agriculture. Bobby has lent his leadership to \nthe variety of Vermont's agricultural pursuits, but it is the dairy \nindustry which has remained at the heart of his vision. Certainly \nBobby's upbringing and his strong dairy farm constituency provide the \nfoundation of his knowledge and commitment to the interests of the \nState's dairy farmers. Yet his vision is broader than just his home \ndistrict, and indeed has expanded beyond the boarders of Vermont to all \nof New England.\n  It is this unique expansive vision which spawned the dairy compact. \nMany of us in this body are intimately familiar with the dairy compact, \nyet few of us may know that the dairy compact was originally sponsored \nby Bobby Starr in the Vermont Legislature in 1989.\n  Few initiatives in my memory have sparked such a vigorous policy \ndebate as the dairy compact. I am proud to have sponsored the compact \non behalf of all by colleagues from the New England delegation. \nAdoption of the compact could not have happened without their hard work \nhere in Congress, and without the years of dedicated work of a \nveritable army of compact supporters from throughout New England.\n  In all, the compact reflects the true spirit of commitment to our \ndairy farmers. The compact's first payment is a tribute to the hard \nwork and the tireless commitment of Bobby Starr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8620-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8620-S8621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WV AMERICORPS PROJECTS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nthe West Virginia Americorps Program for their outstanding service and \naccomplishments. Currently, 500 Americorps members work at nearly 100 \nsites throughout West Virginia. Americorps programs strive to extend \nand promote education for children of all socioeconomic backgrounds and \nto fulfill basic needs, such as, food, shelter, and health care, for \nWest Virginians. By working together with the community, the members of \nAmericorps search for solutions to improve the quality of life and \nexpand opportunities for individuals who are less fortunate.\n  Helping individuals become more independent and self-sufficient are \ngoals of Americorps. To help people with multiple sclerosis, the West \nVirginia chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and \nAmericorps members provide friendly home visits, organize peer support \ngroups, and help them with their daily chores.\n  The Energy Express Americorps opens new doors and expands the \npossibilities for children of West Virginia. This 6-week summer \nlearning program provides nutritious meals, a safe learning \nenvironment, and positive role models. While developing a strong \nrelationship between students and mentors, the children improve their \nreading skills. With the support of the community and the involvement \nand attention of parents and volunteers, children's self esteem is \nincreasing and their reading skills are improving.\n  Throughout the mountains of West Virginia, homes need constant care \nand attention. My colleagues know that floods, violent storms, and \nother uncontrollable factors can cause homes to deteriorate more \nrapidly. My State is\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nfortunate enough to have organizations like the Southern Appalachian \nLabor School, Fayette Environmentally Safe Housing, and Americorps \nvolunteers to repair and remodel homes for low income families. With \nproject partners and community support, West Virginia families may live \nin a safe, clean environment.\n  Another Americorps program, Project HEALTH [Health Education \nAssociates Learning to Teach Health], encourages healthy diets and \nlifestyles while increasing public awareness on health issues. Through \na learn and serve america higher education grant, Project HEALTH and \nAmericorps volunteers have a profound impact on rural communities. As a \nresult of their hard work, communities have reduced illnesses and \ninjuries, increased immunizations for children, improved the diets for \nhigh risk individuals, and reduced the number of low birth weight \nbabies.\n  While working class families struggle to find adequate child care and \naffordable health insurance, the cost of living rises. Parents must \nprovide more than the basic needs for their families. However, with the \naid of the Regional Family Resource Network and Americorps, these \nservices become a reality. Immunizations, developmental screening, and \nafter school services are available to families in Kanawha, Clay, and \nBoone counties in West Virginia. Preventive medicine, medical \nattention, and a safe environment for children after school are vital \nto raising healthy children.\n  To help victims of domestic violence, the West Virginia Coalition \nAgainst Domestic Violence provides food and shelter, legal assistance, \nsupport, and counseling. With the assistance of Americorps volunteers, \nthere are programs in Beckley, Charleston, Elkins, Huntington, Keyser, \nLewisburg, Morgantown, Sutton, Welch, Wheeling, and Williamson. \nEmergency hot lines, resources, and counseling services are offered by \nthe coalition also. Educating women about the warning signals and \nteaching them ways to avoid violent situations can prevent abusive \nbehavior and possibly death. In West Virginia, there are twelve \nshelters providing services to victims.\n  Finally, I'd like to thank all the volunteers and employees who \ndedicate their lives to public service, and I'd like to thank the \ncommunity for their support and involvement in Americorps projects. \nYour time and effort are greatly appreciated by all. With your help, \nour state has been able to improve the quality of life for West \nVirginians and to increase the opportunities for them in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8620-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RETIREMENT OF DR.

Dr. Lesher, who was chosen as president of the Chamber in \n1975 as served the Chamber with both pride and dignity for over 21 \nyears.

His work on behalf of \nthe business community in promoting common sense reforms and tax cuts \nhas benefitted the entire country.\n  Dr. Lesher has served the business community with true integrity.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to wish Dr. Lesher great \nsuccess in his future endeavors. I know that he will continue to \ncontribute his time and talent to his fellow man even in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8621-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SONY FEST '97\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to commend the Sony \nTechnology Center as it celebrates 25 years of success and partnership \nin San Diego.\n  In honor of this milestone, Sony is holding a four-day gala, Sony \nFest '97. Scheduled events include the grand opening of the Technology \nCenter's newest building (nicknamed ``genesis''), a keynote address by \nSony Corporation President Nobuyuki Idei, business and technical \nsymposiums, even carnival activities for children and families. Sony \nFest '97 promises to be quite a party!\n  Sony began in San Diego by constructing a color television assembly \nplant in 1972, making it the first Japanese electronics company to \nestablish television production in the United States. Sony has been \ngoing full steam ahead in San Diego ever since. Today, 25 million \ntelevision picture tubes, 14 million ``Made in San Diego'' televisions, \nand almost $500 million in capital investments later, Sony continues to \nexplore new horizons. It now manufactures a variety of electronic \nproducts from its trademark Trinitron televisions to computer picture \ntubes and peripherals. In fact, Sony San Diego is currently the only \nU.S. manufacturer of Computer cathode ray tubes or CRTs.\n  Although an international company, Sony takes pride in its efforts to \nrespond to local and national concerns. Where possible, Sony buys and \nsells domestically, if not locally. For example, Sony estimates that 90 \npercent of the materials used in its television picture tubes come from \ndomestic sources, and that 80 percent of finished Trinitron sets \nmanufactured in North America are sold in the U.S. Sony San Diego is \nalso very active in the community and in the fight for more \nenvironmentally friendly business practices.\n  I think all in San Diego would agree: Sony is a great neighbor. For \n25 years its presence has helped make San Diego a better place to live, \nwork and conduct business. It is a pleasure to come to the Senate today \nand wish all involved a very enjoyable Sony Fest '97.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8621-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO OUTSTANDING SENATE STAFFER BYRA KITE\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nman who has dedicated his time, efforts and immeasurable talents to \nWyoming politics. I am speaking of Byra Kite, whom I have known and \nrespected for many years, and have had the pleasure of having as a \nmember of my staff since I joined the Senate in 1994.\n  Byra is retiring, and I would like to take this time to publicly \nthank him for all his hard work. He has served Wyoming well, and I am \nnot alone in saying he is one of our State's finest sons.\n  In 1965, Byra came to the Cowboy State from California to play \nfootball for the University of Wyoming. During that time, he was an \nAll-Conference and All-American member of three conference champion \nteams, including the undefeated 1967 Cowboy team that played in the \nSugar Bowl. Later this year, that team will be inducted into the \nUniversity of Wyoming Hall of Fame. Following graduation he decided to \nstay in Wyoming. In Laramie he found his home, and his passion for \npolitics.\n  He made his first foray into the national political arena in 1976 \nwhen he managed Malcolm Wallop's initial run for the Senate. Malcolm \nwon, defeating a three term incumbent senator, and Byra began a 20 year \ncareer of helping Wyoming Republicans shape their campaigns and win \nelections. His tireless work, dedication and vision broke new ground in \nterms of modern campaigning.\n  In 1977 Byra began 18 years of service as Senator Wallop's State \nDirector. During that time he helped hundreds of Wyoming folks in their \ndealings with the federal government. Following Malcolm's retirement, \nByra joined our staff, and continued his outstanding brand of public \nservice to Wyoming people. He, and his talents, will truly be missed.\n  And so, Mr. President, I am joined by Senators Wallop, Simpson, Enzi \nand Representative Barbara Cubin--all of whom have been touched by \nByra's hard work and dedication--in saying not only thank you, but good \nluck to a trusted advisor and friend. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8621-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8621-S8622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WALT DIBBLE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for most Americans, mornings are a \ntime of routines. People like to eat the same thing for breakfast, \ndrink their coffee with just the right amount of cream and sugar, and \nduck out the door at the same time every day. Over the past 40 years, a \ncentral part of the morning routine for thousands of Connecticut\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\nresidents has been the voice of Walt Dibble reading the news over the \nradio. During this time of the day where so many people are rushing \naround, Walt Dibble's calm presence served as a soothing influence that \nmade each morning more pleasant. Sadly, the mornings in Connecticut \nwill never be the same, as Mr. Walt Dibble died last week at the age of \n65.\n  A lifelong Connecticut resident, Walt Dibble was loved by all of the \npeople in the state who listened to him. It didn't matter if they \nworked as a school teacher in Manchester, in the Inventory Control \nDivision of Pratt & Whitney, or as a financial analyst in Hartford, all \nof Walt Dibble's listeners felt that he was a man whom they could \nrelate to and whom they could trust.\n  Walt Dibble was an institution in Connecticut radio. For the past 20 \nyears, Mr. Dibble was the voice of WTIC news in Hartford, where he was \nthe News Director and Managing Editor. Hartford was familiar with Walt \nDibble even before he came to WTIC, since he had worked for 10 years at \nHartford's WDRC radio station. Before coming to Hartford, Walt had been \nthe radio voice of the news in New Haven and Bridgeport.\n  Throughout his career he was always quick to pick up a microphone and \nhit the street to cover a breaking news story. And it was in these \nsituations that Walt Dibble flourished. His colleagues always marveled \nat his ability to deliver extended live coverage of major news events \nwithout any script as a safety net. Whether it was covering the \ncollapse of the Hartford Civic Center roof, Hurricane Gloria, or the \ndebate over the state income tax in 1991, he always kept his cool and \noffered a professional news report that, in many cases, he made up as \nhe went along.\n  People may have wondered why Walt Dibble always seemed more sincere \nthan other newscasters. The reason probably stems from the fact that \nWalt Dibble reported the news in his own words that came from his own \nmind and his own heart.\n  Walt Dibble loved his profession, and he was a father figure for \nhundreds of Connecticut broadcasters. He treated the interns at the \nradio station with the same respect as lifelong colleagues, and he \nwould always encourage them to embark on a career in radio. Mr. Dibble \nbrought a similar approach to the classes he taught at the Connecticut \nSchool of Broadcasting and Southern Connecticut State University. He \ndid not need to teach, but he did so because he wanted to pass the \ntorch on to future broadcasters.\n  In this day and age where most people get their news from television, \nand more and more radio stations are broadcasting nationally syndicated \nradio shows, Walt Dibble was a throwback to an era when the radio was \nthe place where people went to get their local news. While it will be \ndifficult for anyone to deliver the news with the style and grace of \nWalt Dibble, I only hope that somebody will carry on his tradition of \nexcellence in broadcasting to ensure that Connecticut residents will \nstill be able to receive local news, on local radio stations, from \nlocal broadcasters whom they know and trust.\n  Walt Dibble lived a truly charmed life. He interviewed Presidents of \nthe United States, he saw his son pitch in the World Series, and for \nmore than 40 years he got to go to work to do a job that he loved. But \nin the end, it is the people of Connecticut who are charmed for having \nknown this great man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8621-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CELEBRATING OLDSMOBILE'S CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to honor Oldsmobile on the \noccasion of its centennial anniversary. On August 20, 1997, Oldsmobile \nand its employees will celebrate 100 years of outstanding achievements.\n  Few things have become so entwined with American culture as the \nautomobile. Since its creation, cars have fascinated us. While the \nability to travel has changed drastically in the last 100 years, one \ntenent has remained: the desire to go further and faster.\n  Helping fuel this desire is Oldsmobile. This company and its workers \nhave been central to the development of the automobile. From Ransom E. \nOlds' Curved Dash to today's Intrigue, Oldsmobile continues to innovate \nand revolutionize the industry. Every individual involved with the \norganization strives to create a better product. In doing so, the \ncompany has given Americans the ability to do more, to see more, and to \npursue new experiences. The vision of R.E. Olds has stretched far \nbeyond Lansing. His legacy will be forever remembered.\n  This celebration is especially personal for me, Mr. President. My \nfather worked on the production line in Lansing for nearly 20 years. \nOldsmobile gave my father the chance to provide for his family. During \nhis tenure at Oldsmobile, he demonstrated to me the importance of hard \nwork, dedication, and a pursuit of excellence; values I am proud to \nemulate.\n  Again, I extend my most heartfelt congratulations on this momentous \noccasion. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8622-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE ROMA RESTAURANT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, spring has always been known as a \nseason of rebirth, but, sadly, the Spring of 1997 saw the passing of \none of the true culinary landmarks of Washington, D.C. as the Roma \nRestaurant closed its doors after 77 years.\n  In the days since the Roma closed, the local newspapers have been \nfilled with articles and letters to the editor paying tribute to the \nWashington institution. All of the writers had different memories of \nwhat made the Roma so special to them. For some it was the outdoor \ncourtyard with the elaborate garden and grape arbor. For others it was \nthe unique experience of dining amongst stuffed tigers, lions, and \nother wild game that Roma founder Frank Abbo had killed on safari. For \nsome people it was simply the linguine with clam sauce.\n  But for everyone who frequented the Roma, there are fond memories of \nthe wonderful people who worked at this restaurant and made it such an \nenjoyable place to spend an afternoon or an evening.\n  Patrons of the Roma have described members of the Abbo family, who \nowned and operated the Roma since it was founded in 1920, as having the \nbiggest hearts in Washington.\n  While most restaurants are closed for Thanksgiving and Christmas, the \nRoma was always open, as the Abbos cooked countless turkeys and \nprepared thousands of meals over the years for unfortunate people who \ncould not afford to buy a warm holiday meal.\n  The Roma was not just a business. It was more like a club where \nfriends would meet regularly to get together and enjoy some good food \nand have a good time.\n  Whenever I dined at the Roma, it felt like going to dinner at a \nfriend's house. In a sense, it was, since the Roma's owner, Bobby Abbo \nhas been a friend of mine for many years. But while I know that my \nfriendship with Bobby will persevere and I will continue to see him, I \nwill surely miss the many friendly faces that I may no longer see now \nthat the Roma has closed. It would be impossible for me to remember all \nof the people whom I befriended at the Roma. However, I would \nspecifically like to mention Maria Amaya, Hugo Terzi, and John Squitero \nand thank them for the kindness that they extended toward me over the \nyears.\n  In closing, I will miss the gardens, and I will miss the food. But, \nmost important, I will miss the people that made the Roma such a \nspecial place. I wish all of them well, and I thank them for all of the \nwonderful memories they have provided me and so many others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8622-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8622-S8623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATIONS ON THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF CLEVELAND-CLIFFS, INC.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my \ncongratulations to Mr. Thomas Moore, CEO of Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. and \nits outstanding employees on behalf of the company's 150th anniversary. \nI am honored to join them in celebrating this significant milestone.\n  For over a century now Cleveland-Cliffs has been a leader in North \nAmerican mining operations and has served as a model for other \ncompanies to emulate. It comes as no surprise that this mining company \nhas survived in a market where competition is fierce and the work \nextraordinarily difficult. Since 1847 when its founders first began \nmining iron ore in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the company has relied \nupon one\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\nbasic ingredient for success--fostering good relationships with its \nemployees and local communities.\n  I am particularly proud of the relationship Cleveland-Cliffs has \nbuilt with the State of Michigan. The Marquette Iron Range located in \nthe Upper Peninsula has been a tremendous boost to the area's economy \nand Cleveland-Cliffs has continually demonstrated its community \nactivism by infusing funds into the surrounding area. For example, the \ncompany generously provides ``Legacy Grants'' to local organizations \nand schools. These charitable acts offer just one example of the many \nways in which Cleveland-Cliffs cares for the local community. I applaud \ntheir efforts and encourage other companies to follow their exemplary \nlead.\n  Mr. President, this sesquicentennial celebration of Cleveland-Cliffs, \nInc founding marks a remarkable achievement. I am pleased to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Moore and the employees of Cleveland-\nCliffs on celebrating this auspicious occasion and extend my best \nwishes for much continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8622-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDIA'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \npeople of India, as they prepare to commemorate the 50th anniversary of \ntheir nation's independence from Britain. Led by Mahatma Gandhi, whose \nphilosophy and practice of nonviolent civil disobedience was the \ncornerstone of the people of India's campaign, their long struggle for \nself-rule came to a triumphant end on August 15, 1947. The victory won \nby the people of India served as a model for American civil rights \nleaders, like Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and inspired oppressed \nand disenfranchised people throughout the world. For these and many \nother reasons, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senate \nResolution 102, which designates August 15, 1997, as ``Indian \nIndependence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Indian and American \nDemocracy.''\n  The Golden Anniversary of India's independence provides people of \nIndian descent with an opportunity to celebrate the immeasurable \nachievements they have made in their homeland and in countries \nthroughout the world. There are vital Indian communities from China to \nMichigan. In fact, Michigan's Indian-American community is one of the \nleading ethnic groups in my home State, and its members have made \nimportant contributions to the local economy and culture. Many of \nMichigan's Indian-Americans are professionals who play key roles in \nsectors like the automotive industry and the field of medicine. Many \nothers are entrepreneurs, and Indian-Americans in Michigan own more \nthan 600 businesses with thousands of employees.\n  Indian-Americans are justifiably proud of the tremendous strides \ntheir homeland has made in the last 50 years. India is the world's \nlargest democracy, with nearly 1 billion people. With a middle class of \napproximately 250 million, India is an increasingly important market \nfor American goods. India's economy has been advancing rapidly, with a \nlarge stock market and strong high-tech enterprises like aircraft and \nautomobile manufacturing, a computer industry, and its own space \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, the 50th anniversary of India's independence provides \nan opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation to the Indian-\nAmerican community. I know my colleagues join me in recognizing the \nprofound contributions Indian-Americans have made to American society, \nand in offering congratulations to the people of India and their \ndescendants throughout the world who are celebrating this important \ndate in history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8623-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF INDIA\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the people of \nIndia on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of India's \nindependence.\n  Independence days, like birthdays, are for celebrating. And we have \nmuch to celebrate in United States-India relations. The friendship \nbetween the Indian and American people today is stronger and more \ndeeply rooted than ever--deeply rooted because it is based on shared \nvalues, and strong because it is shared by more Indians and more \nAmericans than ever before.\n  The friendship between the United States and India is a friendship \nthat goes back to the beginnings of the American Nation. In fact, the \nfirst Asian Indian-American is said to have come to the United States \n200 years ago.\n  It is a friendship that was strengthened when the United States \nsupported Indian independence in 1947. It was strengthened again when \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi during the \nAmerican civil rights movement. And it was strengthened most recently \nwhen India embarked on its bold strategy of economic openness.\n  It is a friendship based on mutual respect and understanding--\nunderstanding that the problems we face are mutual problems. In a \nshrinking world, India's challenges and India's successes are also \nthose of the United States. Because radicalism and terrorism threaten \nall civilized countries, especially democracies. Because in a world \neconomy, one nation cannot long prosper while its neighbors do not.\n  India and the United States stand on the threshold of a new era. In \njust the past few years, India has flung open its doors to the world, \nand emerged as a rising star on the world scene. We should commit \nourselves to continue the progress of recent years.\n  We have a great advantage in this effort. It is the Indian-American \ncommunity. Indian-Americans are the magnet that will keep India and the \nUnited States moving closer together, making our friendship worthy of \nthe world's largest and oldest democracies.\n  Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of a resolution in the Senate \ndesignating August 15, 1997 as ``Indian Independence Day: A National \nDay of Celebration of Indian and American Democracy.'' This resolution \nreaffirms the democratic principles on which the United States and \nIndia were established, and it requests that the President issue a \nproclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe \nthe day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And to the people of \nIndia, Indian-Americans, and all those who support the ideals of \nliberty and democracy, I wish you a happy independence day!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8623-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8623-S8624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    VOTE JUSTIFICATION--AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my votes \non the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. This legislation, which is \nevery bit as important as the Farm bill passed by Congress in 1996, was \nacted upon and quickly passed last week.\n  The first amendment considered by the Senate was an effort by Senator \nDurbin to deny crop insurance to tobacco growers. This legislation also \nprohibited payments for tobacco under the Non-Insured Disaster \nAssistance Program.\n  Mr. President, in fiscal year 1996, the federal government spent $69 \nmillion for net losses on tobacco crop insurance. The dangers of this \ncommodity have become abundantly clear in recent years, and while I \nunderstand that crop insurance is an invaluable tool for today's \nfarmers, I am troubled by the government support of a product which is \nresponsible for thousands of deaths every year. For that reason, I \nvoted against the motion to table the Durbin amendment. Unfortunately, \nthe amendment was tabled on a 53-47 vote.\n  After this vote, the Senate turned to consideration of a Helms \namendment to increase the tax on ethanol by 3 cents per gallon. The \nfunds raised from this tax were to be set aside to fund an anti-smoking \ntrust fund. Regardless of the ultimate destination, this account was to \nbe funded by a substantial tax increase on fuel. At a time when \nAmericans are already fighting to keep every dollar they earn, I refuse \nto support another tax increase. Therefore, I supported the motion to \ntable the Helms amendment and it was overwhelmingly defeated by a 76-24 \nmargin.\n  Shortly after disposing of the Helms amendment, a Harkin amendment to \nincrease funding by $29 million for enforcement efforts to prevent kids \nfrom smoking was debated. The amendment would have fully funded a \nprogram\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nwhich was established to punish establishments that sell tobacco to \nindividuals under 18 years of age. While I support efforts to curb \nunderage smoking, this amendment sought to impose a new, $34 million \ndollar tax on smokers. In light of the tobacco tax increase already \nadopted in the budget agreement, and considering the penalties expected \nin the tobacco settlement, I believe Senator Harkin's additional tax \nwas excessive and I voted to support the 52-48 tabling vote.\n  The next amendment considered was a Bryan amendment to reduce the \namount of funds appropriated to the Market Access Program [MAP]. \nIdentical to the one offered on the fiscal year 1997 appropriations \nbill, the Bryan amendment would have eliminated funding of MAP if the \naggregate amount of funds and value of commodities under the program \nexceeded $70,000,000. Formerly known as the Market Promotion Program, \nMAP has provided funding for large, lucrative corporations. I believe \nthe Market Access Program is a clear example of corporate welfare, and \nI have consistently supported elimination or reduction of this \nunnecessary government subsidy. I supported Senator Bryan's amendment \nwhich was tabled by a vote of 59-40.\n  A vote on a Grams amendment to complete a comprehensive economic \nevaluation of the Northeast Dairy Compact was scheduled to follow the \nBryan amendment, but was instead adopted by unanimous consent. The \ncompact allows dairy producers in the Northeast to artificially set \nminimum prices for dairy products within the region. I have \nconsistently opposed the new bureaucracy established by the Compact and \nwas pleased to be a cosponsor of the Grams amendment.\n  Following disposition of these three amendments, the 1998 Agriculture \nappropriations bill was passed, with my support, by a vote of 99-0. I \nurge the conferees to act quickly to finalize this legislation and once \nagain demonstrate America s commitment to its farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8623-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8624-S8625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING CONNECTICUT'S BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to six \nelementary schools from my home state of Connecticut whose achievements \nhave earned them the honor of being named blue ribbon schools. The blue \nribbon schools program was established in 1982 to honor the best \nelementary and secondary schools in the country. This program promotes \nexcellence in education by providing national recognition to a diverse \ngroup of schools that display an uncommon ability to help their \nstudents to reach their potential.\n  These blue ribbon schools, with their varied socioeconomic, \ngeographic, and educational needs, prove that, with the right tools, \nall of our schools can be successful. They display the qualities of \nexcellence that are necessary to prepare our young children for the \nchallenges of the next century. Their formula for success is no secret. \nEach has strong leadership, a sense of mission, parental involvement, \nhigh quality teaching, and high standards and high expectations for \neach and every student.\n  It is important that we make every child in this country believe in \nthemselves, and blue ribbon schools are challenging our students to try \nharder and demand more from themselves.\n  Of the 76,000 elementary schools across the country, only 263 are \nhonored as blue ribbon schools, and I am proud of the fact that all six \nnominated schools from Connecticut were chosen to be honored. These six \nschools from Connecticut are Ellen B. Hubble Elementary School in \nBristol, Highland Elementary School in Chesire, East Farms School in \nFarmington, the Center School in Litchfield, the Peck Place School in \nLitchfield, and West District School in Unionville. Each is different \nand unique, but they hold in common a commitment to helping all their \nstudents achieve high standards. I would like to briefly mention some \nof the unique accomplishments of each of these schools.\n  Ellen P. Hubble School in Bristol is a center for innovation in \neducation, where learning is fun. The school brings excitement to \nlearning by developing building-wide themes. In the past, the school \nhas been transformed into a farm, a forest, and a circus, and the \nchildren have responded by bringing uncommon enthusiasm to their \nschoolwork. The students of Ellen P. Hubble have also been very active \nin their community. Through the random acts of kindness and make a \ndifference day program, students have worked on activities ranging from \nsupporting a shelter for battered women to providing help for Bosnian \nrefugees.\n  Highland Elementary School is a reflection of the town of Cheshire's \ndedication to provide each young person with a nurturing, motivating, \nand enjoyable learning environment. Highland Elementary has formed a \ncollaborative intervention team, composed of teachers and \nadministrators, whose role is to identify and address the complex needs \nof each individual student. The teachers set high standards for their \nstudents, but the results have shown that great teaching inspires \nactive learning. In addition, Highland is a member of the national \nnetwork of Partnership 2000 schools, which fosters home-school \npartnerships.\n  The East Farms School in Farmington is centered around the belief \nthat all children are capable of becoming skillful, lifelong learners. \nThe staff works within collaborative teams which develop an engaging \ninter-disciplinary curriculum. East Farms is the first school in \nConnecticut to establish their own publishing center. For 3 years, \nparents have assisted children and teachers in the publication of over \n1,000 original books each year. This effort has not only brought \nstudents, parents, and teachers together in a learning exercise, it has \nalso reinforced the value and importance of written work.\n  At the Center School in Litchfield, lessons are planned around \nstudent inquiry, and teachers serve as facilitators rather than \nlecturers. In addition, students at the Center School are taught that \nthe best way to solve a problem is by cooperating with others, and \nstudents are instilled with a strong sense of community. The school has \nbeen at the forefront of instructional reform, and the school's \nthematically arranged, interdisciplinary units of instruction have been \nhailed as exemplary by local, state, and national educators. The Center \nSchool was the first elementary school in Connecticut to be accredited \nby the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, and they \nrecently received the Connecticut Award for Excellence.\n  Teachers are at the center of efforts to provide children with a \nquality education at the Peck Place School in Orange. This school has \ninvested in highly-qualified staff with 92 percent of the staff holding \nadvanced degrees. Beyond an excellent traditional elementary schools \ncurriculum, Peck Place also offers both French and Spanish to its \nstudents. Students and parents are enthusiastic partners in this \neffort. The Peck Place School proves a strong learning environment \nleads to improved performance by students. Connecticut mastery test \nscores have shown significant improvement in every grade, and grade \nfour scores have jumped from 25 percent meeting or exceeding the State \ngoals in 1993 to 74 percent in 1995.\n  West District School in Unionville is a true neighborhood school \nwhere nearly half of the students walk to school every day, and many of \nthem are the children of former students. West District is committed to \nthe belief that all students are capable of learning at a high level if \nyou nurture each student's special strengths. West District has formed \na school development council, made up of teachers, staff, and parents, \nto work on ways to improve the school and to develop priorities for \neach school year. Last year the school chose to focus its efforts on \naddressing the needs of low-performing students, and the school worked \ndiligently to bridge the gap between their most successful students and \nthose who struggle with their classwork. The results have been \nsuccessful as the vast majority of students are now performing at the \nhigh levels. West District boasts some of the highest Connecticut \nMastery scores in the State, with 84 percent of sixth graders and 80 \npercent of fourth graders reaching the excellent level on the \nConnecticut mastery test in math. In addition, 80 percent of sixth \ngraders achieved excellence in reading and 75 percent of fourth graders \nreached the excellence level in writing.\n  Once again I would like to congratulate these six schools for being \nhonored\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\nas blue ribbon schools. I believe that they all serve as models for \nother schools and communities seeking to provide young students with a \nnurturing environment that will enable each child to develop into a \nlife-long learner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8624-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO CAPT. CARLTON A. SIMMONS, JR., USN (RET.)\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with the sad mission \nof reporting the loss of a truly outstanding naval officer, Capt. \nCarlton A. Simmons, Jr. He passed away on July 14 after a long illness \nand was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery on July 22.\n  A native of North Dighton, MA, and a 1974 graduate of the University \nof Massachusetts at Amherst, Captain Simmons was commissioned an ensign \nin 1975. Following designation as a naval aviator in 1977 and \nqualification in the A-7E Corsair, he served with Attack Squadron 22, \ncompleting two deployments to the western Pacific.\n  Followon tours of duty included an exchange assignment with the Air \nForce, flying F-16 Falcons with the 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron; \nand duty as flag secretary to the commander, Middle East Force in \nManama, Bahrain. Later, after training in the F/A-18 Hornet, he served \nwith Strike Fighter Squadron 113.\n  A superb leader, the Navy entrusted Captain Simmons with three \ncommand assignments--the Strike Fighter Weapons School, Pacific Fleet; \nStrike Fighter Squadron 25; and the F/A-18 Fleet Readiness Squadron, \nStrike Fighter Squadron 125. While commanding officer of VFA-125, the \nsquadron earned the Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety Award for \nsurpassing 70,000 accident-free flight hours; and Personal Excellence \nPartnership Program awards from the Chief of Naval Operations and the \nState of California.\n  Captain Simmons also served a 22-month tenure in Washington as the \nStrike Warfare and Naval Aviation Programs Congressional liaison \nofficer in the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs. In this capacity, \nCaptain Simmons provided members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the professional and personal staffs, and many of you, with \ntimely support regarding Navy plans and programs. His contributions \nenabled Congress and the Navy to work closely in ensuring the Nation \npossessed a modern and capable naval force.\n  During his illustrious career, Captain Simmons was the recipient of \nmany awards and commendations including the Legion of Merit, the \nMeritorious Service Medal with Gold Star, and the Navy Commendation \nMedal with Gold Star.\n  Mr. President, Captain Simmons, his wife Carol, and their daughters \nErin and Stacey, made many sacrifices during his long career. It is \nindeed tragic that he has been taken from his family, the Navy, and the \nNation he so selflessly served. His courage and fortitude marked him as \na great patriot. He will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8625-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO TRUMBULL, CONNECTICUT'S WE THE PEOPLE TEAM\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to the students of Trumbull High School, who recently \nwon an award at the ``We the People * * * The Citizen and the \nConstitution'' national finals in Washington, DC.\n  The ``We the People * * *'' program includes a comprehensive \ncurriculum on the history and principles of American constitutional \ndemocracy. It culminates in a competition testing student teams' \nknowledge of the Constitution, structured as a congressional hearing \nwith students testifying as constitutional experts. This innovative \napproach has received critical acclaim from educators and scholars \nalike, and the curriculum stands as a model for future educational \nprograms. Students involved in the ``We the People * * *'' program not \nonly gain an understanding of constitutional history, but many of them \nalso show a much stronger commitment to democratic principles and feel \nmore involved in the political process.\n  The students from Trumbull High School were recognized for their \nexpertise on Unit 6 ``Role of Citizen'' of the ``We the People * * *'' \ncurriculum. I'm very proud of their accomplishment, and would like to \nrecognize them all by name: Katherine Baker, Scott Baker, Heather \nBeardsley, Annette Besso, Andrew Braverman, Meredith Bryk, Christopher \nCheng, Jonathan Chin, Jessica Cohen, Vimala George, Kristy Gordon, \nTravis Halky, Stephen Henshaw, Ryan Leichsenring, Jennifer Liu, Devon \nNykaza, Nicole Perreault, Diane Perry, Anne Rackliffe, Sophia Rountos, \nRachel Simonds, and Alan Stern.\n  In February 1963, President John F. Kennedy said that ``the future \npromise of any nation can be directly measured by the present prospect \nof its youth.'' Frighteningly low voter turnout has recently raised \nconcerns about public frustration with our political system. And yet, \nwhen I had the opportunity to meet with these Trumbull high schoolers, \nI was struck by the students' optimism and thoughtfulness about our \ngreat constitutional democracy. Their strong sense of civic \nresponsibility provides me with great hope for our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8625-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO PVT. WALTER C. WETZEL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Radio \nControl Club of Detroit in paying tribute to Pvt. Walter C. Wetzel of \nthe U.S. Army 13th Infantry Brigade, 8th Infantry Division. On April 3, \n1945, Private Wetzel, a young squad leader with the antitank company of \nthe 13th Infantry, was keeping watch at his platoon's command post in \nBirken, Germany. Early in the morning, Private Wetzel detected enemy \nforces moving in to attack the post. Immediately, he alerted the \ncommand post occupants and began fighting against heavy automatic \nweapons fire. Under cover of darkness, Germans forces moved close to \nthe building and began throwing grenades. During the fighting, two \ngrenades landed in the room from which Private Wetzel and the others \nwere defending the post. With a warning to his fellow soldiers, Private \nWetzel threw himself on the grenades just before they exploded.\n  Sadly, the heroic deed of Private Wetzel cost him his life, but in so \ndoing he saved the lives of others in his division. His comrades were \nable to continue the defense of the command post while breaking the \npower of a dangerous German war front. Certainly, his sacrifice was in \nkeeping with the U.S. Army's highest traditions of bravery and heroism. \nPrivate Wetzel was laid to rest at the American Battlefield Monuments \nCommission cemetery in the Netherlands. Shortly after his death, \nPrivate Wetzel was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  In further recognition, the Radio Control Club of Detroit has \nconstructed a monument to Private Wetzel on the grounds of Wetzel State \nPark in Lenox Township of Northern Macomb County. The monument consists \nof a concrete monolith flagpole base with a bronze plaque inlaid and \ninscripted. Upon dedication, the field at which the monument will be \nplaced will be named ``Wetzel Memorial Flying Field.'' I ask the Senate \nto join this organization in remembering one of the many true American \npatriots who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8625-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8625-S8626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID L. CINI\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, any town in America can find somebody \nto run their local government. But few cities ever have a leader whose \ncourage, hope, and humor serve to inspire others to expect more from \nthemselves and their community. East Lyme was fortunate enough to know \none of these leaders--David L. Cini. Mr. Cini served as East Lyme's \nfirst selectman since 1989, and, sadly, he died earlier this month at \nthe age of 60.\n  Eight years ago, I attended a political rally for David Cini that was \nheld in a vacant lot behind a beauty salon in the small town of \nNiantic, CT, which is part of East Lyme. Also in attendance at this \nrally were Senator Joe Lieberman, Congressman Sam Gejdenson, and a host \nof other local dignitaries. Upon realizing that there were two U.S. \nSenators, a Congressman, and many other elected officials in attendance \nat this rally, I asked aloud, ``Why are all of these important people \ngathered behind a beauty salon\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nin Niantic?'' David Cini quickly stood up and responded, ``Because \nNiantic is the center of the universe, and I am going to be the first \nselectman.''\n  For David Cini, Niantic and East Lyme was the center of the universe, \nand he really loved and took pride in this town and its people. One \ntime, David cut short a week-long vacation in Florida to come back to \nEast Lyme. He said that East Lyme was the best place to live and work \nso why leave? Mr. Cini loved the city of East Lyme and his primary \nconcern as first selectman was improving the quality of life for these \npeople.\n  But while David Cini was completely committed to the people of East \nLyme, he also recognized that the interests of one town are often \nconnected to the interests of neighboring communities. He worked \ntirelessly to see that the towns in southeastern Connecticut worked \ntogether to preserve prosperity in the region. Mr. Cini was \ninstrumental in the formation of the Council of Governments, which is \ncomprised of the chief executive officers of 20 southeastern \nConnecticut towns, and he served as the council's first chairman.\n  Throughout his tenure as East Lyme's top official, Mr. Cini had to \novercome various health problems, but he always maintained a positive \nattitude, and you never saw him without a smile on his face. David was \nalways too concerned with the welfare of others to dwell on his own \npersonal interests.\n  When you ask his friends what they will remember most about David \nCini, they all mention his sense of humor. He was frequently seen \njoking with workers at Town Hall, and with his modest and unassuming \nmanner, he could always make people laugh and put them at ease.\n  His humor will be missed in Town Hall, and so will his leadership. \nDavid Cini was known and respected by his colleagues in politics, but, \nmore important, he was admired by the people that he was elected to \nrepresent.\n  He is survived by his wife Sally, seven siblings, five children, and \nfour grandchildren. I extend my heartfelt condolences to them \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8625-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8626-S8627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today our negotiators are \ngathering in Bonn, Germany to continue negotiations toward a new \nclimate treaty, so it is appropriate to address the Senate on this \nissue.\n  My comments today will focus on the issue of science, scientific \ncertainty, and scientific honesty.\n  During the Senate's debate on Friday there were some general and \nspecific comments made about climate science that were simply wrong, \nand I'd like to begin by addressing some of the general \nmisunderstandings that may exist.\n  First, some of our colleagues seem to have it in their minds that \nthere is scientific certainty and consensus over the issue of whether \nor not human activities are causing global warming. This is simply not \ntrue.\n  While it is true that Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth said that \n``the science is settled,'' it is clear that there is not a broad \nscientific consensus that human activities are causing global warming.\n  Don't take my own word for it:\n  The prestigious journal Science, in its issue of May 16th, says that \nclimate experts are a long way from proclaiming that human activities \nare heating up the earth.\n  Even Benjamin Santer, lead author of chapter 8 of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] report admits as much.\n  Here is what Dr. Santer says:\n\n       We say quite clearly that few scientists would say the \n     attribution issue was a done deal.\n\n  Indeed, the search for the ``human fingerprint'' is far from over \nwith many scientists saying that a clear resolution is at least a \ndecade away.\n  Even the Chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, Dr. Bert Bolin, says that the science is not settled. When told \nthat Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth had said the science was \nsettled, Dr. Bolin replied: ``I've spoken to [Tim Wirth], I know he \ndoesn't mean it.''\n  Mr. President, the science is not settled. We continue to spend over \n$2 billion on the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program for the \nsimple reason that the science is not settled.\n  We know human activities result in carbon emissions. We also know \nthat land-based records indicate that some warming has occurred. We do \nnot know that one has caused the other.\n  Let me now turn to some specific statements that were made during the \ndebate last Friday that simply don't agree with the latest scientific \nliterature:\n  My good friend, Senator Kerry, said (on page S8118 of the \nCongressional Record) that the ``global average temperature has changed \nby less than a degree Celsius up or down for 10,000 years--[and that] \nthe projected warming is expected to exceed any climate change that has \noccurred during the history of civilization.''\n  Unfortunately, the facts simply don't match up with Senator Kerry's \nstatement. According to data from the Woods Hole Oceanographic \nInstitution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, temperatures were up to \n3 deg.C higher than present values some 2500-3000 years ago. \n(Reference: L. Keigwin, Science, volume 274, p. 1504-1508, 1996.)\n  In addition, independent studies using a different set of data \nindicate abrupt worldwide changes in temperature about 8000 years ago. \n(Reference: Stager and Mayewski, Science, volume 276, p. 1834, 1997.)\n  Another statement made by Senator Kerry (on page S8137 of the \nCongressional Record) claims that ``. . . we are living in the midst of \nthe most significant increase that we have seen in 130 years, and the \nevidence of the prognosis of our best scientists is that it is going to \ncontinue at a rate that is greater than anything we have known since \nhumankind, since civilization has existed, civilization within the last \n8,000 to 10,000 years on this planet.''\n  Well, the facts are somewhat different. The most significant \ntemperature increase in the last 130 years occurred between 1900 and \n1940, and is generally believed to be a natural warming, a recovery \nfrom the Little Ice Age.\n  In pointing these facts out, it is not my contention that Senator \nKerry is trying to mislead anyone. He is merely repeating some of the \ninformation that has been provided to him by his staff or others, and I \nknow he believes them to be correct.\n  But they are not correct.\n  I believe this makes my point that there is a great deal of \nmisunderstanding about this issue, in addition to the lack of \nscientific certainty I alluded to earlier.\n  I'd like to briefly turn my attention to a few statements made by \nothers outside the Senate about the science of Climate Change.\n  When I opened the newspaper on Saturday I was amused to see the level \nof ``spin control'' that some were attempting with respect to the \nSenate's actions of Friday.\n  Indeed, on page A11 of Saturday's Washington Post, in an article by \nHelen Dewar, I read that Phillip Clapp, the President of the \nEnvironmental Information Center, said the Byrd resolution ``endorses \nthe science on global warming . . .''\n  Well, I hope the public and the press will follow the wise counsel of \nSenator Byrd and allow the resolution to speak for itself.\n  Indeed, the resolution does not say anything about endorsing the \nscience of global warming.\n  If it had, it would not have passed the Senate at all . . . much less \nthan by a vote of 95-0.\n  Special interest groups will, I suppose, do their best to advance \ntheir special interests. But we should demand a certain level of \nintegrity and scientific honesty in our public debate of this issue.\n  This brings me to the final issue that I wish to address today--the \nissue of scientific honesty and integrity.\n  As pointed out above, there is a great deal of scientific uncertainty \nabout climate change. Well respected, highly qualified scientific \nexperts disagree over this issue.\n  The hearings held before the Energy Committee, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and the Environment and Public Works Committee have all \nfeatured solid, respected scientists--some of whom question the link \nbetween human activities and a warming planet.\n  Before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee which I chair, Dr.\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\nSallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for astrophysics \nquestioned the link between human activities and climate change.\n  Before the Environment and Public Works Committee, Dr. Richard S. \nLindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, pointed out problems with the \nGeneral Circulation Models that are the basis for the predictions of \nwarming.\n  My Committee also heard from Dr. V. Ram Ramanathan of the Scripps \nInstitute of Oceanography, about the role of water vapor as a \nconfounding factor in these models.\n  In the Environment and Public Works Committee, Dr. John R. Christy of \nthe Earth System Science Laboratory at the University of Alabama in \nHuntsville discussed the satellite temperature records that conflict \nwith ground-based data.\n  Before the Foreign Relations Committee, Dr. Patrick Michaels, \nprofessor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia, \ndirectly challenged the links between human activities and observed \nwarming.\n  These are all respected scientists. They are not crackpots, nay-\nsayers, or as some press accounts have branded them, a ``small and \nnoisy band of skeptics.''\n  Instead, they are scientists, doing what scientists do. Consistent \nwith the scientific method, they are challenging the findings of other \nscientists, in an open, intellectually honest manner, using all the \ndata and analysis that they can bring to bear.\n  That is how the system is supposed to work.\n  Unfortunately, the proponents of the view that we must take extreme \nactions now to address climate change have been attacking the \ncredibility and the reputations of some scientists who do not share \ntheir view.\n  Instead of attacking their science, they attack the scientist.\n  They claim that scientists who disagree with the so-called consensus \nview of climate change are part of some kind of anti-science \nconspiracy, funded by big oil and big coal to deliberately mislead the \nAmerican public.\n  That sounds silly, doesn't it?\n  Yet, on the Diane Rehm radio program which aired locally on WAMU-FM \non July 21, a prominent guest made some pretty remarkable assertions. \nLet me quote from the transcript of this radio interview:\n       . . . it's an unhappy fact that the oil companies and the \n     coal companies in the United States have joined in a \n     conspiracy to hire pseudo scientists to deny the facts . . . \n     the energy companies need to be called to account because \n     what they are doing is un-American in the most basic sense. \n     They are compromising our future by misrepresenting the facts \n     by suborning scientists onto their payrolls and attempting to \n     mislead the American people.\n  A ``conspiracy,'' Mr. President.\n  ``Pseudo scientists.''\n  ``A deliberate attempt to mislead the American people.''\n  ``Un-American.''\n  These are serious charges.\n  Who was the guest who was making these charges of a conspiracy \ndesigned to deliberately mislead the American people?\n  Was this guest calling Dr. Lindzen a pseudo scientist? Or Dr. \nBaliunas? Or any of the others I mentioned?\n  Are they part of this conspiracy?\n  Sadly, a member of the President's Cabinet--the Secretary of the \nInterior--was responsible for these remarks.\n  Here is a political appointee who appears to be making judgments \nabout the scientific integrity of others.\n  Those were unfortunate remarks, Mr. President. And they are the sort \nof remarks I hope that the Senate will avoid as we continue the debate \non climate change.\n  Let us keep to the high road.\n  Let us appreciate the fact that scientists, and indeed, all \nAmericans, are free to disagree and to challenge the views of others in \nhonest, public debate.\n  There will be disagreements. Just as I challenged the scientific \nunderstanding of Senator Kerry on several issues earlier in my remarks, \nothers will surely challenge my understanding of the science at some \npoint in the debate.\n  And in the process, we will all learn. That is the way it should be.\n  But there will be some, Mr. President, who will attack the scientist \ninstead of the science.\n  There will be some who say that you must agree with me, or you must \nbe part of some conspiracy that is trying to mislead the American \npeople.\n  That, to use Secretary Babbitt's words, strikes me as un-American.\n  Let's not fear a healthy scientific debate. Instead, let's depend on \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8626-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HONG KONG\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 1 month ago, Hong Kong reverted \nto the control of the People's Republic of China, ending over 150 years \nof colonial rule. This was a historic and unprecedented event in \nChinese history. I was honored to serve as the chairman of the official \nSenate delegation that attended the handover ceremonies along with \nseveral of our colleagues from the House of Representatives, led by \nCongressman Chris Cox. \n  I hope that when I return to Hong Kong next year, and the year after, \nand the year after, I will witness the same optimism that I observed \nduring the transition from British to Chinese rule. The people of Hong \nKong should be congratulated for their determination to keep Hong Kong \nthe pearl of the Orient.\n  During our visit, our delegation was fortunate to meet with the new \nchief executive, C.H. Tung, as well as his Chief Secretary, the highly \nrespected civil servant, Anson Chan. This duo has been referred to as \nthe dream team and the name is well deserved. It is my opinion that if \nC.H. Tung and Anson Chan work together they will lead Hong Kong to a \nbrighter future. But they will face severe trials. The ``one country, \ntwo systems'' approach of the late Chairman Deng is untested, and I \npredict that there will be hurdles to its implementation, especially in \nthe area of personal and political autonomy.\n  The purpose of the Senate Delegation to Hong Kong was to demonstrate \nour continued commitment to support the people of Hong Kong and to \nprotect United States interests. And Congress will continue to monitor \nevents in Hong Kong.\n  The key events that I think will determine whether this experiment \nwill work are the following:\n  Whether the elections C.H. Tung has called for May of 1998 are free \nand fair and allow broad participation.\n  Whether the Court of Final Appeal functions as the final word, or \nwhether the PRC People's Congress uses the fig leaf of ``national \nsecurity'' to step in and usurp Hong Kong's legal system.\n  How the PRC Government handles Martin Lee, and other democrats. Thus \nfar, democratic protests have continued without intervention.\n  What happens to the first paper to publish a Pro-Taiwan or Pro-Tibet \neditorial.\n  Whether Chief Secretary Anson Chan stays in her post after 1998, and \nwhether there is an exodus of other civil servants.\n  But I also urge restraint by my colleagues. We should not assume the \nworst for Hong Kong. Specifically, we should not alter trade laws that \nassume that Hong Kong cannot enforce her borders and her laws. If Hong \nKong cannot live up to her commitments in this regard, then the United \nStates should act, but we should not act prematurely.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to extend my commitment to \nthe people of Hong Kong to support their efforts.

This report, \nreleased in April of this year, examines current research being \nconducted or supported by the National Institutes of Health [NIH] into \nthe area of child abuse and neglect. The report proposes ground-\nbreaking recommendations for improving the coordination of child \nmaltreatment research across the NIH, with other divisions within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and with other federal \nagencies. In addition, the report addresses the current gaps in \nresearch, identified in the National Research Council's 1993 report,\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\n``Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect.'' The April, 1997, report by \nNIH emphasizes the need to provide more attention to training new \nresearch in the field and disseminating research results to the \nagencies and practitioners who are working on the frontlines.\n  We are all concerned about the prevalence of child abuse and neglect. \nAccording to a 1995 state-by-state survey conducted by the National \nCommittee to Prevent Child Abuse, over 3.1 million children were \nreported to be abused or neglected. Child abuse fatalities have \nincreased by 39 percent from 1985 to 1995. The Department of Health and \nHuman Services Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and \nNeglect, released in September, 1996, estimated that the number of \nchild abuse and neglect cases in this country doubled between 1986 and \n1993.\n  One critical and necessary step to stop child maltreatment is to \nsupport research that will enhance our understanding of the underlying \ncauses of child abuse and neglect. This research also will improve our \nability to identify and define abuse and neglect, and discover which \nintervention techniques are most successful in preventing and treating \nchild maltreatment.\n  The proposals for future NIH activities contained in the report give \nnew meaning to the concept of knowledge translation and research \napplication. The most important characteristic of the proposals are the \nefforts to move scientific knowledge from the research lab and \ndemonstration site into professional practice. Parents, child welfare \nagencies, and practitioners will all benefit from this information and \ntechnology transfer. In the exchange, NIH researchers will benefit from \nthe lessons learned by practitioners and be better able to target their \nresearch. Everyone will benefit from the increased coordination that is \nintegral to the NIH effort. But most important, fewer children will \nsuffer from abuse and neglect, once marriage between the research and \npractice is accomplished. This is a goal upon which we can all agree.\n  I want to commend Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of NIH, for his \nleadership in this critical area. Under the direction of Dr. Varmus, \nDr. Peter Jensen, Chief-Child and Adolescent Disorders Branch, at the \nNational Institutes of Mental Health established a trans-NIH Working \nGroup on child abuse and neglect. I would also like to thank the \norganizations which brought this issue to my attention and encouraged \nthe formation of the Working Group--the National Association of Social \nWorkers, National Child Abuse Coalition, Institute for the Advancement \nof Social Work Research, and the American Psychological Society.\n  The Working Group has developed a bold plan for advancing research on \nchild abuse and neglect, as evidenced by the April, 1997 report. This \nplan will make the optimal use of federal dollars though better \ncoordination of NIH research activities and dissemination of research \nresults to those who can make a difference in children's lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8627-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL EDUCATION CENTER FOR WOMEN IN BUSINESS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to engage the \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nin a brief colloquy concerning funding for the National Education \nCenter for Women in Business at Seton Hill College.\n  Mr. President, in the decade between 1982 and 1992, women-owned \nbusinesses grew substantially, increasing by over 55 percent between \n1987 and 1992 alone. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's women business \nowners helped make this happen, as my state ranks sixth in the nation \nin the number of firms owned by women. These firms contributed over \n290,000 jobs to my state's economy. The Center conducts collaborative \nresearch, provides educational programs and curriculum development, and \nserves as a information clearinghouse for women entrepreneurs. I have \nheard only good things about the Center's work in the promotion of \nwomen business ownership, both in the Commonwealth and across the \nnation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I must echo the comments of my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania with respect to the National Education Center for \nWomen in Business, which provides invaluable services to women from all \nover this country to encourage the establishment and growth of \nbusinesses. The Center's programs are truly in the national interest \nand as a member of the Appropriations Committee I have been pleased to \nwork with my colleague, Senator Santorum, and Congressman Mascara in \nsupport of the Center and its funding needs. The federal funds we have \nsought are necessary to bring the Center to a position of self-\nsufficiency where it can operate solely with private funds in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Center has received funds in five previous \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations bills through the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Women's Business Ownership and, as \noriginally envisioned, it was to receive $5 million in federal funds \nover five years. The fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill for the SBA \nincluded $500,000 for the Center, which leaves $500,000 in federal \nfunds that are needed to complete the total $5 million federal \ncontribution to the establishment of the Center. I understand that the \nSmall Business Administration would generally continue the program \nthrough the next cycle, even though it is not specifically listed in \nthe bill, as the Center has been successful in its mission on behalf of \nwomen in business. Would the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee \nbe willing to work with Senator Specter and me to examine options for \nallocating funds for the National Education Center for Women in \nBusiness?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Pennsylvania for \nhighlighting the work of this program and its funding history. Since \nthe Small Business Administration funded the program in fiscal year \n1997, I assume they will wish to continue funding in fiscal year 1998 \nfor the Center. The absence of report language should not prevent the \nagency from providing funding in the next fiscal year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8628-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8628-S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CHRIS YODER\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the \nSenate's time to speak today about a man whose life has been dedicated \nto public service--in particular, service to America's veterans: Chris \nYoder.\n  Many of my colleagues know Chris. He has spent his entire career \nworking for veterans. And now, Chris has decided to leave the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs [VA]. However, his life-long commitment \nto veterans will continue as he moves to the Commission on Service \nMembers and Veterans' Transition Assistance.\n  I have known Chris for many years, and I have come to rely on him for \nhis expertise.\n  He served in Vietnam and after he returned home, he began his career \nwith the Veterans' Administration in 1972. He joined the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs in 1985 when I served as the Committee \nChairman. Chris immediately demonstrated a remarkable recall and \nuncanny knowledge of veterans' issues. In 1991, Chris joined Tony \nPrincipi when Tony went to work for the Bush Administration as Deputy \nSecretary for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In 1993, when I \nserved as Vice Chairman of the Committee, Chris returned.\n  Over the years, I have asked Chris to examine a number of veterans' \nprograms and I have always expected Chris to ask tough questions about \nthese programs. We spend billions of dollars on veterans' health care \nand benefits, and members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee \nconstantly struggle to ensure that the money is spent efficiently and \nin an equitable manner.\n  Is the veterans' health care program based on the most modern medical \ndelivery systems, or are we sticking with an aging infrastructure that \nis consuming dollars that need to be redirected to meet the real needs \nof veterans? That's the type of issue that Chris has had to tackle.\n  Last Congress, we passed Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform. If \nyou think the tax code is complicated, you should have seen the VA's \nhealth care eligibility criteria before our reforms. It confused \nveterans, it confused Congress, and it even confused VA doctors and \nadministrators.\n  Chris took it upon himself to play the leading role in crafting a \nreform proposal that simplified the criteria without sacrificing the \nquality and access to care for our Nation's veterans.\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\n By far, this was the most important veterans' legislation passed in \nthe 104th Congress, and one of the most difficult and complex issues I \nhave witnessed during my 17-year tenure as a U.S. Senator.\n  I do not think anyone can doubt the commitment and dedication Chris \nhas for our veterans, and I know every member of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs will miss his dedication and expertise.\n  He is a man with the courage to tackle the difficult questions and \nthe knowledge to find the answers. Chris Yoder will be sorely missed on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee. As a friend, I wish him the best of \nthe luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8628-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO HAROLD ``PRINCE HAL'' NEWHOUSER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one \nof Michigan's greatest athletes in America's greatest pastime. Baseball \nwas Harold ``Prince Hal'' Newhouser's life, and it showed every minute \nduring the 15 years he was on the field, proudly wearing the Detroit \nTigers jersey number 16. Rising to prominence during a time when \nathletes played for the love of the sport, Harold's story represents a \nfine example of the American ethic of hard work and determination.\n  At 14 years old, Harold listened intently to the announcer as Goose \nGoslin drove in the series winning run, giving the Detroit Tigers the \n1935 pennant. Harold was so excited about the victory he decided his \nlife's goal was to play for his hometown Tigers. Four months after his \neighteenth birthday, as he stepped on the mound for the first time, \nHarold's dream came true.\n  Harold Newhouser was born to play baseball. Just a few years after he \nbegan pitching for the Tigers, Harold reached the coveted twenty wins \nin one season. In 1942, Harold was named to the All-Star team. In 1944, \nhe earned the American League's Most Valuable Player award, and won it \nagain the very next year. This occasion marked the only time in history \na major league picture won the MVP award in back-to-back seasons.\n  By the time Harold Newhouser retired in 1955, he had played in six \nAll-Star Games, won two MVP's, and earned recognition as a strikeout \nking with a blazing fastball. In 1992, his achievements were formally \nrecognized through his induction into the Hall of Fame. As Harold is \nproud to point out, he is the first Detroit-born player to go into the \nHall of Fame, and he's the first Detroit-born player to have his \nuniform number retired by the Tigers.\n  And that occasion, Mr. President, is what I rise today to \ncommemorate. Harold was born in Detroit, grew up in Detroit, and played \nbaseball for Detroit. This Sunday the Tigers will bestow upon him their \nhighest honor, and on behalf of Michigan, I would like to recognize his \naccomplishments in the Record, and to thank him for his outstanding \nrepresentation of Michigan throughout his life, both on and off the \nfield.\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/31/senate-section/article/S8629-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}]
