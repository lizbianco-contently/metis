At 12:30 today the Senate will recess \nuntil 2:15 to allow the weekly policy conferences to meet.\n  Following the conferences, the Senate may consider a Senate \nresolution regarding mammograms, which was submitted by Senator Snowe. \nIt is my hope we will be able to enter a short time limitation for \ndebate and then have a rollcall vote on the adoption of that \nresolution. All Members will be notified when that agreement is reached \nas well as when the rollcall vote can be expected. We hope that we will \nhave that vote probably not later than 4 o'clock or so this afternoon, \nbut we will give the specific time a little later in the morning.\n  As expected, yesterday the Judiciary Committee did file their report \non the constitutional amendment on the balanced budget. The report \nbecame available this morning and, therefore, under the rule, the \nSenate may begin consideration of that joint resolution on Thursday. It \nis possible that we may begin opening statements on the balanced budget \namendment on Wednesday, tomorrow afternoon. I will notify all Members \nof that schedule after I confer further with the democratic leader.\n  In addition, several committees are expected to complete their work \non some of the pending nominations during this week. Once again, I will \nalert all Members as to the Senate schedule with respect to these \nnominees. We have at least a couple that are close to being reported. \nWe hope to have a vote on those Thursday, if at all possible.\n  Of course, on Thursday morning we will also be notified of the \nPresident's budget proposals, and we hope to have a quick meeting with \nthe President up here on Capitol Hill in the President's room certainly \nwithin the next week. We are still working on the specifics and details \nof that meeting, so we can begin to actually roll up our sleeves and \nbegin work on items where we think there is a good possibility for \nagreement so that we can move things, like the balanced budget \nagreement, some tax relief for working Americans, improvements in \neducation at the local level with parents being involved on behalf of \nthe children's interests, safer streets, safer neighborhoods, and toxic \nand nuclear waste cleanup. These are areas where we have a lot of \ncommon interests, concerns, and we should go to work on these big \nissues as quickly as we possibly can.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, one of the disappointing aspects of serving \nin the Senate is the inescapable and unintended detachment we so often \nunknowingly experience in our efforts to keep up with the joyful things \nhappening to our friends back home and elsewhere. But it is downright \ndiscouraging to discover sometimes long after the fact, that sadness \nhas come to our friends and their families.\n  For example, the death this past December 29 of a remarkable \nAmerican, Robert J. Morris, who immediately earned my admiration when I \ncame to Washington in 1951 as administrative assistant to a fine North \nCarolina Senator.\n  I had a note the other day from Bob Morris's widow, Joan, about his \ndeath. Mr. President, when I arrived in Washington years ago, Bob \nMorris was the very bright and talented chief counsel of the Internal \nSecurity Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  The New York Times on January 2 of this year reported Bob Morris's \ndeath. The headline read: ``Robert J. Morris Is Dead at 82; Crusader \nAgainst Communism''.\n  The opening paragraphs of the obituary read as follows:\n\n       Robert J. Morris, whose ministrations as counsel for a Cold \n     War Senate Subcommittee bent on rooting out Communists marked \n     a long career devoted to conservative causes, died on Sunday \n     at Point Pleasant Hospital in Point Pleasant, N.J. He was 82 \n     and lived in Mantoloking, N.J.\n       The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said his \n     son Geoffrey, who added that Mr. Morris had been suffering \n     for more than a year from hydrocephalus, a condition that \n     impedes brain function.\n       Mr. Morris was chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary \n     Subcommittee on Internal Security from 1951 to 1953, and \n     again from 1956 to 1958, a period when the country was \n     tormented by the specter of Communist infiltration at every \n     level of life.\n       A graduate of Fordham Law School, he had served on a New \n     York State Assembly committee in 1940 that investigated New \n     York's schools and colleges for Communist activities. He \n     worked various aspects of the Senate hearings, appearing as a \n     witness now and then and serving as a frequent spokesman and \n     defender of its work.\n\n  After those somewhat objective paragraphs, Mr. President, the New \nYork Times launched a full-fledged attack on Bob Morris because of his \nbattles against communism.\n  I shall omit that part of the New York Times report regarding Bob \nMorris's death and pick up again when the obituary regains objectivity:\n\n       Mr. Morris's interest in politics was part and parcel of \n     his upbringing in Jersey City, where his father was known for \n     organizing opposition to Frank Hague, the entrenched Hudson \n     County boss. That interest sharpened while Mr. Morris served \n     in the Navy during World War II.\n       Turned down at first because of his inability to recognize \n     the color red, an anecdote he repeated with delight through \n     the years, he became a commander of counterintelligence and \n     psychological warfare. At one point, his son said, he was in \n     charge of writing the threats, printed in Japanese on what \n     looked like money, that were dropped by the planeload on \n     Japanese cities.\n       He also interrogated prisoners, and began believing that \n     Communism was a greater threat to world security than most \n     leaders realized--an opinion that would influence the rest of \n     his life.\n       Politics continued to attract him after he left the \n     subcommittee. In 1958, he made a bid for the Republican \n     Senate nomination from New Jersey, running on a conservative \n     platform that stressed his subcommittee work. Like all but \n     one of his attempts to win public office--he was elected a \n     municipal judge in New York City in 1954, and resigned two \n     years later to rejoin the Senate investigations--it was \n     unsuccessful.\n       Turning his eye to education, Mr. Morris moved to Texas in \n     1960 to become president of the University of Dallas. He \n     continued speaking out against Communism and on other \n     issues, which became a source of friction at the \n     university, which he left in 1962.\n       That summer, he founded the Defenders of American \n     Liberties, a group he described as modeled after the American \n     Civil Liberties Union, ``but with emphasis on different \n     positions.'' The group quickly gained public attention with \n     its defense of former Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker, who was \n     accused of inciting unrest at the University of Mississippi \n     at Oxford as James Meredith, its first black student, was \n     attempting to start classes there.\n       In 1964, he founded the University of Plano, now defunct, \n     in Plano, Tex., which was intended to teach mildly disabled \n     young people through ``patterning,'' controversial at the \n     time. It involved putting students through a series of \n     physical exercises, including crawling and creeping, to \n     stimulate nonphysical development in the brain.\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\n       Mr. Morris was prompted to do so by the difficulties of one \n     of his children, William, whom he enrolled in the university. \n     He remained at the university until 1977, and it closed a \n     short time later.\n       He continued to be a vocal foe of Communism and to speak \n     out against disarmament. While In Texas, he made two runs at \n     the Senate, in 1962 and 1970, positioning himself as a \n     conservative Republican. Both times he was defeated in the \n     primary by George Bush.\n       He was the author of five books, all but one dealing with \n     the prospective unraveling of the world order. One, \n     ``Disarmament: Weapon of Conquest,'' became something of a \n     best seller after it appeared in 1963.\n       He also wrote a column, ``Around the World,'' which was \n     published from 1960 to the early 1980's in newspapers, among \n     them The Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader and The New York \n     Tribune. Among his interests were the politics of Africa, and \n     he became a chairman of the American Zimbabwean Association.\n       In 1984, he made one last bid for the New Jersey Senate \n     nomination, campaigning on the same platform as President \n     Ronald Reagan but losing nonetheless. Until last year, his \n     son said, he remained active, writing and giving lectures to \n     groups in the New York area.\n       He is survived by his wife, Joan Byles Morris; a daughter, \n     Joan M. Barry of Jackson, N.J.; six sons, Robert J. Jr., of \n     Kauai, Hawaii, Paul E., of Montclair, N.J., Roger W., of \n     Mantoloking, William E., of Mantoloking, John Henry 2d, of \n     Bay Head, N.J., and Geoffrey J., of Armonk, N.Y.; two \n     sisters, Alice Gougeon of Stone Harbor, N.J., and Kathleen \n     Reinert of Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., and 12 grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S922-7", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S923-S924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FUNDING FOR INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate and House will soon vote on the \nPresident's finding that withholding disbursement of USAID family \nplanning funds until July 1, 1997, will cause serious damage to the \nproper functioning of the program.\n  It is no surprise that the President reached this conclusion. It is \nbeyond dispute that family planning services, including the provision \nof modern contraceptives, are the most effective way to prevent \nunwanted pregnancies and abortions. The examples that the President \ncites to support his finding should be read by every Member of \nCongress. They illustrate the harm these restrictions have already done \nto the program, and the further harm, measured in the numbers of women \nwho will die from unsafe abortions that could be prevented, and \nchildren who will die from disease or starvation because their families \ncould not care for them, as well as in added administrative costs, that \na further delay in disbursement will cause. They also refute the \nflagrantly erroneous claim of the right-to-life lobby, that this vote \nis about whether or not to provide $123 million to organizations that \nfund abortion. Not one dime of these funds can be used for abortion, \nand the vote is only about when, not whether, these funds will be \ndisbursed.\n  I will have more to say about this at the time of the vote, but I \nwant to be sure that all Senators saw the editorial from this \nSaturday's Washington Post, and this Sunday's Post op-ed piece by David \nBroder, which make compelling arguments for upholding the President's \nfinding. Perhaps most noteworthy is the quote from former Senator \nHatfield, who was staunchly pro-life but an equally strong supporter of \nfamily planning. He said ``it is a proven fact that when contraceptive \nservices are not available to women throughout the world, abortion \nrates increase.''\n  Mr. President, that should be the beginning and end of this debate. I \nask unanimous consent that the two articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 1997]\n\n                       A Key Family Planning Vote\n\n       In the familiar and frazzling congressional argument over \n     U.S. foreign aid for family planning, the side whose explicit \n     purpose is to oppose abortion has been marking up notable \n     gains. In the past two years, these funds have been cut by a \n     full third, kept from being spent until nine months of the \n     fiscal year have passed and then allowed to be spent \n     (``metered'') only in small monthly sums. Now an important \n     vote is coming up that the family planning side hopes will \n     halt and reverse this legislative harassment of a valuable \n     program. The vote this month is not about funding abortions--\n     something prohibited by law and policy anyway. It will simply \n     determine whether funds already appropriated for family \n     planning in fiscal 1997 will be held up until July or \n     released in March.\n       Not a great issue, it could be said: a battle over crumbs \n     in Congress. But it is a great issue if you believe as we do \n     that American voluntary family planning programs--carefully \n     drawn, executed and monitored to ensure that they will not be \n     diverted to abortions--have made a central, proven, 30-year \n     contribution to reducing poverty and enhancing human dignity \n     around the world. The effectiveness of well-run programs, in \n     fact, is no longer at issue. They work. It is demonstrable \n     that when programs and funds are reduced--by cuts, delays and \n     policy encumbrances--unintended pregnancies and abortions \n     follow.\n       We now come to the large and continuing mystery of these \n     programs. A strange belief that abortions can be made to end \n     if family planning is restricted in what apparently has led \n     antiabortion advocates to work for the denial and diminution \n     of family planning services. ``Chris,'' Sen. Mark Hatfield \n     wrote not long ago to one of those advocates, Rep. Chris \n     Smith (R-N.J.), ``you are contributing to an increase of \n     abortions worldwide because of the funding restrictions on \n     which you insisted in last year's funding bill. It is a \n     proven fact that when contraceptive services are not \n     available to women throughout the world, abortion rates \n     increase. . . . This is unacceptable to me as someone who is \n     strongly opposed to abortion.''\n       The global generation now coming of child-bearing age is \n     the largest single generation ever to reach reproductive \n     maturity, the Rockefeller Foundation reports. This is a \n     sobering reminder of the need for the United States to resume \n     its leadership in an important field.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 1997]\n\n                     A Vote for Poor Women Overseas\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       For 30 years, the United States has led an international \n     effort to reduce the toll of maternal deaths and unwanted \n     pregnancies by providing money and technical assistance for \n     family planning programs in underdeveloped countries. Despite \n     its dramatic successes and despite universal agreement that \n     federal funds would not be used to pay for abortions, the \n     program was severely cut and then temporarily suspended last \n     year by antiabortion forces in the House of Representatives.\n       Now that issue is about to be revisited in a February \n     congressional vote that will directly affect the life \n     prospects of countless women and children--and provide an \n     important test of the shellshocked House Republican \n     leadership's ability to maintain a degree of cohesion in its \n     fragile majority.\n       The background is this: Since the mid-1960s, the United \n     States, through aid to foreign countries and to private, \n     nonprofit organizations, has helped make contraceptive advice \n     and supplies available to couples in poor lands so they can \n     plan the size of their families. Its success is undeniable. A \n     report released last week by the Rockefeller Foundation, a \n     longtime supporter of family planning, noted that in the past \n     three decades, the percentage of women in these countries \n     using contraception has grown from 10 percent to 50 percent \n     and the average number of children they have borne has been \n     reduced from six to three.\n       The reduction in family size has helped millions escape \n     from poverty and, for many women, enhanced the prospects for \n     education and a richer life--to say nothing of better health. \n     Fewer risky pregnancies and many fewer abortions are among \n     the benefits.\n       No one seriously questions the efficacy of the program and, \n     equally, no one has sought to upset the longstanding ban on \n     U.S. government money paying for abortions. But when the \n     Republicans won control of the House in 1995, they sought to \n     write into law a policy that Presidents Reagan and Bush had \n     imposed by executive order banning U.S. aid to organizations \n     that used their own funds to pay for abortions. President \n     Clinton ended that policy two days after he took office, and \n     the House Republicans sought to overrule him.\n       Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), whose opposition to abortion is \n     as fervent as it is sincere, argued that since money is \n     fungible, grants to groups such as the International Planned \n     Parenthood Federation, which offers privately financed \n     abortion counseling and services, were indirectly subsidizing \n     the procedure he despised. But before he retired last month, \n     Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), as staunch an opponent of \n     abortion as can be found, rejected Smith's logic.\n       In a letter to Smith last September, Hatfield wrote: ``I \n     have reviewed the materials you recently sent to my office in \n     response to my request that you provide proof that U.S. funds \n     are being spent on abortion through AID's [the Agency for \n     International Development] voluntary international family \n     planning program. Unfortunately, I do not see anything in \n     these materials to back up your assertion.'' Hatfield said, \n     ``AID has a rigorous process,'' enforced by outside monitors, \n     to carry out the abortion ban. ``In the meantime, Chris,'' he \n     added, ``you are contributing to an increase of abortions \n     worldwide because of the funding restrictions on which you \n     insisted. . . . It is a proven fact that when contraceptive \n     services are not available to women throughout the world, \n     abortion rates increase.''\n       In 1995 and 1996, the House majority followed Smith, the \n     Senate Hatfield. To break the impasse and keep the program \n     alive, Clinton agreed last year that if the House Republicans \n     would not insist on reinstating the Reagan-Bush restrictions, \n     he would accept a 35 percent cut in family planning funds and \n     agree to the financing being suspended entirely for six to \n     nine months.\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\n       That agreement guaranteed Clinton an up-or-down floor vote \n     in the House and Senate this month on resuming the program \n     without the Reagan-Bush restrictions. But Smith is pressing \n     House Majority Leader Dick Armey to break the deal \n     Republicans made with the White House last September and \n     allow Smith to bring up his restrictive amendment again, \n     sweetened with a partial rollback of the funding cut. Armey's \n     spokeswoman told me, ``We're leaning toward'' giving Smith \n     what he wants.\n       That prospect has impelled many of the three dozen House \n     Republicans who support the international family planning \n     program to write Armey that, rather than yield to Smith and \n     his allies, they are prepared to fight their own leadership \n     and, if necessary, hand them an embarrassing defeat on the \n     first major legislative test since Speaker Newt Gingrich was \n     disciplined for ethics violations. The issue goes before the \n     House Republican Conference later this week. But the women \n     and children who have most at stake around the world will not \n     have a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S923-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CHARLES A. ``BILL'' BISHOP\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

And a man whose death is a loss \nto us all.\n  My friend, Charles A. ``Bill'' Bishop, died on Sunday, January 26. \nBut his memory will continue to live on in all of us who remember him. \nHis loss is sudden, and we are left now to remember this man who gave \nus so much. Throughout his life, he was a husband, a father, an \nadvocate, a learner, a jokester, and a teacher. In everything he did, \nhe attacked it with a passion--an unquenchable zest for life.\n  Family was everything to Bill. He idolized his wife and children, and \nthey loved him dearly. One of his favorite things in the world was \nspending time with his family. I extend my deepest sympathies to them \nin this time of sorrow.\n  Bill's zest for life can easily be seen in his legacy of outspoken \nadvocacy for the environment. With a heart as big as the Mission \nMountains that he loved so much, Bill was committed to leaving this \nplanet a better place for his children and grandchildren. On these \nissues, Bill was often an adviser to me. If he agreed with something I \ndid, he would let me know. If he disagreed, I could expect to get an \nearful from him. Yet through it all, he was thoughtful, respectful, and \neager to find solutions to the many problems that confront Montana.\n  I still have a hard time imagining Montana without Bill Bishop. In \nmany ways, I will never get used to his absence. To say that I will \nmiss him is not enough. His passing leaves my life with a little less \nlaughter and a little less joy.\n  Those of us who knew Bill will make sure that the memories stay \nalways fresh, renewed over and over again by our love for this great \nman. God bless you, Bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S924-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, on December 16, 1996, Mark Gearan, the \nDirector of the Peace Corps, delivered an eloquent address at the \nNational Press Club on the current status of the Peace Corps. Mr. \nGearan's address provides an excellent summary of the accomplishments \nof the Peace Corps and the extraordinary assistance that Peace Corps \nvolunteers are providing to nations in all parts of the world. I know \nthat President Kennedy would be proud of the way the Peace Corps is \nliving up to its ideals, and I ask that Mr. Gearan's address be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Remarks by Mark D. Gearan, Director of the Peace Corps\n\n       The job of Director of the Peace Corps affords those who \n     are privileged to hold it a unique perspective on the world \n     and our country, one that is shaped by the enduring values \n     that the Peace Corps represents, and by the spirit of service \n     that Volunteers embody.\n       When Sargent Shriver, the first Director of the Peace \n     Corps, came to the National Press Club in 1962, he made this \n     observation:\n       ``It is a complex world we live in today,'' he said. \n     ``While one man orbits the earth in a space capsule, another \n     man squats for hours beside an Asian rice paddy, trying to \n     catch a fish only as big as your thumb. While some men \n     manufacture computers, other men plow with sticks.''\n       What my predecessor said then still holds true today. We \n     have men and women orbiting the earth in space capsules. But \n     we still have men and women plowing with sticks in many parts \n     of the world.\n       Yet it goes without saying that the world is much different \n     than it was in 1962. The disparities that Sargent Shriver \n     described are still with us. But advances in science, \n     technology, the media, the spread of freedom and democracy, \n     and the end of the Cold War, have not only made our lives \n     more complicated, they have also given us new opportunities \n     and new reason for hope.\n       Much the same can be said about the Peace Corps. Since \n     President Kennedy sent the first group of Volunteers to Ghana \n     in 1961, we have remained true to the vision and goals that \n     were set out for us from the very beginning. Today, nearly \n     7,000 Volunteers are working with ordinary people in 90 \n     countries to encourage social and economic progress at the \n     grass-roots level. Peace Corps Volunteers are young and \n     older; they are black, white, Asian, Hispanic, and Native \n     American; and they come from every social, economic, and \n     religious background.\n       Yet for all of their diversity, our Volunteers still share \n     a common purpose: to help make the world a better place.\n       And just as it was in the beginning, the Peace Corps is \n     still much more than a development agency. Our Volunteers are \n     still strengthening the bonds of friendship and understanding \n     between Americans and the people of the developing world that \n     are, in many respects, the foundation of peace among \n     nations.\n       Yet the Peace Corps has also changed to meet the needs of \n     our time. We have worked hard to strengthen the Peace Corps \n     while remaining faithful to our mission. And I believe that \n     the state of the Peace Corps is as strong as it has ever \n     been, and that its prospects for the future are bright and \n     promising. From the number of qualified and motivated people \n     who want to become Volunteers, to the new countries we are \n     entering, to the strong support we have among the American \n     people, this Administration, and in the Congress, the Peace \n     Corps is moving forward and is poised to enter the 21st \n     century with confidence and energy.\n       With this future in mind, we decided to take a look at the \n     past and see what we could learn from some of the men and \n     women who have served as Peace Corps Volunteers over the \n     years. We have conducted the first comprehensive survey of \n     returned Peace Corps Volunteers who have served in each of \n     the last four decades since 1961.\n       I'll tell you more about the survey in a minute. But let me \n     give you just a few examples that demonstrate the vitality of \n     an agency that continues to capture the imagination of so \n     many people.\n       First, we continue to attract the best that America has to \n     offer. Last year, more than 100,000 people contacted us \n     seeking information about how to become a Peace Corps \n     Volunteer. Ten thousand went through our competitive \n     application process, and we extended invitations to 3,500 of \n     these talented and dedicated people.\n       Second, we are making sure that Volunteers are serving in \n     the right countries for the times in which we live. That's \n     why earlier this year, our Volunteers returned to Haiti after \n     a five-year absence to work with the people of the poorest \n     nation in this hemisphere.\n       That's why next month, Volunteers will go to South Africa \n     for the first time in the history of the Peace Corps to help \n     support and contribute to the historic transformation that is \n     taking place in that critical country.\n       And that's why I recently signed an agreement with the \n     government of Jordan that will allow Volunteers to begin \n     serving there in April 1997 for the first time. Expanding the \n     presence of Peace Corps Volunteers in the Middle East is an \n     important step for us. I believe these Volunteers will help \n     improve understanding between Americans and the people of the \n     Arab world and contribute to Jordan's development.\n       Third, we are making sure that the work of our volunteers \n     is driven by the needs of the communities where they are \n     serving. Volunteers are working with their counterparts to \n     help to protect and restore the environment. Others \n     collaborate with small business people to create economic \n     opportunities. They are working with teachers to expand \n     access to education for children and adults, and they help \n     farmers grow more and better food. Still others are helping \n     to keep families healthy and prevent the spread of terrible \n     diseases, such as HIV/AIDS.\n\n[[Page S925]]\n\n       Fourth, we are leading the way for international volunteer \n     organizations to play an even greater role in the developing \n     world. Earlier this year, we brought together the leaders of \n     35 international organizations that send volunteers outside \n     of their own countries. Our purpose was to find ways to \n     collaborate in the field and help those countries, such as \n     Mali, Senegal, the Czech Republic and Malaysia, that want to \n     establish their own volunteer organizations.\n       Finally, we are moving forward with the establishment of \n     the Crisis Corps, one of our newest and most exciting \n     initiatives. We are making it possible for experienced Peace \n     Corps Volunteers and returned Volunteers to contribute their \n     language skills, their cross cultural understanding, and \n     their experience in development to short-term international \n     relief efforts.\n       These are just a few of the important steps we are taking \n     to ensure that the Peace Corps stays on the cutting edge of \n     development and service. So like any forward-thinking \n     organization, we thought we could learn something from the \n     people who have contributed so much to the Peace Corps' \n     success. We wanted to take advantage of the insights and \n     experience of returned Volunteers who served in the Peace \n     Corps for at least one year.\n       Let me share with you some of the highlights of what they \n     had to say:\n       Perhaps the most impressive finding was that 94% of the \n     respondents said that they would make the same decision to \n     join the Peace Corps again, and 93% said they would recommend \n     service in the Peace Corps to others.\n       One returned Volunteer wrote: ``Aside from the births of my \n     two daughters, my Peace Corps experience was the most \n     gratifying experience of my life. I'm so proud and grateful \n     for having been blessed with such a powerful and positive \n     experience.''\n       Ninety-four percent of the respondents believed they made a \n     positive contribution to the development of the country where \n     they served, and most indicated that their greatest \n     contribution as Volunteers was to the individuals with whom \n     they worked.\n       In addition, most of the respondents said that service in \n     the Peace Corps met their expectations of helping others, \n     experiencing a different culture, and their desire for travel \n     and adventure. And 70% said that their Peace Corps experience \n     had a positive impact on their careers.\n       The survey also revealed that some returned Volunteers did \n     not leave their sense of humor overseas. In response to the \n     question: ``In what state are you currently living?'', \n     several Volunteers responded: ``confusion, or bliss . . .''\n       Our survey also confirmed what we already know: Peace Corps \n     Volunteers face some very difficult realities--from petty \n     burglaries and assault, to racial and sexual harassment, to \n     political unrest and natural disasters. Service in the Peace \n     Corps can sometimes be tough, but the Volunteers confront \n     these challenges head on every day with great courage.\n       Finally, this survey also reveals that, for most returned \n     Volunteers, their commitment to service doesn't end when they \n     come home. They tend to be active members of their \n     communities. Seventy-eight percent said they have volunteered \n     since coming home, and 63% have worked with people with \n     ``special needs,'' such as the elderly, the disabled, and \n     refugees.\n       These are just some of the results of the 1996 survey of \n     returned Peace Corps Volunteers. But what are we to make of \n     all this? Does it matter? I think it does, and let me tell \n     you why.\n       First, I believe that in many ways this survey reaffirms \n     and justifies the confidence that Americans have placed in \n     the Peace Corps over the years, something for which we are \n     grateful and never take for granted.\n       Second, this survey also demonstrates in a small but \n     important way that many Americans care about what happens in \n     the world and want to help make it a better place. I believe \n     they understand the connection between America's engagement \n     in the world and our prosperity. And they are generous in \n     their willingness to encourage progress and help other \n     people.\n       But there is also a significant domestic dividend to the \n     Peace Corps. Our country is fortunate to have a large cadre \n     of people with international experience that broadens our \n     understanding of other countries and cultures. This is a \n     tremendous asset for America's participation in the global \n     marketplace.\n       Moreover, the insights about other peoples and cultures \n     that returned Volunteers bring back with them, I believe, can \n     add to America's thinking and understanding of the many \n     problems that we confront in our own multicultural society.\n       Finally, let me close by speaking directly to the young \n     people in our country. The Peace Corps is an organization \n     that is often identified with the 1960s. A lot of young \n     people sometimes wish they had been around to witness the \n     sweeping changes that occurred in our society and our culture \n     back then. I believe there is much that we all can learn from \n     that important era in our country's history.\n       But a nostalgic view of the past need not keep us from \n     looking ahead and moving forward. I believe the times in \n     which we live today are just as exciting and hold even more \n     promise. Fifty years from now, young people will look back to \n     the end of the 20th century and say: ``I wish I had been \n     around when the German people took their sledgehammers to the \n     Berlin Wall, when the people of South Africa tasted freedom \n     for the first time, when the Cold War ended and new \n     democracies began to flourish.'' They will surely wish they \n     had been alive when the information revolution took off and \n     helped shrink the world by an order of magnitude.\n       But the men and women who are serving as Peace Corps \n     Volunteers today are taking part in the great struggle that \n     still lies ahead--the struggle for human dignity both here at \n     home and around the world. President Kennedy and each of his \n     successors, both Democratic and Republican alike, have \n     summoned us to participate in that struggle, and I am very \n     proud to say that Peace Corps Volunteers are doing their \n     part.\n       I believe this is the best time to be part of the Peace \n     Corps. We are grateful for the service of more than 145,000 \n     Americans. We are excited about our future--from the new \n     countries where Volunteers will be serving, to our new \n     initiatives, including the Crisis Corps. The Peace Corps is \n     moving into the next century, proud of the legacy that \n     precedes us and confident that Peace Corps Volunteers are \n     making a real difference in lives of people around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S924-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S925-S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IMPLEMENTATION OF MANAGEMENT REFORMS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND \n                           URBAN DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to use the opportunity, \nfollowing Senate confirmation of Andrew Cuomo as the next Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development, to address some vital management issues \nat the Department. The Department of Housing and Urban Development \n[HUD], like many other federal agencies, is confronted by serious \nmanagement problems that impede its ability to carry out its mission.\n  HUD, which Secretary-designate Cuomo will head, has a diverse group \nof activities under its purview. HUD manages an $885 billion loan \nportfolio and provides $25 billion in rental subsidies and over $5 \nbillion annually in community development grants. As the principal \nagency concerned with the Nation's housing needs and redeveloping our \ndecaying cities, HUD has a monumental task on its hands and should be \nrun as efficiently and effectively as a Fortune 500 company. \nUnfortunately, this has not been the case in the past.\n  Historically, HUD has had a rocky track record. Departmentwide \nmanagement deficiencies were a major factor leading to the 1989 HUD \nscandals. In 1994, the General Accounting Office placed the entire \ndepartment on its high risk list, designating HUD as ``especially \nvulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.'' I understand \nthat this year GAO will continue to keep HUD on its high risk list, \nbelieving that the deficiencies hampering HUD's leadership in \neffectively managing the agency have yet to be resolved.\n  Congress has given agencies like HUD the tools to improve their \nmanagement operations, most notably by passing legislation developed by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee such as the Chief Financial Officers \n[CFO] Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act [GPRA] of \n1993, and the procurement and information technology reforms of last \nCongress. These laws are designed to get the Federal Government to \noperate in a sound, businesslike manner and implementing these \nmanagement reforms is a major responsibility for each department head. \nI urge Mr. Cuomo to devote as much of his time as necessary to use \nthese laws to focus on getting results for the taxpayers who fund HUD \nand the many who depend on its programs.\n  The Government Performance and Results Act, for example, can be an \neffective tool to make government work better by measuring the success \nor failure of government programs and using this information to support \nbudget decisions. I am encouraged by Secretary-designate Cuomo's \nenthusiastic support of GPRA in his responses to my questions submitted \nduring his confirmation process. This is because effective GPRA \nimplementation is especially needed at HUD. HUD's programs and missions \noften overlap or are linked only tangentially to HUD's primary \nmissions. The National Academy of Public Administration and HUD's \ninspector general [IG] have recommended eliminating, consolidating, or \nrestructuring many of HUD's 240 programs and activities, 91 of which, \nthe IG said, were questionably related to the department's primary \nmission. GPRA, by focusing on agency missions and results, will \ngive HUD, the Office of Management and Budget and the Congress\n\n[[Page S926]]\n\nthe information necessary to consolidate and eliminate these wasteful \nand redundant programs.\n\n  Unfortunately, HUD has a long way to go toward effectively \nimplementing GPRA. The HUD IG recently found that the department is \njust beginning to develop an agencywide strategic plan, the key \nunderpinning and starting point for the process of goal-setting and \nperformance measurements under GPRA. The IG report also indicated that \nHUD staff felt that the initial plans were developed only by a few of \nthe Department's staff and did not involve input from a broad range of \nHUD offices. Given the need for broad acceptance of performance \nmeasures and established deadlines for implementing GPRA, I hope the \nnew Secretary will take steps to ensure the integrity and successful \nimplementation of GPRA at HUD.\n  GPRA is dependent on sound financial management--something that HUD \nis lacking. One of the reasons for GAO's designation of HUD as a high-\nrisk area is its poorly integrated, ineffective, and generally \nunreliable information and financial management systems. These systems \ndo not meet program managers' needs and provide inadequate control over \nHUD's housing and community development programs. HUD must get better \ncontrol over its finances and prepare timely financial statements as \nrequired by the CFO Act.\n  Good financial data relies upon the development of effective computer \nsystems and these systems are crucial to HUD's ability to meet its \nhousing mission and business needs. In recent years, the Department has \nobligated over $170 million annually to activities related to \ninformation management. Yet HUD has had a poor history of managing its \ninformation resources, and as a result, is struggling with aging \nsystems that do not adequately meet the agency's needs and are \ncontributing causes of managerial inadequacies.\n  In response to its problems, HUD has undergone dramatic structural \nchanges. In September 1995, HUD completed a major field reorganization \nwhich was intended to eliminate previously confused lines of authority, \nenhance communications, reduce levels of review and approval, and \nimprove customer service. In January 1996, HUD announced additional \nplans to reduce headquarters staff and further streamline its field \norganization by, among other things, closing up to 10 of HUD's 81 field \noffices by the end of fiscal year 1997. However, it is questionable \nwhether these changes have turned the tide as GAO has found that the \nDepartment still has an ineffective organizational structure.\n  The situation is not hopeless. HUD has made some progress in recent \nyears addressing these Departmentwide management deficiencies, but \nsuccess will require top-down management support. I hope Secretary-\ndesignate Cuomo will articulate a management vision that can improve \noperations at HUD and take measures required to take the agency off \nGAO's and Congress' high-risk list. I look forward to working with him \nto achieve those objectives in this Congress and to effectively \nimplement the bipartisan management reforms passed by Congress in \nrecent years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S925-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE PRESIDENT'S CERTIFICATION ON INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on Friday, January 31, the President \nsubmitted to the Congress a certification that merits the support of \nall Members of Congress who wish to see improvements in the quality of \nlife of women and families around the world.\n  The President has certified that the restrictions imposed by Congress \nin the fiscal year 1997 appropriations legislation are ``having a \nnegative impact on the functioning of the population planning \nprogram.'' Congress's approval of that certification would allow fiscal \nyear 1997 family planning funds to be released at a rate of 8 percent \nper month beginning March 1 rather than July 1. Population programs \naround the world have not received any U.S. fiscal year 1997 funding \neven though the fiscal year began October 1, 1996, so approval of this \nresolution would simply reduce the delay of the funds' release from 9 \nmonths to 5.\n  U.S. contributions to family planning programs have immeasurably \nimproved the lives of women in developing countries. The ability to \nplan the size of one's family is essential if women and children are to \nlive longer and healthier lives and if women are to make the \neducational and economic gains they and we wish to see.\n  The Rockefeller Foundation released a report last week documenting \nthe effectiveness of the family planning programs the United States \nsupports. The report noted that the percentage of women in developing \ncountries using contraception in the past three decades has grown from \n10 to 50 percent, and the average number of children they have borne \nhas dropped from 6 to 3.\n  Mr. President, there is a growing clamor that Congress is about to \ncast its first abortion vote of the 105th Congress when it votes on the \nPresident's certification. Nothing could be further from the truth. The \ntruth is that Congress voted to cut U.S. contributions to population \nplanning programs by 35 percent from fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year \n1997 and then imposed a series of harsh metering requirements on the \nrate at which the money could be spent. This vote would simply remove \none of the harshest requirements--that the funding be delayed by an \nadditional 4 months.\n  It is tragic that the impact of these cutbacks and restrictions has \nbeen to increase the number of abortions. At a time when the number of \nwomen of childbearing age is increasing by 2.3 percent, or 24 million, \nper year, the United States is reducing its commitment to programs that \nreduce the incidence of abortion.\n  The close relationship between family planning and abortion is clear. \nIn Russia, for example, the Russian Department of Health reports that \nthe use of contraceptives grew from 19 to 24 percent between 1990 and \n1994 with the establishment of 50 International Planned Parenthood \nFederation affiliates across Russia. During that time period, the \nnumber of abortions performed dropped from 3.6 to 2.8 million. In \nColombia and Mexico, USAID has long been a major donor to their family \nplanning programs. In Bogota, a one-third increase in use of all forms \nof contraception between 1976 and 1986 accompanied a 45-percent drop in \nthe abortion rate. In Mexico City and the surrounding region, the use \nof all forms of contraception increased 24 percent between 1987 and \n1992, while the abortion rate fell 39 percent.\n  Helping to provide women with the means to prevent pregnancy is a far \nbetter alternative than contributing to a situation in which they must \nchoose between bringing a child into the world for whom they too often \nhave neither the physical nor financial means to care, and obtaining an \nabortion that is often illegal and unsafe. No woman wants to face that \nchoice.\n  The statistics clearly document this problem. UNICEF's 1996 ``The \nProgress of Nations'' reported that each year, 600,000 women die of \npregnancy-related causes, 75,000 of them associated with self-induced, \nunsafe abortions. These women leave behind at least 1 million \nmotherless children. In addition, an estimated 34,000 children under \nage 5 in developing countries die every day--a number that would surely \ndecline if mothers were able to space the births of their children to \nimprove the health and nutrition they can provide them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Presidential certification to \nreduce the most onerous restrictions on U.S. contributions to \ninternational family planning programs when it comes up for a vote this \nmonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S926-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S926-S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONSTRUCTION OF THE CLEAR CREEK COMPOSITE BRIDGE\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today, I wish to extend my congratulations \nto the University of Kentucky, the Kentucky Transportation Center, the \nGreat Lakes Composite Consortium, the U.S. Forest Service, and other \ncomposites manufacturers on the completion of the Clear Creek Composite \nBridge in Bath County, KY, located in the Daniel Boone National Forest. \nThis pedestrian bridge is the first of its kind in the world, and the \nsuccessful creation of this bridge stems from a creative design, and a \ngreat deal of research.\n  The Clear Creek Bridge is a 60-foot composite bridge, which is \nlightweight,\n\n[[Page S927]]\n\nmaintenance free, and most importantly, unobtrusive in its environment. \nDr. Issam E. Harik, a professor of civil engineering, along with \ngraduate students Pete Szak and Brad Robson of the University of \nKentucky, were the research team that designed and constructed this \nvisually appealing and structurally sound bridge.\n  The research and development of the technology which allowed the \nconstruction of this pedestrian bridge are essential for a competitive \nand strong economy, particularly with respect to the use of composite \nmaterials. The lightweight, maintenance-free bridges of the future are \na welcomed change to current engineering practices, which will save \ntaxpayers money.\n  Construction material and maintenance costs surrounding today's \ninfrastructure needs are significant, and increasing rapidly. \nParticularly in this year, as Congress begins discussion of the \nreauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct, it is important to identify new processes which will allow the \nNation to maintain our roadways and bridges at a more affordable rate \nthan is currently possible.\n  It is my understanding that a major reason for the creation of this \npedestrian bridge was to validate the concept of construction of \ncomposite vehicular bridges. I encourage the dedicated engineers who \nworked on this project to remain committed to their research and it is \nmy hope that the people of Kentucky and throughout the country, will be \ndriving over composite bridges sometime in the very near future. These \nwill truly be the bridges of and to, the 21st century.\n  Other special recognition goes to Northwestern University in \nEvanston, IL; the Morison Molded Fiber Glass Co. of Bristol, VA; Owens \nCorning of Toledo, OH; Ashland Chemical in Columbus, OH, and Zoltek \nCorp. of St. Louis, MO. This is an example of the private sector, \nuniversities, and Federal Government working together to form a strong \nand successful partnership.\n  I commend and thank the University of Kentucky team and U.S. Forest \nService for their determination and hard work in building this historic \nbridge.

Mr. President, it is easy for both elected officials and \ncommenters to refer to all knowledge as residing outside the beltway.\n  It has been my experience that some of the greatest wealth of \nknowledge, experience, and ability represented in this country is \ninside the beltway. Rarely enough does that talent get recognized.\n  An exception, is the recognition in the Washington Post of the \nextraordinary talent of Anne Dibble Jordan. Mrs. Jordan was the cochair \nof the last Presidential inaugural of the 20th century.\n  It is my privilege to know this extraordinary woman and her noted \nhusband, Vernon Jordan. Anne Jordan is one of those people who makes it \npossible for Washington and our Government to present a face worth \nseeing by the rest of the world. In fact for those who have come to \nknow her, it is hard to think of anything she could not achieve.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 18, 1997]\n\nThe Woman Behind the Curtain--Monday Is Ann Jordan's Big Day--You Won't \n                         Even Know She's There\n\n                          (By Roxanne Roberts)\n\n       It's the middle of a news conference at the Foreign Press \n     Center. Ann Dibble Jordan and Terry McAuliffe, the chairmen \n     of the Presidential Inaugural Committee sit on a stage \n     briefing dozens of reporters from around the world about the \n     seemingly endless list of celebratory events.\n       McAuliffe pops off with enthusiastic sound bites, jumping \n     in to answer virtually every question. Jordan sits quietly, \n     carefully offering written remarks. If there were an award \n     for the inaugural chairman with the lowest possible profile, \n     Jordan would win--hands down.\n       Her face is dominated by her red-framed glasses. She wears \n     simple gold jewelry, a plain black dress and carriers an \n     inexpensive Le Sportsac purse.\n       ``I hate interviews. I hate publicity,'' she says later. \n     ``My husband tells me I'm the most private person he knows.''\n       Herein lies the intriguing contradiction of Ann Jordan: a \n     very private person who lives a very public life. Her husband \n     is the much-respected and much-feared lawyer Vernon Jordan, \n     power broker extraordinaire. The Jordans are on the A-list of \n     every Washington social event, serve on numerous corporate \n     and charitable boards, and count a vast number of powerful \n     people as friends--including the president and first lady. \n     Indeed, Vernon Jordan is a favorite golfing buddy of Bill \n     Clinton; the couples are so close they had Christmas Eve \n     dinner together.\n       Shortly after the election, Clinton picked up the telephone \n     and called Ann Jordan. ``I need your help,'' said the \n     president, who asked that she accept the unpaid co-\n     chairmanship. It was an offer she couldn't refuse.\n       ``I didn't think I'd be doing all of this, I tell you,'' \n     she says. ``I thought I'd just be a worker. But I had worked \n     in the previous inaugural, and I'd seen a lot of the things \n     that probably would be helpful in doing this.''\n       Jordan, 62, came aboard just before Thanksgiving, with an \n     eye to creating a structure that was ``open and honest.'' \n     This year, there are no fund-raising responsibilities, so the \n     job of chairman is primarily one of oversight: meetings every \n     morning to go over all the plans, defining goals, and signing \n     off on major decisions and expenditures. When a final \n     decision had to be made, said committee members, it was often \n     Jordan whose judgment carried the day.\n       And there are also news conferences--Jordan's least \n     favorite part of the job.\n       ``She doesn't crave the limilight,'' says co-chairman \n     McAuliffe. ``She's just been a joy to work with. She and I \n     have not had one disagreement in the past two months.''\n       ``I am absolutely, totally impressed and in awe of her,'' \n     says Harold Ickes, who is coordinating inaugural plans from \n     the White House. ``It is not unusual for someone of her \n     social position to take the job and be sort of honorary about \n     it, sweeping in and out. She does not throw her weight \n     around, although--God knows--she knows everyone in\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\n     Washington and can get anyone on the phone at the drop of a \n     hat.''\n       Of course, in Washington one expects the customary \n     compliments from colleagues. But the genuine exuberance for \n     Jordan goes beyond the predictable.\n       Jordan describes herself as ``quite low-key . . . I know \n     what my limits are.'' She doesn't mention the gala with \n     Princess Diana or her vacations on Martha's Vineyard with the \n     Clintons. She doesn't bring up the dinner at her home four \n     years ago--the president-elect's first Washington party--or \n     the fact that she sent cyclamens to all her neighbors \n     apologizing for any inconvenience it may have caused.\n       Her official biography for the inauguration is three short \n     paragraphs.\n       ``She's raised in the old school,'' says events planner \n     Carolyn Peachey, a close friend. ``Your name is in the \n     newspaper three times: born, married, died.''\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton calls her ``a woman of many \n     talents.'' Jordan's work on the inaugural committee, says the \n     first lady, highlights her ``wonderful'' organizational and \n     management skills. ``What I think I like most about her is \n     her warm friendship, coupled with her marvelous sense of \n     humor.''\n       Vernon Jordan is not in the habit of discussing his \n     personal life with the press. But he is downright effusive \n     when it comes to his wife of 10 years.\n       ``She's smart, independent, caring, loyal,'' he says. ``She \n     is my best friend in the world.'' The suggestion that she is \n     shy produces Jordan's famed booming laugh. ``She's not shy at \n     all. She just keeps her own counsel. And she is in many ways \n     a very private person, which is one of her more admirable \n     qualities.''\n       Nonetheless, it is difficult to be an entirely private \n     person if one happens to be married to one of the most \n     influential--and socially gregarious--men in the city. It is \n     ``just nonsense,'' says Jordan, to even suggest that his wife \n     was asked to chair the inauguration because of his friendship \n     with the first couple.\n       ``I think she did this out of a sense of duty and \n     responsibility,'' he says. ``She loves to make things work \n     right. And it's an honor, and I think she views it that \n     way.''\n       There is, in fact, a long history of public service in her \n     life. She was born in Tuskegee, Ala., one of five children of \n     a surgeon who ran the only hospital in the city that treated \n     black patients.\n       Jordan attended prep school and then went to Vassar, where \n     she was one of four black students. She was so fair-skinned \n     that she had to tell classmates she was black. ``You didn't \n     want to have a conversation where you had to get up and walk \n     out,'' she says. ``Once you say it, you don't have to tell \n     many more. It goes around quickly.''\n       She took graduate courses in social work at the University \n     of Chicago and later taught there and served as head of \n     social services at the university's medical center. She \n     married, had four children and divorced 11 years later. She \n     stayed in Chicago, working full time and raising her \n     children. ``I was used to running my own life,'' she says.\n       That life was shaken by the 1981 death of a daughter in a \n     car accident. ``I think it makes you just stop and relive \n     your life,'' says Jordan. ``I mean, you think about your life \n     and what's important, and it changes it.''\n       Her other children--now in their thirties--were grown when \n     she married Vernon in 1986. They had met years earlier \n     while both were working with the Urban League. His first \n     wife, Shirley, died of multiple sclerosis in 1985.\n       ``What I like best about him is when we sit down to talk--\n     he's very interested,'' she says. ``And he's fun to be with. \n     He's totally unpredictable.''\n       And Vernon Jordan says, ``When I want to get it straight, I \n     talk to Ann.''\n       And then he adds the one-liner of every clever husband: \n     ``The fact is that I married up.''\n       Her new husband brought to the marriage the lifestyle of a \n     wealthy, powerful man in this town. ``It was sort of nice to \n     enjoy the free time of living in Washington,'' she says. ``It \n     also allowed me to pursue a lot of my own interests. I was \n     very busy. And Vernon is a very--to say the least--he's \n     fun.''\n       Being married to Jordan also brought invitations to every \n     important social event in Washington, including the state \n     dinner for South African President Nelson Mandela. ``It was \n     one of the great thrills of my life,'' she says. Mandela told \n     her ``a very funny story about his life after he got out of \n     prison. . . . I'm certainly grateful for those kinds of \n     opportunities.''\n       Aside from inaugural duties, Jordan's time these days is \n     devoted to her five grandchildren (all under 5 years old), \n     volunteering in the White House social office and serving on \n     various boards: WETA, Sasha Bruce Youthworks, the Kennedy \n     Center and the Child Welfare League of America.\n       She has settled into her life in the nation's capital, but \n     her affection for Chicago is such that she travels there as \n     often as once a month. ``It's a wonderful city and people \n     don't realize it.'' Washington, she says, ``is a wonderful \n     city of live in. I mean for living purposes, it's very easy \n     to get around, the weather's wonderful, and very interesting \n     people here.''\n       It was Jordan who pushed to include residents of Washington \n     in more inaugural activities. She is most excited about the \n     public events on the Mall, and she was instrumental in \n     bringing ``King,'' the musical tribute to Martin Luther King \n     Jr., to the celebration.\n       ``I love the fact that it can be open,'' she says. ``Not \n     only just free events, but very well done free events.'' She \n     hopes to find time to drop by the children's tent for the \n     storytellers: ``My grandchildren want to see it.''\n       Jordan doesn't mention the glamour of the inaugural balls. \n     She'll attend five or six, wearing a dress that she's had a \n     long time. ``I wear it every year to the Kennedy Center,'' \n     she says. ``It's a black velvet dress that has--I don't know \n     what you'd call 'em, not rhinestones but sort of sparkly'' \n     decor on the shoulders. ``I love the dress.''\n       On that night, her husband says simply that he'll be doing \n     ``whatever she says.''\n       And afterward, instead of all the exclusive after-ball \n     parties, you might see the inaugural chairman celebrating at \n     . . . McDonald's.\n       ``That's my favorite,'' she says. ``A Quarter-Pounder \n     without cheese. Then they have to cook it fresh. We're there \n     all the time.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S927-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I came to this floor and spoke \nof an event that happened in the late 1930's in Montpelier, VT, the \ncapital of Vermont, the city where I was born. I will recount that only \nbriefly because we have the state of the Union message tonight. I hope \nit may be instructive to some.\n  In the late 1930's, then-President Franklin Roosevelt visited \nVermont. To put this in context, during the Roosevelt landslide, \nPresident Roosevelt carried all States but two: the State of Maine and \nthe State of Vermont. We were not a hotbed of Democratic action, \nVermont.\n  The president of the National Life Insurance Co. of Vermont was \nstanding on State Street. That building was directly across the street \nfrom where my family lived. He was standing next to my father, who was \nprobably the lone Democrat in Montpelier.\n  President Roosevelt's car went by, and the president of National \nLife, an ardent, lifelong, fervent, and proud Republican, stood at \nattention, took his hat off, and held it over his heart as a mark of \nrespect, as did other men on the street.\n  My father, who knew him well, chided him a little bit and said, ``I \nnever thought I'd see the day you would salute Franklin Roosevelt.'' He \nturned to my father and said, ``Howard, I didn't salute Franklin \nRoosevelt. I saluted the President of the United States.'' As a child I \nremember that same gentleman repeating the story to me in my father's \npresence.\n  I mention this because he was also very proud of the fact that he was \none of the ones who, as he said, voted for sanity when he voted for Alf \nLandon and not Franklin Roosevelt.\n  In a way it reflects a different time, but in many ways, a good time. \nThe United States was, in the late 1930's, approaching our eventual \nentry into World War II, when we had to pull together. We also showed \nthat we respected our institutions.\n  Tonight there will be some of us who agree and some of us who \ndisagree with what President Clinton says in the state of the Union \nmessage. I hope that in expressing both our agreements and our \ndisagreements we will resolve that there are three great institutions \ndeserving our civil respect in this country: the institution of the \nPresidency; the institution of the Congress itself, which is demeaned \nwhen we do things that harm or degrade it; and the institution of the \njudiciary.\n  This great democracy exists because of the respect of its people for \nthese three institutions. This great democracy is diminished if we, \nespecially we in the Senate, diminish any of these. Debate, yes; but \nrespect our institutions, also, yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S928-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S928-S934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONCERNING THE NEED FOR ACCURATE GUIDELINES FOR BREAST CANCER SCREENING\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for such \ntime as she may consume under the previous order.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to offer a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution in conjunction with my colleague, the Senator from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, who has been a longtime advocate, proponent of \nadvancing women's health in America. We responded to the January 23 \ndecision that was made by the advisory panel to the National Cancer \nInstitute that recommended that women should refrain from having \nmammograms in their forties.\n  I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, the assistant \nmajority leader, Senator Nickles, and Senator Jeffords, chairman of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee for their assistance in getting \nthis resolution to the floor so quickly. I would also want to thank the \nDemocratic leader and my friends on both sides of the aisle for \nallowing us to consider this resolution under a unanimous-consent \nagreement. Breast cancer is an issue that transcends party and \npolitics.\n  My resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that NCI should \nconduct studies to determine, once and for all, the true benefit of \nmammograms for women in their forties. It also urges the Advisory Board \nto NCI, which will meet later this month, to consider reissuing the \nmammography guideline it rescinded in 1993 recommending that women in \ntheir forties seek routine mammograms. NCI must put an end to the \nunfortunate confusion that may cost some women their very lives.\n  Breast cancer is one of the most pressing public health crises facing \nAmerican women today, striking one in every eight women during their \nlifetime. It will strike 180,000 American women this year, and kill \n44,000 women--more than 10,000 of whom will be diagnosed with breast \ncancer in their forties. For women in this age group, it is the leading \nkiller, and more women this year will be diagnosed with cancer in their \nforties than in their fifties.\n  Mammograms are the most powerful weapon we have in the fight against \nbreast cancer. They enable us to detect and treat breast cancer at its \nearliest stages when the tumors are too tiny to be detected by a woman \nor her doctor, providing a better prognosis for treatment. An estimated \n23.5 million mammograms were performed in 1992 at a cost of \napproximately $2.5 billion--a valuable downpayment in our fight against \nan unmerciful killer.\n  The question about whether women in their forties should seek regular \nmammograms has been an open question for years. On January 23, an NCI \nconsensus panel decided not to recommend that women in their forties \nseek routine mammograms. To justify their position, they argued that \nthe costs associated with routine mammograms for women in this age \ngroup potentially exceed the benefits. In making its decision, the \npanel gave undue weight to hypothetical risks, such as false-negative \nresults that potentially provide women with a false sense of security, \nfalse-positive results that produce unnecessary anxiety, the potential \nfor overtreatment, and radiation exposure.\n  If we ever hope to improve survival rates for breast cancer, women of \nall ages must receive accurate and consistent information regarding the \nimportance of mammograms. Women and their doctors look to the Nation's \npreeminent cancer research institution--the National Cancer Institute--\nfor clear guidance and advice on this issue.\n  Confusion on this issue is not new. In 1989, NCI, along with the \nAmerican Cancer Society and the American Medical Association, issued \nbreast cancer screening guidelines which advised women to begin having \nmammograms at age 40. In 1993, NCI rescinded these guidelines, stating \nthat their review of clinical trials produced no evidence that \nmammograms significantly reduced breast cancer deaths for women in \ntheir forties. At the time, Congress and many experts questioned the \nappropriateness of this conclusion, based on the available scientific \nevidence. This is when I first introduced legislation urging NCI to \nreexamine this issue.\n  By rescinding its guideline, NCI produced widespread confusion and \nconcern among women and physicians regarding the appropriate age at \nwhich to seek mammograms. This confusion eroded public confidence in \nmammography. It also reinforced the information barrier which \ndiscourages women from seeking care. Four years later, we are still \nmired in this controversy.\n  Yet new studies strongly suggest that routine mammograms for women in \ntheir forties can save lives. For example, investigators found a 24-\npercent lower death rate among women who received mammograms in their \nforties when the world's population-based trials were combined; and \nSwedish researchers in 1996 in two studies found a 44- and 36-percent \nlower death rate among women who received mammograms in their forties. \nAnd several studies have concluded that breast tumors in women under 50 \ngrow far more rapidly than breast cancer in older women, suggesting \nthat annual mammograms are of value to women in their forties.\n\n  In studying the research and scrutinizing the statistics, the panel \nappears to have lost sight of the human dimension of this question, and \ngave undue weight to the costs of screening, rather than the benefits. \nThe panel emphasized that 2,500 women would have to be screened to save \none life. But this 1 life represents someone's mother, wife, sister, or \ndaughter.\n  The panel also emphasized that up to one-fourth of all invasive \nbreast cancers are not detected by mammography in women in their \nforties. Yet, the flip side of this statistic is that three-fourths of \nall cancers in this age group are detected through mammography. While \nit may not be perfect, that clearly amounts to saved lives.\n  Finally, the NCI Panel also overemphasizes the risks of false-\npositives, suggesting that many women would undergo unnecessary \nsurgical procedures. Yet, most women with positive findings \nsubsequently undergo more refined diagnostic tests, including \ndiagnostic mammograms, ultrasounds, and needle biopsies to confirm the \npresence of cancer, before any treatment decisions are made.\n  Appropriately, the Director of NCI, Dr. Richard Klausner, expressed \nhis surprise and disappointment over the decision of the consensus \npanel, and has asked the NCI Advisory Board to convene next month to \nrevisit this issue. Former NIH Director, Dr. Bernadine Healy, affirmed \nhis views.\n  I am asking the Senate to consider my resolution today because women \nand physicians deserve to have guidance on this issue. My resolution \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that NCI should conduct studies to \ndetermine, once and for all, the true benefit of mammograms for women \nin their forties. It also urges NCI's Advisory Board, which will meet \nlater this month, to consider reissuing the mammography guidelines it \nrescinded in 1993 which recommended that women in their forties seek \nroutine mammograms. Alternatively, NCI should direct women to other \norganizations which have issued clear guidelines on the issue, such as \nthe American Cancer Society. This resolution does not dictate science--\nit simply helps to provide women with clearer guidance as they look to \nanswer a potentially life or death question--should they get mammograms \nin their forties?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution and am pleased to be a cosponsor of the resolution \nwith my distinguished colleague, Senator Snowe of Maine. Senator Snowe \nhas been an outstanding advocate for many years on the issue of women's \nhealth. This is yet one more action on her part that shows her deep \ncommitment in this area.\n  Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I am pleased \nto tell you that my colleagues in the Democratic caucus join with us on \na bipartisan basis and have endorsed this. All six Democratic women \nhave cosponsored this legislation. Over 30 of the men that we call the \n``Galahads'' also cosponsored this resolution.\n  What does this resolution call for? It calls for three things that \nwould protect women's health, particularly in the area of breast \ncancer. No. 1, it calls for further research on the benefits of \nmammograms for women in their forties; No. 2, it urges the public to \nfollow screening guidelines issued by medical groups which call for \nmammography\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\nscreenings in women between the ages of 40 and 49; and it calls upon \nthe National Cancer Institute to again revisit the guidelines that they \nthemselves promulgated, also urging that women who are between the ages \nof 40 and 49 seek mammograms.\n  We already have clearly on the record, and clear guidelines have \nestablished, that women over 50 should get an annual mammogram. It is \nclear that often the older you get, the more likely you are to get \nbreast cancer. But there is a particular group of women between ages 40 \nand 49 who are particularly prone to breast cancer, and each day we are \nlearning more who that category is. Therefore, we are urging through \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution that traditional guidelines urging \nannual or, at the very least, biannual mammograms for women between the \nages of 40 and 49 be pursued.\n  I could not believe when an NIH advisory panel decided that women in \nthis age group might not need mammograms, and at the very best, they \nwere either silent or tepid in their recommendations. They made this \ndecision because they felt there was not substantial evidence that this \ngroup was at risk. This flies in the face of what we know through \nstudies done at the National Institutes of Health, through extramural \nprograms at our great academic centers of excellence, and also in \nworldwide studies of women. The NIH panel should have recognized, also, \nthe weight that their announcement carries. This panel absolutely \nconfused the public, scared women, and gave permission to insurance \ncompanies not to pay for a mammogram for a woman between the ages of 40 \nand 49.\n  Mr. President, we think this creates a public health concern. Now, \nwhy would we believe that? First, women often have been reluctant to \nseek a mammogram either out of fear or because they do not have the \nFederal resources to do it. We have been working on education to deal \nexactly with those issues and even to offer opportunities for women to \nbe able to have funding for this. Also, we have been engaged in an \nimpressive and assertive effort to educate primary care physicians in \nurging women to get mammograms.\n  We have been dealing with the insurance companies on the whole issue \nof breast cancer. Now some companies have that misguided approach of \ninsisting that women leave a hospital in less than 48 hours after they \nhave had a mastectomy. Mr. President, we say enough is enough. We \nshould take time out, go back to our science, go back to our research, \ngo back to the National Institutes of Health and ask them to come up \nwith the recommendations that we need. We are urging them to do that. \nNot only are we urging them to do that, but the actual Director of the \nNational Cancer Institute, Dr. Richard Klausner, is also recommending \nthat this advisory board go back and take another look.\n  Senator Snowe has talked about the risk of cancer. We all know that \nany woman can fall prey to breast cancer. It does not matter how old \nshe is or what her income bracket is. We know she needs to be screened. \nWe know 40,000 women die every year of breast cancer. We know over \n138,000 women every year have some early signs of breast cancer. What \nwe are saying on behalf of the women and the men who support us, let us \ngo back to our standards.\n\n  I am happy to have joined in this resolution because I know that \nmammograms save lives. And if breast cancer is detected early, the \nprobability that a woman will survive is greater than 90 percent. My \nposition is simple: Stick to science, go to the guidelines that were \nproperly promulgated, listen to doctors and other health care providers \nworking in this field.\n  Mr. President, for some time we have been working in a bipartisan \nbicameral basis on this. I remember back in the House of \nRepresentatives when Senator Snowe and I introduced one of the first \nWomen's Health Equity Act's that we called for activity in this area. \nWe have been working on that ever since, on a bipartisan bicameral \nbasis, and not only with the women taking the lead, but with the \nenthusiastic support of the men in our body.\n  Thanks to the work of Senators Snowe, Mikulski, and Boxer, and \nRepresentative Morella and others, we have established the Office of \nWomen's Health at NIH. We made more money for research available for \ndiseases most affecting women. We ensured that women were included in \nthe protocols of medical research, where they had been excluded not \nbecause of science but because of gender. We worked to expand the \ncoverage for mammograms under Medicare and even provided funds for low-\nincome women to get mammograms. We also have led the fight for \nmammogram quality standards, which we will be reintroducing as it \nexpires. We hope to do this together, to show that when it comes to \nfighting for women's health, we are there. We want to make sure that \neach family is able to ensure that breast cancer does not strike them. \nWe are going to do it not only on a bipartisan basis, we are going to \ndo it on a nonpartisan basis.\n  I thank Senator Snowe for taking the lead on this as she has done in \nso many other areas. We are pleased on our side of the aisle to also \njoin with her.\n  I send to the desk the list of the Democratic cosponsors. I look \nforward to voting for this bill and continuing our advocacy on this \nmost crucial issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the sponsors will be added \nto the bill as requested by the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. SNOWE. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 9 minutes and 33 \nseconds remaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I just respond to the Senator from Maryland by commending \nher for her very strong statement, her commitment, and a resoluteness \nto this issue in the hope that women get the best health care in \nAmerica. She has shown strong leadership on this issue throughout the \nyears. As she mentioned, we worked on women's health issues beginning \nin the House of Representatives in making some extraordinary changes \nwithin the National Institutes of Health to create an Office of Women's \nHealth, which was absolutely vital because women were excluded--as well \nas minorities, I might add--from clinical studies.\n  I thank the Senator and commend her for all she has done on behalf of \nwomen.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nresolution. For 2 weeks, like many Americans, I was disturbed by the \nnews that the National Institutes of Health would not recommend regular \nmammograms for women in their forties.\n  Mr. President, we have to call this a deadly and silent disease. The \nfact is, cancer is the leading cause of death for women between the \nages of 40 to 55. Mr. President, this statistic itself should dictate \nthat women in their forties should have regular mammograms. It only \nmakes common sense that they should. My worry is that without the \nNational Institutes of Health's recommendation, women will be lulled \ninto a false sense of security and believing that they do not need a \nmammogram, and that doctors may not always recommend that women in \ntheir forties have one.\n  The last thing we need to say to women juggling family, career, and \nall of the problems they are faced with, is that this can wait. If we \nlead them to believe that, then they will let it wait, and they will \nface dire consequences when they do.\n  Too often when these matters are debated, the fact that we are \ntalking about the lives of people, the lives of wives, mothers, \ndaughters, and friends--by remaining silent on this issue, we are \nputting their health at risk. I thank Senator Snowe for bringing this \nissue to the floor. It is one that deserves national attention and \ncertainly the attention of the Senate. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the resolution. I thank Senator Snowe for bringing it to \nthe Nation's attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I now yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison] is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Snowe and \nSenator Mikulski. All of the women in the Senate are cosponsoring this \nresolution. I will never forget 2 years ago\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\nwhen Senator Mikulski called a hearing of all of the women in the \nSenate on the first time we saw there was a question by the National \nInstitutes of Health about whether women should have screening before \nthe age of 50. All of us, resoundingly, came together and said, ``Of \ncourse they should.'' Now we have new Members in the Senate--Senator \nSnowe, Senator Collins, Senator Landrieu, who have joined us in a \nunanimous verdict, which is that the women of this country deserve \nbetter.\n  The women of this country deserve to know the facts. The facts are \nthat the studies have come in. In 1995, a study showed a 24-percent \nlower death rate among women who received mammograms in their forties. \nThat was an American study. In 1996, Swedish researchers, in two \nstudies, found a 44-percent and a 36-percent lower death rate among \nwomen who received mammograms in their forties.\n  So why are we getting a mixed message? Why aren't all of the experts \ncoming together on an issue that is killing more women in their forties \nthan any other disease? The women of America have no guidelines. They \nhave no guidelines because we can't get our doctors to do what they do \nfor every other medicine and every other disease that I can think of, \nand that is to say we can have a 24-percent lower death rate of the \nwomen in this country in the 40-to-49 age bracket if we will have \nmammograms. But there is a slight chance, perhaps less than 1 percent, \nthat having a mammogram might induce cancer.\n  Now, I think we are intelligent enough to receive the full facts and \nnot have a mixed message. That is not a mixed message. When we can save \nthousands of lives by having mammograms between the ages 40 and 49, and \nthere is a, perhaps, less than 1 percent chance that it might be a \ndanger, let's give women the facts without a muddled message. That is \nwhat this resolution does today. It says to the women of our country, \nvery clearly, that their chances of surviving breast cancer are \ninfinitely better, and all the studies show it, if they will have a \nmammogram, starting at the age of 35 or 40, every 2 years, and then \nwhen you are 50, every year. It is very simple. The women of this \ncountry deserve to know that their chances are a heck of a lot better \nif they will have this procedure done.\n  Now, something that you all have not mentioned yet, which I worry \nabout very much, is that now that we have this mixed, garbled message, \nare insurance companies going to step forward and say, now, wait a \nminute, maybe we should not cover mammograms? Is this going to open the \ndoor to questions as to whether this very basic preventive procedure \nwill be available to the women of this country?\n  We must speak with a certain voice today in saying to all of our \nhealth institutes: Come forward and give us leadership. You are the \nexperts. I think we can take the facts, and I think we can save the \nlives of thousands of women if we will say exactly what all of the \nstatistics show, which is to take care of yourself. Have a mammogram, \nstarting at the age of 35 or 40, every 2 years, and then, at 50, every \nyear. Let's not even introduce the option of insurance perhaps not \ncovering this kind of preventive procedure that is killing more women \nbetween the ages of 40 and 49 than any other disease in this country.\n\n  So I commend all of my women colleagues and friends for coming \ntogether, along with all of the men cosponsoring this amendment and ask \nfor a unanimous vote today at 5 o'clock supporting this, urging experts \nto help the women of our country protect themselves.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 6 minutes 44 \nseconds. The Senator from Maine has 1 minute 40 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I reserve my time. Senator Specter has 10 minutes on \nhis own time. I have no objection to his proceeding.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the pending resolution because \nit focuses attention on the need for mammograms that would give the \nimprimatur of the U.S. Senate to this important medical testing device. \nI, with many other Americans, was very surprised when, on January 23, a \nreport was issued questioning the advisability of mammograms with the \nessential finding that there was not enough evidence that women in \ntheir forties would benefit by advising them to have the x-ray test as \npart of routine health screening. The question which then came to my \nmind was whether there was enough evidence to conclude that women in \ntheir forties would not benefit from the mammograms as part of routine \nhealth screening.\n  To articulate the conclusion in the form that there was not \nsufficient evidence to show that women would benefit is really not to \nanswer the question, because where the evidence may be in doubt in the \nminds of some scientists, the practical sense conclusion is that there \nis very, very substantial evidence to show that mammograms are helpful \nand that underlying a decision not to have mammography is a question \nabout cost-benefit ratio and a question about certain collateral \nissues, which need not necessarily be faced, as to whether there will \nbe unnecessary biopsies.\n  This matter struck home with me especially, because in 1993, when I \nsought an MRI examination of my head, I was told by the doctors that I \ndid not need it. I then insisted on having it, and they found a \npotentially life-threatening problem, which was corrected after I got \nthe MRI. There is an attitude in many quarters that unless the burden \nof proof rises to a certain level, and perhaps a very high level, these \ntests ought not to be given. I think that is the wrong standard of \nevaluation.\n  Mammograms are expensive; MRI's are expensive. But I am convinced, \nfrom the work I have done as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Health and Human Services, that we have enough \nmammography equipment and enough specialists and enough administrators \nand enough MRI machines, et cetera, to conduct the necessary tests. It \nmay be necessary to do them in the evening. If an MRI costs $800 at a \nconvenient time during the day, maybe it could be accomplished at 2 \na.m. or 3 a.m. for $50, with a margin of cost as to what it would take.\n\n  When this report came down on January 23, 12 days ago, I immediately \nscheduled a hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and \nHuman Services. Tomorrow we will be hearing from the people who came to \nthe conclusion that mammograms are not warranted for women in their \nforties, and we will also be hearing from people who have reached the \nopposite conclusion.\n  I think it is very significant that Dr. Richard D. Klausner, Director \nof the National Cancer Institute, expressed shock when he heard of this \nreport that mammograms were not warranted for women in their forties.\n  Dr. Bernadine Healy, former Director of NIH, made this succinct \nstatement: ``What are they saying--that ignorance is bliss?''\n  Dr. Daniel B. Kopans of the Harvard Medical School said the \ncommittee's report was ``fraudulent,'' which was the way he termed it.\n  And if you take a look at this issue historically, in 1977, the \nNational Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society recommended \nthat women 40 to 49 have mammograms only if their mothers or sisters \nhad breast cancer. In 1980, the Cancer Society recommended that one-\ntime mammograms for women 35 to 40 were warranted to establish a \nbaseline for future measurements for women under 50. In 1983, the \nCancer Society recommended that symptom-free women 40 to 49 have \nmammograms every 1 or 2 years.\n  In 1987, the Cancer Institute adopted a working guideline to begin \nscreening women age 40 with mammograms every 1 to 2 years. In 1989, \nthose guidelines were officially adopted by a conference of leading \ncancer organizations.\n  Then, in 1993, the National Cancer Institute changed the \nrecommendation, saying ``Experts do not agree on the value of routine \nscreening of mammography of women ages 40 to 49.'' They do not agree \nthat women in that age category ought not to have mammograms. And I say \non the face of this record with succinct evidence that women do benefit \nfrom mammograms. Even though there is conflicting evidence, we ought to \nerr on the side of safety,\n\n[[Page S932]]\n\nand mammograms ought to be available.\n  But when there is a national report questioning the value for women \n40 to 49, immediately it is going to send shock waves to the women of \nAmerica who will say, ``Well, maybe I do not really need a mammogram.''\n  It is very difficult to get some people to take medical tests because \npeople very understandably, very naturally, are afraid of the results. \nIf you have this conclusion from a group of experts that you really \nought not to have it, that it is not a matter of necessity, then women \nare not going to take it. Where you have this kind of report too, those \nwho are responsible for paying for mammograms are going to have a good \nreason to say, ``We are not going to cover mammograms for women in the \n40 to 49 category.''\n  When we have the hearing in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health \nand Human Services tomorrow it will be a rather unusual hearing as far \nas I am concerned. Most of the time we have these hearings to answer \nquestions. This is one hearing that I am approaching with the fixed \nopinion from all that I have studied in the past to really find a \ndirection so that the National Cancer Institute will take whatever \nsteps are necessary to resolve this issue in favor of having \nmammograms. It is simply not sufficient to say on the evidence that \nwhen there is conflicting evidence we are going to reject mammograms \nfor women in the 40 to 49 age category.\n  In addition, I think that the National Cancer Institute ought to be \ndoing more on multiinstitutional testing of MRI's on imaging. Last \nyear, with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency and a special \ncontribution made with the help of then-Director John Deutch, some $2 \nmillion was put up by the CIA for imaging processes on the proposition \nthat if the CIA could image and detect through clouds and look to the \nEarth to find out what was going on that those processes could be \nhelpful in the detection of breast cancer.\n\n  So I compliment my distinguished colleague from Maine and my \ndistinguished colleague from Maryland for their leadership.\n  I would like to add that for the National Institutes of Health \nbudget, specific research funding for women was added that Senator \nHarkin, then-chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and \nHuman Services, and I as ranking member, supported. I must say that I \nlike it better to be chairman and have Senator Harkin as ranking \nmember. But there has been very considerable attention to this issue \nnot only by our very distinguished women Senators but many on the male \nside as well.\n  I hope that the vote this afternoon--and I am confident that it will \nbe, knowing our colleagues on issues of this sort--will be a resounding \nvote to send a message to the women of America that they ought to get \nmammograms, that they ought to protect their health, and that where it \nis an open question as to whether it is cost-effective, let us err on \nthe side of taking the test.\n  I say that with some substantial experience in the field of having \nundergone a test that the experts said I didn't need, which for me was \na life-saving procedure.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of this important \nresolution which expresses the sense of the Senate that further \nresearch is necessary to determine the benefits of mammography in women \nages 40 to 49.\n  Mr. President, I have been very involved with mammography issues in \nAlaska and have worked with my wife Nancy to promote access to this \nimportant diagnostic tool. I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention the work my wife Nancy, and others, has promoted on behalf of \nthe Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska.\n  The Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska had its beginnings in \n1974 when seven Fairbanks women decided that health care for women, \nespecially in the area of breast cancer, should be made more accessible \nand less expensive for residents who live in remote areas of Alaska. In \n1976, with very humble beginnings, the center opened its doors in \nFairbanks, staffed and equipped by volunteers. The State granted the \nmoneys for a GE mammography machine and a local bank loaned the \nbasement of a drive-in branch for the clinic offices. Furniture, \ncarpeting, and paint was donated by local merchants, and a nurse-\nadministrator, radiologist, and two doctors volunteered their services. \nBreast examination was taught and recommended mammograms were provided \nfree of charge.\n  Today, the center, housed in a very spacious office, is staffed by an \nexecutive director, two office personnel, a certified mammographer, and \na radiologist. The lo-rad mammography machine is one of the finest in \nthe State. The center still maintains the policy of waiving a fee for \nwomen who cannot afford to pay or do not have insurance.\n  With the unwavering support of the Fairbank community the center has \nbeen operating for 20 years with donations, insurance, and fundraisers \nby local service organizations.\n  Three years ago, the executive director informed the board of \ndirectors that a new mammography machine was needed to keep up with \nadvancing technology. Nancy and I offered to do a fundraising fishing \nevent in southeastern Alaska to benefit the center. At that first \nevent, Waterfall '94, over $140,000 was raised for the breast cancer \ncenter and completely offset the cost of the new state-of-the-art lo-\nrad mammography unit.\n  Because of the overwhelming success of Waterfall '94, we decided to \nhold a similar event the following year to again benefit the center. \nNancy, one of the original founders of the center, had long desired to \nhave a mobile mammogram van to serve the Yukon River system villages, \nand the rural bush communities of Alaska. Waterfall '95 made that dream \ncome true with a donation of $210,000 to the center. Waterfall '96 will \nbenefit the center with an approximate $240,000 donation. Plans are \nalready in place for the Waterfall '97 event with plans to incorporate \nprostate PSA tests, and to do cervical cancer checks as well.\n  The Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska now visits remote bush \nvillages along the river system and the highways with a 43-foot van \nequipped with a mammogram unit and darkroom with a film processor, two \ndressing rooms which double as bunks for the driver and mammography \ntechnician, a small reception area, and a bathroom which can \naccommodate wheelchairs. There is a hydraulic lift for wheelchair entry \ninto the van as well.\n  While most American women face a 1-in-9 risk of dying of breast \ncancer, Alaskan women face a 1-in-7 chance. Among Alaska Native women, \ncancer is the leading cause of death and breast cancer is the second \nmost prevalent cancer. Now there is no reason for these women not to \nlearn about early detection. Julia Roberts, from the small village of \nTanana, said it all when she came to the van for her exam. ``I know \nit's important. I know if you catch it early you can probably save your \nlife. I have three children and I want to see my grandchildren.''\n  Mr. President, we need more fundamental research on breast cancer. \nAnd I strongly support further study to determine the adequacy and \neffectiveness of mammography for women in the 40-to-49-age bracket.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this \nresolution concerning the need for accurate guidelines for mammography \nscreening for women between the ages of 40 and 49.\n  Since 1993, when the NCI rescinded its original guidelines I have \nbeen trying to get them to return to their original position. In the \npast 3 years, I have written several letters to the heads of the \nNational Cancer Institute [NCI], asking that it reconsider its position \non mammography screening for women between the ages of 40 and 49.\n  We have seen study after study that shows that mammography screening \nat an earlier age can help save women's lives. Women and physicians \nhave come to depend on the recommendations of the NCI in determining \nwhen they should begin mammography screening.\n  NCI's decision to back away from screening for women between the ages \nof 40 and 49 has led to confusion and anxiety. I applaud Dr. Klausner, \nhead of the NCI, for convening the advisory panel. But like him, I am \ndisappointed that the panel issued no concrete guidelines to aid women \nand their doctors.\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\n  Since we cannot prevent or cure breast cancer, mammography screening \nremains the best tool we have to detect it early when chances for \nsurvival are highest. We cannot now eliminate the only hope younger \nwomen have for fighting this dreaded disease.\n  This resolution is an important step in the right direction. The NCI \nneeds to recognize the importance of mammograms for women in their \nforties and reissue its previous guidelines.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the three letters I referenced in my \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Hart Senate Office Building,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 1994.\n     Samuel Broder, M.D.,\n     Director, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of \n         Health Buildings, Bethesda, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Broder: I have previously expressed to you my deep \n     concerns about the National Cancer Institute's position on \n     mammography screening for women between the ages of 40 and \n     49. I am writing today because I believe that studies \n     released this week underscore the need for prompt \n     reconsideration of the position taken by the NCI.\n       As you probably know, two studies presented at the annual \n     conference of the Radiological Society of North America \n     concluded that mammography is of substantial benefit to women \n     between 40 and 49. In a study done by the Screening \n     Mammography Program of British Columbia, 15 percent of the \n     cancers detected through mammography were in women under 50. \n     Eighty-seven percent of the tumors discovered were at an \n     early, curable stage.\n       Annual mammograms for women 40 and over also resulted in \n     the greatest chance of recovery and the largest number of \n     treatment options, in an analysis of 851 breast cancer \n     patients at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in \n     Philadelphia. The authors of this study concluded that \n     mammography was particularly important for women under 50 due \n     to the speed with which tumors develop in younger women.\n       With this new research strongly suggesting great benefit in \n     mammography screening for women between 40 and 49, I ask the \n     NCI once again to reconsider its position and return to its \n     original guidelines.\n       Please contact me as soon as possible as I need to \n     determine what further action I will take on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Hart Senate Office Building,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 23, 1994.\n     Dr. Samuel Broder,\n     Director, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of \n         Health Building, Bethesda, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Broder: Three weeks ago I wrote to you about the \n     National Cancer Institute's (NCI) position on mammography \n     screening for women between the ages of 40 and 49. I continue \n     to believe that this issue merits your immediate attention.\n       As I have stated previously, women and physicians have come \n     to depend on the recommendations of the NCI in determining \n     when they should begin mammography screening. NCI's decision \n     to back away from screening for women between the ages of 40 \n     and 49 has led to confusion and anxiety.\n       NCI's position on this issue is especially distressing in \n     light of the conclusions found in a recent report prepared by \n     the House Government Operations Committee titled ``Misused \n     Science: The National Cancer Institute's Elimination of \n     Mammography Guidelines for Women in Their Forties.''\n       This report notes that several senior scientists at NCI \n     questioned the scope and quality of studies used by NCI to \n     reverse its position on mammography and that NCI ignored the \n     14 to 1 decision by its own National Cancer Advisory Board \n     ``to defer'' action on any changes to the mammography \n     guidelines. The latter point was one which I had brought to \n     your attention in July.\n       Two new research studies presented at the annual conference \n     of the Radiological Society of North America last month now \n     strongly support mammography screening for women under age \n     50. I outlined these studies and their findings in my letter \n     to you of November 30.\n       It is time for the NCI to reconsider its position on \n     mammography screening for younger women. I would like to meet \n     with you personally to discuss what actions the NCI can take \n     on this matter. Please contact me as soon as possible to \n     arrange for an appointment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Hart Senate Office Building,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 1996.\n     Dr. Richard Klausner,\n     Director, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of \n         Health Building, Bethesda, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Klausner: Over the past two years, I have written \n     several letters to both you and your predecessor, Dr. Samuel \n     Broder, asking that the National Cancer Institute (NCI) \n     reconsider its position on mammography screening for women \n     between the ages of 40 and 49.\n       As I have stated previously, women and physicians have come \n     to depend on the recommendations of the NCI in determining \n     when they should begin mammography screening. NCI's decision \n     to back away from screening for women between the ages of 40 \n     and 49 has led to confusion and anxiety.\n       As you know, yesterday at the Radiological Society of North \n     America meeting in Chicago, new research was presented which \n     supports the position that mammography screening for women \n     should begin at age 40.\n       I understand that next month the NCI will convene a panel \n     of experts to reconsider this issue. Given the new research \n     which convincingly supports mammography screening for women \n     between the ages of 40-49 when the panel convenes next month, \n     I urge you to reconsider your position and reinstitute the \n     original guidelines on mammography screening.\n       Since we cannot prevent or cure breast cancer, mammography \n     screening remains the best tool we have to detect it early \n     when chances for survival are highest. We cannot now \n     eliminate the only hope younger women have for fighting this \n     dreaded disease.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Barbara Boxer,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution which calls for the National Cancer Institute to reissue \nguidelines for breast cancer screening for women between the ages of 40 \nand 50. Although an NIH advisory panel decided that women in their \nforties may not need mammograms, this finding continues to be a \ncontroversial one. Even though some studies have shown that mammography \nmay not always be effective in detecting breast cancer, we can't ignore \nthe importance of the early detection of this disease. Early detection \nand treatment will lead to reductions in breast cancer mortality. \nFailure to encourage breast cancer screening for women in their forties \nmay well have disastrous results.\n  The scientific literature is controversial. In this situation, it \nmakes no sense to rescind the current mammography guidelines and \nstandards. The evidence is far from conclusive that screening brings no \npositive effect for women in their forties. Further studies need to be \nconducted before our choice is made. We need to do all we can to \nencourage the early detection of breast cancer. I commend Senator Snowe \nand Senator Mikulski for their leadership, and I urge the Senate to \npass this important resolution.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in 1993, the National Cancer Institute \nrescinded its recommendation that all women in their forties undergo \nmammography screening for breast cancer. Since then, American women \nhave been receiving mixed messages about the importance of mammography.\n  Women are confused. Women are angry. Women are frightened. Given the \nwide variety of recommendations being made about mammography screening \nfor younger women, one can certainly understand why.\n  The scientific community is deeply divided on the interpretation of \ndata from mammography clinical trials conducted in the United States \nand elsewhere. Cancer advocacy organizations are split on the proper \nrecommendations to give their members and the public. Physicians want \nto provide the best recommendations to their patients, but there is no \nsingle answer to give them. Insurance companies frequently deny \ncoverage of benefits unless there is compelling scientific data to \nwarrant coverage.\n  Clearly, women want to be more involved in making health care \ndecisions for themselves. But when the medical, scientific, and patient \nadvocacy communities cannot agree on the issue of mammography \nscreening, women are being placed in a situation where they must make, \nat best, an educated guess as to what they should do to protect \nthemselves from a disease which will kill an estimated 44,000 women \nthis year.\n  Women and their families were hopeful they would get clear answers \nwhen the National Institutes of Health convened the Consensus \nDevelopment Conference on Breast Cancer Screening for Women Ages 40-49.\n  Unfortunately, the Consensus Development Conference statement \ncontains more mixed messages, more confusing data and few real answers.\n  The report concludes, ``zero to 10 women would have their lives \nextended\n\n[[Page S934]]\n\nper 10,000 women ages 40-49 who are regularly screened. About 2,500 \nwomen should be screened regularly in order to extend one life.'' These \ntwo statements leave a great deal of room for interpretation by women, \ntheir physicians and their families.\n  The report concludes, ``up to 25 percent of all breast cancer is not \ndetected by mammogram in women ages 40-49.'' One could therefore \nlogically conclude that 75 percent of all breast cancer is detected by \nmammography performed on women in this age group. To me, the fact that \n75 percent of breast cancers will be detected through mammography is \nvery significant. In addition, this conclusion also makes a compelling \ncase for additional research to develop more sophisticated equipment \nwhich can detect breast cancer earlier than today's mammography \ntechnology can.\n  The report also concludes that use of mammography has contributed to \na growing trend that breast cancer tumors are being detected when they \nare small, and at an early stage. The report states that, ``the \npresence of smaller or earlier stage breast tumors can give a patient \nmore choice in selecting among various treatment options.'' Research \nhas shown that lumpectomy, combined with radiation therapy, is as \neffective as mastectomy when the tumor is detected early.\n  One area all parties involved in this issue can agree upon is the \nneed for additional research. I have introduced Senate Resolution 15, \nto express the sense of the Senate that funding for biomedical research \nactivities of the National Institutes of Health should be doubled over \nthe next 5 fiscal years. It is only through research that definitive \nanswers to these very important research questions can be obtained.\n  While I respect the conclusions of the consensus panel, I believe the \nmessage being sent to younger women throughout America is wrong. They \nare being told, in essence, that early detection of breast cancer may \nnot be all that important. I believe most women reject that conclusion.\n  On numerous occasions, I have spoken about how my own family has been \naffected by cancer. My wife and my mother are both survivors of breast \ncancer because it was detected at an early stage. It haunts me to think \nwhat might have happened if they had received the message that women \nare currently receiving with this report.\n  I support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I believe it is \nimportant that the Senate send the message that more research is needed \nto further determine the benefits of mammography screening in younger \nwomen, that the National Cancer Institute should reconsider its \nmammography screening guidelines, and to encourage the public to \nconsider cancer screening guidelines issued by other organizations.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to conclude the debate on this \nside by reaffirming that this resolution does not meddle with the \nNational Institutes of Health. It does not meddle with science. It \nessentially says let us have more research on the subject of breast \ncancer in terms of its cause, in terms of its prevention, and in terms \nof its cures.\n  It also calls for the women of America and their physicians to follow \nthose guidelines that are recommended by every physician group as well \nas the American Cancer Society on urging women in the age 40 to 49 \ngroup to have either an annual or biannual mammogram.\n  Third, it asks the National Cancer Institute to repromulgate its own \nguidelines urging the same.\n  I would like to comment that this advisory panel that made this \nreport in January is not made up of NIH scientists. This is an outside \nadvisory group to the National Institutes of Health.\n  Mr. President, I have the honor of representing the National \nInstitutes of Health because it is in my State. How wonderful to be \nable to represent a Government organization devoted to saving lives by \nfinding cures and causes for the diseases that threaten Americans and \nothers around the world.\n  The National Cancer Institute has taken specific steps to be far more \nsensitive and to have a budget priority looking at those gender-\nspecific diseases, particularly breast cancer and ovarian cancer. And \nwe are pleased also with the work that is now being done in the area of \nprostate cancer as well.\n  I believe that the National Cancer Institute is on the right track. \nWe want to be sure that they continue their scientific research, and if \nthere is a gray area about when you should have a mammogram always go \nto the side of safety. Always go to the side of caution. One of the \nthings we know is that when you are treated by a physician more \ninformation is often better information.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge unanimous adoption of this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n  Knowing no other Democrats who wish to comment on this issue, I yield \nthe remainder of my time and look forward to the vote at 5 p.m.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in conclusion I would like to make several \nfinal points.\n  First of all, I would like to commend Senator Specter for his \ncommitment and devotion for years on this issue, and in particular \ntomorrow for holding a hearing as the chairman of the Labor-HHS \nCommittee on Appropriations which I think will be very significant in \nhighlighting and profiling the importance of this issue.\n  Finally, I also would like to say that I think it is critical that he \nsend a very strong message to the Cancer Institute advisory panel that \nwill be meeting later this month to revisit this issue, and, if they \nsee that we have a very strong vote here in the U.S. Senate from all \nSenators across the political aisle, clearly I think they will rescind \nthe statement that they made last month in not making any \nrecommendation for women in their forties. I think it is an abdication \nof their responsibility, and an abdication of their knowledge of \nmedical science in terms of what is best for women.\n  I am very pleased as well that all nine women here in the U.S. \nSenate--all Republican and all Democratic women--are cosponsors of this \nresolution.\n  I do hope that we can get unanimous support of this issue so that we \ncan correct what I think has been a wrong decision on the behalf of \nwomen in America and does nothing to advance women's health.\n  That is why this resolution becomes a critically important statement \nto the lives, health, and safety of women in America.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote on this \nresolution will occur at the hour of 5 p.m.\n  In my capacity as a Senator from the State of Idaho, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S928-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S934-S935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, while I and a number of my colleagues \nwill come to the floor in the days ahead to introduce specific \nproposals affecting our Nation's parks and public lands, I would like \nto talk very generally about the environmental and natural resources \nagenda of the 105th Congress. My hope is that we have learned from the \nlessons of the last Congress and will not once again attempt to undo \nthe most effective and progressive network of environmental laws in the \nworld.\n  Over 25 years ago, with overwhelming bipartisan support, the National \nForest Management Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, and the Clean Water Act were enacted into law.\n  Today, as a result of those and other laws passed with strong support \nfrom\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle, people are more actively involved in \nmanagement of their public lands, more people are using public lands \nfor recreation than ever before, our air and waters are cleaner, \nhunting and fishing is better, our Government is more open about the \neffects of its actions on the health and safety of families and local \ncommunities, and rare species such as the bald eagle and grizzly bear \nare thriving.\n  By protecting our natural resource heritage, we have become a wiser, \nstronger, and healthier Nation.\n  At times we have a tendency to overlook the value--our moral and \nethical obligation--to pass on healthy lands and waters to our \nchildren's children. How else can we explain efforts in the last \nCongress--and proposals by some of my colleagues today--to rewrite, \noverturn, or significantly weaken the protections afforded all \nAmericans by these laws?\n  In this regard, I was encouraged by the recent words of Mike Dombeck, \nthe new Chief of the Forest Service. His first day on the job, Chief \nDombeck said:\n\n       More and more, people are realizing that their jobs and \n     professions, the quality of the water they drink and the air \n     they breathe--the very fabric of their lives --are dependent \n     on the land that sustains them.\n\n  Dombeck told his employees that this Nation's environmental laws:\n\n       . . . represent the conservation values of mainstream \n     America. Do not be disturbed by the debate surrounding their \n     execution. This is background noise to a complex society and \n     healthy, properly functioning democracy. There is an ongoing \n     debate in this Nation over how national forests and \n     rangelands should be managed. That's just fine. In fact, it \n     is healthy. Debate and information are the essence of \n     democracy. The people we serve, all of the American people, \n     are now more fully engaged in defining how their public land \n     legacy should be managed.\n\n  The new Chief succinctly stated what we inside the beltway sometimes \nforget, ``We cannot meet the needs of the people if we do not first \nconserve and restore the health of the land.'' This Nation is blessed \nby a public land legacy that is the envy of the world. Our taxpayer-\nowned lands are the refuge of last resort for vanishing species. \nMoreover, these lands enable our children to experience the solitude of \nwilderness, pristine clear lakes, and a hunting and fishing experience \nunexcelled in pure delight anywhere else.\n  Last year many Members of Congress were shocked by the outrage of our \ncitizenry over the efforts to dramatically cut the EPA budget. In 1960, \n65 percent of our lakes and streams were neither swimmable nor \nfishable. Today 65 percent of our lakes and streams are swimmable and \nare fishable, and I can tell you, our people want that progress to \ncontinue until we reach 100 percent. I applaud Chief Dombeck's views \nand encourage my colleagues to allow him the time and resources to make \nthe policy and personnel changes needed to achieve his critically \nimportant vision.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S934-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S935-S936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAX CUT AND MEDICARE CUT PROPOSALS\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, tonight the President will address the \nNation on the State of the Union. I do not know precisely what the \nPresident is going to say, particularly about the economy and about the \nbudget, tax cuts, the deficit, crime, education, the environment, and \nso on. I am sure he will address each one of those things and more.\n  But I would be less than candid with my colleagues and my \nconstituents--and I would be less than honest with myself--if I did not \nvoice some concerns about what I have been reading about what the \nRepublicans want in the way of tax cuts and what the President wants in \nthe way of tax cuts, what the President wants in the way of Medicare \ncuts, and what the Republicans want in Medicare cuts, what kind of \nincentives we want for our children to attend college, what kind of a \ntax cut we want for so-called middle class people.\n  So let me address those issues seriatim and say, first of all, it is \nmy understanding that the proposal which has been in the public domain \nfor some time now to cut Medicare by $138 billion over the next 6 years \nwill probably be fairly well applauded. Nobody is going to object to \nany proposal that makes the Medicare system sounder and gives our \nelderly Medicare recipients a better sense of security. Anything we can \ndo to cause the American elderly population to sleep better at night \nbecause they know the Medicare system is sound and will be sound for \nthe foreseeable future is a highly desirable goal.\n  Now, having said that, I think the Republicans will want to cut \nMedicare more than $138 billion. And I am not saying they are right or \nwrong. I do not know what the figure ought to be. I might support \nadditional proposals to do anything to make the Medicare system sounder \nthan $138 billion will make it.\n  But having said that, I am puzzled by how you achieve a balanced \nbudget while you are cutting $138 billion in Medicare, which alone \nwould go right on the budget deficit over the next 6 years, I believe \nit is.\n  But we do not stop with that. The Republicans do not stop with it and \nthe Democrats do not stop with it.\n  The Republicans have a proposal of a tax cut which they call the \nmiddle class tax cut. It is designed to provide a $500 tax credit for \neach child in the family, but it is not refundable.\n  That means that if you are making $30,000 a year, and you pay $1,500 \nin taxes, you would get $1,500 back if you have three children--$500 \nfor each child.\n  But if you happen to have a $30,000 income, and six children, and you \ndo not pay any tax, you get nothing.\n  So the simple question must be asked, who needs a tax cut more, the \nparents with three children or the parents with six children?\n  Move on down the ladder to $25,000, move on down the ladder to \n$20,000, a single mother with one child who is working as a waitress in \na Senate cafeteria. Her tax bill is $1,000, we will say. She would get \n$500. But if she had three children and was still paying $1,000, she \nwould get $1,000, but nothing for the third child.\n  The third scenario: If she has children and is paying no tax, she \ngets nothing. And on top of that, as the Presiding Officer will tell \nyou, and recall, we cut the earned income tax credit last year, which \nis so beneficial to the mother who is a waitress in a Senate cafeteria \nthat I just described because she is entitled to an earned income tax \ncredit by staying on the job and off of welfare.\n\n  No less a person than Ronald Reagan said it was the greatest \nincentive for staying off welfare he could think of. Every President \nsince that thing first came into effect has said that this is one of \nthe best incentives to keep people off of welfare we have. That is to \nsay, ``If you stay on the job all year long, don't get on welfare, and \nif you make less than $28,000 a year, we'll give you a sum of money at \nthe end of the year, as high as $2,000.''\n  So what are we doing here? What kind of social policy is it? Forget \neconomics. What kind of social policy is it when we give money to \npeople who have one or two children and pay income tax, give no money \nto people who work and pay no income tax because they have enough \ndependents to keep them from paying taxes and maybe whose income was \ncut this year because we cut the earned income tax credit? What kind of \nfairness is that?\n  So, Mr. President, I am troubled about the so-called $500 tax rebate \nfor all your children. It is not refundable. Only if you pay taxes do \nyou get it. Obviously, the people who are hurting most are not paying \ntaxes because they do not make enough money.\n  Then we have this proposed capital gains tax cut. As I read the \nRepublican proposal, CBO scores it to cost $33 billion over the next 5 \nyears and $111 billion over the next 10 years. And who do you think \ngets the majority of the benefit? Why, it is the people who own stock \nin Microsoft and Intel and IBM. It is the people who are big investors \nin the stock market.\n  The rate of 28 percent on capital gains may be a tad high. There is \nprobably nobody in this room who would quarrel with that. But if you \nare trying to balance the budget, which we have\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\nbeen doing a magnificent job of for the past 4 years, why do we want to \nmuck it up and start cutting taxes, which is absolutely guaranteed to \nstart the deficit back up again?\n  We tried that in 1981, cutting taxes massively, increasing defense \nspending massively, and winding up today with a $5.2 trillion debt. \nThis is the slowest learning crowd I have ever seen. It is worse than \ntrying to housebreak a dog I had one time. We just could not do it.\n  So what are we doing talking about these massive tax cuts and \nbalancing the budget at the same time? It has never worked, and it \nnever will. Where did all this talk get started? If you are going to \ncut taxes, cut taxes for people who honestly need the money.\n  If you cut capital gains, with 75 percent of the benefit going to \npeople who make over $100,000, where is it going to go? Probably into \nthe stock market. The mutual funds are putting $15 billion a month into \nthe market right now. Who here believes that the stock market can \nabsorb those kinds of investments? Everything that goes up has to come \ndown at some point or another. But I am talking about the Republican \nproposal.\n  And now the President is going to announce tonight apparently a \nproposed capital gains tax cut for people who have homes worth \n$500,000. If you bought a home 20 years ago for $100,000 and you sell \nit today for $500,000, under the proposal of the President you would \nnot pay a nickel tax.\n\n  I remember many years ago when we passed an exemption for homeowners \nto exclude $150,000 of the price tag. You could do that one time in \nyour life, a $150,000 exclusion. If you had a $500,000 home that you \nhad paid $100,000 for, you not only get your $100,000 cost back, you \ncan add $150,000 to that and you have $250,000 capital gains on which \nyou would pay a 28 percent tax. The President's proposal is that if you \nhave a $500,000 home and you sell it for $500,000 there is no tax, no \nmatter what you paid for it. You may have paid $25,000 for it and it \nmay be worth $500,000 today because somebody wants to build a \nMcDonald's where you are living, no tax. Now, Mr. President, would you \nlike to know how many people in this country have a home that is valued \nin excess of $500,000? The answer is 1 percent. The President's \nproposal of a $500,000 exclusion will take care of 99 percent of all \nthe homeowners in America. I do not know what the cost of it is \nsupposed to be.\n  These things are all laudable. I never lost a vote voting for a tax \ncut. When you tell people you are for tax cuts, everybody applauds. If \nthere is anything people want to hear, it is that they are overtaxed, \nthey are overregulated, they are overeverything. I understand their \nfrustration.\n  But let me ask you this: When you have an economy that grew at 4.7 \npercent in the fourth quarter of 1996--that is a staggering growth \nrate--with an inflation rate of 2.2 percent, about as low as you can \never get it, Treasury bills at 5 percent as of yesterday, the \nunemployment rate as low as it ever gets, in short, you have an economy \nthat is performing absolutely magnificently, and the deficit has gone \nfrom $290 billion in 1992 to $107 billion, a 63-percent reduction in \n1996, what are we going to do? We are going to start pandering again. \nWhy can we not focus on that deficit? The people of this country have a \nnonnegotiable demand that we balance the budget.\n  Do you know why a lot of people are going to vote for the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution of the United States? Do you think \nit is because they think it is sound economic or social policy? I do \nnot like to denigrate other people. It is arrogant to do that. But I \ncan tell you one reason is because they have seen the polls. I know \nwhat the polls show. One of the reasons the polls show so many people \nwant a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is two things. \nNo. 1, they think a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and \na balanced budget are the same thing. A constitutional amendment does \nnot guarantee you anything. Yes, it does, too: It guarantees you chaos. \nIt is the biggest political scam ever perpetrated and foisted off on an \nunsuspecting public that can bring nothing but utter chaos to this \nNation down the road.\n  Do you know something? People did not elect 100 Senators to come up \nhere and vote however the polls show every time. They elected people to \ncome up here and to think, to read the Constitution, understand the \nsacredness of the Constitution, understanding that every single little \nproblem that comes up ought not to be solved by tinkering with that \nsacred document. I have never voted for a constitutional amendment. I \nthought in 1984 when I voted against that great constitutional \namendment of prayer in school that I was serving my last term in the \nSenate. Do you know something? I went home and I went from one end of \nthe State to the other explaining to the people of my State what that \nmeant, how the school boards could pick the prayers the children would \nsay and tell them how many times a day they would say them. What kind \nof nonsense is that, giving up the greatest religious freedoms we have \nto the local school board? Do you know what? I had the fundamentalists \nand the mainliners and everybody clapping and cheering because they did \nnot want that either. But at least I did not hesitate to talk to them \nabout it and tell them where it would lead us.\n  So I do not have any hesitancy today in coming to the floor and \nsaying I am very apprehensive about all the tax cut proposals. Why are \nwe going to cut $138 billion from Medicare and turn right around and \ngive it away in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America? That is \nnot my idea of responsible legislation. That is not my idea of a \nresponsible economy. If you want a balanced budget, now is the time to \nshow it, and do not tell me you will hide behind this constitutional \namendment and go home and say, ``I did my part. I cut taxes and then I \nvoted for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 47\n\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute is the lead Federal \n     agency for research on the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and \n     treatment of cancer;\n       Whereas health professionals and consumers throughout the \n     United States regard the guidelines of the National Cancer \n     Institute as reliable scientific and medical advice;\n       Whereas it has been proven that intervention through \n     routine screening for breast cancer through mammography can \n     save the lives of women at a time when medical science is \n     unable to prevent this disease;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute issued a guideline in \n     1989 recommending that women in their forties seek \n     mammograms, but rescinded this guideline in 1993;\n       Whereas in 1993, it was difficult to have the same degree \n     of scientific confidence about the benefit of mammography for \n     women between the ages of 40 and 49 as existed for women \n     between the ages of 50 and 69 due to inherent limitations in \n     the studies that were conducted as of that date;\n       Whereas at that time, the American Cancer Society and 21 \n     other national medical organizations and health and consumer \n     groups were at variance with the decision of the National \n     Cancer Institute to rescind the guidelines of the Institute \n     for mammography for women between the ages of 40 and 49;\n       Whereas the statement of scientific fact on breast cancer \n     screening issued by the National Cancer Institute on December \n     3, 1993, caused widespread confusion and concern among women \n     and physicians, eroded confidence in mammography, and \n     reinforced barriers and negative attitudes that keep women of \n     all ages from being screened;\n       Whereas in 1995, investigators found a 24 percent lower \n     death rate among women who received mammograms in their \n     forties when the world's population-based trials were \n     combined;\n       Whereas in 1996, Swedish researchers in 2 studies found a \n     44 and 36 percent lower death rate among women who received \n     mammograms in their forties;\n       Whereas a number of studies have shown that breast tumors \n     in women under the age of 50 may grow far more rapidly than \n     in older women, suggesting, that annual mammograms are of \n     value to women in this age group;\n       Whereas on January 23, 1997, a panel convened by the \n     National Institutes of Health reviewed these and other \n     compelling studies but decided not to recommend that the \n     National Cancer Institute reissue its earlier guidelines;\n       Whereas the Director of the National Cancer Institute and \n     other major national organizations, including the American \n     Cancer Society, expressed surprise and disappointment with \n     this decision;\n       Whereas the majority (approximately 80 percent) of women \n     who are diagnosed with breast cancer have no identifiable \n     risk for this disease;\n       Whereas breast cancer is the single leading cause of death \n     for women in their forties and fifties, and a leading cause \n     of death for women between the ages of 30 and 60; and\n       Whereas more women will be diagnosed with breast cancer \n     this year in their forties (over 33,000 women) than in their \n     fifties: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) adequately designed and conducted studies are needed to \n     further determine the benefits of screening women between the \n     ages of 40 and 49 through mammography and other emerging \n     technologies; and\n       (2)(A) the Senate strongly urges the Advisory Panel for the \n     National Cancer Institute to consider reissuing the guideline \n     rescinded in 1993 for mammography for women between the ages \n     of 40 and 49 when it convenes in February; or\n       (B) until there is more definitive data, direct the public \n     to consider guidelines issued by the other organizations.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to echo the words of Senator \nBumpers regarding national forest policy and to welcome Mike Dombeck as \nChief of the U.S. Forest Service. The Forest Service is one of the \noldest and one of the largest stewards of our public lands. This year \nmarks the 100th anniversary of the Organic Act in which Congress laid \nout the purposes for our national forests. Since the Forest Service was \ncreated in 1905, it has grown to manage over 190 million acres of \nforest lands. These lands span the entire United States, ranging from \nthe small national forests of the East to the multimillion-acre forests \nof the West. The mission of the Forest Service is to manage all of \nthese forests under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. \nAs Gifford Pinchot, the first Forest Service Chief, declared in 1905, \nthe role of the Forest Service was to achieve ``the greatest good for \nthe greatest number in the long run.'' This mandate still stands today \nand should guide us into the next century of national forest \nmanagement.\n  As the Green Mountain National Forest in my State begins review of \nits forest plan, the Pinchot vision is what I would like to see the \nForest Service follow. The challenges facing the Green Mountain in many \nways reflect the challenges facing the Forest Service as we move into \nthe next century--increased recreational use, pressure to increase \ntimber production, and protection of the forest's wildlife habitat, \nstreams, and wilderness areas. Over the last decade we have witnessed a \nboom in recreational use of the Green Mountain, with more than 1.5 \nmillion visitors using the forest for skiing, hiking, hunting, \nsnowmobiling, and fishing. All of our national forests together host \nover 820 million visits a year.\n  Although visitor use is a valuable indication of the importance of \nthese national forests, we must not forget the equally compelling \nreason to protect these national treasures. They represent some of our \nNation's most unique ecosystems, from the tropical rainforests in the \nSouth, the alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, the coastal redwoods \nof the Pacific coast, and the hardwood forests in the East. This \nnetwork of forests preserves natural resources for scientific, \neducational, and historical values. New scientific information and \nadvances in technology have allowed us to improve the management of our \nforests to protect these values. I applaud Chief Dombeck's call for \nincreased use of available technology, enhanced conservation education, \nand insistence on personal accountability to protect these natural \nresources.\n  At the same time, the resources available to the Forest Service to \nmove our national forests into the next century must keep pace with the \ndemands. The Forest Service is developing joint business ventures and \ncooperative agreements with both public and private partners to address \nthis situation. It has looked to its neighbors to share in the \nresponsibility and caretaking of the forests. It has reached out to \nprivate enterprises to operate facilities and develop viable business \nventures to provide quality recreational opportunities while ensuring \necosystem protection.\n\n  In Vermont, the Green Mountain National Forest has worked with \nnumerous volunteer organizations to maintain and develop campgrounds \nand trails in the forest. The Green Mountain also has been \nparticipating in a cooperative effort with the University of Vermont to \ndevelop a database of resource information to analyze different \nmanagement scenarios in the forest. I appreciate Chief Dombeck's \nrecognition of the value of these multipartner projects in reaching out \nto the communities who live near our national forests.\n  Although some people feel that these increasing pressures and \nsometimes conflicting demands on our national forests is reason to \ncompletely overhaul the laws that govern our forests, I believe that \nthese laws are sound. When the National Forest Management Act [NFMA] \nwas drafted in the mid-1970's there was a crisis facing the management \nof our forest, the competing interests of timber production and forest \nconservation were colliding. That environment created what I believe is \na law that offers the flexibility, public participation, and \naccountability necessary to guide our national forests into the next \ncentury.\n\n[[Page S938]]\n\n  The responsibility of guiding our national forests into the next \ncentury lays on the shoulders of both the Chief and the many employees \nwho serve him. The relationship between the Chief, Forest Service \nemployees, and the public will become increasingly important as the \ndemands on the National Forest System continue to grow and diversify. I \nhave great admiration for the traditions and mission of the Forest \nService; I have confidence that it has the statutory and administrative \nability to maintain the balance between multiple-use and sustained \nyield management of our forests; I have respect for the knowledge and \nskills of the people that work for the Forest Service; but, I also have \nconcerns that as the Agency faces the pressure to maintain timber \nproduction and expand recreational opportunities we could compromise \nthe debt we owe to our children--conserving these forests for their use \nand enjoyment.\n  As the 14th Chief of the Forest Service, Chief Dombeck will have to \nlead the Agency through the swirling debate on how to manage our \nforests for multiple-use while protecting them for future generations. \nI believe Chief Dombeck has the vision and leadership ability to \nachieve this goal. I welcome the opportunity to work with him to \nimplement his philosophy of collaborative stewardship and \naccountability to the public as a whole and to the direct neighbors of \nthe national forests. Chief Dombeck has already laid out some changes \nto move in this direction. I urge my colleagues in Congress to work \nwith Chief Dombeck to pursue changes that will enable the Forest \nService to address the growing demands on our forests.\n  I do not see anybody seeking recognition, Mr. President, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S937-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IMPLEMENTATION OF MANAGEMENT REFORMS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \naddress some vital management issues at the Department of Commerce and \nurge Secretary-designate Daley to make use of the management tools \nCongress has provided to obtain better results for the taxpayers' \ninvestment. The Department of Commerce must tackle some endemic \nmanagement problems before it can successfully carry out its mission of \npromoting the Nation's international trade, economic growth, and \ntechnological advancement.\n  The main problem with the Department of Commerce may be in the \nbreadth of its mission. Commerce's writ runs from promoting American \ncompetitiveness in the global marketplace to providing the weather data \nwe see on the news each night. The Department, which employs 35,000 \npeople and spends $3.5 billion of taxpayer dollars is, in reality, a \nloose collection of more than 100 programs. In the last Congress, many \nquestioned the value added of this departmental bureaucracy. This \nculminated in action by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee to \nreport out a bill that would have abolished the Department, as such, \nand reassigned many of its functions.\n  Clearly, the Department's new leadership will have a task ahead of it \nto ensure that its many bureaus and offices are efficiently run and are \neffectively serving the taxpayers' interest. For example, the General \nAccounting Office [GAO] has identified the National Weather Service's \nmodernization efforts as being a high risk area which is especially \nvulnerable to the problems of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. \nThis year, planning for the decennial census is expected to be added to \nthat list. In addition, auditors have found significant accounting \nproblems at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n  I hope that the Department of Commerce will be able to improve its \noperations through effective implementation of recently enacted \nlegislation. Congress has given the agencies like the Department of \nCommerce the tools to improve their management operations, most notably \nby passing the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government \nPerformance and Results Act [GPRA] of 1993, and the information \nmanagement and procurement reforms of the 104th Congress. These laws \nare designed to get the Federal Government to operate in a sound, \nbusinesslike manner and implementing these management reforms is a \nmajor responsibility for each department head.\n  The Government Performance and Results Act, for example, can be an \neffective tool to make Government work better by measuring the success \nor failure of Government programs and using this information to support \nbudget decisions. For example, GAO found that the Commerce Department \nshares its mission with at least 71 Federal departments, agencies, and \noffices. With this type of overlap and duplication, the Department \nneeds to have a clear idea of its primary missions, otherwise it risks \ndoing a lot of things poorly and nothing well at all. GPRA, by focusing \non agency missions and results, will give Commerce, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and Congress the information necessary to \nconsolidate and eliminate wasteful and redundant programs at the \nDepartment.\n  I submitted to Secretary-designate Daley several questions regarding \nhis views on implementing GPRA and improving Commerce's financial \naccountability and information resources management as part of his \nconfirmation process. I look forward to receiving from him a firm \ncommitment to use GPRA's strategic planning process, performance goals, \nand performance measures to radically transform his agency to better \nserve the taxpayers.\n  There are many challenges ahead for Congress and Secretary-designate \nDaley as we address the problems at the Department of Commerce \nidentified by GAO, the Department's inspector general and others. \nCertainly, the bipartisan management reforms we have enacted should be \nimplemented to assist in that process. I am sure that together we can \nwork to effectively implement sound management policies and practices \nand I look forward to achieving those objectives in the coming \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S938-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S938-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S938-S939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LITHUANIA--MESSAGE \n                        FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 7\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; referred jointly, pursuant to Public Law 94-265, 16 U.S.C. \n1823(b), to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement \nbetween the Government of the United States of America and the \nGovernment of the Republic of Lithuania Extending the Agreement of \nNovember 12, 1992, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United \nStates, with annex, as extended (``the 1992 Agreement'').

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice-President, Members of the 105th \nCongress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:\n  I come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our \npeacetime history--and a plan of action to meet that challenge, to \nprepare our people for the bold new world of the 21st Century.\n  We have much to be thankful for. With four years of growth, we have \nwon back the basic strength of our economy. With crime and welfare \nrolls declining, we are winning back our basic optimism, the enduring \nfaith that we can master any difficulty. With the Cold War receding and \nglobal commerce at record levels, we are helping to win unrivaled peace \nand prosperity all across the world.\n  My fellow Americans, the state of our union is strong, but now we \nmust rise to the decisive moment, to make a nation and a world better \nthan any we have ever known. The new promise of the global economy, the \nInformation Age, unimagined new work, life-enhancing technology--all \nare ours to seize. That is our honor and our challenge. We must be \nshapers of events, not observers. For if we do not act, the moment will \npass--and we will lose the best possibilities of our future.\n  We face no imminent threat, but we do have an enemy: The enemy of our \ntime is inaction.\n  So tonight, I issue a call to action--action by this Congress, by our \nstates, by all our people, to prepare America for the 21st Century. \nAction to keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all \nour people; action to strengthen education and harness the forces of \ntechnology and science; action to build stronger families and stronger \ncommunities and a safer environment; action to keep America the world's \nstrongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And above all, \naction to build a more perfect union here at home.\n  The spirit we bring to our work will determine its success. We must \nall be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans, and \nresponsibility for all Americans, in a community of all Americans, and \nto a new kind of government--not to solve all our problems for us, but \nto give all our people the tools to make the most of their own lives.\n  And we must work together. The people of this nation elected us all. \nThey want us to be partners, not partisans. They put us all here in the \nsame boat, they gave us all oars, and they told us to row. Here's the \ndirection I think we should take.\n  First, we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of \nour country--to balance our budget, renew our democracy, and finish the \njob of welfare reform.\n\n  Over the last four years, we brought new economic growth by investing \nin our people, expanding our exports, cutting our deficits, creating \nover 11 million new jobs. Now we must keep our economy the strongest in \nthe world.\n  We here tonight have an historic opportunity. Let this Congress be \nthe Congress that finally balances the budget.\n  In two days, I will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by \n2002.\n  This plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while \nprotecting Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. It will \nbalance the budget and build on the Vice President's efforts to make \nour government work better, even as it costs less. It will balance the \nbudget and provide middle class tax relief to pay for education and \nhealth care, to help raise a child, to buy and sell a home.\n  Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature. It \ndoes not require us to rewrite our Constitution. I believe it is \nunnecessary and unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could \ncripple our country in time of crisis later on, and force unwanted \nresults such as judges halting Social Security checks or increasing \ntaxes. Let us agree: We should not pass any measure that threatens \nSocial Security. We don't need a Constitutional amendment--we need \naction.\n  Whatever our differences, we should balance the budget now, and then, \nfor the long-term health of our society, we must agree to a bipartisan \nprocess to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare, so that these \nfundamental programs will be as strong for our children as they are for \nour parents.\n  Our second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit \nourselves tonight, before the eyes of America, to enacting bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Senators McCain and Feingold, Representatives Shays and Meehan, have \nreached across party lines to craft tough and fair campaign reform. \nTheir proposal would curb spending, reduce the role of special \ninterests, create a level playing field between challengers and \nincumbents and ban contributions from noncitizens and all corporate \nsources, and the other large soft money contributions that both parties \nreceive.\n  You know and I know that delay will mean the death of reform. So \nlet's set our own deadline. Let's work together to write bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform into law, and pass McCain-Feingold by the day \nwe celebrate the birth of our democracy--July the 4th.\n  There is a third piece of unfinished business: Over the last four \nyears, we moved a record two and a quarter million people off the \nwelfare rolls. Then last year we enacted landmark welfare reform, \ndemanding that able-bodied recipients assume the responsibility of \nmoving from welfare to work.\n\n  Now each and every one of us has to fulfill our responsibility--\nindeed, our moral obligation--to make sure that people who must work, \ncan work. Now we must act to meet a new goal: two million more people \noff the welfare rolls by the Year 2000.\n  Here is my plan: Tax credits and other incentives to businesses that \nhire people off welfare. Incentives for job placement firms and for \nstates to create more jobs for welfare recipients. Training, \ntransportation and child care to help people go to work.\n  Now I challenge every state: turn those welfare checks into private \nsector paychecks. I challenge every religious congregation, every \ncommunity non-profit, and every business: hire someone off welfare. And \nI say especially to every employer in this country who has ever \ncriticized the old welfare system: You cannot blame that old system \nanymore. We have torn it down. Now do your part. Give someone on \nwelfare the chance to work.\n  Tonight, I am pleased to announce that five major corporations--\nSprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines--will be the \nfirst to join in a new national effort to marshal America's businesses, \nlarge and small, to create jobs so people on welfare can move to work.\n  We passed welfare reform. We were right to do it. But no one can walk \nout\n\n[[Page S940]]\n\nof this chamber with a clear conscience unless you are prepared to \nfinish the job.\n  And we must join together to do something else too--something both \nRepublican and Democratic governors have asked us to do--to restore \nbasic health and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants \nwho came to this country legally, who work hard, pay taxes, and obey \nthe law. To do otherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of \nimmigrants.\n  Next, the greatest step of all--the high threshold to the future we \nnow must cross--and my number one priority as President for the next \nfour years--is to ensure that Americans have the best education in the \nworld.\n  Let's work together to meet these goals: Every 8 year old must be \nable to read; every 12 year old must be able to log on to the Internet; \nevery 18 year old must be able to go to college, and every adult \nAmerican must be able to keep on learning.\n  My balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals--\n$51 billion dollars next year. But far more than money is required.\n  I have a plan, a Call to Action for American Education, based on \nthese ten principles.\n  First, a national crusade for education standards--not federal \ngovernment standards, but national standards representing what all of \nour students must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st \nCentury. Every state and school must shape the curriculum to reflect \nthese standards, and train teachers to lift students up to meet them. \nTo help schools meet the standards and measure their progress, we will \nlead an effort over the next two years to develop national tests of \nstudent achievement in reading and math.\n  Tonight, I issue a challenge to the nation: Every state should adopt \nhigh national standards, and by 1999, every state should test every 4th \ngrader in reading and every 8th grader in math to make sure these \nstandards are met.\n  Raising standards will not be easy, and some of our children will not \nbe able to meet them at first. The point is not to put our children \ndown, but to lift them up. Good tests will show us who needs help, what \nchanges in teaching to make, and which schools to improve. They can \nhelp us to end social promotion. For no child should move from grade \nschool to junior high, or junior high to high school until he or she is \nready.\n  Last month, Secretary of Education Dick Riley and I visited Northern \nIllinois, where 8th grade students from 20 school districts, in a \nproject called ``First in the World,'' took the Third International \nMath and Science Study--a test that reflects the world-class standards \nour children must meet for the new era. And those students in Illinois \ntied for first in the world in science, and came in second in math. Two \nof them, Kristin Tanner, and Chris Getsla are here tonight, with their \nteacher, Sue Winski. They prove that when we aim high and challenge our \nstudents, they will be the best in the world.\n  Second, to have the best schools, we must have the best teachers. \nMost of us would not be here tonight without the help of such teachers. \nI know I wouldn't be. For years, many educators, led by North \nCarolina's Governor Jim Hunt and the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, have worked hard to establish nationally accepted \ncredentials for excellence in teaching. Just 500 of these master \nteachers have been certified since 1995. My budget will enable 100,000 \nmore to seek national certification as master teachers. We should \nreward our best teachers, quickly and fairly remove those few who don't \nmeasure up, and challenge our finest young people to consider teaching \nas a career.\n  Third: we must do more to help all our children read. 40% of our 8 \nyear olds cannot read on their own. That's why we have just launched \nthe America Reads initiative--to build a citizen army of one million \nvolunteer tutors to make sure every child can read independently by the \nend of the 3rd grade. We will use thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers to \nmobilize this citizen army. We want at least 100,000 college students \nto help. And tonight, I am pleased that 60 college presidents have \nanswered my call, pledging that thousands of their work study students \nwill serve for one year as reading tutors.\n  This is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal: use \nthese tutors to help students read. And it is especially a challenge to \nour parents: Read with your children every night.\n\n  This leads to the fourth principle: Learning begins in the first days \nof life. Scientists are now discovering how young children develop \nemotionally and intellectually from their first days, and, therefore, \nhow important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing, \neven reading to their infants. The First Lady has spent years studying \nand writing about this issue. She and I will convene a White House \nConference on Early Learning and the Brain this Spring, to explore how \nparents and educators can best use these startling new findings.\n  We already know we should start teaching children before they start \nschools. That's why my budget expands Head Start to one million \nchildren by 2002. And, in June, the Vice President and Mrs. Gore will \nhost their annual family conference. This one will focus on the \nimportance of parents' involvement throughout a child's education.\n  Fifth, every state should give parents the power to choose the right \npublic school for their children. Their right to choose will foster the \ncompetition and innovation that can make our public schools better. We \nshould also make it possible for more parents and teachers to start \ncharter schools, schools that set and meet the highest standards, and \nsurvive only as long as they do. Our plan will help America create \n3,000 of these charter schools by the next century--nearly seven times \nas many as there are today--so that parents will have even more choices \nin sending their children to the best public schools.\n  Sixth: character education must be taught in our schools. We must \nteach our children to be good citizens. And we must continue to promote \norder and discipline, supporting communities that introduce school \nuniforms, impose curfews, enforce truancy laws, remove disruptive \nstudents from the classroom, and have zero tolerance for guns and \ndrugs.\n  Seventh: we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in \nschools that are literally falling down. With the student population at \nan all time high, and record numbers of school buildings falling into \ndisrepair, this has now become a serious national concern. My budget \nincludes a new initiative: $5 billion to help communities finance $20 \nbillion in school construction over the next four years.\n  Eighth: We must make the 13th and 14th years of education--at least \ntwo years of college--just as universal in America as a high school \neducation is today, and we must open the doors of college to all.\n  To do that, I propose America's HOPE scholarship, based on Georgia's \npioneering program: two years of a $1,500 tax credit for college \ntuition, enough to pay for the typical community college. I also \npropose a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for all tuition after \nhigh school; an expanded IRA you can withdraw from tax free for \neducation; and the largest increase in Pell Grant scholarships in 20 \nyears. This plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on \nmoney saved for college tuition. I ask you to pass it--to give every \nAmerican who works hard the chance to go to college.\n\n  Ninth: In the 21st Century, we must expand the frontiers of learning \nacross a lifetime. All our people, of whatever age, must have a chance \nto learn new skills. Most Americans live near a community college. The \nroads that take them there can be paths to a better future. My G.I. \nBill for Workers will transform the confusing tangle of federal \ntraining programs into a simple skill grant that will go directly into \neligible workers' hands. For too long, this bill has been sitting on \nthat desk down there without action--and I ask you to pass it now. \nLet's give more of our workers the ability to learn and to earn.\n  Tenth: we must bring the power of the Information Age into all our \nschools. Last year, I challenged America to connect every classroom and \nlibrary to the Internet by the year 2000, so that, for the first time \nin history, a child in the most isolated rural town, the most \ncomfortable suburb, the poorest inner city school, will have the same \naccess to the same universe of knowledge. I ask your support to \ncomplete this historic mission.\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\n  That is my plan--a Call to Action for American Education.\n  We must understand the significance of this endeavor: One of the \ngreatest sources of our strength throughout the Cold War was a \nbipartisan foreign policy; because our future was at stake, politics \nstopped at the water's edge. Now I ask you--I ask all our nation's \ngovernors--and I ask teachers, parents and citizens all across \nAmerica--for a new nonpartisan commitment to education--because \neducation is one of the critical national security issues for our \nfuture--and politics must stop at the classroom door.\n  I pledge to take this Call to Action to our country, so that \ntogether, we can make American education, like America itself, the envy \nof the world.\n  To prepare America for the 21st century, we must harness the powerful \nforces of science and technology to benefit all Americans.\n  This is the first State of the Union carried live over the Internet. \nBut we have only begun to spread the benefits of a technology \nrevolution that should be the modern birthright of every citizen.\n  Our effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning. Now, we \nshould connect every hospital to the Internet, so doctors can instantly \nshare data about their patients with the best specialists in the field. \nAnd I challenge the private sector to start by connecting every \nchildren's hospital as soon as possible, so that a child in bed can \nstay in touch with school, family and friends. A sick child need no \nlonger be a child alone.\n  We must build the second generation of the Internet so our leading \nuniversities and national laboratories can communicate at speeds 1000 \ntimes faster than today, to develop new medical treatments, new sources \nof energy, and new ways of working together.\n\n  But we cannot stop there. As the Internet becomes our new town \nsquare, a computer in every home--a teacher of all subjects, a \nconnection to all cultures--this will no longer be a dream, but a \nnecessity. And over the next decade, that must be our goal.\n  We must continue to explore the heavens, pressing on with the Mars \nprobes and the international space station, both of which will have \npractical applications for our everyday living.\n  We must speed the remarkable advances in medical science. The human \ngenome project is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life. American \nscientists have discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian \ncancer, and medication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to \nreverse its effects--and treatments that dramatically lengthen the \nlives of people with HIV and AIDS.\n  Since I took office, funding for AIDS research at the National \nInstitutes of Health has increased dramatically, to $1.5 billion. With \nnew resources, NIH will now become the most powerful discovery engine \nfor an AIDS vaccine, working with other scientists to finally end the \nthreat of AIDS. Every year we move up the discovery of an AIDS vaccine, \nwe can save millions of lives around the world.\n  To prepare America for the 21st Century, we must build stronger \nfamilies.\n  Over the past 4 years, the Family and Medical Leave Act has helped \nmillions of Americans take time off to be with their families. With new \npressures on people in the way they work and live, we should expand \nFamily Leave so that workers can take time off for teacher conferences \nand a child's medical checkup. We should pass flextime so workers can \nchoose to be paid for overtime in income, or trade it for time off to \nbe with their families.\n  We must continue, step-by-step, to give more families access to \naffordable, quality health care. 40 million Americans still lack health \ninsurance. 10 million children still lack health insurance. 80% of them \nhave working parents who pay taxes. That is wrong. My balanced budget \nwill extend health coverage to up to five million of those children. \nSince nearly half of all children who lose their insurance do so \nbecause their parents lose or change jobs, my budget will also ensure \nthat people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep \ntheir health insurance. No child should be without a doctor just \nbecause a parent is without a job.\n  My Medicare plan modernizes Medicare, increases the life of the Trust \nFund to 10 years, provides support for respite care for the many \nfamilies with loved-ones afflicted with Alzheimers--and for the first \ntime, it would fully pay for annual mammograms.\n  Just as we ended drive through deliveries of babies last year, we \nmust now end the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home \nfrom the hospital only hours after a mastectomy. I ask your support for \nbipartisan legislation to guarantee that women can stay in the hospital \nfor 48 hours after a mastectomy. With us tonight is Dr. Kristen Zarfos, \na Connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice spurred a national \nmovement and inspired this legislation. We thank her for her efforts.\n\n  In the last four years, we have increased child support collections \nby 50%. Now, we should go further, and make it a felony for any parent \nto cross state lines in an attempt to flee from this, his or her most \nsacred obligation.\n  Finally, we must also protect our children by standing firm in our \ndetermination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that \nendanger their lives.\n  To prepare America for the 21st Century, we must build stronger \ncommunities.\n  We should start with safe streets. Serious crime has dropped five \nyears in a row. The key has been community policing--and we must finish \nthe job of putting 100,000 community police on our streets. We should \npass the Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution.\n  And I ask you to join me in mounting a full scale assault on juvenile \ncrime, with legislation that: declares war on gangs, with new \nprosecutors and tougher penalties; extends the Brady Bill so violent \nteen criminals will never be able to buy handguns; requires child \nsafety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use; and helps to keep \nour schools open after hours, on weekends, and in the summer, so young \npeople will have someplace to go and something to say yes to.\n  My balanced budget includes the largest anti-drug effort ever: to \nstop drugs at their source, punish those who push them, and teach our \nyoung people that drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, and drugs will \nkill them.\n  Our growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural \nneighborhoods. But we must do more, to empower them to create the \nconditions in which families can flourish, and to create jobs through \ninvestment by business and loans by banks.\n  We should double the number of empowerment zones. They have already \nbrought hope to communities like Detroit, where the unemployment rate \nhas been cut in half in four years. We should restore contaminated \nurban land and buildings to productive use. We should expand the \nnetwork of community development banks.\n  And together, we must pledge tonight that we will use this \nempowerment approach--including private sector tax incentives--to renew \nour capital city, so that Washington is a great place to live and work, \nand is once again the proud face America shows to the world.\n  We must protect our environment in every community. In the last four \nyears, we cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites, as many as in the previous \ntwelve. Now we should clean up 500 more of them, so that our children \ngrow up next to parks, not poison. Big polluters must live by this \nsimple rule: If you pollute our environment, you pay to clean it up.\n\n  In the last four years, we strengthened the nation's safe food and \nclean drinking water laws. We protected some of America's rarest, most \nbeautiful land in Utah's Red Rocks region, created three new national \nparks in the California desert, and began to restore Florida's \nEverglades. Now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with \nour land. Tonight, I announce that this year I will designate 10 \nAmerican Heritage Rivers, to help communities alongside them revitalize \ntheir waterfronts and clean up pollution in the rivers, proving once \nagain that we can grow the economy as we protect the environment.\n  We must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst \ntoxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gasses that challenge our \nhealth even as they change our climate.\n\n[[Page S942]]\n\n  We all know that in all of our communities, some of our children \nsimply do not have what they need to grow and learn in their homes, or \nschools, or neighborhoods. The rest of us must do more, for they are \nour children too. That is why President Bush, General Colin Powell, and \nformer Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros will join Vice President Gore \nand me to lead the President's Summit of Service in Philadelphia in \nApril.\n  Our national service program, Americorps, has already helped 70,000 \nyoung people work their way through college as they serve America. Now \nwe intend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of \nways. Citizen service is an American responsibility, which all \nAmericans should embrace.\n  I'd like to make one last point about our national community. Our \neconomy is measured in numbers and statistics, and it's very important. \nBut the enduring worth of our nation lies in our values and our soaring \nspirit. So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the \narts and humanities, I believe we should stand by them, and challenge \nour artists, musicians and writers, our museums, libraries and \ntheaters, to join with all Americans to make the Year 2000 a national \ncelebration of the American spirit in every community--a celebration of \nour common culture in the century that has passed, and in the new one \nto come in the new millennium, so that we can remain the world's beacon \nof liberty and creativity, long after the fireworks have faded.\n  To prepare America for the 21st Century, we must master the forces of \nchange in the world and keep American leadership strong and sure for an \nuncharted time.\n  Fifty years ago, a farsighted America led in creating the \ninstitutions that secured victory in the Cold War and built a growing \nworld economy. As a result, today more people than ever embrace our \nideals and share our interests.\n  Already, we have dismantled many of the blocs and barriers that \ndivided our parents' world. For the first time, more people live under \ndemocracy than dictatorship, including every nation in our hemisphere \nbut one--and its day too will come.\n\n  Now, we stand at another moment of change and choice--and another \ntime to be farsighted, to bring America 50 more years of security and \nprosperity.\n  Our first task is to help build, for the first time, an undivided, \ndemocratic Europe. When Europe is stable, prosperous and at peace, \nAmerica is more secure.\n  To that end, we must expand NATO by 1999, so that countries that were \nonce our adversaries can become our allies. At the special NATO summit \nthis summer, that is what we will begin to do. We must strengthen \nNATO's Partnership for Peace with non-member allies. And we must build \na stable partnership between NATO and a democratic Russia.\n  An expanded NATO is good for America. And a Europe in which all \ndemocracies define their future not in terms of what they can do to \neach other, but in terms of what they can do together for the good of \nall--that kind of Europe is good for America.\n  Second, America must look to the East no less than the West. Our \nsecurity demands it: Americans have fought three wars in Asia this \ncentury. Our prosperity requires it: more than 2 million American jobs \ndepend upon trade with Asia.\n  There, too, we are helping to shape an Asian Pacific community of \ncooperation, not conflict. But we must not let our progress there mask \nthe peril that remains. Together with South Korea, we must advance \npeace talks with North Korea and bridge the Cold War's last divide. And \nI call on this Congress to fund our share of the agreement under which \nNorth Korea must continue to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear \nweapons program.\n  We must pursue a deeper dialogue with China--for the sake of our \ninterests and our ideals. An isolated China is not good for America. A \nChina playing its proper role in the world is. I will go to China and I \nhave invited China's president to come here, not because we agree on \neverything, but because engaging China is the best way to work on \ncommon challenges like ending nuclear testing--and to deal frankly with \nfundamental differences like human rights.\n  Third, the American people must prosper in the global economy. We \nhave worked hard to tear down trade barriers abroad, so that we can \ncreate good jobs at home. I am proud to say that today, America is once \nagain the most competitive nation, and the number one exporter in the \nworld.\n  Now, we must act to expand our exports, especially to Asia and Latin \nAmerica, the two fastest growing regions on earth--or be left behind as \nthese emerging economies forge new ties with other nations. That is why \nwe need the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open \nmarkets to our goods and services even as we preserve our values.\n  We need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy. We have \nthe best workers and the best products. In a truly open market, and we \ncan out-compete anyone in the world.\n  But this is about more than economics. By expanding trade, we can \nadvance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world.\n  We should all be proud that America led the effort to rescue our \nneighbor Mexico from its economic crisis--and we should all be proud \nthat last month, Mexico repaid the United States, three years ahead of \nschedule, with a half a billion dollars profit for us. And today our \nexports to Mexico are at an all time high.\n  Fourth, America must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace--\nfrom the Middle East to Haiti--from Northern Ireland to Africa. Taking \nreasonable risks for peace keeps us from being drawn into far more \ncostly conflicts later.\n  With American leadership, the killing has stopped in Bosnia. Now, the \nhabits of peace must take hold. The new NATO force will allow \nreconstruction and reconciliation to accelerate. Tonight, I ask \nCongress to continue its strong support for our troops there. They are \ndoing a remarkable job for America--and America must do right by them.\n  Fifth, we must move strongly against new threats to our security. In \nthe past four years, we agreed to ban nuclear testing. With Russia, we \ndramatically cut our nuclear arsenal; we stopped targeting each others \ncitizens. We are acting to rid the world of landmines, and prevent \nnuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands. We are working \nwith other nations, with renewed intensity, to stop terrorists and drug \ntraffickers before they act, and to hold them fully accountable if they \ndo.\n  Now, we must rise to a new test of leadership: ratifying the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. It will make our troops safer from chemical attack. \nIt will help us to fight terrorism. We have no more important \nobligations--especially in the wake of what we now know about the Gulf \nWar. This treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning, supported by \nRepublican and Democratic administrations alike--and Republican and \nDemocratic Members of Congress alike--and already approved by 68 \nnations. If we do not act by April 29--when this Convention goes into \nforce, with us or without us--we will lose the chance to have Americans \nleading and enforcing this effort. Together, we must make the Chemical \nWeapons Convention law, so that at last we can begin to outlaw poison \ngas from the earth.\n  Finally, we must have the tools to meet all these challenges.\n  We must maintain a strong and ready military. We must increase \nfunding for weapons modernization by the Year 2000, and we must take \ngood care of our men and women in uniform. They are the world's finest.\n  We must also renew our commitment to America's diplomacy--and pay our \ndebts and dues to international financial institutions like the World \nBank, and to a reforming United Nations. Every dollar we devote to \npreventing conflicts, to promoting democracy, to stopping the spread of \ndisease and starvation, brings a sure return in security and savings. \nYet international affairs spending today is just one percent of the \nfederal budget--a tiny fraction of what America invested in diplomacy \nto choose leadership over escapism at the start of the Cold War. If \nAmerica is to continue to lead the world, we here who lead America \nsimply must find the will to pay our way.\n  A farsighted America moved the world to a better place over these \nlast fifty years. And it can do so for another fifty years. But a \nshortsighted\n\n[[Page S943]]\n\nAmerica will soon find its words falling on deaf ears all around the \nworld.\n  Almost exactly fifty years ago, in the first winter of the Cold War, \nPresident Harry Truman stood before a Republican Congress and called \nupon our country to meet its responsibilities of leadership. This was \nhis warning: ``If we falter, we may endanger the peace of the world--\nand we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation.'' That \nCongress, led by Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenberg, answered \nPresident Truman's call. Together, they made the commitments that \nstrengthened our country for fifty years. Now let us do the same. Let \nus do what it takes to remain the indispensable nation--to keep America \nstrong, secure and prosperous for another fifty years.\n  In the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out \nof the power of our example here at home, out of our ability to remain \nstrong as one America.\n  All over the world, people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic, \nand religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror. We are the \nworld's most diverse democracy. And the world looks to us to show that \nit is possible to live and advance together across those kinds of \ndifferences.\n  America has always been a nation of immigrants. From the start, a \nsteady stream of people, in search of freedom and opportunity, have \nleft their own lands to make this land their home. We started as an \nexperiment in democracy fueled by Europeans. We have grown into an \nexperiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and promise.\n  My fellow Americans, we must never believe that diversity is a \nweakness--it is our greatest strength. Americans speak every language, \nknow every country. People on every continent can look to us and see \nthe reflection of their own greatness, as long as we give all of our \ncitizens, whatever their background, an opportunity to achieve their \ngreatness.\n  We are not there yet. We still see evidence of abiding bigotry and \nintolerance, in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and \nbombed buildings. We must fight against this, in our country and in our \nhearts.\n  A few days before my second inauguration, one of America's best known \npastors, Rev. Robert Schuller, suggested that I read Isaiah 58:12. It \nsays: ``Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and \nthou shalt be called, the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths \nto dwell in.'' I placed my hand on that verse when I took the oath of \noffice, on behalf of all Americans. For no matter what our \ndifferences--in our faiths, our backgrounds, our politics--we must all \nbe repairers of the breach. We may not share a common past, but surely \nwe share a common future.\n  I want to say a word about two other Americans who show us the way to \nthat common future. Congressman Frank Tejeda was buried yesterday, a \nproud American whose family came from Mexico. He was only 51 years old. \nHe earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart \nfighting for his country in Vietnam, and he went on to serve Texas and \nAmerica fighting for our future in this chamber. We are grateful for \nhis service and honored to have his mother, Lillie Tejeda, with us \ntonight.\n  Gary Locke, the newly elected Governor of Washington State, is our \nfirst Chinese-American Governor, the proud son of two of the millions \nof Asian-American immigrants who have strengthened America with their \nhard work, family values, and good citizenship.\n  Rev. Schuller, Congressman Tejeda, Governor Locke, along with Kristin \nTanner, Chris Getsla, Sue Winski and Dr. Kristen Zarfos--all Americans \nfrom different roots, whose lives reflect our shared values and the \nbest of what we can become when we are one America.\n  Building that one America is our most important mission, ``the \nfoundation of many generations,'' of every other strength we must build \nfor the new century. Money cannot buy it. Power cannot compel it. \nTechnology cannot create it. It must rise from the human spirit.\n  America is far more than a place. It is an idea, the most powerful \nidea in the history of nations. We are now the bearers of that idea, \nleading a great people into a new world. A child born tonight will have \nalmost no memory of the 20th Century. Everything that child will know \nof America, will be because of what we do now to build a new century.\n  We don't have a moment to waste. Tomorrow morning, there will be just \nover 1,000 days until the Year 2000. 1,000 days to prepare our people. \n1,000 days to work together. My fellow Americans, we have work to do. \nLet us seize the days and the century.\n  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S939-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following resolution:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for \nthe reallocation and auction of a portion of the electromagnetic \nspectrum to enhance law enforcement and public safety \ntelecommunications, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS EMPOWERMENT \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Law Enforcement \nand Public Safety Telecommunications Empowerment Act. This legislation \naddresses a longstanding need by police, fire departments, and \nemergency medical services for more channels of radio communication and \nfor more state-of-the-art technology to use in their efforts to \nsafeguard life and property.\n  Mr. President, the telecommunications needs of the public safety \ncommunity have been a subject of widespread concern for many years. In \nmany instances, channel capacity for safety-of-life communications is \ndangerously low. In many others, budgetary constraints have kept law \nenforcement and other public safety officials from getting new \ncommunications equipment and services that\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\nwould make their transmissions more efficient and reliable.\n  Most recently, a Federal advisory committee documented these needs \nfor more spectrum. There are clearly ways this can be done. But \nspectrum is a limited, and therefore very valuable, resource, and big \nbusinesses that would compete for this same spectrum must not be \nallowed to divert it for commercial use. Further, this bill creates \nspecific mechanisms that will continue over the years to assure that \nmoney and equipment are available for the continuing need of those \nwhose job is to safeguard our lives, our health, and our property.\n  Let me outline the provisions of this bill. First, the bill orders \nthe FCC to give public safety radio users four new radio channels. \nThese new channels are currently allocated to television use and are \nlocated between TV channels 60 and 69. Ongoing plans to convert \ntelevision broadcasting to more spectrum-efficient digital transmission \ntechnology is expected to make this channel reallocation possible \nwithout significant impact on the television service people receive.\n  Next, this legislation provides that the rest of the available \nspectrum between TV channels 60 and 69 will be auctioned to the highest \nbidder for commercial use. Of the money raised, 10 percent, or a sum of \nnot less than $200,000,000 or more than $750,000,000, is earmarked for \ndistribution to the Governors of each of the States for use in \npurchasing services and equipment that would increase the ability of \npublic safety radio users to communicate quickly and easily in times of \nemergency.\n  Third, to make sure that the four new public safety radio channels \nare used in as efficient a manner as possible and to provide added \npublic safety communications resources tailored to their specific \nneeds, this legislation gives the Governors the authority to lease, \nsell, or otherwise dispose of any extra channel capacity they may have. \nThis will enable them to procure new technology or services that will \nfurther improve the effectiveness of public safety communications. The \nremainder of the money raised at auction would be used for deficit \nreduction.\n  Mr. President, in closing, this is a fair bill. The spectrum is owned \nby the public and the public should benefit from its use. This plan \nbenefits the public in two ways: It helps protect the public by \naugmenting police and fire services, and it helps pay down the deficit.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this measure. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement and Public \n     Safety Telecommunications Empowerment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Improvements in technology have made it possible for \n     television broadcast stations to offer advanced television \n     services.\n       (2) To facilitate the transition to advanced television \n     services, the Federal Communications Commission is issuing \n     additional licenses to existing broadcast licensees and \n     permittees under section 336 of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 336).\n       (3) As part of the transition to advanced television \n     services, the Federal Communications Commission will develop \n     and implement an allotment plan that will permit the \n     repacking of television broadcast station licenses into a \n     smaller segment of the Very High Frequency and Ultra High \n     Frequency bands than presently used for broadcast television.\n       (4) Implementation of the advanced television service \n     transition plan will enable the Federal Communications \n     Commission to allocate spectrum to other purposes.\n       (5) Implementation of the advanced television service \n     transition plan will permit recovery for the public of a \n     portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made \n     available for commercial use.\n       (6) Many of the State and local agencies responsible for \n     law enforcement and public safety have inadequate spectrum \n     and inadequate funding to maintain the existing level of, or \n     to effect improvements in, the radio communications on which \n     they depend to perform their missions.\n       (7) Implementation of the advanced television service \n     transition plan will permit State and local law enforcement \n     and public safety agencies to secure additional spectrum and \n     additional funding for mission-related activities.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act, the term--\n       (1) ``Board'' means the Board of Directors of the \n     Institute;\n       (2) ``Director'' means the Executive Director of the \n     Institute;\n       (3) ``Governor'' means the Chief Executive Officer of a \n     State;\n       (4) ``Institute'' means the Public Safety \n     Telecommunications Institute;\n       (5) ``recipient'' means any grantee, contractor, or \n     recipient of financial assistance under this Act; and\n       (6) ``State'' means any State of the United States and \n     includes the District of Columbia.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The Institute shall work closely with the \n     Commission in assigning licenses for the commercial use of \n     that spectrum, and shall make such assignments in accordance \n     with rules established by the Commission.\n       ``(f) Sequential Assignment of Surplus Public Safety \n     Spectrum.--If the Governor of any State to which spectrum is \n     assigned for law enforcement and public safety purposes \n     determines that a portion of that spectrum is excess to the \n     needs of the State for such purposes, then the Governor may \n     lease, sell, or otherwise assign any such excess portion to \n     any person for any lawful purpose under this Act under such \n     terms and conditions as the Governor may require. Any term \n     used in this subsection that is defined in section 3 of the \n     Law Enforcement and Public Safety Telecommunications \n     Empowerment Act has the meaning given to it by that section.\n       ``(g) Effective Date for Auctioned Spectrum.--Licenses \n     assigned under subsection (e) shall become effective on the \n     day after the date on which the advanced television services \n     transition period terminates, as determined by the \n     Commission.

Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to \naddress a matter of great concern to all dairy farmers in the Nation--\nthe lack of a credible milk-pricing system. Though there are many \naspects of the milk-pricing system in need of reform, the legislation \nthat I am introducing today seeks to address concerns about the \npotential for manipulation on the National Cheese Exchange [NCE] in \nGreen Bay, WI, and the influence of the NCE on farmers' milk prices.\n  Last year, a 3-year study funded by USDA, and conducted by economists \nat the University of Wisconsin-Madison, highlighted the flaws of the \nNational Cheese Exchange. Specifically, the report showed that although \nless than 1 percent of the nation's cheese is traded on the exchange, \nthe price resulting from the exchange's weekly trading sessions acts as \na reference price for nearly 95 percent of the commercial bulk cheese \nsales in the country. Further, the NCE price is also used by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture as a factor in calculating the monthly \nminimum price that farmers receive for their milk.\n  The report raised serious concerns about the appropriateness of \nallowing a market that is as thinly traded, highly concentrated, \nunregulated, and subject to manipulation as the NCE to have such \nextreme influence over farmers' milk checks and national cheese prices.\n  Since the report was released, a great deal of time has been devoted \nto a discussion of whether certain companies or cooperatives have \nintentionally manipulated the exchange. I personally asked the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to review the \nreport, to determine if any antitrust laws had been violated. While I \nam not convinced that either agency gave much attention to the matter, \nboth replied that they saw no sign of illegality in the activities by \nlarge traders on the NCE.\n  While these questions of legality and manipulation are valid, they \nare questions that may never be resolved to anyone's satisfaction. \nUltimately what I believe to be the most important exercise is to find \na market that will be more reflective of supply and demand, and to \neliminate any potential for manipulation in price discovery. Farmers \nand consumers alike deserve to know that markets are fair and \naboveboard.\n  With that goal in mind, my colleagues from Wisconsin, Senator \nFeingold and Congressman Obey, and I have worked continuously on \nseveral initiatives to create and promote alternative price discovery \nmechanisms, and to urge Federal and State regulatory agencies to \nexercise any authorities they might have to oversee the operations of \nthe exchange.\n\n\n             Need for an Alternative Cash Market for Cheese\n\n  With regard to the possible establishment of alternative cash markets \nfor cheese, several months ago, Senator Feingold and I asked the \nCoffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange [CSCE] to explore the possibility of \nestablishing such an alternative. The CSCE, which already trades \nfutures contracts for cheese, is regulated by the U.S. Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, and imposes strict self-regulatory \nguidelines on its traders as well.\n  Further, there is some hope that the establishment of cash market for \ncheese on the CSCE, and the more direct connection to the existing \ncheese futures trading business, would lead to an increased volume of \ntrading on both the cash and futures markets for cheese.\n  I have been very pleased to see that the CSCE is seriously \nconsidering our proposal, and is actively exploring the possibility of \ncreating a cash market for cheese in the near term. While there is no \nguarantee that such a market will be successful, it is my hope that the \nCSCE leadership will opt to establish such a market, and will establish \nand enforce guidelines to assure that the new market does not merely \nmimic the flaws of the National Cheese Exchange.\n  However, even if the CSCE decides to establish an alternative market \nfor\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\ncheese, it will be some time before the influence of the National \nCheese Exchange over farmers' milk prices and national cheese prices is \ndiminished. Therefore, I have tried to deal with that problem directly \nand immediately.\n\n\n   Efforts to Reduce the Influence of the NCE on Farmers' Milk Prices\n\n  First, since I believe that it is inappropriate for an unregulated \nand thinly traded market like the NCE to be used in setting farmers' \nmilk prices, I and other members of the Wisconsin congressional \ndelegation have asked Secretary Glickman to delink the NCE from the \ncalculation of the basic formula price [BFP]. Therefore, I was very \npleased last week when Secretary Glickman announced a 60-day comment \nperiod to solicit comments about whether to delink the NCE from the \ncalculation of the BFP. I am hopeful that this process will free \nfarmers' milk checks from the direct connection to NCE within a few \nshort months.\n  But even if the Secretary decides to eliminate the direct link \nbetween the NCE price and the basic formula price, farmers' milk prices \nwill still be indirectly linked to the NCE, as long as industry leaders \ncontinue to use the NCE as a reference price for forward contracts for \nbulk cheese. Since cheese is such a dominant end product for milk, \nespecially in Wisconsin, as long as cheese prices are set off the NCE, \nthe NCE will be remain a major factor in milk prices.\n  That is why, in the long term, I believe the creation of an \nalternative market for cheese, which could become the new reference \nprice for bulk cheese contracts, will be in the best interest of \nfarmers, consumers, and cheese manufacturers.\n  However, until that happens, we must continue in the efforts to fix \nsome of the flaws of the National Cheese Exchange. And it is with that \npurpose that I am introducing the National Cheese Exchange Oversight \nand Improvement Act, to require the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to oversee the activities of the NCE.\n\n\n Legislation Needed to Require Federal Regulatory Oversight of the NCE\n\n  In October of 1996, Senator Feingold, Congressman Obey, and I wrote \nto the CFTC to urge them to oversee the activities of the National \nCheese Exchange. This month, we received a response letter explaining \nthat the CFTC, as a futures market regulatory agency, has very limited \nauthority over cash markets. In the letter, CFTC Acting Director \nTheodore C. Barreaux states,\n\n       The Commodity Exchange Act does not provide the CFTC with \n     regulatory jurisdiction over the day-to-day operations of \n     cash commodity markets * * * The Commodity Exchange Act does \n     confer on the CFTC the authority to investigate possible \n     manipulation of cash markets and to impose sanctions based on \n     its findings, if appropriate. Historically, given the \n     Commission's principal regulatory responsibility over futures \n     and options markets and its relatively limited resources, the \n     CFTC has focused its investigative attention on cash market \n     activity that involves possible adverse impact on one or more \n     of the numerous futures and option markets which it \n     regulates.\n\n  However, it seems very likely that the industrywide concern about the \nlack of viability of the cash market for cheese, is a direct factor in \nthe reluctance of the industry to participate more fully in the trading \nof futures contracts for cheese on the CSCE. Therefore, I believe that \nthe NCE does have a more direct nexus with the futures market than the \nCFTC is acknowledging.\n  However, accepting CFTC's claim that it lacks the necessary authority \nto oversee or regulate the NCE, this legislation is intended to give \nthe Commission the explicit authority to do so, at least until the \nCommission determines that the NCE is no longer acting as a reference \nprice for commercial sales of bulk cheese of the NCE.\n  While I understand the concern of the Commission that requiring CFTC \nregulation of cash markets would open a Pandora's box of new work for \nthe Commission, the bill has been written in a very narrow manner, so \nas only to require regulation of the NCE, or other concentrated cash \nmarkets that share the specific flaws of the NCE.\n  I believe there are certain circumstances where a cash market has \nsuch great influence over national prices, and is so subject to \nmanipulation, that it needs to be regulated. And the cheese exchange is \nperhaps the best example of that.\n  When you have a cash market that is very thinly traded, completely \nunregulated, and used as a reference price for both raw product prices \npaid to farmers and commercial end product sales, something must be \ndone to bring some credibility to the market.\n  It is my hope that this legislation could be attached as an amendment \nto the Commodity Exchange Act reauthorization, which is on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee agenda for early action this year. I look forward \nto working with Chairman Lugar, Senator Harkin, and the other members \nof the committee to assure that the necessary Federal oversight of the \nNCE is put in place.\n  Further, I welcome my colleague Senator Feingold as an original \ncosponsor of this legislation, and thank Congressman Obey and other \nmembers of the Wisconsin House delegation for introducing companion \nlegislation in the House today as well. It is very gratifying that the \nWisconsin delegation is working cooperatively and constructively in \nadvancing these necessary dairy pricing reforms.\n  In that regard, I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor of the \nMilk Price Discovery Improvement Act of 1997, as introduced today by \nSenator Feingold. This legislation will make the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture an equal partner in the NCE reform efforts by: First, \nrequiring USDA to delink the NCE opinion price from the USDA basic \nformula price [BFP], which establishes minimum milk prices paid to \nfarmers; second, requires USDA to take steps to improve price discovery \nfor cheese, in order to reduce the influence of the NCE on farmers' \nmilk prices; and third, requires USDA to prohibit competitive practices \non any cash market that may affect milk prices regulated under Federal \nmilk marketing orders.\n  While my legislation requires CFTC oversight of the NCE and its day-\nto-day rules of operation, Senator Feingold's legislation requires USDA \nauthority to prohibit anticompetitive actions by traders on the NCE. \nThese two roles are entirely compatible and complementary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill summary, and the \nfull text of the bill, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that the operation of the National \n     Cheese Exchange and other cash markets is of national concern \n     and in need of Federal oversight because of the following:\n       (1) The National Cheese Exchange, located in Green Bay, \n     Wisconsin, is the dominant cash market for bulk cheese in the \n     United States.\n       (2) While less than 1 percent of the cheese produced in the \n     United States is sold on the National Cheese Exchange, the \n     price determined by the National Cheese Exchange acts as a \n     reference price for as much as 95 percent of the commercial \n     cheese transactions conducted in the United States.\n       (3) A three-year federally funded investigation into the \n     activities of the National Cheese Exchange determined that \n     the National Cheese Exchange is very thinly traded, highly \n     concentrated, completely unregulated, and subject to \n     manipulation.\n       (4) The Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange in New York, an \n     exchange regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission, trades futures contracts for cheese.\n       (5) The low volume in trading of cheese futures contracts \n     on the Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange is partially related \n     to concerns about the lack of viability, and potential for \n     manipulation, in the dominant cash market for cheese, the \n     National Cheese Exchange.\n       (6) The National Cheese Exchange is completely unregulated \n     by any Federal or State agency.\n       (7) The Commodity Futures Trading Commission claims a lack \n     of authority to regulate or oversee the National Cheese \n     Exchange and similar cash markets.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to improve the \nact, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senators \nHarkin and Leahy, legislation to amend the Commodity Exchange Act. This \nbill is very similar to S. 2077, which Senator Leahy and I introduced \nlast September after several months of hearings and informal \nconsultations with industry, academics, and regulators. The legislation \nstreamlines U.S. futures trading law, conforming it to changing \ncompetitive realities.\n  In many ways, regulation has benefited the U.S. futures industry. \nPrudent regulation enhances customer protection, prevents and punishes \nfraud and other abuses, and makes futures markets better able to \nprovide risk management, price discovery, and investment opportunity.\n  Regulation, however, also has its costs. U.S. futures markets face \ncompetition that is, in some cases, less regulated or differently \nregulated. In the years ahead, our challenge is to balance the need for \nadequate regulation with the need to offer cost-competitive products.\n  This bill tries to strike such a balance. It requires the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission to consider the costs for industry of the \nregulations it imposes. The bill streamlines the process of introducing \nnew futures contracts, reducing the time that is required to begin \ntrading these new products. It makes similar reforms to the process by \nwhich exchanges' rules are reviewed by the CFTC.\n  Where additional authority for the CFTC is needed, the bill provides \nit. The CFTC will have the authority to require U.S. delivery points \nfor overseas futures markets to provide information that is also \nregularly demanded of American market participants. This is eminently \nreasonable, and may assist the CFTC and other regulators in the future \nif situations similar to the 1996 London copper market scandal recur.\n  The bill will also provide greater legal certainty for swaps, over-\nthe-counter products that are of increasing importance to many \nbusinesses. It is important that these contracts' enforceability be \nmade more certain, so that legal risk does not compound the other risks \ninherent in any financial transaction. In one important addition to \nlast year's legislation, the new bill will also provide this legal \ncertainty for swaps that are based on equities, as well as for hybrid \ninstruments. In a more limited way, the bill will establish the terms \nof exemptions for on-exchange products traded solely among professional \ninvestors.\n  Another addition to last year's legislation is a major rewrite of the \nso-called Treasury amendment, a provision of the Commodity Exchange Act \nthat excludes some financial products from its regulatory coverage. \nThis controversial section is at best unclear, and needs a fresh look \nfrom Congress. I hope the proposals we have made in this bill--which \nare explained in a discussion document I will mention in a moment--will \nboth stimulate dialog and find wide acceptance.\n  It is unfortunate that the CFTC and the Treasury Department, which \ndiscussed this subject at Senator Leahy's and my request, were unable \nto agree on a common approach. However, the committee will work with \nboth agencies as we move forward. Despite some differences in drafting, \nI believe the Treasury Department's ideas are basically consistent with \nwhat Senators Harkin, Leahy, and I have proposed. The Treasury did not \npropose, as we do, to allow futures exchanges to create professionals-\nonly markets in Treasury amendment products. However, Senator Harkin \nand I are informed that while the Treasury is still studying\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\nthis proposal, in principle the Department does not object to treating \nexchange affiliates in a manner similar to other sophisticated market \nparticipants.\n  The bill contains a number of other provisions. Senator Harkin and I \nhave prepared a section-by-section discussion document, which may be \nhelpful to our colleagues.\n  On February 11 and 13, the committee will hold hearings on this \nlegislation. It is a priority for the committee during the coming weeks \nand months.\n  I would like to thank Senator Harkin for his extraordinary \ncooperation in putting this bill together. As the new ranking member of \nthe committee, he has been gracious and collegial. Likewise, Senator \nLeahy's efforts both last year and this year deserve special praise. I \nsalute them both for their leadership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Foreign currency and government securities transactions \n     are the most prominent categories of transactions excluded by \n     the Treasury amendment, though there are several others. The \n     history, purpose and scope of the Treasury amendment have \n     been the subject of frequent disagreement even among federal \n     agencies, and the provision has been frequently litigated.\n       The CFTC has historically asserted that the amendment \n     permits it to enforce the Act against firms offering Treasury \n     amendment products to the general public, arguing that the \n     amendment's purpose was merely to exclude such institutional \n     markets as the interbank currency market from regulation. \n     Other agencies have dissented from this view. In addition, \n     futures exchanges have argued that they should be able to \n     offer contracts in Treasury amendment products that would not \n     be subject to CFTC regulation, as long as they did not offer \n     these contracts to the general public but only to a \n     sophisticated, institutional or professional clientele.\n       The Committee, in mid-1996, asked the CFTC and the Treasury \n     Department to arrive at a consensus on how the Treasury \n     amendment should be interpreted and, if necessary, re-\n     written. Unfortunately, the agencies were unable to agree and \n     have formulated recommendations that are quite different in \n     both intent and effect.\n       This legislation reflects a view that there should be a \n     federal role in protecting retail investors from abusive, \n     improper or fraudulent activity in connection with the sale \n     of foreign currency futures or options by an otherwise \n     unregulated entity. By the same token, the legislation \n     provides no role for the CFTC where other regulators--\n     including the banking and securities agencies--already \n     provide federal regulatory oversight. Similarly, the bill \n     views current regulation of other off-exchange Treasury \n     amendment products as adequate and does not provide a role \n     for the CFTC in this regard. For example, federal agencies \n     and private firms alike have widely agreed that it would be \n     unnecessary and inappropriate for the CFTC to regulate the \n     ``when-issued'' market in Treasury securities.\n       The bill defines more clearly the CFTC's role in regulating \n     retail transactions and affords equivalent opportunities for \n     futures exchanges to develop markets in Treasury amendment \n     products for professional investors. In particular, the bill \n     states that an unsupervised entity systematically marketing \n     standardized, non-negotiable foreign currency transactions to \n     retail investors will be considered a ``board of trade,'' and \n     hence subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction.\n       The bill instructs the CFTC to define the term ``retail \n     investors,'' and provides some guidance on how to do so. It \n     further clarifies that an option involving a Treasury \n     amendment product is a ``transaction,'' meaning that it is \n     excluded from the Act to the same extent as other \n     transactions. Finally, the bill retains the current Treasury \n     amendment provision which extends CFTC jurisdiction to \n     products offered on a board of trade, but makes this \n     provision apply only when these products are offered to the \n     general public. The effect is that futures exchanges would be \n     able to develop separate markets in Treasury amendment \n     products. As is the case when such products are traded over \n     the counter among institutions today, the Act and its \n     regulations would not apply. The bill instructs the CFTC to \n     define the term ``the general public,'' in order to make \n     clear the parameters under which exchanges may establish \n     these markets. The bill also confirms the CFTC's ability, \n     acting pursuant to its emergency powers under Sec. 8a(9) of \n     the Act, to secure the integrity and viability of approved \n     contract markets in the event that market factors, including \n     the establishment by futures exchanges of markets in Treasury \n     amendment products, adversely affect them.\n\n\n                            sec. 3. hedging\n\n       The CEA does not directly define the term ``hedging.'' In \n     Section 3 of the CEA, which contains various legislative \n     findings that justify regulation of futures markets, the \n     statute speaks of business operators ``hedging themselves \n     against possible loss through fluctuations in price.'' \n     Questions have been raised whether hedging can occur against \n     risks other than price risks--for instance, in new futures \n     contracts that are based on yields of specified crops in \n     particular States. The bill deletes the phrase ``through \n     fluctuations in price.'' It makes clear that risks to be \n     hedged may be risks other than those directly resulting from \n     price changes. This change will not affect the authority to \n     establish speculative limits, require reporting of large \n     trader positions and otherwise ensure market integrity.\n       In the course of hearings and discussions on the proposed \n     legislation, the Committee may also consider whether to \n     revise Section 3 of the Act more extensively in order to \n     bring it up to date with market needs and conditions, \n     preserving the Act's important functions of facilitating \n     price discovery and customer protection while recognizing the \n     changes that have occurred in the composition and \n     sophistication of market participants as well as the more \n     competitive environment in which the futures industry now \n     operates.\n\n\n         sec. 4. delivery points for foreign futures contracts\n\n       In recent years, some overseas futures exchanges have \n     established delivery points in the United States. The \n     implications of making and taking delivery of a physical \n     commodity that is priced on a foreign exchange may differ, \n     depending on the comparability of price discovery on that \n     exchange and on U.S. exchanges, as well as other factors. \n     Serious questions were raised last year, as various \n     allegations about the copper markets were made and \n     investigated, about what role, if any, delivery points for \n     foreign futures contracts may have played in that affair. \n     These questions are not yet answered. However, the \n     legislation makes changes that will be appropriate regardless \n     of the outcome of specific investigations.\n       The bill directs the CFTC to consult with overseas \n     regulators and other appropriate parties in countries where \n     futures exchanges have established U.S. delivery points. \n     The aim of the consultations will be to secure adequate \n     assurances against any adverse effect on U.S. markets \n     because of these delivery points. Such assurances could \n     take the form of changes to regulations or trading rules \n     in the overseas market.\n       The bill also gives the CFTC authority to obtain \n     information from warehouses that are delivery points for \n     foreign exchanges. This information would be similar to that \n     which the CFTC may already require of persons making trades \n     on overseas futures markets, and will assist the CFTC in \n     ensuring market integrity, preventing abuses, and otherwise \n     discharging its responsibilities.\n\n\n             SEC. 5. EXEMPTION AUTHORITY AND SWAP EXEMPTION\n\n       The Act gives the CFTC authority to exempt transactions \n     from its regulatory requirements, either completely or on \n     stated terms. In 1993, the CFTC used this authority to exempt \n     swap agreements from most, but not all, portions of the Act. \n     This exemption generally has worked well, facilitating a \n     climate in which swaps, which offer numerous benefits to \n     their users if properly and prudently employed, could trade \n     with secure legal status. (It was the lack of such legal \n     certainty which, in part, prompted Congress to enact the \n     exemptive authority.) Despite the CFTC's prompt action \n     following the 1992 enactment of exemptive authority, the \n     status of swaps remains subject to a change in regulations \n     that could subject these instruments to renewed legal \n     uncertainty.\n       The bill will provide additional legal certainty for swaps \n     and similar transactions in three ways. First, the bill \n     codifies the present exemption from regulation for \n     transactions that meet its requirements, either now or in the \n     future. For these qualifying instruments--which now rely on \n     the exemptions for swaps in Part 35 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations and for hybrid instruments in Part 34--a \n     statutory change would be required in order for the exemption \n     to become more restrictive than it now is. The codification \n     does not affect the CFTC's power to grant additional \n     exemptions that would be less restrictive than, or \n     independent of, the current exemption. Nor does it limit the \n     CFTC's ability to enforce antimanipulation or anti-fraud \n     provisions of the CEA as they may apply to these transactions \n     or as the present exemptions may be conditioned on compliance \n     with their provisions. The CFTC will have, under the codified \n     exemption, the same authority to enforce these provisions of \n     the Act as it has retained under its current policies. In \n     addition, the CFTC would implement the conditions for an \n     exemption, such as making creditworthiness a material \n     consideration, in a manner consistent with its current \n     interpretations. (It has been suggested that some additional \n     conforming changes may also be appropriate to Section 12(e) \n     of the Act.)\n       Second, the bill codifies two important elements of the \n     present swaps exemptive authority, again to enhance legal \n     certainty. The legislation clarifies that the CFTC may issue \n     an exemption that is applicable to the extent the exempted \n     transaction may have been subject to the Act--i.e., without \n     requiring a prior decision on whether the transaction \n     actually was, in fact, subject to the Act. Relatedly, the \n     legislation states that the mere fact that a transaction was \n     exempted from the Act does not, in itself, create a \n     presumption that the transaction was one that would have \n     fallen under the Act's regulatory requirements had it not \n     been exempted. Thus, the bill makes the existence of an \n     exemption a neutral event, for purposes of determining \n     whether the exempted transaction was subject to the Act: \n     No inference for or against such a determination is \n     warranted by the mere fact of an exemption. Both these \n     clarifications are consistent with present regulations for \n     these exemptions.\n       Third, the bill for the first time extends the same legal \n     certainty to swaps based on equities as is now available for \n     other swaps. Although the great majority of swaps involve \n     interest rates or currencies, there presently exist swaps \n     based on equities or equity indices. The legal status of \n     these instruments has been less certain than that of other \n     swaps; they rely primarily on a 1989 policy statement by the \n     CFTC which predates the present swaps exemption. The bill \n     codifies, for these swaps, the same exempt\n\n[[Page S957]]\n\n     status as for other similar instruments: To the extent they \n     may be subject to the Act's provisions, they will be exempt \n     from those provisions (other than anti-fraud and anti-\n     manipulation strictures) as long as they satisfy the terms \n     and conditions of the present swaps exemption as to the way \n     in which they are structured and traded, and as to the \n     persons who may enter into them.\n\n\n            SEC. 6. EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS ON CONTRACT MARKETS\n\n       In contrast to the exemptions for swaps and hybrids, the \n     Commission's exemptive terms for on-exchange professionally \n     traded markets (codified in Part 36 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations) have not led to significant commercial activity. \n     The legislation provides that such markets may be established \n     by futures exchanges, subject to some limitations. In \n     particular, the bill does not exempt such ``professional \n     markets'' from the so-called ``Shad-Johnson'' accord, which \n     governs on-exchange products involving equities. Moreover, \n     the legislation excludes agricultural commodities from the \n     list of products for which the professional markets must be \n     recognized.\n\n\n                      SEC. 7. CONTRACT DESIGNATION\n\n       The Act now requires futures exchanges to be ``designated'' \n     as a ``contract market'' for each futures contract they \n     trade. This process has been streamlined by the CFTC in \n     recent years, but the statute continues to reflect a rather \n     elaborate process in which, in many ways, the burden of proof \n     is placed on exchanges to demonstrate why they should be able \n     to offer new products for trading. Even for a sector like the \n     the futures industry, where the public interest requires \n     regulation, this implicit presumption against new product \n     development is out of date.\n       The bill streamlines the process of introducing new futures \n     contracts, both by compressing the time available for agency \n     review and by creating a presumption that products developed \n     by exchanges should be permitted to trade unless the CFTC \n     finds compellingly why they should not. The legislation \n     treats new contract applications as rules, albeit under \n     somewhat different procedures from other exchange rules. \n     Under the new procedure, an exchange submits a new contract \n     to the CFTC. The new contract may trade after 10 business \n     days, unless the CFTC states an intention to review it for \n     possible disapproval. After a further 15 business days, the \n     new contract can be traded unless the CFTC institutes \n     proceedings to disapprove it. These proceedings are to be \n     completed within 120 days; if not, the new contract can trade \n     until and unless it is finally disapproved. In contrast to \n     the present burden on an exchange to show that a contract is \n     in ``the public interest,'' the CFTC could only disapprove \n     a contract by showing that it was ``contrary to the public \n     interest'' (or by showing that it violated law or \n     regulations). The philosophy is a fairly simple one: \n     Subject to prudent regulatory limits, private futures \n     exchanges can more appropriately and efficiently decide \n     which new products are ripe for trading than can the \n     government. The exchanges may sometimes err in these \n     judgments, but that is the way markets work.\n\n\n           sec. 8. delivery by federally licensed warehouses\n\n       An obscure provision of the Act now allows any federally \n     licensed grain warehouse to make delivery against a futures \n     contract, on giving reasonable notice. Though seldom if ever \n     used, this provision appears to conflict with the ability of \n     exchanges to establish their own trading procedures, \n     including delivery points. In an extremely tight market, the \n     current provision could in some circumstances facilitate \n     market manipulation. The bill repeals this provision.\n\n\n               sec. 9. submission of rules to commission\n\n       The bill revises current requirements for submitting \n     exchange rules to the CFTC. These rules affect the everyday \n     procedures for doing business on the exchange, as well as the \n     ground rules for trading. They run the gamut from major to \n     minor. As with the procedures for approving new contracts, \n     the legislation compresses the time available for federal \n     review and generally streamlines procedures. Rules are to be \n     submitted to the CFTC and can become effective in 10 business \n     days unless the CFTC notifies the exchange that it will \n     review them for possible disapproval. If the CFTC does not \n     institute disapproval proceedings within 45 days of receiving \n     the proposed rule, or conclude its proceedings within 120 \n     days, the rule can become effective until and unless \n     disapproved.\n       The authors of the bill intend that its legislative history \n     will also discuss the implementation of statutory \n     requirements for the composition of exchange boards of \n     directors. The CFTC will be directed to report, on an ongoing \n     basis, its evaluation of how fully these requirements are \n     being met. The report language will provide further \n     clarification of Congressional intent with regard to the \n     qualification of individuals to satisfy particular \n     requirements for board representation.\n\n\n                          sec. 10. audit trail\n\n       Futures exchanges are subject to audit trail requirements \n     that are intended to ensure market integrity, and to deter \n     and detect abuse. The bill clarifies these requirements in \n     one respect. It states--consistent with testimony by the CFTC \n     before Congress in 1995--that the audit trail requirements \n     establish a performance standard, not a mandate for any \n     particular technological means of achieving the standard. In \n     further support of this clarification, the bill speaks of the \n     ``means selected by the contract market'' for meeting audit \n     trail standards. The authors of the bill intend that its \n     legislative history will also note further CFTC testimony \n     that, in assessing the ``practicability'' of various \n     components of the audit trail standards, the cost to \n     exchanges of meeting the standards is one factor to be taken \n     into account.\n\n\n              sec. 11. miscellaneous technical amendments\n\n       The bill makes several technical changes to correct \n     omissions in the current statute. Moreover, it makes \n     additional technical amendments, in many cases as a result of \n     CFTC suggestions, that correct previous errors or \n     inconsistencies as to typography, proper citation and the \n     like.\n\n\nsec. 12. consideration of efficiency, competition, risk management, and \n                             antitrust laws\n\n       The bill requires the CFTC, in issuing rules, regulations \n     and some types of orders, to take into account the costs and \n     benefits of the action it contemplates. The requirement is \n     not for a quantitative cost-benefit analysis, but a mandate \n     to consider both costs and benefits, as well as other \n     enumerated factors. The authors of the bill believe that in \n     establishing its policies and giving direction to market \n     participants, the CFTC should weigh how its actions may \n     affect the participants' costs of doing business, as well as \n     what benefits may accrue from the action.\n       Some activities of the CFTC, of course, do not call for \n     this kind of approach, and indeed applying a cost-benefit \n     requirement to them would be inappropriate. Thus, the bill \n     exempts the CFTC's adjudicatory and investigative processes, \n     emergency actions and certain findings of fact that are \n     objective, quantitative or otherwise unsuitable for a cost-\n     benefit approach. The bill's eventual legislative history \n     will further discuss Congressional intent in enacting this \n     requirement.\n\n\n            sec. 13. disciplinary and enforcement activities\n\n       Enforcement is a priority for the CFTC. Like other \n     financial regulators, the CFTC is assisted in its enforcement \n     activities by the complementary rules, surveillance and \n     disciplinary actions of self-regulatory organizations (SROs). \n     These include both the futures exchanges themselves and the \n     National Futures Association. The bill provides guidance to \n     the CFTC on the deployment of enforcement resources, and \n     requires a report in one year on the overall enforcement \n     program. The legislation expresses the sense of Congress that \n     the CFTC should avoid unnecessary duplication of effort where \n     SROs have taken adequate action to deter abuse and ensure \n     customer protection. It further states that the CFTC's \n     oversight and disciplinary role should be sufficient to \n     safeguard market integrity and protect public confidence in \n     markets.\n\n\n           sec. 14. delegation of functions by the commission\n\n       The CFTC, under current law, has delegated some limited \n     duties to the National Futures Association. Today's austere \n     budget climate makes it prudent for the commission to assess \n     whether other functions could appropriately be delegated. The \n     bill calls on the CFTC to determine which, if any, additional \n     functions should be delegated to SROs, suggesting the use of \n     procedures like spot checks and random audits to ensure that \n     any delegated functions are adequately performed, and \n     requires a report in one year with the results of the review. \n     The authors intend that the bill's legislative history will \n     cite several current CFTC activities that could be considered \n     for delegation.\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Lugar \nand Senator Leahy in introducing legislation to amend the Commodity \nExchange Act. This bill updates and streamlines U.S. futures trading \nlaw, and provides needed clarification to several critical issues \nfacing today's vast derivative markets.\n  After reviewing the committee testimony taken last year, and meeting \ninformally with industry, regulators, and academics, Chairman Lugar, \nSenator Leahy, and I are convinced that these changes are appropriate \nand necessary if the United States is to maintain its dynamic, world-\nclass futures trading industry.\n  There is a strong public interest in maintaining a competitive and \nsound futures market in the United States. These markets are critical \nbecause they allow farmers, ranchers, and other businesses to manage \nrisk and maximize their investment opportunities. At the same time, the \ncommittee has an obligation to protect the public trust through \neffective enforcement and regulatory measures that prevent and punish \nfraud and other abuses that may, and have, occurred in the \ninternational financial markets--including the futures market.\n  This bill is a bipartisan effort to find the balance between the need \nfor prudent regulation with industry's need for changes so that the \nU.S. futures market continues to be the driving\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\nforce in today's competitive global financial markets.\n  Introduction of this legislation is timely. President Clinton's 1998 \nbudget, due for release later this week, challenges Federal agencies to \ndo more with less. It will ask Federal agencies to improve programs and \nservices and streamline procedures.\n  This legislation provides legislative backing to accomplish this \ncrucial goal. The bill proposes specific changes that will further \nassist the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary regulator \nof the futures industry, to continue its on-going effort to focus \nscarce resources where they are most effective--in enforcement--\npreventing consumer fraud and manipulation of market prices.\n  The legislation allows industry to focus on product innovation and \nmarketing so that the end users--farmers, ranchers, and other \nbusinesses--have available to them, free of fraud and at a competitive \nprice, the most state-of-the-art financial products.\n  The bill also provides the CFTC with additional authority to require \nU.S. delivery points for overseas futures markets to provide \ninformation similar to that currently demanded of American market \nparticipants. This provision may help prevent a repeat of last summer's \n1996 London/Tokyo copper market crisis where billions of dollars were \nlost due, in part, to lack of sufficient information and Government \noversight by the CFTC's foreign counterparts.\n  I am pleased that this legislation addresses the uncertainty that \ncurrently exists in the so-called ``Treasury amendment'', a 1974 \nprovision of the Commodity Exchange Act that excludes certain financial \nproducts from its regulatory coverage. This provision has long been \ncontroversial and our proposal suggests one solution.\n  It is unfortunate that the Treasury Department and the CFTC were \nunable to negotiate a resolution of this issue in time for this bill's \nreintroduction. But I remain open to alternative proposals, and look \nforward to hearing the views of all interested regulators, industry \nparticipants, and users of these products at next week's hearings.\n  Two other important aspects of this legislation are a provision that \nprovides greater legal certainty for the over-the-counter financial \ntools such as swaps and hybrids, and a provision that codifies a 1992 \nprovision to allow on-exchange products to be traded solely among \nprofessional investors. Both of these provisions are important to the \nability of private enterprises to manage business risk.\n  I am very pleased to join my colleagues in offering this bill. \nChairman Lugar, Senator Leahy, and I have worked together on futures \nissues for many years. We did the same on this bill--working to ensure \nthat these markets remain competitive while maintaining effective \nprovisions on customer protection and market integrity.\n  Introducing this bill early in the 105th Congress offers ample time \nto continue last year's public discussion and debate over what changes \nare appropriate and necessary to maintaining a viable U.S. futures \nmarket.\n  It is my experience that such a dialogue helps develop solid \nbipartisan legislation. As with most issues, there are many interests \nthat must be balanced, and this bill strives to find that balance. I am \ncertainly open to further input as we hold hearings next week.\n  I look forward to continuing the process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 258. A bill to improve price discovery in milk and dairy markets \nby reducing the effects of the National Cheese Exchange on the basic \nformula price established under milk marketing orders, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n            THE MILK PRICE DISCOVERY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I introduce the Milk Price \nDiscovery Improvement Act of 1997 with my senior Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Kohl]. Mr. President, this bill addresses longstanding farmer \nconcerns that milk prices can be manipulated by those with the \nincentive and ability to do so. Those concerns were validated by a \nMarch 1996 University of Wisconsin study funded by the Department of \nAgriculture which concluded that the National Cheese Exchange, a cash \nmarket for cheese located in Green Bay, WI, directly and indirectly \ninfluences farm milk prices and is highly vulnerable to price \nmanipulation by its major traders.\n  Concern about trader concentration and price manipulation is not \nexclusive to the dairy industry, Mr. President. Two weeks ago, the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, introduced the Cattle Industry \nImprovement Act which addressed concerns about growing concentration in \nthe livestock industry and the lack of market information available to \nlivestock producers. Less than 2 percent of the cattle in the U.S. are \nsold on markets with open and competitive bidding and the top four \npacking firms in this country slaughter 80 percent of all cattle.\n  The unfortunate trend of increasing concentration throughout \nagriculture and the growing scarcity of reliable market information has \nplaced farmers at an extreme disadvantage compared to powerful \ncorporate traders. Mr. President, I was pleased to cosponsor the Cattle \nIndustry Improvement Act, which seeks to prevent noncompetitive \npractices in the livestock industry and improve market information \nbecause I believe this trend must be stopped.\n  The bill I am introducing today addresses these same alarming trends \nin the dairy industry and seeks to prevent manipulation of farm-level \nmilk prices. Dairy farmers must not be held captive to a market that \ncannot be relied upon to provide accurate information about the value \nof the milk they produce. Unfortunately, farm milk prices are currently \ndetermined by such a market--the National Cheese Exchange.\n  The National Cheese Exchange is the only cash market in the United \nStates for the sale of bulk cheese. Located in Green Bay, WI, the \nExchange trades cheese each Friday for half an hour. Between 1988 and \n1993, only 1 percent of all bulk cheese sold nationally was traded on \nthe NCE. During this 5-year period, eight buyers and sellers dominated \nmuch of the exchange trading, despite exchange membership of 30 to 40 \ncompanies. The top seller on the exchange accounted for 75 percent of \nall sales during this period.\n  Thus, the exchange is not only thin with respect to the volume of \ncheese bought and sold, it is also thinly traded with the same small \nnumber of large firms dominating the trading activity. The opinion \nprice on the National Cheese Exchange, and other markets with these \ncharacteristics, is easily influenced by one trade. In addition, unlike \nother cash markets which trade more frequently, when the price changes \nat the National Cheese Exchange it stays at that level until one week \nlater at the next trading session. This infrequency of trading lends \ngreater significance to any trading activity which alters the price of \ncheese.\n  The existence of such a market on its own would not be a problem if \nit did not affect dairy farmers and others off the exchange. \nUnfortunately, the opinion price of the National Cheese Exchange \ndirectly and decisively affects the price that farmers throughout the \nNation receive for their milk. A 1-cent change in the opinion price at \nthe exchange generally translates into a 10-cent change in the price of \nmilk to farmers. When prices on the exchange drop suddenly and \nprecipitously, dairy farmers nationally lose millions of dollars in \nproducer receipts. In the last 3 months of 1996, cheese prices on the \nNational Cheese Exchange fell by more than 50 cents per pound, with an \nunprecedented price plunge of 21 cents in one trading session. As a \nresult, as many of my colleagues are aware, milk prices fell by more \nthan $4 per hundredweight--a 26-percent decline in income. In Wisconsin \nalone, this price decline has cost dairy farmers more than $165 million \nin lost income.\n  The price decline has been extremely painful for dairy farmers still \nstruggling with high feed bills but what has made the pain more \ndifficult to bear is the general belief held by many dairy economists \nthat the price fell too far too fast and could not be justified based \non prevailing market conditions. Whether the price declined so \ndrastically simply because the National Cheese Exchange is a poor \nindicator of market conditions or because traders intentionally drove \nthe price down is irrelevant. The perception of farmers that the \nexchange price was manipulated warrants its retirement as the mover of \nmilk prices in this country.\n\n[[Page S959]]\n\n The reality that the exchange clearly overreacted to market conditions \nwith record-setting price declines necessitates it.\n  The National Cheese Exchange has such a dramatic effect on milk \nprices for two reasons. First, milk prices are tied directly to the \nexchange opinion price through the basic formula price [BFP], \ncalculated by USDA. The BFP determines the class III price for milk \nregulated under the Federal milk marketing order system. Second, even \nif the formal linkage did not exist, milk prices would still be \ndramatically affected by the exchange opinion because it is used as the \nbenchmark in virtually all forward contracts for bulk cheese; 90 to 95 \npercent of bulk cheese in the United States is sold through forward \ncontracts. In other words, virtually all cheese sold in the country is \npriced based on the opinion price at the Cheese Exchange. That is, at \nleast in part, due to the lack of any alternative market information on \nthe value of cheese.\n  The combination of thin nature of the National Cheese Exchange and \nits influence on milk prices nationally, creates a situation in which \nthere is both the opportunity and the incentive for price manipulation. \nAnyone buying or selling cheese on the National Cheese Exchange may be \nable to affect the price of milk throughout the country. The extensive \nreport issued by the University of Wisconsin last year concluded that \nthe trading patterns on the NCE suggest that lead traders use the NCE \nto influence exchange prices with the intent of affecting milk and \ncheese prices nationwide.\n  Unfortunately, no viable alternative to the National Cheese Exchange \ncurrently exists for cheese price discovery. While there is a futures \nmarket for cheese and other dairy products, trading of futures \ncontracts have been weak making the futures prices unreliable \nbenchmarks. Furthermore, there is little or no market information on \nprices for off-exchange spot transactions of cheese collected by the \nDepartment of Agriculture. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman \nrecently announced a new cheese price series that should improve market \ninformation for off-exchange transactions. However, such information \nmay not be adequate to supplant the role of the National Cheese \nExchange. Of even greater concern is that despite its influence over \nmilk prices nationwide and its vulnerability to manipulation, the \nexchange is not regulated by any State or Federal entity.\n\n  Mr. President, farmers throughout the country are frustrated by a \npricing system that can no longer guarantee that milk prices are \ndetermined competitively and without manipulation and that they believe \nled to the severe and unwarranted price decline last fall. They have \nrightfully demanded that we change the way milk prices are set by U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to reduce the influence of the exchange on \nfarm-level prices. In addition, farmers have called for increased \nregulation of the exchange to prohibit manipulation of milk and cheese \nprices.\n  Mr. President, that is my goal in introducing this legislation today. \nFarmers must not be held hostage to this market any longer. First, my \nlegislation directs USDA to break the direct link between the basic \nformula price and the National Cheese Exchange. Second, it requires \nUSDA to develop alternative sources of cheese market information so \nthat buyers and sellers of cheese need no longer rely on the exchange \nas a reference price for forward contracts. Finally, my legislation \nwill provide USDA with clear authority to prohibit noncompetitive \npractices on any cash market that affects the price of milk regulated \nunder Federal milk marketing orders, including the National Cheese \nExchange. By law, USDA has been charged with ensuring orderly \nconditions for the marketing of milk. The agency cannot meet that \ncharge without greater authority to oversee the National Cheese \nExchange and prevent those who benefit from low milk prices from \ndriving them down. Ultimately, the solution to these problems lies in \nthe creation of a reliable price discovery system for milk and dairy \nproducts that the dairy industry can rely on. But it will take time to \ndevelop those alternatives, and it will take time for the dairy \nindustry to come to rely on them. Until we reach that goal, it is \nabsolutely critical that USDA prohibit noncompetitive activities on the \nNational Cheese Exchange.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of the National \nCheese Exchange Oversight and Improvement Act introduced by my senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. This bill provides the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission [CFTC] with day-to-day regulatory \njurisdiction over the activities of the National Cheese Exchange. While \nthe CFTC has some limited jurisdiction over the exchange, they do not \nhave the authority to impose trading rules on the exchange. The new \nauthority provided in our respective bills for USDA and CFTC to oversee \nthe exchange should ensure farmers that until the functions of the \nexchange can be replaced by alternative price discovery mechanisms, we \nwill do all we can to prevent manipulation of farm milk prices.\n  Mr. President, I believe the combination of the provisions of the \nMilk Price Discovery Improvement Act and the National Cheese Exchange \nOversight and Improvement Act will go far toward resolving some of the \nproblems that have led to the recent milk price plunge that has cost \nthis country's family farmers so dearly. This legislation, if passed, \nmay also help restore the confidence of dairy farmers in our milk \npricing system.\n  Mr. President, there are varied and complicated reasons that the \ntrend in American agriculture is toward fewer and larger farms and \ntoward greater concentration in processing and manufacturing. However, \nI believe that Federal policies that provide competitive advantages to \nlarger farms and subtly discriminate against smaller farmers are among \nthem. Sanctioning pricing mechanisms, like the National Cheese \nExchange, that provide unequal market power and information, and \nrelying on them to set prices, is one such policy. Small dairy farmers \nare less able to withstand the lost income resulting from volatile \nprices caused by the National Cheese Exchange. Small cheese processors \nand manufacturers that dot Wisconsin's countryside also suffer from \nprice volatility and manipulation on the exchange yet lack the ability \nto counteract the power of other traders. We can restore a degree of \nmarket equality by improving price discovery and by preventing those \nwith the power to manipulate prices from doing so. That is the goal of \nthe Milk Price Discovery Act of 1997. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of my \nlegislation as well as the full text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Cheese Exchange, located in Green Bay, \n     Wisconsin, is the only cash market for bulk cheese in the \n     United States, trades less than 1 percent of all bulk cheese \n     sold nationally, and currently functions as the only price \n     discovery mechanism for bulk cheese throughout the industry;\n       (2) the National Cheese Exchange opinion price directly \n     influences milk prices paid to farmers because of its use in \n     the Department of Agriculture's basic formula price under \n     Federal milk marketing orders;\n       (3) opinion prices at the National Cheese Exchange \n     influence the price for much of the bulk cheese bought and \n     sold in the United States and directly or indirectly \n     influences the price of milk paid to producers throughout the \n     United States;\n       (4) the National Cheese Exchange is a thinly traded, \n     illiquid, and highly concentrated market that is increasingly \n     volatile;\n       (5) a report issued by the University of Wisconsin and \n     funded by the United States Department of Agriculture \n     concluded that the National Cheese Exchange is vulnerable to \n     price manipulation;\n       (6) the thin nature of the National Cheese Exchange and the \n     characteristics of that market that may facilitate price \n     manipulation have led to widespread producer concern about \n     the validity of prices at the National Cheese Exchange; and\n       (7) it is in the national interest to ensure that prices on \n     cash markets that directly and indirectly affect milk prices \n     are determined in the most competitive manner practicable and \n     to improve price discovery for milk and other dairy products.\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nadjust the maximum hour exemption for agricultural employees, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n the fair labor standards act water delivery organizations flexibility \n                         amendment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today, \nwhich this body previously approved as an amendment to the first bill \namending the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] that the Senate passed in \n1989. This bill would solve a problem with the interpretation of a \nprovision of the FLSA, clarifying that the maximum hour exemption for \nagricultural employees applies to water delivery organizations that \nsupply 75 percent or more of their water for agricultural purposes.\n  Representative Mike Crapo, of the Second District of Idaho, is today \nintroducing an identical bill in the other body. Our bill would restore \nan exemption that was always intended by Congress.\n  Companies that delivery water for agricultural purposes are exempt \nfrom the maximum-hour requirements of the FLSA. The Department of Labor \nhas interpreted this to mean that no amount of this water, however \nminimal, can be used for other purposes. Therefore, if even a small \nportion of the water delivered winds up being used for road watering, \nlawn and garden irrigation, livestock consumption, or construction, for \nexample, delivery organizations are assessed severe penalties.\n  The exemption for overtime pay requirements was placed in the FLSA to \nprotect the economies of rural areas. Irrigation has never been, and \ncannot be, a 40-hour-per-week undertaking. During the summer, water \nmust be managed and delivered continually. Later in the year, following \nthe harvest, the work load is light, consisting mainly of maintenance \nduties.\n  Our bill is better for employers, workers, and farmers. Winter \ncompensation and time off traditionally have been the method of \ncompensating for longer summer hours. Without this exemption, \nirrigators are forced to lay off their employees in the winter. \nTherefore, our bill would benefit employees, who would continue to earn \na year-round income. It also would keep costs level, which would \nbenefit suppliers and consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\n                                 S. 259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect to \npenalties for crimes involving cocaine, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  Powder Cocaine Penalties Legislation\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that would \nincrease penalties for distribution of powder cocaine. It would do this \nby applying existing mandatory minimum sentences of 5 and 10 years for \nthis crime to a larger class of powder cocaine dealers.\n  Specifically, under current law, a dealer has to distribute 500 grams \nof powder to qualify for the 5-year minimum, and 5,000 grams to qualify \nfor the 10-year minimum. My bill would lower the trigger quantities to \n100 grams and 1,000 grams, respectively.\n  As many of you will recall, last Congress, the Sentencing Commission \nproposed a dramatic lowering of penalties for distribution of crack. \nThat proposal would have taken effect automatically had Congress not \nstepped in to prevent it from doing so it by adopting legislation I \nintroduced to block it.\n  The principal argument the Commission advanced for its proposal was \nthat current law's sharp differentiation between sentences for crack \ncocaine and powder cocaine distribution is wrong. Therefore, the \nCommission argued, we should equalize these penalties by lowering \npenalties for crack cocaine.\n  As is clear from the fact that I sponsored legislation to prevent its \nrecommendation from taking effect, I did not agree with the \nCommission's view that crack and powder penalties should be equalized. \nI also did not think that dramatically lowering crack penalties was a \ngood idea for anyone--least of all for inner-city residents where crack \nis most freely available and where parents need the most help in \nprotecting their kids from those peddling this poisonous drug.\n  At the same time, it also seemed to me that the Commission's report \nmade some valid criticisms of the current disparity in the sentences. \nIt just seemed to me that it drew the wrong conclusion from its \ncriticisms, and that the answer to the problems it identified was not \nto lower crack sentences but to raise powder sentences.\n  That is why, at the same time I introduced my legislation to prevent \nthe Commission's proposal from taking effect last Congress, I also \nintroduced the same bill I am introducing today: to raise the sentences \nfor those who deal powder cocaine, and thereby bring the quantity ratio \ndown from 100-1 to 20-1.\n  I believe this proposal recognizes two realities: that crack is more \ndangerous and more addictive than powder, but that powder is very \ndangerous and a critical contributor to our very serious crack problem.\n  First, as both the Commission's own study of the matter and a recent \nmedical study indicate, crack is a more dangerous and addictive form of \ncocaine than powder. Moreover because of its relative cheapness and \nease of use, it is more attractive to first-time users, and especially \nchildren.\n  It is also common sense that with crack use finally stabilizing, we \nshould not jeopardize what success we have had in combating it by \ndramatically lowering the penalties for selling it. That would surely \ninvite new entrants into the crack market, and thereby lead to an \nincrease in drug use and trigger a resurgence of violence among \ncompeting crack dealers.\n  On the other hand, as the Commission's report also pointed out, \npresent law has resulted, at least occasionally, in insufficiently \nsevere punishment of individuals at the top of crack distribution \nchains. These dealers distribute their product in powder rather than in \ncrack form. And at least a few of them have received considerably less \nthan the mandatory 5-year penalty. At the same time lower level dealers \nwho worked for them and sold the final product, crack, were receiving \nat least 5-year sentences. This overly lenient treatment of the powder \nkingpins does not seem right.\n  Second and more generally, when the mandatory sentences for powder \nwere originally set, they were set without knowledge of the extent of \nour crack problem and the contribution that powder cocaine makes to it. \nAn increase therefore is warranted for that reason as well.\n  Finally, while I believe some differential in the quantities that \ntrigger the same sentence for crack and powder is warranted, 100 to 1 \nseems too great. It is also unique in our drug laws' treatment of \nderivative versus source drugs, and that uniqueness is part of what has \nmade it racially divisive.\n  My proposed legislation addresses all three of these points. Its \nlower threshold for powder mandatories would make it much less likely \nthat a powder kingpin at the top of a crack-dealing chain would escape \nwith a lower punishment than those further down in the chain.\n  By raising the sentences for powder significantly, the bill also \ntakes into account the contribution that powder cocaine dealing \ngenerally makes to the crack market.\n  Finally, the change in the powder triggers makes the ratio of powder \nto crack necessary to trigger the same sentences 20 to 1 rather than \n100 to 1. This would bring it in line with other similar differentials \nbetween source and derivative drugs, such as opium and heroin, which \nlikewise have a 20 to 1 quantity ratio.\n  Mr. President, last Congress we withheld action on this question \nbeyond blocking the Sentencing Commission's proposal because we were \ntold that the Commission ought to be given another chance to devise a \nsolution. I believe, however, that this Congress must act on this \nmatter--whether with the help of the Commission or on its own. By \nintroducing this legislation at this time, I want to make clear that I \nintend to see to it that we do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Ford, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thompson, \n        Mr. Thomas, Mr. Roth, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Nickles, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Frist, Mr. Grams, Mr. Lugar, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Breaux Mr. DeWine, Mr. Burns, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Coats, Mr. Mack, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. D'Amato and \n        Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 261. A bill to provide for biennial budget process and a biennial \nappropriations process and to enhance oversight and the performance of \nthe Federal Government; to the Committee on the Budget and the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of \nAugust 4, 1977, with instructions that if one committee reports, the \nother committee have 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n             THE BIENNIAL BUDGETING AND APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Ford and 23 other \nSenators, I rise to introduce the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations \nAct, a bill to convert the budget and appropriations process to a 2-\nyear cycle and to enhance oversight of Federal programs.\n  One of the greatest challenges facing the 105th Congress and \nPresident Clinton is to balance the Federal budget by 2002 and maintain \nbalance through the next century when we will need to confront the very \nserious fiscal problems associated with an aging America. Balancing the \nFederal budget will require long-term planning, tough choices, and \nsteadfast effort. These decisions should not be made, indeed I contend \ncannot be made, using the current fractionated annual budget process.\n  Congress should now act to streamline the system by moving to a 2-\nyear, or biennial, budget process. This is the most important reform we \ncan enact to streamline the budget process, to make the Congress a more \ndeliberative and effective institution, and to make us more accountable \nto the American people.\n  Mr. President, moving to a biennial budget and appropriations process \nenjoys very broad support. President Clinton has proposed this reform. \nPresidents Reagan and Bush also proposed a biennial appropriations and \nbudget cycle. Leon Panetta, who has\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\nserved as White House Chief of Staff, OMB Director, and House Budget \nCommittee chairman, has advocated a biennial budget since the late \n1970's. Former OMB and CBO Director Alice Rivlin has been arguing for a \nbiennial budget for almost two decades. Other supporters include \nSenators Lott, Ford, Roth, Thompson, and Glenn. Last year, 42 Senators \nwrote our two Senate leaders calling for quick action to pass \nlegislation to convert the budget and appropriations process to a 2-\nyear cycle.\n  The most recent comprehensive studies of the Federal Government and \nthe Congress have recommended this reform. The Vice President's \nNational Performance Review and the Joint Committee on the \nReorganization of Congress both recommended a biennial appropriations \nand budget cycle.\n  A biennial budget will dramatically improve the current budget \nprocess. The current annual budget process is redundant, inefficient, \nand destined for failure each year. The current process to develop, \nlegislate, and implement the annual budget consumes 3 years: 1 year for \nthe administration to prepare the President's budget, another year for \nthe Congress to put the budget into law, and the final year to actually \nexecute the budget.\n  Today, I want to focus just on the congressional budget process, the \nprocess of annually passing a budget resolution, authorization \nlegislation, and 13 appropriation bills. The record clearly \ndemonstrates the serious shortcomings of this process:\n  We have met the statutory deadline to complete a budget resolution \nonly 3 times since 1974. In 1995, we broke the Senate record for the \nmost rollcall votes cast in a day on a budget reconciliation bill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office just released its report on \nunauthorized appropriations. For fiscal year 1997, 121 laws authorizing \nappropriations have expired. These laws cover over one-third, or $89.6 \nbillion, of appropriations for nondefense programs. Another 52 laws \nauthorizing non-defense appropriations will expire at the end of fiscal \nyear 1997, representing $31 billion more in unauthorized nondefense \nprograms.\n  Since 1950 Congress has only twice met the fiscal year deadline for \ncompletion of all 13 individual appropriations bills to fully fund the \nGovernment.\n  While we have made a number of improvements in the budget process, \nthe current annual process is redundant and inefficient. The Senate has \nthe same debate, amendments, and votes on the same issue three or four \ntimes a year--once on the budget resolution, again on the authorization \nbill, and finally on the appropriations bill.\n  I recently asked the Congressional Research Service [CRS] to update \nand expand upon an analysis of the amount of time we spend on the \nbudget. CRS looked at all votes on appropriations, revenue, \nreconciliation, and debt limit measures as well as budget resolutions. \nCRS then examined any other vote dealing with budgetary levels, Budget \nAct waivers, or votes pertaining to the budget process. For 1996, CRS \nfound that the Senate devoted 73 percent of its time to the budget.\n  If we cannot adequately focus on our duties because we are constantly \ndebating the budget in the authorization, budget, and appropriations \nprocess, just imagine how confused the American public is about what we \nare doing. The result is that the public does not understand what we \nare doing and it breeds cynicism about our Government.\n  Under the legislation I am introducing today, the President would \nsubmit a 2-year budget and Congress would consider a 2-year budget \nresolution and 13 2-year appropriation bills during the first session \nof a Congress. The second session of the Congress would be devoted to \nconsideration of authorization bills and for oversight of Government \nagencies.\n  Most of the arguments against a biennial budget process will come \nfrom those who claim we cannot predict or plan on a 2 year basis. For \ntwo-thirds of the budget, we do not actually budget on an annual basis. \nOur entitlement and revenue laws are under permanent law and Congress \ndoes not change these laws on an annual basis. The only component of \nthe budget that is set in law annually are the appropriated, or \ndiscretionary accounts.\n  Mr. President, the most predictable category of the budget are these \nappropriated, or discretionary, accounts of the Federal Government. I \nrecently asked CBO to update an analysis of discretionary spending to \ndetermine those programs that had unpredictable or volatile funding \nneeds. CBO found that only 4 percent of total discretionary funding \nfell into this category. Most of this spending is associated with \ninternational activities or emergencies. Because most of this funding \ncannot be predicted on an annual basis, a biennial budget is no more \ndeficient than the current annual process. My bill will continue to \nallow supplemental appropriations necessary to meet these emergency and \nunanticipated requirements.\n\n  This legislation also will enhance oversight of Federal programs and \nactivities. Frankly, the limited oversight we are now doing is not as \ngood as it should be. We have a total of 34 House and Senate standing \nauthorizing committees and these committees are increasingly crowded \nout of the legislative process. Under a biennial budget, the second \nyear of the biennium will be devoted to examining Federal programs and \ndeveloping authorization legislation. The calendar will be free of the \nbudget and appropriations process, giving these committees the time and \nopportunity to fully review and legislate changes to Federal programs.\n  We also build on the oversight process by incorporating the new \nrequirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n[GPRA] into the biennial budget process. The primary objective of this \nlaw is to force the Federal Government to produce budgets focused on \noutcomes, not just dollars spent. When the goal is to balance the \nbudget, decisions must be made based on performance.\n  More specifically, GPRA requires agencies to develop strategic plans, \nperformance plans, and performance goals. GPRA requires agencies to \nreport on their actual performance in relation to these goals. Finally, \nGPRA requires the President to incorporate these performance plans into \nthe President's budget submission to Congress.\n  At the beginning of each even-numbered year, this new biennial bill \nrequires Federal agencies to submit their preliminary performance plans \nand any proposed legislation that will enhance the performance of \nFederal programs to authorizing committees. During these even-numbered \nyears, the authorizing committees will review these performance plans \nand actual performance and develop authorization legislation geared to \nenhancing the performance of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, a biennial budget is not a panacea for all our budget \nwoes. A biennial budget cannot make the difficult decisions that must \nbe made in budgeting, but it can provide the tools necessary to make \nmuch better decisions. By moving to a biennial budget cycle, we can \nbudget more effectively, strengthen oversight and watchdog functions, \nimprove the efficiency of Government agencies, and work to balance the \nbudget in an intelligent, fair, and deliberative manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post \narticle, a description of the bill, and a section-by-section analysis \nof the bill be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Description of the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act\n\n       Cosponsors (24): Senators Ford, Snowe, Thompson, Thomas, \n     Roth, Moynihan, Nickles, McCain, Conrad, Abraham, Frist, \n     Grams, Lugar, Collins, Breaux, DeWine, Burns, Warner, \n     Roberts, Coats, Mack, Kempthorne, D'Amato, and Enzi.\n       The Domenici bill would convert the annual budget, \n     appropriations, and authorization process to a biennial, or \n     two-year, cycle.\n\n\n                 First Year: Budget and Appropriations\n\n       Requires the President to submit a two-year budget at the \n     beginning of the first session of a Congress. The President's \n     budget would cover each year in the biennium and planning \n     levels for the four out-years. Converts the ``Mid-session \n     Review'' into a ``Mid-biennium review''. The President would \n     submit his ``mid-biennium review'' at the beginning of the \n     second year.\n       Requires Congress to adopt a two-year budget resolution and \n     a reconciliation bill (if necessary). Instead of enforcing \n     the first fiscal year and the sum of the five years set out \n     in the budget resolution, the bill provides that the budget \n     resolution establish binding levels for each year in the \n     biennium and the sum of the six-year period. The bill \n     modifies the time frames in the Senate ten-year pay-as-you-go \n     point of order to provide that legislation could not increase \n     the deficit for the\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\n     biennium, the sum of the first six years, and the sum of the \n     last 4 years.\n       Requires Congress to enact a two-year appropriations bill \n     during the first session of Congress. The Domenici bill \n     provides two fail-safe measures if there were an attempt to \n     continue to appropriate funding on an annual basis. First, \n     the Domenici bill provides a new majority point of order \n     against appropriations bills that fail to cover two years. \n     Second, if an appropriations bill were enacted that failed to \n     appropriate money for the second year of the biennium, \n     funding would be automatically appropriated at the first \n     year's level. These fail-safe measures would not apply to \n     supplemental appropriations bills to fund unanticipated needs \n     such as emergencies.\n       Makes budgeting and appropriating the priority for the \n     first session of a Congress. The bill provides a majority \n     point of order against consideration of authorization and \n     revenue legislation until the completion of the biennial \n     budget resolution, reconciliation legislation (if necessary) \n     and the thirteen biennial appropriations bills. An exception \n     is made for certain ``must-do'' measures.\n\n\n     Second Year: Authorization Legislation and Enhanced Oversight\n\n       Devotes the second session of a Congress to consideration \n     of biennial authorization bills and oversight of federal \n     programs. The bill provides a majority point of order against \n     authorization and revenue legislation that cover less than \n     two years except those measures limited to temporary programs \n     or activities lasting less than two years.\n       Requires the General Accounting Office (GAO) to give \n     priority to requests for audits and evaluations of programs \n     and activities during the second year of the biennium.\n       Modifies the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n     (GPRA) to incorporate the government performance planning and \n     reporting process into the two-year budget cycle to enhance \n     oversight of federal programs.\n       The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) \n     requires federal agencies to develop strategic plans, \n     performance plans, and performance reports. The law requires \n     agencies to establish performance goals and to report on \n     their actual performance in meeting these goals. GPRA \n     requires federal agencies to consult with congressional \n     committees as they develop their plans. Beginning this year, \n     GPRA will require all federal agencies to submit their \n     strategic plans to the Office of Management and Budget, along \n     with their budget submissions, by September 30 of each year. \n     Finally, GPRA requires the President to include a performance \n     plan for the entire government, beginning with the FY 1999 \n     budget.\n       The Domenici bill modifies GPRA to place it on a two-year \n     cycle along with the budget process. The bill also requires \n     the authorizing committees to review the strategic plans, \n     performance plans, and performance reports of federal \n     agencies and to submit their views, if any, on these GPRA \n     plans and reports as part of their views and estimates \n     submissions to the budget committees.\n       The Domenici bill requires agencies to submit a preliminary \n     performance plan and proposed authorization legislation to \n     the relevant authorizing committees by March 31 of even-\n     numbered years. In developing proposed authorization \n     legislation, the bill directs agencies to include in their \n     proposed legislation, changes that will enhance agencies' \n     ability to meet their strategic and performance goals.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1 states the title of the legislation--the \n     ``Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act''.\n       Section 2 amends section 300 of the Congressional Budget \n     and Impoundment Control Act to revise the timetable to \n     reflect a biennial budget process. In general, the revised \n     timetable is similar to the current timetable except that \n     most of the milestones only apply to the first session of a \n     Congress. The timetable is modified to extend the deadline \n     for completion of the budget resolution to May 15th and to \n     extend the deadline for completion of reconciliation \n     legislation to August 1st. The revised timetable contains two \n     milestones in the second session: a February 15th reporting \n     requirement for the CBO annual report on the budget and an \n     end of session deadline for completion of action on \n     authorization legislation. This section also amends the \n     timetable to provide a special schedule in years a new \n     President is elected. Generally, deadlines are extended by 6 \n     weeks to give a new President more time to prepare and submit \n     his budget.\n       Section 3 includes most of the other amendments made to the \n     Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act.\n       Section 3(a) amends section 2 of the Act to make a \n     conforming change to the statement of the purposes of the \n     Act. Section 3(b) adds a definition for ``biennium'' and \n     makes a conforming change to the definition of a budget \n     resolution.\n       Section 3(c) amends section 301 to require the Congress to \n     complete action on a biennial budget resolution by May 15th \n     of each odd-numbered year; to require the budget resolution \n     to cover the biennium, and each of the ensuing four years; to \n     make conforming changes regarding requirements for hearings \n     and reports on budgets; to make other conforming changes to \n     the section; and, to make conforming changes to the section \n     heading and the table of contents of the Act.\n       Section 3(d) amends section 302 of the Budget Act, \n     regarding committee allocations, to require the conference \n     report on a budget resolution to include an allocation of \n     budget authority and outlays to each committee for each year \n     in the biennium and the total of the biennium and the four \n     succeeding fiscal years. This subsection also makes \n     conforming changes to section 302(f).\n       Section 3(e) amends section 303 of the Budget Act, \n     regarding the point of order against spending and revenue \n     legislation affecting future fiscal years, to make a \n     conforming change to provide that such legislation cannot be \n     considered until the budget resolution for a biennium is \n     adopted. This subsection also drops an exception in the \n     Senate that exempts appropriations measures providing an \n     advance appropriation for the two fiscal years following \n     the budget year from this point of order.\n       Section 3(f) makes conforming changes to section 304 of the \n     Budget Act, regarding revisions of budget resolutions. \n     Maintains current law that allows Congress to revise the \n     budget resolution at any time.\n       Section 3(g) amends section 305 to make a conforming change \n     regarding a reference to the budget resolution.\n       Section 3(h) and (i) amend sections 307 and 309 to make \n     conforming changes regarding the deadlines for completion of \n     appropriations bills.\n       Section 3(j) amends section 310 to make conforming changes \n     regarding reconciliation.\n       Section 3(k) amends section 311 to provide that a point of \n     order will lie against any legislation that would cause the \n     total budget authority, outlay, Social Security outlay, or \n     Social Security revenue levels to be breached in either \n     fiscal year of the biennium or that would cause revenue, \n     Social Security revenue, or Social Security outlays levels to \n     breached for the sum of the biennium and the four outyears \n     covered by the resolution. Currently, the budget resolution \n     all budget authority and outlays are enforced for the first \n     year covered by the budget resolution and Social Security \n     outlay, Social Security revenue, and total revenues are \n     enforced for the five years covered by the budget resolution.\n       Section 3(l) amends section 401(b)(2) to make a conforming \n     change regarding the referral of certain entitlement \n     legislation to the Appropriations Committee.\n       Section 3(m) amends section 603 to make a conforming change \n     regarding automatic allocations to the House Appropriations \n     Committee if the budget resolution is not adopted by May \n     15th.\n       Section 4 amends the Senate pay-as-you-go point of order \n     that prohibits consideration of legislation that would \n     increase the deficit over a ten year period. The current \n     Senate pay-as-you-go point of order prohibits consideration \n     of legislation that would increase the deficit in the first \n     year, the sum of the first five years, or the sum of the last \n     five years. Section 4 modifies this point of order to \n     prohibit consideration of legislation that would increase the \n     deficit for the sum of the first two years (the biennium), \n     the sum of the first six years, or the sum of the last four \n     years.\n       Section 5 amends the relevant sections of Title 31 of the \n     U.S. Code regarding materials the President's budget \n     submission and related documents.\n       Section 5(a) amends section 1101 to add a definition of \n     ``biennium''.\n       Section 5(b) amends section 1105 to require the President \n     to submit the budget the first Monday of February for every \n     odd-numbered year (except the schedule in section 300(b) of \n     the Budget Act applies for years in which a new President is \n     elected). Section 5(b) also amends a number of requirements \n     in section 1105 to conform the President's budget to a \n     biennial budget. Among these changes, the President's budget \n     would have to propose levels for each fiscal year in the \n     biennium and projections for the four succeeding years.\n       Section 5(c) amends section 1105(b), regarding estimated \n     expenditures and proposed appropriations for the legislative \n     and judicial branches, to require the submittal of these \n     proposals to the President by October 16th of even-numbered \n     years.\n       Subsections (d) and (e) of section 5 make conforming \n     changes to section 1105 regarding the President's \n     recommendations if there is a proposed deficit or surplus and \n     capital investment analyses.\n       Section 5(f) amends section 1106 to change the requirements \n     regarding the President's ``Mid-session Review''. Current law \n     requires the President to submit the Mid-session Review \n     before July 16 of each year. Section 5(f) requires the \n     President to submit a ``Mid-biennium Review'' before February \n     15 of each even-numbered year. With this modification, the \n     President will submit his biennial budget at the beginning of \n     each odd-numbered year and provide updated information on the \n     budget at the beginning of each even-numbered year.\n       Section 5(g) amends section 1109 to make conforming changes \n     to require the President to submit current services estimates \n     for the upcoming biennium and to require the Joint Economic \n     Committee to submit an economic evaluation to the Budget \n     Committee as part of its views and estimates report. This \n     subsection also makes two technical corrections to require \n     the President to submit the current services information with \n     his budget\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\n     submission and to require the Joint Economic Committee to \n     submit its economic evaluation within 6 weeks of the \n     President's budget submission.\n       Section 5(h) makes amendments to provisions regarding year \n     ahead requests on authorization legislation to require the \n     President to submit requests for authorization legislation by \n     March 31st of even-numbered years.\n       Section 5(i) amends section 1119 to conform a requirement \n     regarding agency budget justifications and consulting \n     services information to the biennial budget submission.\n       Section 6 amends section 105 of Title I of the U.S. Code \n     regarding the form and style of appropriations Acts to \n     require that they cover two years.\n       Section 7 adds a new section 314 to the Budget Act that \n     establishes two new points of order in the Congress against \n     authorization legislation. The first point of order prohibits \n     consideration of authorization legislation that covers less \n     than 2 years except for temporary activities. The second \n     point order prohibits consideration of authorization or \n     revenue legislation until the Congress has completed action \n     on the biennial budget resolution, biennial appropriations \n     bills, and all reconciliation bills. These two points of \n     order do not apply to appropriations measures, reconciliation \n     bills, privileged matters, treaties, or nominations. This \n     point of order can be waived by a simple majority.\n       Section 8 amends section 717 of title 31 of the U.S. Code \n     to require the General Accounting Office to give priority \n     during the second session of a Congress to requests for \n     Federal program audits and evaluations.\n       Section 9 establishes a stopgap funding mechanism to \n     provide funding authority for the second year if Congress \n     enacts an appropriations bill that only funds one year. This \n     automatic funding authority does not apply to supplementals \n     or continuing resolutions.\n       Section 9(a) amends chapter 13 of title 31 to add a new \n     section 1311. Section 9(b) amends the table of contents of \n     chapter 13 of title 31 to add the new section 1311.\n       Section 1311(a)(1) provides that if Congress enacts a \n     regular appropriation bill in an odd-numbered year that fails \n     to provide funding for the second year of the biennium, the \n     second year is automatically funded at the first year's \n     level. Section 1311(a)(2) provides that in determining the \n     level of funding for the first year, the President must take \n     into account sequester reductions made pursuant to the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act and \n     cancellations made pursuant to the Line Item Veto Act. \n     Section 1311(a)(3) provides that the automatic funding \n     authority remains in effect only for the duration of the \n     second fiscal year.\n       Section 1311(b) makes the automatic appropriation in the \n     second year subject to the same terms and conditions Congress \n     established for the first year's appropriation.\n       Section 1311(c) provides that the funding authority shall \n     not apply to a project or activity if another law prohibits \n     funding for that activity.\n       Section 1311(d) defines ``regular appropriation bill'' as \n     any one of the thirteen regular appropriations bills.\n       Section 10 amends the Government and Performance and \n     Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) to incorporate GPRA into the \n     biennial budget cycle.\n       The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) \n     requires federal agencies to develop strategic plans, \n     performance plans, and performance reports. Strategic plans \n     set out the agencies' missions and general goals. Performance \n     plans lay out the specific quantifiable goals and measures. \n     Performance reports compare actual performance with the goals \n     of past performance plans.\n       GPRA currently requires federal agencies to consult with \n     congressional committees as they develop their strategic \n     plans. Beginning this year, GPRA will require all federal \n     agencies to submit their strategic and performance plans to \n     the Office of Management and Budget, along with their budget \n     submissions, by September 30 of each year. Finally, GPRA \n     requires the President to include a performance plan for the \n     entire government, beginning with the FY 1999 budget.\n       Section 10(a) and (b) amend section 306 of title 5 and \n     section 115 of title 31 to require agencies to prepare \n     performance plans every two years, in conjunction with the \n     President's development of a biennial budget, and strategic \n     plans every four years (covering a six-year period). This \n     subsection also requires federal agencies to submit a \n     preliminary draft of the performance plans to the relevant \n     authorizing committees by March 31 of even-numbered years. \n     Subsection (b) also requires agencies to include an executive \n     summary of their 10 most important performance goals and to \n     consult with Congress in developing these priority goals. The \n     purpose of this change is to require agencies to highlight \n     the crucial goals for Congress.\n       Section 10(c) amends section 1105(a)(30) of title 31 to \n     require the President's budget to include aggregate \n     performance report for the executive branch starting with the \n     FY 2002-03 budget. Currently, OMB must submit an aggregate \n     performance plan (known as the Federal Government performance \n     plan) with the President's budget, but GPRA does not require \n     them to prepare a performance report, indicating how they \n     measured up to their goals.\n       Section 10(d) amends section 1116 of title 31 to make two \n     changes. First, this subsection requires agencies to report \n     to Congress on statutory barriers that limit their ability to \n     meet their mission statement and to propose legislative \n     recommendations to modify or eliminate such barriers. Second, \n     this subsection adds subsections (g) and (h) to section 1116. \n     Subsection (g) would require agencies to include an executive \n     summary in their performance report describing actual results \n     in relation to their 10 most important performance goals. \n     Subsection (h) requires OMB's overall performance report to \n     compare actual results with the goals established in previous \n     federal government performance plans.\n       Section 10(e) amends section 301(d) of the Budget Act to \n     require Congressional committees to review the strategic \n     plans, performance plans, and performance reports of agencies \n     in their jurisdiction. Committees may then provide their \n     views on the plans or reports to the Budget Committee, if \n     they so choose, as part of their views and estimates report.\n       Section 10(f) provides that the amendments shall take \n     effect on March 31, 1998.\n       Section 11 amends the Budget Act to add a new section 315 \n     that provides a majority point of order against consideration \n     in any odd-numbered year of a regular appropriations bill \n     that fails to fund both years of the biennium. This point of \n     order does not apply to supplementals or continuing \n     resolutions.\n       Section 12 requires OMB to conduct a study within 6 months \n     of enactment of the feasibility of converting the fiscal year \n     to a two year period.\n       Section 13 provides an effective date for the Act and a \n     transition period. Subsection (a) generally provides that the \n     Act takes effect on January 1, 1998. Section 13(b) provides a \n     transition year to the biennial cycle by requiring the \n     authorizing committees to start consideration of two-year \n     authorization legislation in 1997. The result is that the \n     authorizing committees will act on legislation for the fiscal \n     year 2000-2001 biennium in calendar year 1997. The budget and \n     appropriations committees will then follow by developing a \n     budget resolution and 13 appropriations bills for the fiscal \n     year 2000-2001 biennium in calendar year 1998.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 8, 1996]\n\n                       Make It a Two-Year Budget\n\n                         (By Pete V. Domenici)\n\n       Democrats and Republicans are pledging bipartisanship \n     cooperation in fashioning this year's federal budget. We \n     should begin by abandoning the outmoded and disorderly annual \n     budget and appropriation process and move to biennial \n     budgeting and appropriating to stabilize our budget \n     decisions. This is the most important reform we can adopt to \n     improve the process, provide for oversight and careful \n     deliberation, and make us accountable to the American people.\n       This is not a partisan issue. President Clinton, Senate \n     Republican Leader Trent Lott and Democratic Whip Wendell Ford \n     support biennial budgeting and appropriating. It also was \n     recommended in 1993 by the bipartisan Joint Committee on \n     Reorganization of Congress.\n       Under a biennial budget, the president would submit a two-\n     year budget and Congress would consider a two-year budget \n     resolution and 13 two-year appropriation bills during the \n     first session of a Congress. The second session would be \n     devoted to consideration of authorization bills and for \n     oversight of government agencies.\n       A biennial budget would dramatically improve the current \n     budget process. It would allow legislators to legislate \n     intelligently. It would provide for oversight of what has \n     been legislated, and it would cut down on the tremendous \n     annual effort that now is devoted to developing and \n     implementing the annual budget.\n       Consider that each year program managers interrupt their \n     work to develop detailed documents to propose and support \n     their budget. That budget must be reviewed by agency budget \n     officers and senior agency officials before it is presented \n     to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). After OMB's \n     review and the president's approval, the entire budget is \n     presented to Congress. The executive branch's preparation and \n     review of the budget takes a year.\n       After the budget is submitted to Congress; the agencies \n     have to track and respond to inquiries from Congress as it \n     considers the budget through the budget resolution, \n     authorizing legislation and, ultimately, through \n     appropriations legislation. The congressional budget consumes \n     another year.\n       To understand how much effort goes into preparation of the \n     annual budget, one need only look at one agency's budget \n     justification in the annual process. Let's take the civil \n     works program of the Army Corps of Engineers. The corps' \n     civil works budget amounts to roughly $3.7 billion, or 0.2 \n     percent of the total federal budget. Each year\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\n     the corps prepares and submits to the Appropriations \n     Committee an eight-volume budget justification amounting to \n     2,005 pages!\n       Moreover, our current budget process--in which Congress \n     tries to hold hearings, markups and floor action annually on \n     authorization, budget and appropriations legislation--makes \n     it extremely difficult for a member of Congress to fully meet \n     all his or her obligations, much less take the necessary time \n     to fully participate in each of these activities.\n       While an improvement over what went before, the current \n     budget process is redundant and inefficient. Yogi Berra once \n     observed that ``it's never over until it's over,'' but it \n     seems too often that the budget process is never over. The \n     Senate has the same debate and votes on the same issue three \n     or four times a year--once on the budget resolution, again on \n     the authorization bill and few amendments on the floor, and \n     again on the appropriations bill. In 1993 I found that the \n     Senate devotes roughly 40 percent of its time debating budget \n     resolutions, reconciliation and appropriations bills.\n       In addition to the time-consuming nature of the budget \n     process, Congress regularly misses its own deadlines and \n     guidelines, which generates cynicism about our work. In the \n     22-year history of the Budget Act, we have met the statutory \n     deadline to complete a budget resolution only three times. \n     Last year, we broke the Senate record for the most roll-call \n     votes cast in a day on a budget reconciliation bill.\n       Since 1950, Congress only twice has met the fiscal year \n     deadline for completion of all 13 individual appropriations \n     bills to fully fund the government. Congress usually governs \n     in the breach, rushing to complete action on omnibus \n     continuing resolutions in the best years or government \n     shutdowns in the worst.\n       A biennial budget, while not a panacea, could improve the \n     budget process dramatically. In 1987 I asked 50 agencies \n     about their views on the biennial budget. Thirty-seven \n     agencies supported a biennial budget. None opposed it. The \n     agencies generally responded that they could operate under a \n     biennial budget, and that it would save money for their \n     operations.\n       Based on a 1993 congressional study, only 4 percent of \n     discretionary funding--or $18.5 billion of the $541 billion \n     appropriated in FY 1993--required annual funding because of \n     unpredictable funding patterns.\n       If we have a two-year process, we can deal with another \n     concern--that Congress does not spend enough time reviewing \n     the operations of the federal government. Frankly, the \n     limited oversight we are doing now is not as good as it \n     should be.\n       Authorizing committees must increase their focus on their \n     oversight role. Implementing the Government Performance and \n     Results Act will begin to force the federal government to \n     produce budgets next year focused on outcomes, not just \n     dollars spent. When the goal is to balance the budget, \n     decisions must be made based on performance. With a biennial \n     budget, we would create an atmosphere that encourages and \n     rewards better oversight, because the entire second year of \n     any Congress would be devoted to authorizations and reviewing \n     program performance.\n       By moving to a two-year budget and appropriations cycle, \n     Congress can inject stability into a sometimes chaotic \n     system, strengthen congressional oversight and watchdog \n     functions, improve the efficiency of government agencies \n     and--finally, it is hoped--increase the public's confidence \n     that the achievement of balanced budget has been done \n     intelligently, deliberatively and fairly.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Biennial \nAppropriations and Budget Act--A bill introduced today by Senator \nDomenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee. I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this important legislation.\n  Under a biennial budget, the President would submit a 2-year budget \nin the first session of a Congress. The priority in the first session \nof the Congress would be completion of the biennial budget resolution \nand biennial appropriations bills. The second session would be reserved \nfor authorization legislation and enhanced oversight. The planning and \nperformance requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act \nof 1993 would be incorporated into the budgeting process as well.\n  I have long advocated changing our budget process in this manner. As \na matter of fact in 1993, I introduced similar legislation. Changing \nour budget process would give Congress more time to develop and \nimplement long-term budget plans. In addition, the 2-year cycle would \nallow more time for oversight and thorough evaluation of programs and \nspending.\n  Our current process is simply not working. Only three times in the \npast 20 years has Congress passed the budget resolution on time, and \nthis is only the first step in congressional action on the budget. Only \ntwice since 1950, has Congress met the fiscal year deadline for \ncompletion of all 13 individual appropriations bills. Most of the time \nCongress is rushing to pass appropriations bills, continuing \nresolutions, or omnibus spending bills at the last minute, trying to \navoid a Government shutdown. This is not how we should be managing the \npower of the purse.\n  This idea is not new. President Clinton's former Chief of Staff and \nOMB Director, Leon Panetta, introduced the first biennial budget bill \nin 1977 when he was a Congressman. Vice President Gore strongly \nendorsed this idea in his National Performance Review. In his book, \n``Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less,'' Gore \nstates, ``Biennial budgeting will not make our budget decisions easier, \nfor they are shaped by competing interests and priorities. But it will \neliminate an enormous amount of busy work that keeps us from evaluating \nprograms and meeting customer needs.''\n  Congress' failure to meet our prescribed deadlines, in current budget \nprocess, contributes to the American people's cynicism about politics. \nThe time has come to recognize that our current budget process is \nbroken and we must find a way to fix it. Biennial budgeting is an \nimportant first step toward fixing our current system by making our \nbudget process more efficient and streamlined. I hope that Congress \nwill act on this important legislation expeditiously.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is an honor to join the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, in introducing legislation to \ncreate a 2-year budget and appropriations process. Senator Domenici has \nworked long and hard on this issue and I am hopeful that we can finally \nenact this commonsense reform this year.\n  The current budget process is breaking down. Congress and the \nexecutive branch spend entirely too much time on budget issues. Since \nthe most recent budget process reform in 1974, Congress has \nconsistently failed to complete action on the Federal budget before the \nstart of the fiscal year and, as a result, has increasingly relied on \nomnibus spending measures to fund the Federal Government. In fact, \nsince 1977, Congress has passed over 60 continuing resolutions just to \nkeep the Federal Government open.\n  The budget resolution, reconciliation bill, and appropriations bills \ncontinue to become more time consuming. In the process, authorizing \ncommittees are being squeezed out of the schedule. There are too many \nvotes on the same issues and too much duplication. In the end, this \ntime could be better spent conducting vigorous oversight of Federal \nprograms which currently go unchecked, exacerbating the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  In response to these problems, last Congress I introduced legislation \nthat would create a biennial budget process. I am pleased to continue \nthis effort by joining Senator Domenici in offering this bill. It will \nrectify many of the problems regarding the current process by promoting \ntimely action on budget legislation. In addition, it will eliminate \nmuch of the redundancy in the current budget process. This legislation \ndoes not eliminate any of the current budget processes--each step \nserves an important role in congressional deliberations. However, by \nmaking decisions once every 2 years instead of annually, the burden \nshould be significantly reduced.\n  Perhaps most importantly, biennial budgeting will provide more time \nfor effective congressional oversight, which will help reduce the size \nand scope of the Federal Government. Congress simply needs more time to \nreview existing Federal programs in order to determine priorities in \nour drive to balance the budget.\n  Another benefit of a 2-year budget cycle is its effect on long-term \nplanning. A biennial budget will allow the executive branch and State \nand local governments, all of which depend on congressional \nappropriations, to do a better job making plans for long-term projects.\n  Two-year budgets are not a novel idea. Nor will biennial budgeting \ncure all of the Federal Government's ills. However, separating the \nbudget session from the oversight session works well across the country \nin our State legislatures. It is a solid first step toward restoring \nsome fiscal accountability in our Nation's Capital. I am hopeful this \nbill will be a catalyst for action on this commonsense, good Government \nreform.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\nthe Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act. I am a full-fledged \nsupporter of a 2-year budget cycle--an issue I have been championing \nsince 1981. I believe in its potential as strongly now as I did then. \nIt's an idea whose time has come.\n  There are several advantages to a 2-year budget cycle. Foremost, \nthere will be a savings of time and money. Congress currently debates \nspending priorities and funding decisions not only every year, but \nseveral times within 1 year. By limiting budget action to only one \nsession of each Congress, we eliminate repetitive votes on budget \npriorities and spending allocations. We also allow the executive branch \nand recipients of Federal aid, such as State and local governments, to \nbetter manage Federal dollars to get more cents out of the dollar.\n  Biennial budgeting allows for greater planning and more deliberate \nspending decisions. Too often, Congress has padded the budget \nresolution with spending for anticipated reforms and new initiatives \nonly to find that action is not completed on the authorization before \nthe new fiscal year begins. Unfortunately, those funds provided in the \nbudget cannot be deleted or reserved for the next fiscal year, but must \nbe spent on other programs.\n  A 2-year budget, with one session reserved specifically for oversight \nand authorizations, will give Congress the time to enact responsible \nspending proposals before the adoption of a budget resolution and \nappropriations bill. A 2-year budget cycle will give the executive \nbranch and State and local governments, 2 years to plan for the most \nefficient use of Federal dollars.\n  This legislation will give Congress the opportunity to review \nspending decisions, and allow the executive branch to conduct \ncompliance review. Too often we hear that once a Federal program is \ncreated, it will be funded into eternity. Congress simply needs more \ntime to review existing spending programs to determine whether they \nshould be modified, expanded, or replaced.\n  The Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act provides greater \nfunding certainty for State and local governments. Our elected \ncounterparts in the States must plan their budgets in large part around \nFederal spending decisions. As we know from last year's debate on the \nbudget, Congress all too often misses deadlines and does not complete \naction before the beginning of the fiscal year. State and local \ngovernments simply cannot put their budget deliberations on automatic \npilot while Congress completes its work and they cannot be expected to \nefficiently carry out Federal spending programs if they lack the \ncertainty that funds will be provided on time.\n  While a 2-year budget won't replace the tough decisionmaking \nnecessary for deficit reduction, it will make our work on the deficit \nand the Federal budget more efficient and more effective. When I was \nGovernor of Kentucky, 2-year budgeting helped us to lay out a master \nplan for the entire State. And that master plan enabled agencies, local \ngovernments, and constituency groups to do long-term planning--planning \nthat led to greater efficiency, overall cost savings, and equally \nimportant, peace of mind about future funding. We need this sort of \nplanning on the Federal level. Ask any constituent what some of their \ntop concerns are, and most, if not all, will talk about wasteful \nGovernment spending. If we truly want to address their concerns, I say \nthe 2-year budget is the way to go and I am pleased to join Senator \nDomenici and others in pushing it forward with renewed vigor this year.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici as \na cosponsor of this important legislation. I supported a similar \nmeasure in the 104th Congress and held a hearing last year in the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs. The issue has been debated over a \nnumber of years without success. However, the 105th Congress presents a \nnew opportunity. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I \npledge my support in moving this measure to the full Senate.\n  The bill being introduced today has the fundamental goal of moving \nboth the budget and appropriations process to a 2-year cycle--just once \nat the beginning of each Congress. In addition, it will link program \nresults obtained under the Government Performance and Results Act \n[GPRA] to the budget process. Congressional committees will be required \nto review the GPRA reports and provide views and comments in \nconjunction with their comments on the budget.\n  Biennial budgeting would provide more time for Congress to conduct \ngreater oversight and indepth evaluations of existing programs. We need \nto take more time to find out what is working and what is not. Congress \nshould not just rely on good intentions when it passes new measures. We \nmust ensure that the laws we write do provide the benefits and services \nas envisioned. The current budget process leaves us with far too little \ntime to devote to thoughtful and systematic oversight of Federal \nprograms, and far too little time to develop and consider long-term \npolicy initiatives.\n  Another important reason I support 2-year budgeting, in addition to \nenhanced oversight, I believe the bill would provide Members of \nCongress with more time to spend with the people they represent, \nreceiving their views and insights on Government programs, services, \nand pending legislation. Freedom from dealing with the budget on an \nannual basis has the ability to move us closer to a citizen legislature \nas envisioned by the Founding Fathers. We have no greater \nresponsibility than representing the people of our State. To do so, we \nneed to spend time at home.\n  On the issue biennial budgeting, once again the States are leading \nthe way, with more than 20 States currently using some form of it. I \nfirmly believe it is time for Washington to recognize the value in this \nand enact this bill promptly. I support the Biennial Appropriations and \nBudget Act of 1997, and encourage all my colleagues to do the same. It \nis an idea whose time has come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 262. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for \nthe prospective application of certain prohibitions relating to \nfirearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          firearms legislation\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that will make clear that from now on, if you are convicted \nof beating your wife, your husband, or your children, your actions will \nresult in you forfeiting your firearm privileges, no matter who you \nare.\n  The bill amends the Federal law that prohibits someone with a \nmisdemeanor conviction for domestic violence from possessing firearms \nor ammunition so that the law is applied prospectively only, from the \ndate of enactment. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We know \nthat all too often the only difference between a battered woman and a \ndead woman is a batterer with a gun. Many of you are familiar with \nfacts I have stood here and recited in the past: Four women a day are \nkilled at the hands of their batterer;\n  The California Department of Justice Law Enforcement reported in 1994 \nthat 68 percent of the murder victims known to have been killed by an \nintimate were killed by firearms, 68 percent;\n  The likelihood of a woman dying during a domestic assault is directly \nrelated to the type of weapon available. When a firearms is available, \nthe assault is three times more likely to end in death than an assault \nwith a knife. If no weapon is available the dispute is 23 times less \nlikely to end in death;\n  Fifty-seven percent of children under 12 who are murdered are killed \nby a parent.\n  These are statistics based only on what is reported. We know that \nthere are people watching who are victims of abuse in their own homes. \nIt is happening to women that you know in your work place, in your \nchurch or synagogue and your neighborhood.\n  Domestic violence is the most underreported crime in the country.\n  We will not tolerate the violence.\n  We will not ignore the violence.\n  We will not say that it is someone else's responsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE \n                   MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION FIREARMS PROHIBITION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Spouses, ex-spouses, and current and former boyfriends \n     commit over 1,000,000 violent crimes against women each year, \n     including assault, rape, and murder.\n       (2) Approximately 28 percent of all women murdered in the \n     United States each year are killed by current or former \n     husbands or boyfriends.\n       (3) Weapons are used in 30 percent of domestic violence \n     incidents.\n       (4) Domestic violence calls are one of the largest \n     categories of calls to police each year, and, in some \n     locations, up to one-third of all police time is spent \n     responding to domestic calls.\n       (5) Studies show that police are more likely to respond to \n     a reported incident within 5 minutes if the offender is a \n     stranger to the victim and that, police are more likely to \n     take a formal report with respect to an incident in which the \n     offender is a stranger to the victim.\n       (6) Studies show that only approximately 10 percent of \n     spouses who are abused ever call the police, in spite of the \n     fact that conjugal assaults account for 12 percent of all \n     assaults that result in serious injury, 16 percent of all \n     assaults requiring medical care, and 18 percent of assaults \n     that result in the loss of at least a full day of work.\n       (7) Data compilation suggests that injuries in all domestic \n     assaults are at least as severe as those suffered in 90 \n     percent of violent felonies, although the overwhelming number \n     of domestic violence injuries are considered to be only \n     misdemeanors in most States.\n       (8) In the 104th Congress, Congress amended the Federal law \n     that regulates the lawful transfer and possession of firearms \n     and ammunition to provide that an individual's conviction of \n     a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence will prohibit the \n     individual from possessing any firearm or ammunition and will \n     prohibit others from licensing or transferring a firearm or \n     ammunition to that person.\n       (9) The term ``misdemeanor crime of domestic violence'' is \n     defined in Federal law as a Federal or State misdemeanor \n     crime that ``has, as an element, the use or attempted use of \n     physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, \n     committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian \n     of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a \n     child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has \n     cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, \n     or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or \n     guardian of the victim''.\n       (10) For purposes of Federal law, to be considered \n     convicted to be of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, \n     a person must--\n       (A) have been represented by counsel or knowingly waived \n     representation; and\n       (B) have been tried by a jury or knowingly waived trial by \n     a guilty plea or otherwise if entitled to a jury trial for \n     the offense at issue.\n       (11) There are exceptions to the new Federal law that may \n     apply to an individual determined to have been convicted of a \n     misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, if ``the conviction \n     has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which \n     the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored \n     (if the law of the applicable provision provides for the loss \n     of civil rights under such an offense) unless the pardon, \n     expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly \n     provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or \n     receive firearms''.\n       (12) Congress clearly intended for this Federal law to \n     apply to peace officers. The general exception to the law for \n     firearms and ammunition that are issued for the use of ``the \n     United States or any department or agency thereof or any \n     State or any department, agency, or political subdivision \n     thereof,'' does not apply to individuals convicted of a \n     misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\n       (b) Unlawful Acts.--Subsections (d)(9), (g)(9), and \n     (s)(3)(B)(i) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code, \n     are each amended by inserting'', on or after September 30, \n     1996,'' before ``of a misdemeanor''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the amendments made by \n     the first section designated as section 658 of Public Law \n     104-208.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S949-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"},

Res. 47\n\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute is the lead Federal \n     agency for research on the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and \n     treatment of cancer;\n       Whereas health professionals and consumers throughout the \n     United States regard the guidelines of the National Cancer \n     Institute as reliable scientific and medical advice;\n       Whereas it has been proven that intervention through \n     routine screening for breast cancer through mammography can \n     save the lives of women at a time when medical science is \n     unable to prevent this disease;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute issued a guideline in \n     1989 recommending that women in their forties seek \n     mammograms, but rescinded this guideline in 1993;\n       Whereas in 1993, it was difficult to have the same degree \n     of scientific confidence about the benefit of mammography for \n     women between the ages of 40 and 49 as existed for women \n     between the ages of 50 and 69 due to inherent limitations in \n     the studies that were conducted as of that date;\n       Whereas at that time, the American Cancer Society and 21 \n     other national medical organizations and health and consumer \n     groups were at variance with the decision of the National \n     Cancer Institute to rescind the guidelines of the Institute \n     for mammography for women between the ages of 40 and 49;\n       Whereas the statement of scientific fact on breast cancer \n     screening issued by the National Cancer Institute on December \n     3, 1993, caused widespread confusion and concern among women \n     and physicians, eroded confidence in mammography, and \n     reinforced barriers and negative attitudes that keep women of \n     all ages from being screened;\n       Whereas in 1995, investigators found a 24 percent lower \n     death rate among women who received mammograms in their \n     forties when the world's population-based trials were \n     combined;\n       Whereas in 1996, Swedish researchers in 2 studies found a \n     44 and 36 percent lower death rate among women who received \n     mammograms in their forties;\n       Whereas a number of studies have shown that breast tumors \n     in women under the age of 50 may grow far more rapidly than \n     in older women, suggesting, that annual mammograms are of \n     value to women in this age group;\n       Whereas on January 23, 1997, a panel convened by the \n     National Institutes of Health reviewed these and other \n     compelling studies but decided not to recommend that the \n     National Cancer Institute reissue its earlier guidelines;\n       Whereas the Director of the National Cancer Institute and \n     other major national organizations, including the American \n     Cancer Society, expressed surprise and disappointment with \n     this decision;\n       Whereas the majority (approximately 80 percent) of women \n     who are diagnosed with breast cancer have no identifiable \n     risk for this disease;\n       Whereas breast cancer is the single leading cause of death \n     for women in their forties and fifties, and a leading cause \n     of death for women between the ages of 30 and 60; and\n       Whereas more women will be diagnosed with breast cancer \n     this year in their forties (over 33,000 women) than in their \n     fifties: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) adequately designed and conducted studies are needed to \n     further determine the benefits of screening women between the \n     ages of 40 and 49 through mammography and other emerging \n     technologies; and\n       (2)(A) the Senate strongly urges the Advisory Panel for the \n     National Cancer Institute to consider reissuing the guideline \n     rescinded in 1993 for mammography for women between the ages \n     of 40 and 49 when it convenes in February; or\n       (B) until there is more definitive data, direct the public \n     to consider guidelines issued by other organizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S970-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 48--RELATIVE TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF SENATE \n                       FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

The Secretary of the Senate shall communicate this \n     resolution to the House of Representatives, and shall \n     transmit an enrolled copy to the family of Representative \n     Frank Tejeda.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have a resolution that I am \nsubmitting on behalf of myself and Senator Gramm. I have sent it to the \ndesk and I ask that it be held and that it be cleared by the close of \nbusiness today.\n  Mr. President, the resolution is commending and is in honor of a \nfallen comrade. He was a Member of the House, a member of the Texas \ndelegation, Frank Tejeda.\n  Frank Tejeda was a hero, a patriot. He served his country in every \npossible way. Frank Tejeda dropped out of high school at the age of 17 \nto join the Marine Corps. He liked to tell the story that he thought he \nwould have a couple of months to sit around and dream about being in \nthe Marine Corps. And they said to this young 17-year-old, ``We would \nlove to have you. Here are your tickets to California, you leave this \nafternoon.'' So he was off on his life adventure in the Marine Corps.\n  Frank Tejeda went to Vietnam. He was a hero in Vietnam. Frank Tejeda \nwon not only the Purple Heart but the Silver Star for his heroic \nperformance in going onto a battlefield that was riddled with bullets \nflying all around him to save a comrade.\n  He was always there when his country called. After he came back, the \nhigh school dropout went to college and graduated. He graduated not \nonly from St. Mary's University, but also went to law school at the \nUniversity of California at Berkley and received his law degree. Then, \nhe got graduate degrees from both Harvard and Yale. He served in the \nTexas Senate--I knew him there--and then he came to Congress, and we \nwere able to serve together here.\n  Frank was, in every sense, the truest Texan. I was privileged to be \nat his funeral yesterday in south San Antonio, at St. Leo's Catholic \nChurch. You could see the essence of what Frank was. You could see it \nin the people that he had gone to church with all his life. You could \nsee it in the people who eulogized him, that had grown up with him, and \nwho now are also leading citizens of San Antonio. You could see it in \nthe people who were holding signs along the road between the church and \nFort Sam Houston, where he was to be buried with full military honors.\n  No one will be able to fill the shoes of a great Texan like Frank \nTejeda. He will have a successor. We will have someone that will \nrepresent San Antonio and Texas in the U.S. Congress. But you don't \nfill the shoes of a person who never forgot from where he came, who was \nalways there for the people that he grew up with and that he \nrepresented in the U.S. Congress, to make sure that they were part of \nthe great American dream.\n  He was there for our military, he was there for our veterans. I \nremember when I was working to make sure that the veterans' pay came \nwhen Government was shut down. Frank Tejeda was right there trying to \nhelp me make sure that that happened. When the people at Kelly Air \nForce Base learned that their base was going to be shut down, with \nprivatization as an option that was given by BRAC, Frank Tejeda and I \nrolled up our sleeves to go to work for privatization, because we \nwanted the good people at Kelly Air Force Base to be able to keep those \njobs, and because we knew it was in the best interest of our country \nthat they keep those jobs because they are the trained work force.\n  I think the most important thing I could say about anyone with whom I \nserved in Congress is, if we are in a fight, he was someone I would \nwant in the trenches with me.\n  That describes Frank Tejeda. He proved himself on the real \nbattlefield in Vietnam. He proved that he was someone you would want in \nthe trenches with you when you are fighting for your life, for your \ncountry, and he proved it in so many ways in his service in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  I will miss Frank Tejeda as a friend. America will miss him as a \npatriot and a hero. I would like for this resolution to be passed today \nwhen we close the Senate, and I would like to close the Senate in honor \nof former Congressman Frank Tejeda, who was buried yesterday at Fort \nSam Houston with full military honors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S970-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      committee on small business\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor Senate \nbill S. 1, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act. I do so because I am \nconvinced that we owe our children the opportunity to learn in a safe \nenvironment and that our children should not find the door to higher \neducation closed to them by high costs. This legislation will help \nchildren from low income families escape unsafe schools and at the same \ntime help parents and their children better afford higher education.\n  We have a crisis in our schools, Mr. President. According to one \nrecent study, 2,000 acts of violence are committed every hour in our \nclassrooms. The study also found that high percentages of students have \nchanged their daily routine because of personal safety concerns, and \nthat most students say they could obtain marijuana\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\nwithin a day if they wished. Drugs and violence have no place in our \nschools alongside math and history.\n  To address this problem, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act \nauthorizes $50 million for fiscal year 1998 school choice pilot \nprograms. These moneys may be used to develop, establish, and operate \nprograms to protect children who have been victims of, or witnesses to, \nviolence in our elementary and secondary schools. To encourage local \nsafety measures, the act gives priority to programs providing for \nsuspension, delay, or restriction of driving privileges for minors \nfound to be using drugs.\n  Mr. President, poor kids in this country should have the same right \nto attend a safe school as their more well-off counterparts. That is \nwhy school choice programs are essential. This bill provides funding \nfor pilot programs and also for broader school choice vouchers to give \nparents in our less affluent areas a chance to send their children to \ngood schools.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, too many kids who graduate from high \nschool find the doors to higher education closed to them by sky-high \ncosts. Public college and university tuition alone has risen 234 \npercent over the last 15 years. This has put too tight a squeeze on \nstudents and their parents as they seek the opportunities only higher \neducation can provide in our country.\n  To make higher education more affordable for students in college and \nfor parents saving for their children's education, this legislation \nprovides a number of rational, cost-effective tax incentives. To begin \nwith, Mr. President, this bill establishes the Bob Dole education \ninvestment account. Parents would be able to contribute $1,000 per year \nto this account, and would be eligible to establish an account for each \nchild. The savings will be significant. If a parent puts aside $1,000 \nat the time a child is born, and contributes $1,000 every year until \nthe child is 18, the investment account would contain $34,000 to pay \ncollege costs.\n  And this legislation offers further help to parents and students. It \nexcludes from taxation educational assistance provided by employers. It \nalso excludes any prepaid higher education disbursement from the State. \nIn addition, the bill would make student loan interest deductible, up \nto a maximum of $2,500 per year. Finally, the bill would exclude from \ngross income any moneys received through Federal work study programs.\n  These provisions will make higher education more affordable. They \nwill keep the doors of opportunity open for all Americans. Combined \nwith school choice measures, they will go a long way toward \nestablishing the equality of opportunity for which our country always \nhas been known.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S971-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF PROCTOR JONES\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate, with its long hours and \ndemanding schedule is not generally known for the long tenure of its \nMembers' staff. Proctor Jones is an exception to that rule. Proctor has \nserved the Senate for more than 35 years. He has spent 27 of those \nyears working for the Committee on Appropriations, outlasting seven \ncommittee chairmen. Nobody knows the ins and outs of the appropriations \nprocess, better than Proctor Jones.\n  The energy and water appropriations bill just won't be the same \nwithout Senator Johnston leading the Democratic members of the \nsubcommittee and Proctor behind the scenes crafting the bill. It is not \na coincidence that the energy and water appropriations bill is usually \none of the first to be passed by Congress. Proctor's experience on \nappropriations, combined with Senator Johnston's bargaining skill made \nthem a formidable pair. They will be sorely missed on the \nAppropriations Committee. I commend Proctor on his long and dedicated \nservice to the Senate and wish him the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S972-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO STEVE AND LORRAINE GOREN ON BEING NAMED 1997 DOVER CITIZENS \n                              OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Steve \nand Lorraine Goren, coowners of Farnham's clothing store in Dover, on \nbeing named the 1997 Citizens of the Year by the Greater Dover Chamber \nof Commerce. As a former small businessman myself, I commend their \naccomplishments.\n  Farnham's clothing store has been a Dover establishment since 1855. \nFor years, Steve and Lorraine have been involved in Dover's growth in a \nnumber of ways.\n  Steve Goren is a member of the Dover Parking Commission and a trustee \nat the Dover Children's Home. He is a former member of the Dover \nIndustrial Development Authority, a former director of Great Bay Bank \nShares, and was on the board of Southeast Bank. In addition, both \nGorens are active in the downtown merchants group.\n  Lorraine Goren has represented Temple Israel on the board of Dover \nCooperative Ministries for years, served as treasurer of the Wentworth-\nDouglass Hospital Auxiliary and rallied Dover merchants for support \nduring the American Cancer Society's annual daffodil sales. She has \nalso served the Dover Chamber of Commerce as a member of the Cochecho \nArts Festival committee and the Apple Harvest Day committee.\n  Both Steve and Lorraine have dedicated their time, talent and energy \nto serving the residents of Dover in an exemplary way. The Goren's \noutstanding community commitment is important to the future and \nprosperity of New Hampshire's communities. Congratulations to Steve and \nLorraine for this distinguished recognition. I am honored to represent \nthem in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S972-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S972-S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO BEATRICE RUTH FAIRFAX\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to \ntalk about Beatrice Ruth Fairfax, a constituent of mine who died on \nJanuary 14, 1997, at the age of 84, after a lifetime of making a \ndifference in the lives of those she touched. She will be sorely missed \nby her family, friends, and community.\n  Upon her graduation from Hyde Park High School, Beatrice Fairfax \nworked as a writer and became involved in many civil rights and labor \nunion causes. She met her husband, Bob Fairfax through their \ninvolvement in cultural arts activities with the Works Progress \nAdministration [WPA]. They married in 1935 and eventually settled in \nthe Altgeld-Murray public housing development as one of Altgeld's first \ninterracial families. The Fairfaxes worked tirelessly to improve the \nquality of life for public housing residents. They founded and managed \nthe community's first newspaper, the Altgeld Beacon, while working as \nbeat reporters for the Chicago Defender Newspaper. They also \nestablished numerous Boy Scout troops throughout the Chicago Housing \nAuthority [CHA], and founded the Jackson Raiders, an award winning drum \nand bugle corps. In keeping with Mrs. Fairfax's philosophy, ``Before a \ncommunity can make social sense, it has to make economic sense,'' the \nFairfaxes also participated in the establishment of one of the \ncountry's first and largest black owned food co-op stores, which was \nowned by 300 black families and patronized by thousands of public \nhousing residents. In addition, the Fairfaxes were two of the original \nplaintiffs in Gautreaux versus Chicago Housing Authority, a landmark \ncase which resulted in the end of racially discriminatory practices of \nthe CHA.\n  After her retirement from the Illinois Department of Labor, Mrs. \nFairfax continued to be active in community affairs and maintained \naffiliations with the American Association of Retired Persons, American \nFederation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, Girl Scouts of Chicago, Chicago Parent Teacher Association, \nCitizen Utility Board, Chicago Urban League, Chicago Sinai \nCongregation, Jewish Council for the Elderly, Illinois Public Action \nCouncil, and the Friends of the Chicago Children's Choir, to name a \nfew. In addition to her many substantial accomplishments, on a personal \nnote, I must say that Bea Fairfax was one of the kindest and most \ngenerous people I have known. She didn't just talk the talk, but walked \nthe walk. Her life was truly dedicated to improving the lives of \nothers. No one knows that more than her\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\nfamily, including her daughters, Joyce Theresa Fairfax-Wells, and Ruth \nMary Fairfax-Frazier, her son-in-law, Anthany Frazier, her former son-\nin-law, Cornell Wells her grandchildren, Annika Frazier-Muhammad, \nDarius Frazier, Monnica Wells, and Jacqueline Wells, her great \ngrandson, Hamza Ibn Omar Frazier-Muhammad, and many other relatives, \nfriends, and members of the community she helped to create. Her death \nis a great loss, but the legacy of her good works will endure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S972-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO WILLIAM MARVIN ON BEING NAMED THE 1996 MANCHESTER CITIZEN OF \n                                THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BOB SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nBill Marvin, president of Manpower Temporary Services, on being named \nthe 1996 Manchester's Citizen of the Year. I commend his outstanding \ncommunity commitment and congratulate him on this well-deserved honor.\n  As chairman of the 1996 Optima Board, Bill oversaw the capital \ncampaigns for the Currier Gallery and the Palace Theatre, the downtown \nice skating rink, and the merger of Catholic Medical Center and Elliot \nHospital.\n  Bill is a member of the Manchester Rotary Club, the Manchester \nChamber of Commerce and the Catholic Medical Center. He has also \nbrought two area hospitals together and has helped to organize bingo \ngames for the Boys and Girls Club.\n  He is known to many as always willing to take responsibility, whether \nto chair a committee, raise money, or oversee a board of directors. \nWhatever Bill dedicates his time to, he always gets the job done.\n  While giving his time to all these community projects, Bill and his \nwife, Ann, operate Manpower Temporary Services which was named the 1995 \nService Business by Business New Hampshire magazine.\n  As a former small businessman myself, I am proud to honor Bill \nMarvin's outstanding community commitment that is important to the \nfuture and prosperity of Manchester. We are indeed indebted to him for \nhis efforts. Congratulations to Bill on this award and his service to \nNew Hampshire and the people of Manchester.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S973-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO THE JOHN BAPST MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL BAND\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the John Bapst \nMemorial High School Band which honored Maine and America with its \noutstanding performance during 1997's Presidential Inauguration.\n  Personally selected by President Clinton to attend the festivities, \nthe John Bapst band had audiences on their feet with rousing renditions \nof ``The Maine Stein Song,'' ``Camino Real,'' and ``Acclamations,'' to \nname a few. The band performed on the National Mall, along with bands \nsuch as the Count Basie Orchestra, and also at the prestigious Kennedy \nCenter for the Performing Arts.\n  This is not the first time that Maine has been made proud by the John \nBapst band. In 1991, the band was on hand to welcome troops returning \nhome after the Gulf war. For many, their stop in Bangor was the first \ntime on American soil since their deployment. I am certain they will \nnever forget the warm greetings they received in Bangor--which garnered \nnational attention--and John Bapst band played a special part in \nhonoring our servicemen and women. The tradition continued when John \nBapst played for President Clinton last November. The President was so \nimpressed with the group that he pledged to invite them to inaugural \nfestivities should he be reelected.\n  Mr. President, this band represents the very best characteristics of \nAmerica's young people. Band members set a goal of excellence and \nworked hard to achieve it, and I believe their efforts should be \nhighlighted. In an era of conflicting and often dubious influences for \nyoung men and women, and in a time when negative stories abound in the \nmedia, our children should have positive examples to follow. That is \nwhy we should shine a spotlight on groups like the John Bapst band, \nwhich represent the finest qualities and aspirations of America's \nyouth. I applaud the band members and their director, Julie Ewing, for \nshowing our youth what can be accomplished through commitment and hard \nwork.\n  In closing, I would once again like to thank the John Bapst Memorial \nHigh School Band for their tremendous contribution to the 1997 \ninaugural festivities, and for making the State of Maine very \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S973-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COSPONSORSHIP OF THE OLDER AMERICANS FREEDOM TO WORK ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in cosponsorship of \nSenate bill S. 202, the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act. This \nimportant legislation would remove existing penalties on outside income \nearned by Social Security beneficiaries who have reached retirement \nage.\n  Currently, Mr. President, persons between the ages of 65 and 69 face \na penalty of $1 in reduced benefits for every $3 in earnings above \n$13,500 per year. This penalty is unfair because it singles out older \nAmericans for double taxation. That is, this income already is subject \nto normal taxation, and currently is reduced again through the earnings \npenalty.\n  The penalty also is unwise, Mr. President, because it discourages \ntrained and experienced people from participating in the labor force. \nWhen the current earned income limit was devised back in the 1930's, it \nwas thought that encouraging older Americans to leave the labor force \nwas a good idea. But times have changed. Where during the Great \nDepression there were too many workers and too few jobs, we face, in \nthe next several decades, a worsening labor shortage. As the baby boom \ngeneration reaches retirement age between 2000 and 2010, there will be \nfewer younger workers to take the place of those who retire. We should \nbe encouraging older Americans to stay in the labor force as long as \nthey can safely continue to make a contribution there. In this way \nolder people can better see to their financial needs, senior citizens \nwill remain more active and thus happier and healthier, and our Nation \nwill continue to benefit from these people's skills and wisdom.\n  For the sake of our older Americans, and for the sake of continuing \neconomic prosperity for all Americans, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S973-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S973-S974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE CONCORD HIGH SCHOOL CRIMSON TIDE MARCHING BAND ON \n        REPRESENTING NEW HAMPSHIRE IN THE 1997 INAUGURAL PARADE\n\n Mr. BOB SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nstudents of the Concord High School Crimson Tide marching band for the \ndistinguished honor of representing New Hampshire in the 1997 inaugural \nparade. All 116 band members and Bill Metevier, the band's director, \ndeserve special commendation for their hard work and achievement. Being \nselected as 1 of only 20 bands to perform for the President and the \nFirst Lady is quite an honor for all the students.\n  At an inaugural reception on behalf of the Concord High School \nCrimson Tide marching band last week, I had the pleasure of meeting \nsome of the band members, young men and women, who have demonstrated \nthe hard work and dedication that is characteristic of Granite State \nstudents. These band members have proven that determination and \nteamwork are the hallmark of success both as musicians and students. \nThe Crimson Tide marching band's decision to play the ``National Emblem \nMarch,'' composed by E.E. Bagley while he was a resident of New \nHampshire, was a very fitting tribute to the Granite State and our role \nin American history. We were indeed honored to have the Crimson Tide \nmarching band representing New Hampshire with their outstanding musical \nperformances.\n  The Concord School's Friends of Music also deserve special \nrecognition for their help in raising $20,000 from residents and local \ncompanies during such a very short period of time. Without their hard \nwork, the Crimson Tide's trip to Washington, DC, would not have been \npossible.\n  Marching in the parade was also a special highlight for these \nstudents since the Concord High School is celebrating its 150th \nanniversary this year.\n  The Crimson Tide band with their classic military cadet style \nuniforms\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\nhave also performed for audiences in Ottawa, Canada, New York City, \nWilliamsburg, VA; and are planning to return to Williamsburg in April.\n  I want to express my thanks to both the students and faculty at \nConcord High School for their commitment to excellence. Congratulations \nto all the students and Bill Metevier on such a magnificent \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a list of the names of these outstanding \nstudents be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n             Concord High School Crimson Tide Marching Band\n\n       Megan Albert, Dylan Allen, Holly Anderson, Matt Andrews, \n     Alicia Andrus, Angela Averill, George Bacher, Jon Balinski, \n     Sarah Ball, Paul Barnwell.\n       Matt Baron, Ed Barton, Jon Beckwith, Andy Bennert, Erin \n     Benoit, Burt Betchart, Cheryl Blanchard, Melanie Blanchette, \n     Stephen Bloomfield, Desirae Brooks.\n       Katie Cantwell, Jeff Carlquist, Jessica Carr, Carolyn \n     Chaloux, Dan Connelly, Joan Conroy, Patty Cullen, Nathan \n     Davis, Sara Dickson, Laura Dimick.\n       Susan Dimick, Kyle Donovan, Parker Donovan, Robin \n     Duckworth, Eric Dyment, Steve Fisher, John Fitzgerald, Kerry \n     Flannery, Nissa Gainty, Leona Geer, Mike Gogelen, Andy \n     Hamilton, Katie Haubrich, Danielle Hebert.\n       Alex Heinecke, Mike Henninger, Jason Hines, Elizabeth \n     Immen, Brad Jobel, Hillarie Johnson, Danielle Jones, Heidi \n     Jones, Aureta Keane, Ryan Kelly, Phil Kugel.\n       Jeff Laliberte, Jesse Lamarre-Vincent, David Loo, Shana \n     Lorber, Kevin Lucey, Theresa MacNeil, Ethan Mallove, Tegan \n     Marquis, Courtney Masland, Greg May, Sarah May, Luke Maziarz.\n       Sarah Maziarz, Sarah Metting, Lolly Mielcarz, Carl Mintken, \n     Karen Morin, Mary Moss, Miho Nakashima, Chris Newell, \n     Christina Newton, Devin O'Connor.\n       Tim Osmer, Bill Osmer, Brent Paige, Eddie Parker, James \n     Perencevich, Eric Pierce, Erika Poisson, Jill Ramsier, \n     Kristen Randall, Kristen Reed, Tricia Reed.\n       Lynn Reingold, Andrew Ritchie, Becca Roy, Jen Russell, Dan \n     Sarapin, Elaine Sarnosky, Tony Sartorelli, Gianna Scarano, \n     Kevin Scribner, Sara Sheehy, Lucas Smith, Rosco Smith.\n       Calee Spinney, Geoffrey Stebbins, John Sullivan, Dan Turk, \n     Rachel Turk, Stacey Ulmanis, Daniel Vyce, Jessy Wallner, Sara \n     Walsh, Carlyn Wanta, Tiffany Watkins, John Webb, Jon Weiss, \n     Amanda Welch, Cullin Wible, Carll Wilkinson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S973-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 105TH CONGRESS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 10, the \nViolent And Repeat Offender Act of 1997, introduced recently by my good \nfriend, the Senator from Utah, who I know developed this legislation in \nclose cooperation with the majority leader and my new\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\ncolleagues on the Committee, the Senators from Missouri and Alabama. \nWhile I do not necessarily agree with every provision of this \nlegislation, I believe overall it makes great improvements over our \ngeneral framework for handling juvenile crime, and I am therefore \npleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  This legislation is urgently needed. Over the past decade, the rate \nof homicide committed by teenagers, ages 14-17, has more than doubled. \nCrimes of violence committed by juveniles have increased by almost 100 \npercent. In 1994 alone, the number of violent crimes committed by \njuveniles increased by almost 10 percent. Drug use among teens--a \nsignificant factor in violent crime--is on the rise again, after nearly \na decade of steady decreases.\n  We have reached the point that 35 percent of all violent crime is \ncommitted by offenders less than 20 years of age. Today's teenaged \ncriminal is far more likely to be a murderer than was his counterpart \n20 years ago.\n  These trends are expected to continue well into the 21th century. \nMeanwhile, our current approach to juvenile crime is anachronistic and \nbased on faulty premises. It assumes that we should be following a \ntreatment and rehabilitation model for all juvenile crimes--whether \nwhat is involved is petty larceny or murder--and it then tries to \nleverage Federal dollars that we make available to the States to impose \nthis model on their juvenile justice systems. For instance, the \nexisting Juvenile Justice Act requires that States that receive money \nunder the act look to alternatives to incarceration for all juvenile \noffenses without regard to the offense committed by the juvenile.\n  This bill corrects that by substantially revising both the Federal \nGovernment's approach to juvenile crimes that fall under its \njurisdiction and the terms on which we make Federal dollars available \nto the States. At the Federal level, S. 10 will permit juveniles 14 \nyears olds or older who are charged with murder, crimes of violence, or \nserious drug offenses to be prosecuted and sentenced as adults. Federal \ncourts will be required to consider prior offenses in sentencing \njuveniles, just as they would with adult offenders. Juveniles sentenced \nto Federal prisons will no longer be automatically released on their \n21st birthdays, but will serve their full sentences.\n  The bill also attacks violent juvenile crime by enhancing penalties \nrelating to the paraphernalia of violence. Federal penalties are \nincreased for these offenses: illegally transferring a hand gun to a \nminor; possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony; and \nuse of body armor during the commission of a felony.\n  Finally, this bill authorizes new Federal funding for various \nvaluable State juvenile justice programs while relieving them from \nburdensome, outdated, unnecessary and in some instances harmful \nrequirements for obtaining funds previously authorized for this \npurpose. The bill will fund fingerprinting and DNA testing for juvenile \noffenders, expanded record-keeping, and workable prevention programs. \nIt will also release the States from harmful Federal mandates, \npermitting greater innovation and flexibility in State juvenile justice \nsystems. While the bill continues to ensure that juvenile and adult \noffenders are not in actual contact in jail or prison together, it \neliminates many other requirements that presently accompany acceptance \nof Federal juvenile grants such as the obligation to avoid if at all \npossible incarcerating any young offender including a murderer.\n  The new conditions on grants established in S. 10 are designed to \nassure that recipient States' juvenile systems are not based on the \nnotion--unfortunately previously foisted on the States by the Federal \ncourts and the Congress--that all young offenders are eager to be \nrehabilitated. Rather, they take the realistic view that recipients' \njuvenile systems should respect the rights of juvenile offenders and \nthe special considerations that may be appropriate for dealing with \nthem in some instances, but that they must principally be designed to \nprotect the public safety and be adequate to do so. Thus, for example, \nthe bill requires that recipient States permit prosecution of juveniles \n14 and older as adults in cases of murder, rape, or other crimes of \nviolence.\n  The juvenile justice reforms in this legislation are long overdue. I \nurge the Senate to act quickly in passing the Violent And Repeat \nOffender Act of 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S974-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S975-S976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, for over two decades, the Legal \nServices Corporation, or LSC, has been the embodiment of the words \nemblazoned in stone above the Supreme Court: ``Equal Justice Under \nLaw.'' In its effort to fulfill this commitment, the Legal Services \nCorporation has provided critically needed services to millions of \npoor, elderly, and disabled citizens who otherwise would not have \naccess to the American legal system and the protection it affords the \nmany basic rights we have in this country--protection which so many of \nus take for granted. The Legal Services Corporation has also proven to \nbe one of the most efficient Federal programs in existence, using only \n3 percent of its total funding for administration and management.\n  Yet in recent years, the Corporation's ability to satisfy its mandate \nhas been imperiled by congressional efforts to limit its activities, \nboth by cutting the Corporation's funding and by restricting the kinds \nof activities in which its lawyers could engage. Some of these efforts \nhave already succeeded, and I suspect that further initiatives in this \nvein will emerge in the 105th Congress.\n  But Mr. President, before we hasten down this path, let us look at \nwhat we have already wrought with respect to the ability of our Nation \nto provide legal services to the needy.\n  I use as an example the effect of cutbacks in the Legal Services \nCorporation in my own State of Maryland. Maryland's Legal Aid Bureau \nreceives by far the largest portion of its funding from the Legal \nServices Corporation, and over the years has done an outstanding job of \nrepresenting Maryland citizens living in poverty. With the funding \nreceived from LSC, the 13 legal aid offices located throughout Maryland \nprovide general legal services to approximately 19,000 families and \nindividuals annually.\n  In contrast to this tradition of effective service, a January 23 \narticle in the Baltimore Sun entitled ``Poor Have Trouble Getting Legal \nHelp'' demonstrates the current state of legal services in Maryland--a \nstate in no small part due to Congress's recent scaling back of the \nLSC.\n  The article notes that over 1 million Marylanders qualify for legal \nservices, but that volunteer lawyers--the source of the majority of \nlegal assistance with the implementation of Government cutbacks--are \nbarely making a dent in the caseload. In fact, Mr. President, Robert \nRhudy, executive director of the Maryland Legal Services Corporation, a \nState-created organization that administers legal assistance programs \nin the State, estimates that the Maryland Legal Aid Bureau has the \nability to address only 20 percent of the matters that come to its \nattention.\n  The article also notes that recent studies confirm these estimates, \nfinding that about 80 percent of the State's poor lack access to \nvolunteer lawyers. Mr. President, these developments are shameful, and \ncannot be tolerated by a society that prides itself on its commitment \nto constitutional principles of equal protection of the laws and equal \naccess to justice.\n  Part of the solution certainly lies in encouraging and facilitating \nvolunteerism in our legal communities. Pro bono service is part of a \nlawyer's ethical obligations. At the same time, we in Congress bear \nreal responsibility for the shortage of legal assistance to the poor. \nOur efforts to cut back LSC funding in recent years have had a \ndevastating impact on the poor, and have tilted the scales of justice \nin a way that the creators and founders of LSC would have found to be \nintolerable.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the January 23 Baltimore Sun article be \nprinted in today's Record. I daresay that many other States have \nstories similar to those in my State, and I urge my colleagues to \ninvestigate their States' situation before once again lining up to do \naway with a program that should be one of the great prices of our \nNation.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Jan. 23, 1997]\n\n Poor Have Trouble Getting Legal Help--Few Lawyers Agree To Give Free \n                                Service\n\n                           (By Elaine Tassy)\n\n       Poor Marylanders who need legal help are likely to have \n     trouble finding it, and with federal funding cuts at agencies \n     that handle such cases, the problem is worsening.\n       More than a million Marylanders have income low enough to \n     be eligible for free civil legal services, said Robert J. \n     Rhudy, executive director of Maryland Legal Services Corp. \n     Low-income households often have several legal problems in a \n     year.\n       But volunteer lawyers are barely making a dent in that \n     need.\n       ``Of those problems that could clearly benefit from legal \n     attention, we believe that we currently have the ability to \n     serve the need of less than 20 percent . . .'' said Rhudy, \n     whose organization was created by state legislators to help \n     manage and fund free or reduced-fee services.\n       Only about 5,000 new cases were handled last year by \n     volunteer lawyers serving in programs that keep statistics, \n     according to Sharon E. Goldsmith, executive director of the \n     People's Pro Bono Action Center Inc.\n       And, although the number of volunteers is actually greater \n     because some lawyers provide services without being party of \n     any program--by offering advice to community groups, for \n     example--studies have shown that about 80 percent of the \n     state's poor lack access to volunteer lawyers.\n       ``We have clients on waiting lists all the time . . . We've \n     probably got a couple hundred cases sitting here,'' said \n     Winifred C. Borden, executive director of Maryland Volunteer \n     Lawyers Service, the largest of several Baltimore-based \n     agencies that match volunteer lawyers with cases presented by \n     poor people. Those in need often wait months before a \n     volunteer is found, she added.\n       The shortage of lawyers willing to do free, or pro \n     bono, work in civil cases--unraveling family, employment, \n     disability, education and housing disputes--has prompted \n     agencies that recruit volunteers to step up their efforts.\n       ``We all recognize there is this tremendous need,'' said \n     Baltimore County Circuit Judge Dana M. Levitz, who also is \n     seeking new ways to recruit lawyers for such cases.\n       No statistics\n       No one knows how many lawyers do pro bono work. ``We've \n     never been able to come up with a tracking system,'' said \n     Janet Stidman Eveleth of the Maryland State Bar Association.\n       Studies have found that in addition to those doing pro bono \n     work independently, about a fourth of Maryland's 20,000 \n     practicing lawyers volunteer through programs such as the \n     Homeless Persons Representation Project, the House of Ruth \n     Domestic Violence Legal Clinic and the Senior Citizen Law \n     Project.\n       But many experts think the number of volunteer lawyers is \n     still too small.\n       ``I think lawyers like [doing pro-bono work] in principle, \n     and a substantial number of lawyers do it. But at the moment, \n     I think that it's getting harder and harder to find lawyers \n     who are willing to take pro bono cases,'' said David Luban, \n     professor of legal ethics at the University of Maryland \n     School of Law.\n       Lawyers have vigorously resisted proposals to require each \n     of them to do 50 hours of pro bono work a year, he said.\n       No enforceable requirement exists for volunteer legal work. \n     But the rules that govern Maryland lawyers state: ``A lawyer \n     should render public interest legal service . . . by \n     providing professional services at no fee or a reduced fee to \n     persons of limited means or to public service or charitable \n     groups or organizations.''\n       Demand for such services is rising. Congress has scaled \n     back the services the Legal Aid Bureau--a nonprofit \n     organization providing civil legal services to the poor--is \n     permitted to provide and has trimmed its budget in recent \n     years, creating more demand for volunteers to fill the gap.\n\n\n                              No free time\n\n       Some lawyers say they are held back by a lack of free time, \n     conflicts of interest and difficulty in finding cases that \n     match their expertise. Others say they will help but don't \n     follow through.\n       For example, Borden said, from July 1995 to June 1996, \n     2,017 lawyers signed up to volunteer and 788 took cases.\n       The number of volunteers expressing interest also has \n     decreased in recent years. A statewide survey found that in \n     1989, almost 1,700 cases new cases were handled by \n     volunteers working with structured programs. The number \n     jumped to almost 6,000 by 1993 but dropped to 5,253 in \n     1995, the most recent statistics available, said \n     Goldsmith.\n       People with thorny, time-consuming domestic matters such as \n     child-custody disputes are the most likely to request \n     volunteers. But many lawyers shy away from such cases.\n       Criminal-defense lawyer Leonard H. Shapiro, who often \n     handles drunken-driving cases, said volunteering appeals to \n     him, but only in cases in which he has expertise.\n       ``I don't want to engage in an area of the law where I \n     don't think I'm qualified,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want to \n     put the client in jeopardy while I experimented.''\n\n\n                           specialties linked\n\n       Volunteer agencies are working to link lawyers with \n     programs or cases that reflect their specialties.\n       Goldsmith tries to match tax lawyers, for example, with \n     economic development projects such as Habitat for Humanity's \n     in Sandtown-Winchester, where residents need help in \n     acquiring loans and property.\n       Levitz, after seeing dozens of poor defendants appear \n     before him without lawyers, asked the Judicial Ethics \n     Committee whether judges could recruit volunteers by writing \n     letters of inquiry, placing ads in legal newspapers or \n     talking to lawyers at bar association meetings.\n       Two years ago, the committee, most of whose nine members \n     are judges, prohibited such actions. But it reversed its \n     stance in October, saying judges could seek volunteer lawyers \n     in those ways.\n\n\n                              idea studied\n\n       At a recent meeting of Baltimore County judges, Levitz \n     presented the idea of seeking volunteers; a three-judge panel \n     is studying the idea.\n       Some lawyers balk at volunteering, but others embrace it.\n       Daniel V. Schmitt is one of the latter. He handles general \n     business and commercial litigation cases at a four-person \n     firm in Towson, and provides 60 hours of free legal help \n     annually to special education students in Baltimore and \n     Harford counties.\n       Using referrals from the Maryland Disability Law Center, he \n     helps students get into appropriate schools and classes, and \n     helps find computers equipped for people who cannot type with \n     their hands.\n       ``I believe that pro bono is a professional and moral \n     obligation,'' said Schmitt, 38. ``As a professional, I feel \n     you need to hold yourself to a higher standard, and a higher \n     standard would include giving back to the \n     community.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S975-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S976-S978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VERMONT CHIEF JUSTICE JEFFREY L. AMESTOY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermonters are rightfully proud of \ntheir new chief justice of the Vermont supreme court, Jeffrey L. \nAmestoy.\n  Chief Justice Amestoy--a Republican who left behind a distinguished \ntenure as Vermont's attorney general when he accepted the nomination to \nVermont's highest judicial post by Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat--was \nadministered the oath of office by Governor Dean on January 31 in \nMontpelier.\n  I was one of many who were present as Chief Justice Amestoy delivered \nthe traditional inaugural address in the chamber of the Vermont House \nof Representatives. It was more than a speech to be heard. It was also \na speech to be felt. He offered an illuminating, uplifting, heartfelt, \nand deeply personal tapestry that deservedly will long be remembered.\n  Governor Dean has said, ``The most important things in a judge are \nintegrity, compassion, and hard work.'' All who know Jeffrey Amestoy \nand all who heard him speak on that wintry Vermont afternoon know how \nabundantly those qualities are present in our new chief justice.\n  I join all Vermonters in offering congratulations to Chief Justice \nAmestoy, to Jeff's wife, Susan Lonergan Amestoy, to their three \ndaughters, Katie, Christina, and Nancy, and to Jeff's mother, Diana \nWood Amestoy. All were on hand for the stirring ceremony in Montpelier.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join Senator Leahy today in paying \ntribute to Vermont's new chief justice, Jeffrey L. Amestoy. Jeff is a \ngood friend and a great Vermonter, and I know he will serve in his new \npost with distinction and honor.\n  Jeff Amestoy and I have shared many life experiences. We were both \nraised in Rutland, VT. He served as an assistant attorney general under \nmy stewardship as Vermont's attorney general in the early 1970's. And \nnow, over 20 years later, he is serving in the position that my father, \nOlin Jeffords, once held: chief justice of the Vermont supreme court.\n  As someone who has known Jeff for over 25 years, I can attest to his \njudicial knowledge, his keen sense of Vermont values, his modest \ndemeanor and his dedication to the people of Vermont.\n  I was fortunate to be able to attend the swearing-in ceremony for \nJeff last Friday in Montpelier. It was a wonderful event, one that I \nwill never forget. Jeff's comments were from the heart and I am pleased \nto join Senator Leahy in offering them today as part of the Record.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Jeffords and myself, I \ncommend to the attention of our colleagues Chief Justice Jeffrey \nAmestoy's inauguration address before the Vermont House of \nRepresentatives on January 31, 1997, and submit the\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\ntext to the speech for the Record, as printed in the Times Argus of \nBarre, VT, on February 1, 1997.\n  The text of the speech follows:\n\n         Inaugural Address of Chief Justice Jeffrey L. Amestoy\n\n       Three weeks ago, at the occasion of my nomination for the \n     position of chief justice, I said I had so many people to \n     thank I didn't know where to end.\n       Today the task is even more difficult.\n       But I still know where to start: Thank you, Governor Dean.\n       To my ``particular friend,'' Susan Lonergan Amestoy: I \n     could not have made this journey without you--and it wouldn't \n     have been as much fun.\n       To Katherine, Christina, and Nancy Amestoy--for whom this \n     is the third visit to the State House this month--thank you \n     for your patience.\n       I thought the events of the past 30 days might have been \n     bewildering to our daughters, but Katie Amestoy had it \n     exactly right when she told a friend on the day of my second \n     interview with the governor:\n       ``I can't come over today. My Dad's trying out for Chief \n     Justice.''\n       I thank my mother, Dianna Wood Amestoy, for being here \n     today and for always being there in times of need.\n       For those of you for whom a desire to impress your parents \n     is a part of your motivation, I offer the following \n     cautionary tale.\n       When I called my mother to tell her of my nomination, she \n     replied:\n       ``That's wonderful, I've just been hang gliding in \n     Montana.''\n       If I can bring one half of my mother's energy, and one \n     quarter of her sense of humor to my new responsibilities, \n     Vermont will be well served.\n       Thank you (Wisconsin) Attorney General (James) Doyle, and \n     thank you Attorney General Malley for your generous words.\n       Present today are colleagues--current and former--from the \n     National Association of Attorneys General. They, together \n     with the staff of the Vermont Attorney General's Office, have \n     not only supported me professionally during the last dozen \n     years; they have been among my closest friends.\n       And if it is true, as I believe it to be, that one can be \n     judged by the friends one treasures, then you will understand \n     why their being here today means so much to me.\n       There are also here individuals to whom I cannot ever make \n     an adequate expression of thanks.\n       When I became a candidate for public office, the best \n     advice I ever received was: ``Never pass an old friend to say \n     hello to a new one.''\n       Today is special for many reasons, but most of all because \n     our old friends are here.\n       Twenty years ago, as a young assistant attorney general, I \n     spent a Sunday in the law library preparing for an oral \n     argument the next day before the Vermont Supreme Court.\n       Then, as now, the law library was next to the court. But in \n     those days, the doors to the Supreme Court were unlocked \n     during the weekend.\n       And so when I finished a long day's preparation, I went \n     into the empty courtroom and sat in the seat of a Vermont \n     Supreme Court Justice.\n       The next morning I appeared before the Court. As chance \n     would have it, as I began my argument, I was interrupted by \n     Justice Larrow.\n       Some here may remember Justice Larrow's reputation as an \n     incisive interrogator. If you argued before him you will \n     recall his habit of clearing his throat just before he \n     reached the most penetrating portion of his inquiry.\n       ``Mr. Amestoy,'' he began, ``would you please tell this \n     court what gives you the right * * *'' and at this point, as \n     Justice Larrow began clearing his throat, I was struck with \n     the awful realization that it was Justice Larrow's seat I had \n     sat in the previous afternoon.\n       For one terrible moment I thought I was going to be asked: \n     ``What gives you the right to sit in the seat of a justice of \n     the Vermont Supreme Court?''\n       There may be some here who have a similar question. If so, \n     I am grateful to you--as I was to Justice Larrow that day--\n     for not asking.\n       I believe, if I meet the standards I have set for myself, \n     the question will occur to you less often in the future.\n       I am privileged to join a court comprised of individuals \n     with whom I have worked and for whom I have great respect.\n       Justice Johnson and I worked closely together at the Office \n     of Attorney General, where she was an unexcelled chief of the \n     Public Protection Division.\n       I have known Justice Morse since his service as defender \n     general and his work as one of Vermont's finest trial judges.\n       Justice Dooley and I worked together when he served as \n     Governor Kunin's legal counsel and secretary of \n     administration. More recently, I participated with Justice \n     Dooley in the court/prosecution program in Karelia. Joining \n     us in Russia was, among others, Maryland Attorney General \n     Joseph Curran.\n       Hence, Attorney General Curran is the only attorney general \n     in the country that knows both John Dooley and me. It was \n     that knowledge that led the Maryland attorney general to \n     offer the observation, when he learned that John and I were \n     being considered for chief justice, that I was a strong \n     second choice.\n       That is an opinion, I know, that is not exclusive to the \n     state of Maryland.\n       Justice Gibson, as all who know him would anticipate, has \n     been extraordinarily generous and helpful to me.\n       All here know, I am sure, that Justice Gibson's career is \n     consistent with the unparalleled contributions to public \n     service by the Gibson family.\n       What may be less well known is that Justice Gibson plays \n     first base for the combined court/attorney general softball \n     team.\n       As a rookie second baseman, I was saved from several errors \n     by the sure grasp and long range of first baseman Gibson.\n       I will rely on that same grasp and range to minimize the \n     errors of a rookie chief justice.\n       I also take the liberty today of expressing my gratitude to \n     former Chief Justice Allen--not just for his courtesies to \n     me, but for his service to Vermont.\n       In the 1980s, history linked the chief justice of Vermont \n     and the attorney general of Vermont more closely than either \n     one of us would have chosen. Although I do not know all that \n     occurred during the unhappy years enveloped by the ``judicial \n     misconduct'' controversy, I know more than all but a few in \n     this chamber.\n       It may be that another individual in the position of chief \n     justice during those troubled years could have struck the \n     critical balance necessary to keep the court functioning \n     without sacrificing the integrity of the institution.\n       But I, for one, am glad that we do not have to test the \n     hypothetical.\n       And surely it is difficult, even as a hypothesis, to \n     imagine another chief justice who could have brought the \n     court through those difficult days and led the court to a \n     point where, by every objective measure, it is now more \n     efficient than at any time in its history.\n       So today I deliver my first opinion as chief justice. It is \n     one which I know to be unanimous. It is an opinion which will \n     be corroborated by the judgment of history:\n       Frederic Allen was a great chief justice.\n       Fred Allen's shoes are being ones to fill.\n       But--I brought my own shoes.\n       If a span of years in which to serve as chief justice is \n     granted to me by God and the Legislature (that's an \n     alphabetical listing, Mr. Speaker!), I shall judge my \n     success, or lack thereof, against three objectives.\n       First, and by far the most important: Did I contribute to \n     the faith of Vermont's citizens in our judicial system, and \n     to their trust in the character of those entrusted with its \n     authority?\n       Second: Did I, as chief appellate judge of Vermont, \n     contribute to a body of law that clearly and concisely \n     communicates to litigants, lawyers, and trial judges the \n     standards to be used to achieve the just and timely \n     resolution of disputes?\n       Third: Did I, as chief justice, ensure that the judiciary, \n     as a separate and co-equal branch of government, has the \n     resources necessary to fulfill its responsibilities and the \n     accountability for the use of those resources?\n       For that work, I will need the help of all, most especially \n     the judges and staff of the trial courts who honor me with \n     their presence today.\n       When it became apparent that I was to assume the duties of \n     a new position, I received several calls from those most \n     directly affected by my status.\n       The callers were cordial but all had the same message, \n     which may be summarized as follows:\n       1. I should remember who had trial court experience and who \n     didn't.\n       2. I should realize that there were many in their group \n     that were equally or more qualified than I.\n       3. I should never forget that, while I might now have the \n     impressive title, the real work was done in the trenches of \n     the day-to-day business of the trial courts.\n       I am referring, of course, to the calls I received from \n     state's attorneys when I was first elected attorney general!\n       I trust that my past work will offer some guide to what the \n     future may hold. In any event, I shall do my best to avoid \n     the example of the Vermonter who--when asked by his neighbor \n     if he had an opinion about a controversial issue to be heard \n     at Town Meeting--replied: ``Not yet. But when I do take a \n     position, I'm prepared to be bitter!''\n       I believe in ``civility in public discourse and constancy \n     in private affection.''\n       And I believe, with Learned Hand, that ``the spirit of \n     liberty is the spirit that is not too sure it is right.''\n       We will need that spirit more than ever to meet the changes \n     that the new century will surely bring.\n       Two years ago, I spoke to new citizens at a naturalization \n     ceremony in Newport, Vermont. The event coincided with the \n     completion of the debate in the Vermont Legislature over the \n     proposed resolution relating to the flag burning amendment.\n       That probably accounted for the fact that the hosts for the \n     ceremony--the American Legion--were somewhat less \n     enthusiastic about my presence than when the invitation to \n     speak was extended.\n       But whatever one's view of that proposed amendment, it is \n     remarkable, as I observed then, that upon taking the oath of \n     citizenship, had one of the new citizens refused to recite \n     the pledge of allegiance, neither the attorney general of \n     Vermont, nor the attorney general of the United States, nor \n     the entire United States government, could have compelled \n     recitation of the pledge.\n       Indeed, the judicial system would have protected the new \n     citizen and provided redress for any attempted compulsion.\n       But, of course, each of the new citizens recited the pledge \n     of allegiance of their own\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\n     free will and with more meaning than I am accustomed to \n     hearing.\n       It is an inherent American trait to look at the courts to \n     vindicate one's rights. With God's grace, it shall always be \n     so. But it is neither law nor courts that shall secure our \n     future.\n       ``Liberty,'' said Learned Hand, ``lies in the hearts of men \n     and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no \n     court can save it; no constitution, no law, no court can even \n     do much to help it.''\n       So although I have much to learn about judging, it seems to \n     me that Curtis Bok was right when he said of his own judicial \n     experience ``. . . there still remains a mystery . . . that \n     defies analysis.''\n       ``Perhaps,'' wrote Judge Bok, ``it would be better to say \n     that a judge's cases take hold of him and pull things out of \n     him, and that it is his business to be sure to keep the \n     proper supplies on hand, so far as he can be the master of \n     that.''\n       If ``the proper supplies,'' or at least a portion of them, \n     are integrity and hard work, compassion and common sense, an \n     abiding respect for the dignity of the individual and the \n     value of community--then, to the extent I start today with \n     those ``supplies,'' it is because of the people in this room \n     and the Vermont we love.\n       And it is because of one who is not here, nor ever could be \n     the seven other times his son took the oath of office in this \n     historic chamber.\n       More than four decades ago, a young father took his son to \n     Hand's Cove on Lake Champlain for a day of duck hunting.\n       But the father soon understood that of his son a hunter he \n     could not make.\n       So he turned the day into a history lesson, for Hand's Cove \n     is where Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys gathered \n     before their raid on Fort Ticonderoga in the early morning of \n     May 1775.\n       From the father's description of the events sprung a boy's \n     interest in history and the individuals and ideas that shape \n     it.\n       Many years later--when the boy was much older than the \n     father had been on that day--his interest in law led him to \n     Learned Hand.\n       And to the realization, which somehow seemed fitting, that \n     Hand's Cove was the home of--indeed had been named for--the \n     Vermont ancestors of the great judge.\n       Logic tells me that there is no connection in the \n     coincidence of a place from which sprung the beginning of \n     this state, and the family of a remarkable jurist, and a \n     father's gift to his son.\n       But my heart tells me otherwise.\n       And I believe in the ``restless wisdom of the heart.''\n       And I believe, too, in the wisdom of the poet who says to \n     each of us--a chief justice no less than the child who even \n     now gazes out a window, perhaps on Leonard Street: ``We see \n     but what we have the gift of seeing''; to this life, ``What \n     we bring, we find.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S976-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THOMAS, SHEILA, AND STACEY THOMSON ON BEING NAMED NEW \n              HAMPSHIRE'S OUTSTANDING TREE FARMERS OF 1997\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Tom \nThomson, his wife Sheila, and their son Stacey, on being named New \nHampshire's 1997 Outstanding Tree Farmers of the year. Tom first \npurchased his own wood lot at the age of 11 with his two older \nbrothers. Today, Tom and his family manage about 2,500 acres of forest \nin New Hampshire and Vermont.\n  Stacey, Tom, and Tom's father, former Gov. Mel Thomson Jr., \nconstitute three generations of New Hampshire tree farmers. Tom's tree \nfarm is an example of a multipurpose forest with a diverse landscape. \nIn addition to enhancing wildlife habitat, Tom has also increased \nrecreational opportunities in the forest, opened vistas and taken care \nof the protection of water quality. He received a prestigious annual \naward by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department and the University \nof New Hampshire Cooperative Extension in 1994, when his 1,060 acre \ntract in Orford, NH, became designated as a wildlife stewardship area.\n  Tom is known by many for his adoption of more sustainable forestry \npractices, and encouragement of his neighbors to do the same. He gives \ntree farm tours each year to school children, New Hampshire's \nTimberland Owners Association Board Members, conservation groups, \nAudubon groups and New England wildflower groups. Most recently, he had \nalso had visitors from Eastern and Central Europe and South America. \nTom also works with the New Hampshire Board of Licensure for Foresters, \nthe New Hampshire Current Use Advisory Board, the New Hampshire \nEcological Reserve System Steering Committee and the New Hampshire \nForest Stewardship Committee. His enthusiasm and outstanding commitment \nto his work has a very important impact on the future of New \nHampshire's beautiful woods.\n  I have known Tom and his family for many years. They are hard-\nworking, dedicated farmers who embody the true spirit of New Hampshire. \nTom's commitments to preservation and forest education are exemplary. I \nwarmly congratulate Tom, Sheila, and Stacey for their outstanding \naccomplishment and well-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S978-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE OLD TOWN MARCHING BAND\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Old Town \nMarching Band of Old Town, ME.\n  The band made the entire State of Maine proud with its extraordinary \nperformance in the 1997 Inaugural Parade. Countless hours of practice \nand preparation go into such an effort, and the students' dedication to \nexcellence was obvious and stood as a wonderful tribute to the late Old \nTown Superintendent of Schools, Dr. John Grady.\n  I was approached early last year by Dr. Grady, who shared with me his \ndream of having the Old Town Marching Band represent Maine at this \nyear's inaugural parade. Sadly, Dr. Grady passed away, but his dream \nlived on in the hearts of bandmembers and the Old Town community. Old \nTown was one of more than 400 groups seeking to perform in the parade--\nonly 23 were selected, and of those only 9 were high school bands.\n  Old Town's participation in the 1997 Inaugural Parade is the latest \nof a long list of accomplishments. The band is nationally recognized, \nhaving won numerous awards including first place at the 1994 Saint \nAnselm College New England Jazz Festival, the Jazz Ensemble Grand \nChampions at the 1996 Orlando Musicfest, and an award-winning \nappearance at the 1995 Cherry Blossom parade in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, this band represents the very best characteristics of \nAmerica's young people. Band members set a goal of excellence and \nworked hard to achieve it, and I believe their efforts should be \nhighlighted. In an era of conflicting and often dubious influences for \nyoung men and women, and in a time when negative stories abound in the \nmedia, our children should have positive examples to follow. That is \nwhy we should shine a spotlight on groups like the Old Town Marching \nBand, which represent the finest qualities and aspirations of America's \nyouth. I salute the band as well as its director, Jeffrey Priest, for \nshowing young people what can be accomplished through hard work and \ncommitment.\n  In closing, I would once again like to thank the Old Town Marching \nBand for their tremendous contribution to the 1997 inaugural parade, \nand for making Old Town and the State of Maine very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S978-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S978-S979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO REYNALDO MARTINEZ\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend and chief of staff, Reynaldo Martinez. Rey has recently been \nchosen for the Community Hero Award by the National Conference of \nChristians and Jews, and I am proud of him for receiving this well-\ndeserved honor.\n  I have known Rey since I was a boy. He and I have worked side by side \nsince he ran my first campaign and got me as elected student body \npresident of Basic High School in 1956. Since then, he has been my \nadviser, campaign manager, and chief of staff. In addition to helping \ntake me from assemblyman, to lieutenant governor, to the U.S. Senate, \nhe has had many other titles during his life, including teacher, \nlobbyist, coach, education advocate, and husband. To me, Rey is both a \nvalued friend and a trusted adviser. To his country and the State of \nNevada, he is a dedicated public servant and a tireless fighter.\n  In his boyhood days, Rey was a great baseball player who led his high \nschool team to numerous victories. This left-handed pitcher played a \nleading role in Basic High's multiple State championships, as well as \nits championship of the California Interscholastic Federation. In \nshort, our tiny school in Nevada was so good, we beat all of the \nusually dominant California schools.\n  Rey's baseball talents led him to Arizona State University, where, in \naddition to his efforts on the field, he earned a degree in teaching. \nAfter graduation, Rey returned to Nevada to\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\nteach government and coach the Western High School baseball team to \nvictory in two State championships. While he was teaching, Rey worked \non a local Nevada campaign with Monroe Sweetland, an executive with the \nNational Education Association [NEA]. Mr. Sweetland recognized talent \nwhen he saw it, and lured Rey away from the Clark County School \nDistrict to work for the NEA in Washington, DC, and across the Nation. \nAfter 13 years with the NEA, Rey directed his innumerable talents to my \ngovernment career.\n  For more than 30 years, Rey has been a key player in the public \narena, both in Nevada and across the Nation. He is an invaluable asset \nto all of the organizations and campaigns to which he has lent his \nenergy and skill. He has a quick mind and a political acumen which he \nuses to great effect for the causes he believes in. He has been \nrecognized for his efforts by groups across the Nation, including twice \nbeing named Outstanding Hispanic of the Year--in 1990 by the Latin \nChamber of Commerce, and in 1988 by the New Mexico Club in Las Vegas. \nIn 1980, the National Education Association recognized Rey as one of \nits outstanding political and legislative consultants. He has also been \nhonored as an outstanding teacher in Clark County and an outstanding \nbaseball coach in Nevada. The Community Hero award is just the most \nrecent in his distinguished list of accolades.\n  The goal of the National Conference of Christians and Jews is to end \nbias, bigotry, and racism. Through advocacy and education, the National \nConference seeks to promote understanding in all races and religions. \nFor someone who has done so much toward these worthy goals, and who has \nserved his community so well, Rey is truly deserving of the title \n``Community Hero.''\n  It is my pleasure to speak today in tribute to my friend Reynaldo \nMartinez, and congratulate him on being selected for this \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/04/senate-section/article/S978-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NOTE\n\n  On page S829 of the January 30, 1997, Record, during consideration of \nthe nomination of William M.
